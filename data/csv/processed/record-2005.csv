3,29,2005-01-06,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, the Ohio recount requested by the other party, has been  completed and has been verified.  In  every area of Ohio, bipartisan county  boards have verified the integrity of  these election results. This is the true  message  to  the world:  our  system  works with integrity.  We keep hearing that Ohio’s vote was  rigged in some way. But this is not  plausible when you have a system of 88  separate  bipartisan  county  election  boards. In Ohio, our boards take great  pride  in their administration of the  election laws.  I urge the Congress to accept the  votes cast today by the State of Ohio  for President Bush.  ",2005
4,29,2005-01-06,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  ask to address the House for 5 minutes.  The SPEAKER. The gentleman from  Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2005
5,29,2005-01-06,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  do not question the outcome of this  election. However, I do know that I  stood in line for hours with voters trying to cast ballots, and since election  day I have heard from dozens of voters,  Democrats and Republicans, who lost  their right to vote on November 2 in  my State of Ohio.  For 8 years in the 1980s I served as  Ohio’s elected Secretary of State. During my term in office, we held and my  office conducted two Presidential elections, two gubernatorial elections, and  dozens of primary and  special elections.  The role of the Ohio Secretary of  State serves two main functions: to ensure everyone is confident that his or  her vote will be counted and to encourage everyone to exercise that right to  vote. Our Secretary of State this year  failed on both counts. I speak from experience when  I say the 2004 Presidential election  in Ohio was riddled  with unnecessary problems.  b1415  I visited four precincts in Oberlin,  Ohio, outside of my district where I  stood  in  line with voters,  some of  whom waited up to 6 hours to vote. I  visited Hispanic and white working-  class precincts, and I saw long lines everywhere I went. I received panicked  calls throughout the day from voters  whose polling places had broken machines and were being denied the right  to vote. In the days leading up to the  election, I witnessed reports throughout my district in northeastern Ohio of  voters who had been told their voter  registration could be invalid and that  despite their efforts to register, they  were not on the voting rolls. In far too  many cases, their votes were not allowed.  Ohio voters should never again be  forced to wait 3, 5, sometimes even 10  hours to cast a vote. Ohioans should  never again, as too many people did  this November, lose their right to vote.  But it is not just about Ohio; it is not  just about who won and who did not. It  is about our system of democracy. Mr.  Speaker, I am saddened that no Republicans in this body are joining us today  in acknowledging problems in Ohio and  in working with us to fix those problems because, Mr. Speaker, defending  the right to vote should be a concern  for Republicans and Democrats alike.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR).  ",2005
6,29,2005-01-06,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, Ohio  symbolizes that the Help America Vote  Act fell short of the lofty goals set by  this  Congress. Ohio’s  Secretary  of  State, Kenneth Blackwell, a Republican, in a State in which all statewide  offices are controlled by Republicans  and, in our State legislature, Republicans outnumber Democrats two to  one in both chambers, our Secretary of  State repeatedly took actions to make  it more difficult for as many Ohioans  as possible to have their votes fairly  cast and accurately recorded.  No national standards were set for  voting equipment because the Bush administration appointed members of the  Election Assistance  Commission  so  late that their confirmation was nearly  a  full year  later  than  required by  HAVA itself. They had no time to recommend  standards until  it was  too  late, and those standards are still not  in place today.  The Ohio Secretary of State tried to  force county boards of elections to buy  equipment that his own reports showed  to be flawed. Federal dollars that this  Congress appropriated  to help modernize elections became stuck in Ohio  between the Secretary of State’s office  and local boards of elections who were  often in deep disagreement as to which  machine standards were trustworthy.  Just  prior  to  election, Secretary  Blackwell continued to frustrate the  enfranchisement of Ohioans with actions  ranging  from  specifying paper  weight standards for voter registration  forms that even his own office could  not meet, and then fighting the availability of provisional ballots right up  until 3 p.m. on Election Day. In fact,  people who had requested absentee ballots and had not received them were  denied provisional ballots until a Federal court ruling that was issued at 3  p.m. on Election Day, after who knows  how many Ohioans were denied ballots  that they were prepared to cast for the  candidates of their choice.  No one can change the outcome of  this election; but believe me, hundreds  of thousands of Ohioans do have questions about the way that this election  was handled  in Ohio,  in a State  in  which the winning margin was only  118,000 votes. Implementing the actual  intent of HAVA and amending it where  necessary deserve the  full  investigation of  this  109th Congress, and  it  ought to be our first order of business.  I commend the gentlewoman  from  Ohio (Mrs. JONES) of Cleveland who experienced these abuses in her area for  bringing this to national attention. We  are very proud of her. We are very  proud of the Members who have chosen  to join her. I would ask my Republican  colleagues,  starting with  the Committee on House Administration,  to  join us in this effort to make HAVA  really work as we approach the elections of 2006.  ",2005

8,29,2005-01-06,Mr. HAYWORTH.," Mr. Speaker, I seek  to be recognized for 5 minutes.  The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes  the  gentleman  from  Arizona  (Mr.  HAYWORTH) for 5 minutes.  (Mr. HAYWORTH  asked  and was  given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2005
9,29,2005-01-06,Mr. HAYWORTH.," Mr. Speaker, this  may be the most appropriate time to  remind each and every one of us engaged in this debate that it is the hallmark of our constitutional Republic  and our government to operate by the  consent of the governed. And there is a  corollary to that which we should likewise remember: in a free system where  the people choose, it is also necessary  for contestants who are unsuccessful to  accept the verdict of the people. In our  Republic there are majority rules, but  the rights of the minority are protected.  Now, also understand what has transpired this afternoon. In what should  be a reaffirmation of our constitutional  Republic and the Electoral College, a  Member has chosen to dispute the outcome of voting in the State of Ohio.  Despite that fact, speaker after speaker on the minority side, including the  leader from California, has said they  accept the verdict of the election. Do  not misunderstand, I say to my colleagues. This  is a vitally  important  point.  The problem we confront with this  debate is that it serves to plant the insidious seeds of doubt in the electoral  process. All the talk of election reform,  all the talk of hearings that the leader  championed,  all  the  process  complaints, some that are inaccurate that  have come  from the other side, are  points to be debated  in the regular  business of this House. Yes, they are  important. But to disrupt the Electoral  College, to say in effect, hey, we just  want to shine light on this problem, is  not the proper use of the people’s time.  And with all due respect, I question not  the intent; but the net effect is this:  again, it is to place doubt and to institutionalize forever the notion of grumbling and a lack of acceptance of the  verdict of the people. In less elevated  terms, Mr. Speaker, it is called sour  grapes; and  it  is sad to see  in this  House.  Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I  did not point out that this view is not  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:19 Dec 01, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE\TYPESE~1\H06JA5.REC H06JA5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2005
10,36,2005-01-06,Ms. WOOLSEY.," I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentlewoman  from  California  (Ms. WOOLSEY)  for  yielding, and I thank the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Mrs. JONES).  Mr. Speaker, this is a sacred debate.  This is not a frivolous time in our history. This is about avoiding the suppression of votes. Might I say when the  people of Ukraine rose up against their  flawed election, they understood what  democracy is all about.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to object to the  votes in Ohio. I rise under the Constitution of the United States in Article 4, 14 and 15. I argue the point that  we have an inconsistent election, and I  argue the point that we believe in democracy. The equal protection and due  clauses of the 14th amendment of the  Constitution operate  to protect  the  rights of citizens to vote for the candidate of their choice.  Furthermore, the well-settled case on  this  issue, Reynolds v. Sims, states  that ‘‘the right to vote freely for the  candidate of one’s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any  restrictions on that right strike at the  heart of representative government.’’  How would Members  like to be  in  Ohio and be told that the election was  on November 3, 2004, instead of November  2,  2004? The Constitution’s due  process  clause  requires  fundamental  fairness and that a State election official not employ vote-counting procedures that are so flawed.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that the American people value the value of one vote,  one person, and all votes counted.  Mr. Speaker, I support the objection made  as to counting the votes of the Electoral College from the State of Ohio in the name of the  American people, the United States Constitution, in the name of procedural due process,  and  in  the name of democracy. The Equal  Protection and Due Process Clauses of  the  14th Amendment of the Constitution operate  to protect the rights of citizens to vote for the  candidate of  their choice. Furthermore,  the  well-settled case on  this  issue, Reynolds v.  Sims states that ‘‘the right to vote freely for  the candidate of one’s choice  is of  the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.’’  This is a sacred debate that is in no way  frivolous use of the time of the Congress or of  the tax dollars of the American people. Nor is  this debate one that aims to overturn the 2004  presidential election. On the contrary, this debate is being made at the request and at the  behest of the American people.  I will cast a protest vote today not only in  the name of the integrity of the Ohio voting  process but for the democratic process that is  seriously flawed and that must be fixed.  The Court in that case also enunciated that  ‘‘undeniably  the Constitution of  the United  States protects the rights of all qualified citizens  to vote,  in state as well as  in  federal  elections . . . It has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified voters have a constitutionally protected  right  to vote,  . . . and  to  have their votes counted.’’  Moreover,  under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause, all methods prescribed by a legislature to preserve the right to vote must be effected and not thwarted as stated in Bush v.  Gore  in 2000. Reynolds and  its progeny of  cases added that votes that are cast must actually be counted under the Equal Protection  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—applicable to the individual States.  In addition, Mr. Speaker, the Constitution’s  Due Process Clause  requires  ‘‘fundamental  fairness,’’ or that a state official not conduct an  election or apply  vote-counting procedures  that are so flawed as to amount to a denial of  voters’ rights to have their voices heard and  their votes count. The First Circuit  federal  Court in 2001 held that where ‘‘organic failures  in a state or local election process threaten to  work patent and  fundamental unfairness, a  . . . claim  lies  for a violation of substantive  due process.’’  As we look to reauthorize relevant sections  of the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA), it would  be an indictment of the election process itself  if we fail to ask pointed questions as to the integrity of the Ohio election in 2004. This challenge is an absolute must relative to America’s  standing and reputation as a real democracy  and as a center that promotes the sanctity of  the right to vote.  Today’s challenge  in Joint Session  forum  aims to ensure the maintenance of the integrity of the voting process. I support my colleagues in challenging the mechanics of the  Electoral College vote certification for its procedural value. This challenge  represent our  collective exhaustion of legal remedies on behalf of the American people—our constituents,  for without this act, their voice remains muted.  What my colleagues and I stand to achieve  today is to raise the awareness of the American people as to the legitimacy of the democratic process and the absolute value of the  notion of ‘‘One person, One vote’’. Our collective efforts may not net a different result  in  terms of the recent presidential election; but  can and will affect future elections. On a global scale as the standard bearers of democracy  this challenge can serve to provide a shining  example of hope to the emerging democracies  in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The exhaustion of all  remedies available  when there is any doubt as to the legitimacy  of the overall process is one of the basic tenants upon which  this country was  founded.  The duty to doggedly pursue a task to its ultimate conclusion is as applicable to the recent  gubernatorial race in the State of Washington  as it is in the democratic elections taking place  for the first time in the Ukraine. In Washington  State, candidate Dino Rossi declared victory  after only a partial recount. However, after a  full and  fair  recount,  it was correctly determined that the Democratic candidate Chrisine  Gregoire was the victor. A rush to judgment is  never prudent. The  transparency of process  and convincing evidence of the true and correct outcome will preserve this institution we  call democracy.  In  the Ukraine, a new election was held  when majority supporters protested and complained of fraud in the election that resulted in  the  surprising  defeat  of  opposition  leader  Viktor Yushchenko. The second vote held revealed that Yushchenko had actually won by  a significant margin. What underscores  the  critical nature of  full and  fair recounts when  there is doubt as to legitimacy is the fact that  while  the  first  flawed  election  rendered  Yushchenko a loser by three (3) percentage  points, the revote rendered him a winner by  eight percentage points. This is clear and convincing evidence. This is democracy.  Mr. Speaker, election processes, like legislation, are imperfect; therefore, we must use  every opportunity and  resource available  to  bring them closer to legitimacy and a truly representative nature. All evidence of voting irregularity and failure of votes to be counted is relevant and important to the achievement of this  goal. This is democracy.  The hearings that we have held as a body  within the House Judiciary Committee and the  hard work that officials such as my colleague  from Ohio, Ms. TUBBSJONEShas done leading  up to November 4 and well through its aftermath have yielded  factual  findings  that suggest the existence of ample grounds on which  to challenge the electors from Ohio as being  unlawfully  appointed. Our  fact-finding  has  shown possible violation of 3 U.S.C. Section  5—which states that all controversies regarding the appointment of electors should be resolved six days prior to the meeting of electors  (or December 7, 2004 for purposes of the current election) in order for a state’s electors to  be binding on Congress when  it meets on  January 6, 2005, to declare the results of the  2004 election.  Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell and  others appear  to have  intentionally delayed  the initial certification of the electors until December 6, rendering a recount impossible by  December 7—let alone by the December 13  meeting of Ohio’s electors.  Today’s debate is very important to document  the serious election  improprieties  that  occurred in Ohio and in other voter precincts  around America. Some of  the  incidents  that  occurred include:  Insufficient resources allocated to poor and  minority precincts, which resulted in unusually  long lines which resulted in long waiting time;  Lack of a verified  ‘‘paper  trail’’ relating  to  electronic voting machines, thus failing the test  of transparency;  Reports of Ohioans being told, incorrectly,  that the presidential election was to take place  on Wednesday, November 3, 2004, as opposed to Tuesday, November 2;  Denial of provisional ballots to voters;  Voter intimidation;  Voting machine errors or tampering;  Improper purging of eligible votes;  Fraudulent phone calls, fliers, and bulletins  on official-looking letterhead;  Questionable vote  recount  in Ohio, about  which the case Yost v. David Cobb, et al. is  currently under litigation.  The American people deserve to have their  voice heard and  to have  their  fundamental  rights advocated.

11,43,2005-01-06,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank Representative TUBBSJONESand Senator BOXER  and Representative JOHNCONYERS for forcing  this institution, and thus our Nation, to debate  the quality of our democratic voting process  and to consider whether it meets the expectations of its people.  If we are to form a more perfect union, we  must dedicate ourselves  to  forming a more  perfect voting process.  Four years ago,  this Nation shuddered at  the weakness  of  our  ballot  process,  and  vowed to improve it.  But in some respects, it was weakened further.  The ballot was weakened when votes were  allowed to be cast without a printed record.  The ballot was weakened when  the vote  took so  long  that voters had  to choose between voting and missing a day’s work.  The ballot was weakened when provisional  ballots were not honored.  We must confront  the  fact  that electronic  voting machines that do not provide a ‘‘print  our’’ are a black hole.  We can do better. Our ATM machines give  receipts in return for cash. It is clearly not a  JOHN technological barrier to provide a receipt in return for a vote.  This is America. We are the incubator for  democratic evolution. We are a beacon to the  free world. Ohio had special problems  this  time, but they are problems we can fix, and  when we fix them in Ohio, we will have made  the progress in 2005 that we failed to make  over the last 4 years.  I am voting to support this challenge to the  certification of Ohio’s vote as a legitimate and  constructive beginning to a more perfect democracy and a more perfect union.  ",2005
12,43,2005-01-06,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, this debate is not  frivolous. This is not about sour grapes. This  is not about conspiracy theories. This is about  the central act of democracy.  Here  in  the House of Representatives all  members have been elected. Some of us  have been elected in recounts.  What are recounts? They are independent  checks of the tally.  Reliable knowledge is verifiable knowledge.  As my colleagues know, I am a scientist. It is  a principle of scientific thinking that one person’s claim must be subject  to  independent  confirmation or correction.  I agree with Senator  KERRY. We  should today award Ohio’s electoral votes to  President Bush. I believe President Bush got  more votes in Ohio then did Senator KERRY. I  believe it. I cannot confirm it. No one can confirm it.  Consider electronic voting machines. If there  was an error between  the voter casting  the  vote on the touch screen and the recording of  an electronic signal in a memory bank, no one  will ever know. It might be a software error; it  would not necessarily be a malicious conspiracy. But if the vote is recorded incorrectly,  no one will ever know.  I ask my colleagues, can anyone say he or  she knows  that  the actual vote  is what has  been presented  to us? The answer  is no.  None of us can say this knowledge has been  independently verified. It is not reliable knowledge unless it is verified knowledge. This is  not a philosophical fine point. Americans don’t  want to and should not have to take the results simply on faith. The electronic machines  used in Ohio and most other States are not  designed to be verifiable. Recounts are meaningless.  Self-government works only if we believe it  does. A loss of confidence in our system is  fatal  to a democratic republic such as ours.  That confidence has been eroded over  the  years and has taken some body blows in recent years.  We need a major effort to shore up our democracy.  Americans are a trusting people, but we demand evidence. We demand verification.  We are also a pragmatic people, and so we  in  the House will not upset  the apple cart  today. Without doubt we will endorse the electoral votes presented  to us  today. But we  should not be satisfied. Republicans should  not be satisfied. Democrats should not be satisfied. The reason is not that President Bush  got more votes. The reason is that the knowledge of President Bush’s majority is unreliable  knowledge.  Anything  of  value  should  be  auditable.  Votes are valuable. Each voter should have  the knowledge that the vote is recorded as intended. We are talking today about the heart  of our democratic republic.  ",2005
13,43,2005-01-06,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today, not with  the hope of overturning an  election, but with  the hope of overturning a  system  that has  for  too  long  failed  to guarantee every American their most basic right,  the right to vote.  Our very democracy was  founded on  the  essential right of citizens to have a voice in  their government. As Members of Congress  we are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the  United States, which  includes  the 13th and  19th Amendments, and I am quite frankly saddened that such a debate today breaks down  along party lines. Each and every one of us as  Americans should stand to defend this right, to  protect  and  guarantee  that  every  citizen,  black, white, male, female, Democrat or Republican, has the opportunity to cast a vote.  As representatives we should not fear the  will of the people; we should not fear a debate  here on the floor of the House seeking to shed  light on and improve our voting system, rather  we must fear any threat to our right to vote.  We must  take seriously any allegation  that  would deprive any citizen of  this  right,  let  alone the serious and widespread allegations  that are being make in Ohio.  The debate today is not about the election  of George W. Bush, rather it is about the integrity and  the  future of our voting system.  Today we are challenging ourselves to do better. We are challenging ourselves to examine  our voting system, to get to the bottom of what  went wrong in Ohio and around the Nation on  Election Day. We need to hold hearings. We  need to conduct an investigation and we need  to pass legislation that puts in place specific  federal protections  for our  federal elections,  especially in the areas of auditing electronic  voting machines and casting and counting provisional ballots. We must be willing to hold the  same light on our election system that we hold  on nations such as Afghanistan, Ukraine, and  Iraq. How can we serve as a model for democracy, when our own citizens lack faith in  our democracy?  That is what today is about, restoring faith  in our system. This can not be accomplished  by simply accepting the status quo and allowing opportunities such as today to pass without objection. The only way to change an injustice is to stand against it. Mr. Speaker, this  is why I rise today. We must not accept the  status quo,  rather we must challenge ourselves  to do better. This  is what we do as  Americans and this is what I am challenging  us to do today.  ",2005

17,50,2005-01-06,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  the Speaker’s announced policy of January 4, 2005, the gentlewoman  from  Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE) is recognized  for 60 minutes as the designee of the  minority leader.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam  Speaker, I will begin my remarks as I  started this morning and as I continued on the floor just a few minutes ago.  It is good to be an American, and it  is certainly good to have Americans  value their freedom, their justice, their  democracy, and their Constitution.  I said earlier that the debate regarding the election of a President had  nothing to do with any personal statement on the executive. But what it did  have to do with is, I believe, a value for  all Americans, and that is the value of  valuing a vote; one vote, one person;  one vote counted and not uncounted.  The reason why I rise is because I cochair the Afghan Caucus, and I was  very proud to see the work that was  done by all of those around the world  that helped contribute to the election  process in Afghanistan.  I was equally proud of those who  have sacrificed their lives; those who  tried to vote but were undermined by  terrorists and others who were distracted away from the voting process.  And even though there is much disagreement many times about the process, we welcome democracy; President  Karzai now has begun to turn Afghanistan into a nation that welcomes the  education of all people, that welcomes  the empowerment of women and the  protection of human rights.  So it is important today, January 6,  2005, to reinforce that for our Nation,  for if we were to look at some of the infractions, in my own county, in Harris  County, Texas, 270 voting failures; the  lack of voting places and voting equipment; equipment breaking down; voter  intimidation; voter suppression; equipment showing one name, as in my particular election of the Eighteenth Congressional District, constituents voting  for me and my opponent’s name showing up, who happened to be in the other  party. So  it  is very vital, Madam  Speaker, for us to take very seriously  the democratic process.  Let me also say in the backdrop of a  terrible tragedy in Iraq, and when I say  tragedy, obviously what I mean is no  reflection on the brave men and women  who fight every day, those who I visited and those whose greetings I bring  home to their families, but the tragedy  of a misdirected war, a war based on  weapons of mass destruction that did  not exist, a war that was based on liberation, and we are still struggling for  that, a war that is ongoing with no end  in sight. We still are looking for an  election on January 30 and hoping and  praying that the Iraqi people will have  the opportunity to take up their own  destiny.  But that is why this day was so very  important and why it was important  for Members of Congress, not of any  caucus or any one group, to be engaged  in the debate and the democracy. I  thank the two signers of the petition,  as I indicated, the gentlewoman from  Ohio  (Mrs. JONES) and  the Senator  from California, ",2005
18,50,2005-01-06,Ms. BOXER.,"  But I also thank the ranking member  of the Committee on the Judiciary, the  gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr. CONYERS), for the insight he had; for the  hearings  I participated  in  in Washington and also the hearings that others participated in in Ohio. It allowed  us to hear firsthand the pain of people  who tried to vote and could not vote. It  allowed us  to hear  firsthand about  those who stood in line until 4 a.m.,  those who were turned away, those who  had fewer machines in their community than those in anothers.  Madam Speaker, I think in this year  we are to reauthorize portions of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965. It is clearly  urgent that we not disregard and disrespect the voting process.  Might I say that my heritage is one  that is different from many Americans.  My ancestors  came here as  slaves.  When  the Constitution was written,  they were less than one person. It took  constitutional amendments, the 13th,  14th and 15th, one to eliminate slavery,  the others to provide equal process and  equal protection and due process. And  certainly it took the Constitution to  acknowledge every citizen’s right to  vote.

29,71,2005-01-06,Mr.  INOUYE.," Mr.  President,  although there were voting irregularities  in Ohio, I will not vote in support of  the objection. I do respect the result of  the recent Presidential election, but I  do not  respect  the process. Several  thousand voters believe they were discouraged or even prevented from voting, and several thousand who did vote  believe that their votes were not correctly reported. The inequitable allocation of voting machines, the lack of instruction for the review of provisional  ballots, and the questionable activities  surrounding the recount of the electronic ballots call  into question the  final results in Ohio. However, I am unconvinced that it would have made a  difference in the final outcome of this  Presidential election.  I had hoped that we would not have  the electoral college votes called into  question again. After the 2000 Presidential election, we worked together to  pass election reform  legislation, the  Help America Vote Act. That legislation set Federal requirements for provisional ballots and for voter information, registration, and  identification.  Unfortunately, that legislation has not  yet been fully implemented and does  not go far enough.  I would like to work with my colleagues craft legislation to ensure that  all of our citizens are encouraged to  vote and participate in our democratic  process. Our citizens must believe their  vote will count. At a time when we are  risking lives of our service men and  women to spread democracy throughout the world, we cannot ignore the  threats to the democratic process here  at home. I do not relish the vote I am  forced to cast today, but I as I do, I  look forward to being able to cast future votes on Federal election reform  to ensure that we are not in this position again.  ",2005
30,71,2005-01-06,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President, serious allegations have been raised about voting  irregularities in Ohio during the 2004  presidential  election.  I  agree with  many of my colleagues that these allegations must be  investigated to the  fullest extent possible because every  eligible citizen  in  this nation must  have an equal opportunity to exercise  the constitutional right to cast a vote  in Federal elections. That said, I do not  believe there is anything to be gained  by sustaining the objection to the ballot certification with  regard  to  the  state of Ohio. Senator JOHNKERRYhas  already  conceded  the  election  and  there are no pending  investigations  that will  result  in  sufficient votes  being changed so as to alter the outcome of this election.  However, the last two elections have  revealed  a  glaring need  for us  to  rethink how we conduct elections in  our Nation. With more and more voters  needing to cast their ballots on Election Day, we need to build on the  movement which  already  exists  to  make it easier for Americans to cast  their ballots by providing alternatives  to voting on  just one election day.  Twenty-six states, including my own  state of Wisconsin, now permit any  registered voter to vote by absentee  ballot. Twenty three states permit in-  person early voting at election offices  or at other  satellite  locations. The  state of Oregon now conducts statewide  elections completely by mail. These innovations are critical if we are to conduct fair elections for it has become  unreasonable to expect that a nation of  294 million people can line up at the  same time and cast their ballots at the  same time. And if we continue to try to  do so, we will encounter even more reports of broken machines and  long  lines in the rain and registration errors  that create barriers to voting.  That is why I have been a long-time  advocate of moving our federal election  day from the first Tuesday after the  first Monday in November to the first  weekend in November. Holding our federal elections on a weekend will create  more opportunities for voters to cast  their ballots and will help end the gridlock at the polling places which threaten to undermine our elections. I look  forward to introducing legislation to  this end in the 109th Congress and I  urge my colleagues to join me in this  effort.  ",2005
31,71,2005-01-06,Ms. CANTWELL.," Mr. President, we  meet  in historic session today. The  twelfth amendment to the Constitution  sets forth the requirements for casting  electoral  votes  and  counting  those  votes in Congress. The electors are required to meet, cast and certify their  ballots and transmit them to the Vice  President in his capacity as President  of the Senate.  With the exception of objections to  the electoral votes from the State of  Florida in the 2000 election, objections  to an entire slate of votes from a State  have been rare. But we have had one  today, which gives us the opportunity  to discuss and debate a very important  issue for our country and for the citizens of my State—the issue of whether  we have ensured that every vote  is  counted.  I will vote to uphold the outcome of  this most recent election.  However, I think we have more work  to do in the area of election reform,  CONYERS and I think the discussion we are having today is appropriate and overdue.  In 2001, I supported the passage of the  Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act.  That law was designed to protect voting rights and ensure the integrity of  the electoral system in our nation. I  did so because I feel that making certain that each citizen’s vote is counted  and promoting public trust and confidence in our election process is crucial.  The job is far from over. We may  need to have additional hearings and  we may need to take additional legislative action. There have been troubling  reports from this most recent election.  Representative JOHN and  the minority staff of the House Judiciary Committee have conducted their  own hearings and investigations of instances of voter disenfranchisement,  flawed or corrupted voting machinery,  and  inappropriate  procedures  for  counting and recounting votes in Ohio.  They have produced a compelling report itemizing and analyzing the irregularities.  A 2-hour debate on the matter, when  people across the country waited in 4, 6  and 12-hour lines to vote all over this  country in November, is the least we  can do.  The debate we are having focuses attention on  legitimate concerns  that  have been raised regarding the Ohio  vote and count, and on broader concerns about America’s inconsistent and  sometimes  flawed  election processes  which vary so radically from State to  State that genuine equal protection  concerns arise.  I will certify the election results, because I don’t think we should sacrifice  the greater good of the continuity of  Government at this time. We need to  govern. But, what we should be doing is  using this debate to get this Congress,  and this country, talking about the  steps that must be taken to ensure  that American elections provide a true  representation of the people’s will.  ",2005
32,71,2005-01-06,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, while I  was pleased at the  large number of  Americans who turned out to vote in  last year’s Presidential election, I am  deeply concerned about the many credible allegations of voting irregularities  that surfaced in the weeks following  the election.  I cannot, however, support an objection to the certification of Ohio’s electoral votes. Although I believe this debate is worthwhile, I am not persuaded  that the alleged fraud was sufficient to  change the outcome of either the Electoral College or the popular vote. Senator KERRYconceded the election more  than 2 months ago, and he does not  support  a  challenge. Moreover,  the  practical effect of discounting Ohio’s  electoral votes would  simply be  to  allow the election to be decided by the  House of Representatives.

The town of Warrensburg was incorporated in 1855 as a community proud  of its heritage and loyal to the ideals,  traditions and institutions that have  contributed to the success and growth  of the city.  Warrensburg prides itself as being a  self-contained city with a vibrant employment  base,  excellent  education  system,  active  cultural  scene,  and  many civic events and activities  for  residents to enjoy.  Warrensburg  serves as  the county  seat for Johnson County, and is currently home to 17,075 residents who are  served by an excellent school system  which has been accredited with Distinction in Performance by the Missouri State Board of Education. The  Warrensburg School System has also  been named a Gold Medal School, ranking them among the Nation’s top 18  percent of schools.  The community  is also the proud  home of Central Missouri State University, which has provided quality postsecondary education for more than 130  years. This comprehensive university  annually serves nearly 14,000 students  from all over the State, Nation, and  world, and offers more than 150 areas of  study at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  The city’s heartland work ethic and  community pride make it a great place  to do business, with several local companies which have grown into national  and international prominence aided by  the exceptional workforce and affordable business climate. Warrensburg is  home of EnerSys, G.E. Transportation  Systems, ThyssenKrupp Stahl Company, Swisher Mower, Bomag Paving  Products, and the world headquarters  of both Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity  and Carlyle Van Lines.  Warrensburg is also proud of its rich  diversity, with over 35 different languages spoken within the Warrensburg  School District, and over 30 faith communities gathering  for worship and  service each week.  Warrensburg  is  also  the  boyhood  home of John William ‘‘Blind’’ Boone,  the  legendary ragtime composer and  piano player; home of the first gasoline-powered,  push  lawn mower  invented by Leonard Goodall; the original self-propelled mower and the zero-  turning radius riding lawn mower both  invented by Max Swisher, who remains  a Warrensburg  resident; and Errett  Lobban Cord, inventor of Cord Automobiles.  Finally, Warrensburg  is  also  the  hometown of Old Drum, the hunting  dog for which Senator George Graham  Vest’s ‘‘Eulogy on the Dog’’ was delivered, coining the idea that ‘‘man’s best  friend is his dog.’’  I am honored to share Warrensburg’s  proud history and its sesquicentennial  anniversary as a town with my colleagues,  and  I wish  the  people  of  Warrensburg all the best for the future.∑  f  JOHN SACKETT RETIREMENT  ∑",2005
34,85,2005-01-06,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President,  after  years of faithful service and dedication  to his work at Argonne National Lab, a  friend  and  respected  Idahoan, John  Sackett, is retiring to pursue a quieter  life with his family. John served in a  number of positions in the Lab over the  past 34 years, the most recent being director or Argonne National Lab West  located at Idaho National Environment  and  Engineering  Lab  in  southeast  Idaho. He has earned international recognition and respect for his work in  the areas of nuclear safety and advanced reactor design.  I have had the privilege of working  with John the entire time I have served  in Congress. Over the past 12 years, I  have witnessed his steady leadership,  commitment to the goals of the Lab  and DOE. John and I share a fervent  belief in the role of nuclear energy and  research  in economic,  technological,  security and energy sectors.  Perhaps what is most remarkable is  that despite the tremendous demands  of his work at Argonne, he finds the  time to give back to his community,  serving on numerous medical and economic boards and councils in eastern  Idaho as well as on the advisory boards  of both the University of Idaho and  Idaho State University.  Argonne National Lab’s loss is certainly John’s family’s gain, as well as  the gain of any organization in which  he decides to invest his retirement energy. He has my best wishes in his retirement.∑  f  HONORING DAVID L. DAY ON HIS  RETIREMENT  ∑",2005
35,85,2005-01-06,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President, I  rise today to honor David L. Day on his  retirement from 35 years of public service as the Deputy Engineer for Programs and Project Management with  the Nashville District, U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers. During his 35 years  of Federal service, 33 with the Corps of  Engineers, from 1969 to present, Dave  held a clear vision and achieved a remarkable string of successes  in  furthering the mission of the Nashville  District and the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers. Dave has earned a reputation of being honest, fair, and professional with his coworkers. He began his  career with the Nashville District in  October 1998 when he was selected as  the Deputy District Engineer for Programs and Project Management and is  the senior civilian for the district with  more than 800 employees and a $140  million annual operating budget. The  district provides Federal engineering,  planning, construction, project management,  real  estate,  and  environmental services. His responsibilities included budgeting, planning, and executing Civil Works and  Interagency  and  International Services programs  under the project management business process.  Dave Day has distinguished himself  as a leader in many ways during his  tenure. He continuously has encouraged a culture of professional improvement,  fostering team  leadership and  activity to meet district goals, while at  the same time, taking care of the people with whom he works. Dave had a  strong, positive impact on the morale  of the district’s Planning, Programs,  and Project Management Division employees as well as Project Delivery  Team members.

Jennifer’s  brother Jack died bravely serving our nation in  Iraq on November 13, 2004.  RECORD CORPORALKEVINJOHN ‘‘JACK’’ DEMPSEYDECEMBER9, 1980—NOVEMBER13, 2004—A SON,  A BROTHER, A FRIEND  played because of his natural ability and  drive to be the best. As a son and brother he  was loving and protective. He has a great  love for animals. Our mom took us to every  zoo and animal park she could find. Even as  a Marine, he showed that love. There was a  stray dog at Camp LeJeune that Jack used  to feed and take care of.  Jack is loved by many people. He had a  great smile and an even greater laugh. He  was a sweet kid who always wanted to do  something great with his life. My brother  was a wonderful man who accomplished  many great things. He excelled in the Marines and felt he was truly part of a brotherhood. My mother and I are incredibly proud  that he was able to do this for himself and  his country. We love him dearly and this loss  is tremendous to us. But we are extremely  proud of the man he became. He was a sweet  soul with the courage of a tiger. My brother  Jack made the ultimate sacrifice to protect  all of us. Honor him well.  f  40TH ANNIVERSARY OF PADRON  CIGARS  HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2005  Mr. MARIO DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr.  Speaker, 2004 marked the 40th anniversary of  the founding of Padron Cigars and I rise to  honor and congratulate them on this wonderful  achievement.  Padron Cigars was founded on September  8, 1964 by  the Padron brothers—Jose Orlando and Rodolfo. Throughout  the  last 40  years, the Padron family has worked to grow  their business and continue providing new  products  to  their  loyal customers  throughout  the world.  Of course, the success of Padron Cigars did  not come without significant challenges over  the years. In fact, their factory in Nicaragua  was destroyed as a result of civil war.  Through endless commitment and  leadership, Padron Cigars was able to survive and  grow, despite  the  serious  challenges  they  faced.  Today, Padron Cigars continues their commitment to quality through their consistent approach  to  the  lengthy process of manufacturing cigars. In fact, they claim: ‘‘Our primary  mission is the exceptional quality of our product, not the quantity produced.’’  Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Padron Cigars is clearly an industry leader that has epitomized the success of small family businesses  throughout America. The  success  story of  Padron Cigars is nothing short of the American Dream and I ask my colleagues to join  me in congratulating the Padron family on this  anniversary.  f  LEGISLATION ON EXCHANGE OF  LAND FOR A SCHOOL ON ST. JOHN  HON. DONNA M. CHRISTENSEN  OFTHEVIRGINISLANDS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  I would just like to say a few words about  my brother, Jack. As a young child, Jack  was always on the move.

44,106,2005-01-06,Ms. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to introduce legislation to address a long  held concern of my constituents on the island  of St. John, Virgin Islands; the need for the  National Park Service and the government of  the Virgin Islands to agree on an exchange of  land so that residents of St. John can build a  school to accommodate students from K–12.  Mr. Speaker, my constituents in the Virgin  Islands have been wrestling with this issue for  several years now. Since the 1970’s, enrollment in public schools on St. John has grown  considerably and the local government has no  more land on which to expand either of the  two current St. John public schools.  Just  last month a 7-year-old boy by  the  name of Javon Alfred was struck and killed by  a delivery truck, as he was on his way home  from the only public school on St. John. The  Julius Sprauve School, where Javon was a  second grade student, is located in an urban  area with significant vehicular traffic. With the  significant  increases  in population  that St.  John has witnessed in recent years, the location of  the Sprauve School  is not  the most  suitable at the present time.  Mr. Speaker, St. John is an island only 28  square miles  in size,  two  thirds which comprises the Virgin Islands National Park. Without an exchange of land between the National  Park Service and the government of the Virgin  Islands, there is no place to build a school on  St. John. While the residents of St. John have  benefited from a boom in tourism on that island, they have had to give up many long held  traditions,  including  the right  to  fish  in  local  waters. The exchange of land for a school on  St. John is a matter that is long overdue. It is  high time that this issue be resolved. The residents and students of St. John deserve nothing less.  I urge my colleagues to support passage of  this bill.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. JOE BACA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2005  ",2005

Hon. NANCYPELOSI,  Democratic Leader,  Washington, DC.  DEAR LEADER PELOSI:  I respectfully request to be excused from the floor, today, on  legislative business.  Were I able to be present on the  floor  today, I would vote to ensure that the electoral will of the people is respected in every  state. If there is any perceived electoral irregularity, those who have been aggrieved  must be afforded the opportunity to have  their concerns redressed, in the appropriate  manner and forum, as expeditiously as possible.  The hallmark of our Democracy—lasting  and cherished for over two centuries—is that  we respect and abide by Constitutional principles. The right of franchise, purchased with  the blood and toil of our civil rights leaders,  must not be idly relinquished. We must fight  to make all voices heard in that noble and  great enterprise that is America.

46,113,2005-01-06,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the memory of Congressman ROBERT  MATSUI. BOBMATSUIwas one of those elected  officials who earned the right to be called a  ‘‘statesman.’’ He was a force for compassion,  competence and integrity—as well as a wonderful human being whom I was honored to  call my  friend.  I extend my heartfelt sympathies to his loving wife and family.  Mr. Speaker, BOBMATSUIembodied America’s promise, demonstrating how a citizen of  humble beginnings could rise to the heights of  American governance. BOBalso reminded us  of our country’s sins. During the Second World  War, BOB’s  family was  interned  in  the Tule  Lake internment camp. This time of curtailed  liberties and rampant xenophobia is one of the  darker moments of American history.  Mr. Speaker,  internment  left an  indelible  mark on BOBMATSUI’s  family. BOB’s mother  contracted German measles at Tule Lake, and  as a result, BOB’s sister was born blind.  The experience also deeply affected BOB,  inspiring him to use his platform in Congress  to  reclaim  the dignity of  those wrongly  interned. BOBworked tirelessly to enact the Japanese American Redress Act,  in which  the  government formally apologized for internment  and offered compensation.  Mr. Speaker, James Baldwin once said, ‘‘I  love America more than any other country in  the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist  on the right to criticize her perpetually.’’ BOB  loved America in just this spirit. When  John F. Kennedy told Americans to ask what  they could do for their country, BOBpledged to  become a public servant. He served diligently  for 26 years.  Mr. Speaker, we will miss BOB’s leadership  as  the new Congress wades  through  the  murky waters of Social Security policy. Our  Democratic House Leader, Congresswoman  NANCYPELOSI, was quite accurate when she  noted that ‘‘America’s seniors have lost their  MATSUI best friend in the Congress.’’ I would add only  that so have this nation’s children and all of us  who seek balanced, progressive solutions to  the challenges at the center of people’s lives.  f  EXPRESSING  SORROW  OF  THE  HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE  HONORABLE ROBERT T.

47,113,2005-01-06,Mr. DAVIS of  Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor the life of an admirable citizen,  respectable public servant and a generous,  kind man.  Congressman  served the people of California and his nation  in the House of Representatives for 26 years.  BOBgave our country and Congress years  of his knowledge and dedication to fighting for  civil rights after beginning his life in 1942 in a  detention camp  for Japanese-Americans. He  embraced his heritage as well as  the hardships Asian Americans faced and channeled it  to positive change to make our nation formally  apologized  for  the  interment  of  Japanese  Americans and provide financial compensation  to the survivors.  BOBwas a true inspiration: as a Member,  he was a vital member of  the Democratic  Party and worked to make his Party stronger  but never  let his dedicated  ties  refrain him  from working with his Republican colleagues;  as an American, he listened to President Kennedy to give to his country a life of service  and commitment to making life better for all  Americans; and as an Asian American, he  served as a role model to young Asian Americans that the impossible is never that far away  and that they too can become active in government to serve the American people.  Mr. Speaker, BOBMATSUI’s loss will leave a  large void to this chamber. Our prayers and  thoughts are with his wife Doris and his son  Brian.  f  EXPRESSING  SORROW  OF  THE  HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE  HONORABLE ROBERT T.

48,113,2005-01-06,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise with  great sadness as we honor our dear  friend  and  colleague, Congressman BOBMATSUI,  who passed away this New Year’s Day. I always say that it is a privilege to serve in this  body. But for 25 years, it was this institution  that was privileged—privileged  to call BOB  MATSUIone of its Members. He was a compassionate man dedicated to his constituents  and family, and resolute in his ideals.  Each of us knows the adroit knowledge of  Congress BOBpossessed—from his grasp of  tax and trade law intricacies, to his drive for  basic social justice, to his tireless opposition to  those who would weaken Social Security’s  guarantee. He was not only smart—he was  also principled, and he used both to the fullest  throughout his  illustrious quarter-century  in  public life.  I know he would have relished  the  forthcoming debate to fundamentally reform Social  Security,  to which  he  surely would  have  brought the same passion and intelligence he  took to his efforts to help his party over the  years. As was the case with all things he put  his mind to, win or lose, whatever the battle—  whether it was welfare reform, Social Security  or his chairmanship of  the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee—the level of  discourse was elevated when BOBMATSUI  added his voice to the debate. At a time when  the tenor of politics in our country has become  so abrasive, what BOBMATSUIoffered was a  precious commodity indeed.  On a personal note,  I always  felt a close  bond to BOB, as we were both children of immigrant parents—his  from Japan, mine  from  Italy. He spoke of how spending  the  first 5  years of his  life  in a Japanese  internment  camp haunted him for the rest of his life. But  the experience unquestionably gave him a lifelong commitment to civil rights and social justice. It gave him a genuine empathy for people  that one could trace from his friendships to his  work on issues like trade, welfare and retirement security.  He was, in the truest sense of the word, a  patriot—someone  for whom America meant  the promise of a better life for one’s family and  community. As such, BOBMATSUIwill be sorely missed, but his legacy will live on for generations. My  thoughts and prayers are with  him and his family.  f  EXPRESSING  SORROW  OF  THE  HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE  HONORABLE ROBERT T.

I had the pleasure of serving alongside BOB  on  the Ways and Means Committee since  1996 and knew him  to be a statesman of  enormous ability and integrity, a man of kind  and gentle nature, a rare individual with whom  one could disagree without finding him to be  disagreeable. These are  the most  important  qualities a public servant in this House of Representatives could possess. BOBmade an immeasurable contribution  to  the House. His  keen intellect and ability to craft bipartisan legislation will be missed by me and the entire  Congress.  Our  thoughts and prayers are with BOB’s  family at this difficult time. His passing is truly  a great loss for our Nation.  VerDate Aug 04 2004  06:33 Jan 07, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A06JA8.052 E06PT1 ",2005

51,5,2005-01-25,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  want  to  thank  the gentleman  from  California for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I represent an area in  Chicago known as Ukrainian Village,  and last fall, I was privileged to visit  Ukraine with my friends from the Self-  Reliance Credit Union  to  celebrate  Ukrainian independence and to assist  with the development of credit unions  in that country.  I left impressed with the passion and  commitment  of  the  people  of  the  Ukraine to the development of democracy  in  their homeland. They have  been rewarded with a massive victory  for  their notions of  the democratic  process.  I congratulate President Yushchenko  on his election as President of Ukraine  and commend all of the diverse forces  who assisted in bringing about this triumph of the democratic process.  Ukraine is emerging as a vigorous  and forward-looking member of the European community, recognized for stepping away from nuclear weapons, and  acknowledged for a flourishing, developing economy.  I trust that relations between the  Ukraine and the United States will  continue to strengthen. The elections  in the Ukraine mark a kind of fork in  the road for U.S. foreign policy. We can  move down the road toward mutually  beneficial relations with Russia and all  of the former Soviet republics and allies in Eastern Europe, or we can return to the kind of relationships which  characterized the Cold War.  I believe our choice ought to be clear:  strong and peaceful relationships, rejecting all interference in the internal  affairs of other states; mutually beneficial relationships based on fair trade;  strict observance of international law;  cultural and scientific cooperation; and  people-to-people interaction.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I commend the  people  of  the  Ukraine  for  demonstrating what democracy can and  should really mean, and that is rule by  the people.  ",2005
52,5,2005-01-25,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Maryland  (Mr. CARDIN),  the distinguished leader on the Democratic side of the Helsinki Commission.  ",2005
53,5,2005-01-25,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank the gentleman from California  (Mr. LANTOS) and the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. HYDE) for their leadership  on bringing this resolution forward. It  is a very important moment in the history of the Ukraine.  I also want to congratulate my colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. SMITH) for his leadership on the  Helsinki Commission that has consistently raised the issue of fair and transparent elections among the member  states for the Organization of Security  and Cooperation in Europe.  I  want  to  congratulate  Viktor  Yushchenko  and  the  people  of  the  Ukraine on the fair and transparent  run-off elections on December 26. What  is very noteworthy is just 5 weeks earlier, that country had a run-off election that was marked by widespread  fraud.  After that election on November 21,  something happened  in the Ukraine.  The spirit of democracy that we have  seen in so many of the former republics  of the Soviet Union finally made its  way to the Ukraine. The support from  the United States was instrumental in  bringing  about  a  change  in  the  Ukraine. The support within the OSCE  in  insisting  that  its member  states  comply with requirements of the fair  and transparent elections also helped.  The will of the people prevailed.  All of us remember what happened in  Independence Square in Kiev known as  the  Orange  Revolution.  It  gave  strength to their country to seek freedom and fair elections. It gave strength  to their institutions, and on December  3, the Supreme Court ruled the November 21 election invalid.  Now the Ukraine has  followed the  lead  of  the  former Soviet  republic  Georgia in their Revolution of Roses to  bring about a fair election process, but,  Mr. Speaker,  there  is a hard  task  ahead. They have to overcome the dual  legacy of corruption and disregard for  the rule of law.  I know I speak for every person of  this Chamber that if Ukraine follows  the path of democracy and respect for  human rights, as they showed in this  past election, they will have this body,  they will have this Nation on their side  as they fight to develop a democratic  system within their country.

55,12,2005-01-25,Ms.  SCHWARTZ  of Pennsylvania.,"  Madam Speaker, I rise with profound  gratitude to the people of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District  for  electing me to represent them in Congress. As the daughter of a Holocaust  survivor, I am honored that my first  opportunity  to  speak on  the House  floor  is on an  issue so close to my  heart.  My colleagues, the gentleman from  California (Mr. LANTOS) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), I  and so many others stand today in remembrance of the 6 million Jews who  lost  their  lives  during  the Second  World War, many of whom were our  aunts and uncles, mothers and fathers,  friends and loved ones.  My mother, Renee Perl, was one of  the many who  fled their homeland.  Forced to start anew at the young age  of 14, she left Austria alone, spending  time in Holland and England before arriving in Philadelphia at the age of 16  in 1941. Once arriving on the shores of  America, my mother,  like  so many  Jews, was hesitant to tell her story,  hoping that by trying to forget about  the war, the violence, the dislocation,  the fear she could move on. Yet once in  the United States, those who survived  the Holocaust could not hide  their  gratitude and love for this country, relishing  the opportunity and  freedom  granted to them as new Americans. My  own love and respect for our country  and my belief in our responsibility to  each other stems in great part from  this strong sense of patriotism.  Elie Wiesel once said, ‘‘We should all  respect the uniqueness, the originality,  the specificity in one another.’’ It was  leaders like Mr. Wiesel who inspired  Jews to acknowledge the importance of  remembering, of telling the stories, so  as to never  let a Holocaust happen  again.  My colleagues, what makes our country great is we respect differences: ethnic, religious, race, gender, geographic  and political; that we have a government that reflects and embraces our  Nation’s broad diversity; and that we,  as a community, are afforded opportunities to recall the good and the dark  times in our shared history.  Madam Speaker, I am tremendously  grateful  for being able to share my  family’s story, to know my mother  would be proud to know that we were  not only paying tribute to those who  suffered tremendous pain and hardship,  but to recall the Jewish people’s great  spirit to survive, continued  faith  in  God, and unwavering belief in freedom  and democracy.

57,12,2005-01-25,Mr. CARDIN.," Madam Speaker, as we  commemorate the 60th anniversary of  the liberation of Auschwitz, I want to  acknowledge how fortunate we are in  this body to have the gentleman from  California (Mr. LANTOS) as one of our  Members. His passion on human rights  is so welcomed in this body. He has  been the champion on these issues for  many years. We thank the gentleman  for everything he has meant to our sensitivity on human rights issues. The  gentleman has seen  it  firsthand and  has helped us understand the need for  activism in this body.  I also acknowledge  the gentleman  from Illinois (Chairman HYDE) for his  leadership on human rights issues, and  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  SMITH) who is our leader on the Helsinki Commission, not only on this  issue, but on anti-Semitism generally.  He has  led the effort  in the  international body to make sure that we  pay attention to the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe today.  Last year I had an opportunity to  visit  Auschwitz  and  see  firsthand  where a million people lost their lives  in the factory of death. It has an impact on all of us who have seen how inhumane people can be.  Madam Speaker, in 1991 the participating states of the Organization for  Security and Cooperation  in Europe  agreed in Krakow, Poland, to ‘‘strive to  preserve and protect these monuments  and sites of remembrance,  including  extermination camps, and the related  archives,  which  are  themselves  testimonials to their tragic experience  in their common past. Such steps need  to be taken in order that those experiences may be remembered, may help to  teach present and future generations of  these events, and thus ensure that they  are never repeated.’’  Auschwitz is just such a site of remembrance. With this resolution, we  mourn innocent lives lost and vibrant  communities  destroyed.

58,26,2005-01-25,Mr. HIGGINS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in strong support of H. Res. 39 offered by the  gentleman from California, commending countries and organizations  for marking  the 60th  anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and  urging a strengthening of the fight against racism, intolerance, bigotry, prejudice, discrimination, and anti-Semitism. I thank my colleague,  Mr. LANTOS, for bringing this important resolution to the floor today.  The lessons of January 27, 1945 are forever  with us. That day and the many days of liberation afterwards showed us of the fight which  exists to make sure that the world strengthens  its efforts to fight against any form of discrimination.  There  is great danger  in being  inactive  about the threat of anti-Semitism. It was anti-  Semitism that was responsible for the horrors  of the Holocaust, for the death of over 6 million Jews, and for the slaughter of over 1.1  million people at Auschwitz.  Sadly, even  though we have reached  the  60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz,  anti-Semitism in Europe has been on the rise.  Once again, we witness evil propaganda,  physical attacks against Jews, the burning of  Jewish sites and  the desecration of synagogues. We must not stand aside and ignore  this grave escalation of anti-Semitic violence  and hatred.  We also saw the shadow of this anti-Semitism yesterday at the special session of the  United Nations’ General Assembly. Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and  foreign ministers from Israel and a number of  European  countries  spoke  to many empty  seats in the General Assembly chamber while  they delivered powerful and often moving addresses about  intolerance and genocide. Of  the 191 members of  the General Assembly,  only 138 agreed with the proposal by the U.S.  to hold the special day of commemoration. We  must wonder why, after all these years, there  are over 50 countries which did not agree to  this most basic proposal to recognize a day  which will forever be etched in our minds.  Any government whose people exhibit any  act of anti-Semitism must provide security and  safety to their Jewish communities, must prosecute and punish perpetrators of anti-Semitic  violence, and must cultivate a climate in which  all  forms of anti-Semitism and discrimination  are rejected.  Mass violence,  the abuse of  fundamental  human rights, and the mistreatment of human  beings as a result of discrimination are ugly  faces of our humanity. Apart from the Holocaust,  the genocides  in Turkey, Cambodia,  Tibet, and Bosnia, the killing of the Tutsi in  Rwanda, the slaying of thousands in Sudan,  and  the deaths of millions during  the  Irish  Famine, are all instances of oppression and  prejudice succeeding  throughout our history.  The complacency and inaction of governments  around  the world, standing silently by while  discrimination grows, is inexcusable.  Today must be used as a day of education,  since without education, there can be no real  change. Teachers throughout the world must  have  the  support of  their governments  to  teach their students the lessons of the Holocaust and of all discrimination. Our grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and generations  to come must be made to understand that racial, ethnic, and religious intolerance and prejudice can lead to the genocide carried out in  camps such as Auschwitz, and these intolerances will never have a place  in our world  again.  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join with  my colleagues  in supporting  this  resolution,  and thank my colleague, Mr. LANTOS, for his  unwavering leadership on this issue.  ",2005
59,26,2005-01-25,Ms. MCCOLLUM.," Madam Speaker, as an  original cosponsor of H. Res. 39, I rise today  to support this resolution marking the 60th anniversary of  the  liberation of Auschwitz and  exposing  the world  to  this dark chapter  in  human history.  An estimated 6 million Jewish men, women  and children, more than 60 percent of the pre-  Second World War Jewish population of Europe, were murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz and other death camps during World War  II. The Holocaust and  the human suffering  perpetrated by  the Nazi  regime against  the  Jews of Europe deserves  to be commemorated with prayer, reflection and  the solemn  words of this resolution.  On this day, as we remember the victims of  Auschwitz and  the genocide which  ravaged  Europe during World War II, genocide is not a  relic of history, but a reality in today’s world.  The human race has not conquered the tyranny of men willing to commit mass murder—  genocide—against other human beings. At this  moment in the Darfur region of Sudan our own  Secretary of State has called the systematic  murder and rape of tens of thousands—along  with the forced dislocation of some 1.8 million  people—a modern day ‘‘genocide.’’ In fact, it  is because I am traveling back from the Sudan  and eastern Chad having visited directly with  the victims of the ethnic cleansing in Darfur  that I am not present to vote in support of H.  Res. 39.  Today, as we  remember  the  liberation of  Auschwitz,  the  liberation of human beings  forced  to suffer unimaginable horrors,  let us  commit  this House as well as  the will and  power of our great Nation,  to  the cause of  eradicating genocide and holding the perpetrators of such grotesque crimes against humanity accountable.  I commend my  friend Mr. LANTOS for his  leadership on  this resolution and  I  look  forward to working closely with him and Chairman HYDE to end the tyranny of genocide in  the world today.  ",2005

63,33,2005-01-25,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  on February 23, 1905, Paul Harris, a  Chicago attorney, invited three friends  to a meeting: Sylvester Schiele, a coal  dealer; Hiram Shorey, a merchant tailor; and Gustavus Loehr, a mining engineer. All  four men  gathered  in  Loehr’s business office in room 711 of  the Unity Building at 127 North Dearborn  Street  in  downtown  Chicago,  which is my district. They discussed  Harris’  idea that business needed to  meet periodically to enjoy camaraderie  and to enlarge the circle of business  and professional acquaintances.  The club met weekly. Membership  was limited to one representative from  each business and profession. Though  the men did not use the term ‘‘rotary’’  that night, that gathering is commonly  regarded as the first Rotary Club meeting. The name ‘‘rotary’’ was suggested  later on by Paul Harris as meetings  were rotated from office to office in the  early days of the organization.  During the early days, the Rotarians  realized  that  fellowship and mutual  self-interest were not enough to keep a  club of busy professionals meeting each  week. Reaching out to  improve the  lives of the less fortunate proved to be  an even more powerful motivation. The  Rotary commitment to service began  when the Rotary Club of Chicago donated a horse to a preacher so that he  could make the rounds of his churches  and parishioners. A few weeks later,  the club constructed Chicago’s  first  public lavatory. These actions of service and improvement of communities  continued in 1967 to support the pediatric program at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.  Of course, through the years, these  services have continued and they have  continued to make valuable contributions to the most needy members of  our society.  So, Mr. Speaker, I warmly congratulate the Rotary Club of Chicago for 100  years of service, making a difference in  the  lives of  the  less  fortunate and  showing the true commitment of business  leaders to strengthen our  local  and global communities.  I wish the  club another 100 years of service and  Tuesday lunches in downtown Chicago.  f  ABORTION  CLINICS:  NOT  ONLY  KILLING MILLS BUT TORTURE  CENTERS AS WELL  ",2005
64,33,2005-01-25,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) is  recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr.  SMITH  of New  Jersey. Mr.  Speaker,  yesterday,  100,000  human  rights advocates endured the numbing  cold and snow in a great witness for  life here in our Nation’s Capital. Their  presence on behalf of those who have  no voice of their own was truly inspiring. It was gratifying beyond words to  see so many teenagers full of idealism  and  full of compassion and  love  for  their littlest brothers and sisters and  for all human life that is at risk.  Indeed, Mr. Speaker,  the  pro-life  movement is the greatest human rights  movement on Earth.  b1945  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. It is a  struggle based on unconditional love,  even for the proabortionists, unconditional empathy for the victims, both  the child and his or her mother, and  unconditional courage.  We are a movement with deep hope  and expectation, that with God’s all-  powerful grace, and through that all-  powerful grace, the culture of death  will soon be vanquished by the culture  of life, where all human life is cherished and respected. We pray for the  day when branding an unborn child as  unwanted will no longer mean a death  sentence in America.  Mr. Speaker, I have always found the  term ‘‘unwanted child’’ dehumanizing,  for it relegates a child to the status of  a commodity, an object, a thing, something that can be chosen or unchosen  at will, not unlike any other consumer  product.  Mr. Speaker, with each passing year,  the horrific toll of abortion on women’s  lives becomes more evident, and it is  time the media especially stopped censoring the truth. Women deserve better  than abortion, and the compelling stories  of  the  brave  women,  the  postabortive women who are silent no  more need to be heard. These very special women bear witness not only to  the agony and the trauma of their own  abortions, but to the hope of healing,  reconciliation and inner peace as well.  Wounded women  like Dr. Alveda  King, the niece of the late Dr. Martin  Luther King, who has had an abortion,  Jennifer O’Neill, singer Melba Moore,  civil rights activist,  like I said, Dr.  King, and  so many others, and cofounder of this group called Silent No  More Awareness Campaign, Georgette  Forney, have all called on us to listen  to their heart-wrenching stories and  take seriously our moral duty to protect women and children from the predators who ply their  lethal trade  in  abortion mills throughout the land.  These  brave women  are  the new  champions of life. They have refused to  be silent any  longer. They care too  deeply about other women and their  children, and they want others to be  spared the anguish that they themselves have endured. And to the millions of women who have aborted, they  are uniquely equipped to convey the  breathtaking love and healing and reconciliation that God provides to those  who ask. They do have a connection,  the  silentnomoreawareness.org,  if  those who might want to contact them  just go on the Web and check them out.  They are unbelievably full of compassion.  Mr. Speaker, let me also point out  that with each passing year, the child  body count from abortion in America  grows. Since the infamous decision in  1973, more than 46 million babies have  been  killed  by  dismemberment  or  chemical poisoning, a number fast approaching the total worldwide deaths  attributable to World War II; that is civilian and military deaths.  And as we have feared, Mr. Speaker,  the much touted baby pesticide, RU–  486, rushed to approval by a very biased  VerDate Aug 04 2004  05:09 Jan 26, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K25JA7.035 H25PT1 ",2005

90,68,2005-01-25,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, the President’s nomination of Dr. Condoleezza  Rice to be Secretary of State presents  the Senate with a difficult decision. Dr.  Rice will bring an impressive set of  public policy and academic credentials  to the job of Secretary of State. Her  personal story  is  inspiring. Nonetheless, Dr. Rice’s record on Iraq gives me  great concern.  In her public statements, she clearly  overstated and exaggerated the intelligence concerning Iraq before the war  in order to support the President’s decision  to  initiate military  action  against Iraq. Since the Iraq effort has  run into great difficulty, she has also  attempted to revise history as to why  we went into Iraq.  I approach this issue as the ranking  member of the Armed Services Committee and as a member of the Intelligence Committee. Both committees  have devoted a great deal of time over  the last 2 years to issues concerning  Iraq, including the Intelligence Committee  inquiry  into  prewar  intelligence.  These inquiries indicated major problems with the intelligence on Iraq and  how it was exaggerated or misused to  make the case to the American people  of  the need  to  initiate  an  attack  against Iraq. Dr. Rice is a major player  in that effort—a frequent and highly  visible public voice.  Dr. Rice is not directly responsible  for the  intelligence  failures prior to  the Iraq war. The intelligence community’s many failures are catalogued in  the 500-page report of the Senate Intelligence Committee. But Dr. Rice is responsible for her own distortions and  exaggerations of the intelligence which  was provided to her.  Here are a few of those exaggerations  and distortions.  One of the most well known was the  allegation that Iraq was trying to obtain uranium from Africa, which was  cited to demonstrate that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. But our intelligence community  did not believe it was true, and took  numerous actions to make its concerns  known—even urging the British not to  publish the allegation in September of  2002.  So how did it happen that President  Bush in his January 28, 2003, State of  the Union speech said that ‘‘The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa’’?  When the CIA saw a draft of the  President’s Cincinnati speech for October 7, 2002, it asked the White House to  delete  the allegation  that  Iraq had  been seeking uranium from Africa, and  the White House did remove the reference entirely.  On October 5, 2002, the CIA sent a  memo explaining its views to Steven  Hadley, Dr. Rice’s deputy. It sent another memo to Dr. Rice and to Mr.  Hadley on October 6, again expressing  doubt about the reports of Iraq’s attempt to get uranium from Africa.  Finally, George Tenet, the Director  of Central Intelligence himself, personally called Mr. Hadley to urge that the  uranium allegation be removed  from  the speech—which it was.  This was not just some routine staff  action or a low-level CIA analyst who  called the National Security Council.  It was a memorandum from the CIA to  Dr. Rice, and the Director of Central  Intelligence himself who  called Dr.  Rice’s deputy to make it clear what his  concerns were and to request the removal of the allegation.  Yet just 31⁄2months later the White  House put the African uranium allegation back into a draft of the State of  the Union speech. That draft made no  mention of the British. It was a reference like the one that was removed  from  the Cincinnati  speech  a  few  months before. It asserted in that draft  what purported to be the view of the  U.S. Government—that Iraq had been  trying to obtain uranium from Africa.  According to Director Tenet, shortly  before the speech was delivered, the  CIA received portions of the draft of  the State of the Union to review, including the allegation about uranium  from Africa. A senior CIA staff member  called the National Security Council  staff to repeat his concerns about the  allegation.  Instead of  removing  the  text from the speech, the National Security Council and the White House  changed the text to make reference to  the British view, suggesting, of course,  that the United States believed the  British view to be accurate.  That formula was highly deceptive.  The only reason to say the  ‘‘British  have  learned’’  that Saddam Hussein  was seeking uranium from Africa was  to create the impression that we believed it.  But our intelligence community did  not believe  it. Indeed, they had attempted to dissuade the British from  publishing  the  allegation  in  September, and  they  successfully made  several high-level  interventions with  the White House in October to have the  allegation  removed  from  the President’s Cincinnati speech. Concerning  the British report, Director Tenet said  the CIA ‘‘differed with the British on  the reliability of the uranium reporting.’’  What was the role of Dr. Rice in all  of this? I asked her in my questions for  the record whether she was aware the  intelligence  community  had  doubts  about the credibility of the reports,  and if not, how she could not know,  given all of the activity prior to the  President’s  October  7  Cincinnati  speech, including the memo to her.  In response, Dr. Rice said, ‘‘I do not  recall  reading or  receiving  the CIA  memo,’’ and  ‘‘I do not recall  Intelligence Community concerns about the  credibility of reports about Iraq’s attempts to obtain uranium from Africa  either at the time of the Cincinnati  speech  or  the State  of  the Union  speech.’’  Frankly,  I am  surprised and disappointed that the National Security  Adviser would not remember an issue  of this magnitude.  However, it was not only the President who made that allegation, Dr.  Rice made it herself in an op-ed in the  New York Times on January 23, 2003, 5  days before the State of the Union  speech, and 31⁄2months after the same  allegation had been removed from the  Cincinnati speech at the CIA’s request.  She wrote that Iraq’s declaration to  the U.N. ‘‘fails to account for or explain Iraq’s efforts to get uranium from  abroad.’’  Another question I asked Dr. Rice for  the record was whether, prior to the  January  2003  State  of  the Union  speech, she had discussed with Steven  Hadley, her Deputy, the choice of wording in that portion of the speech and  whether she was aware that the language had been changed to refer to the  British rather than stating it as the  U.S. Government’s view.  In her  response she said: Yes, I did discuss with Stephen Hadley concerns the intelligence community had about  protecting sources and methods regarding reports on Iraq’s attempts to procure uranium  from Africa. These concerns were addressed  by citing a foreign government service. I do  not recall any discussion of concerns about  the credibility of the report. However, the CIA requested on three  separate occasions that the reference  in the Cincinnati speech be removed  entirely because the CIA had doubts  about the credibility of the reports.  In Dr. Rice’s answers to my questions, while she failed to remember all  the direct interventions by the CIA to  have the uranium allegation removed  from the President’s Cincinnati speech,  including a CIA memo to her, she instead relied on a single sentence from  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:04 Jan 26, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A25JA6.007 S25PT1 ",2005

95,75,2005-01-25,Mr. BYRD.," I thank the Chair.  Mr. President, in Federalist No. 77,  Alexander Hamilton wrote: The  It will readily be comprehended, that a  man who had himself the sole disposition of  offices, would be governed much more by his  private inclinations and interests, than when  he was bound to submit the propriety of his  choice to the discussion and determination  of a different and independent body, and that  body an entire branch of the legislature. The  possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to care in proposing. Although Hamilton explains the importance of the role of the Senate in  the  appointment  of  officers  of  the  United States, neither he nor the Constitution is specific about what criteria  Senators must use to judge the qualifications of a nominee. The Constitution only requires that the Senate give  its advice and consent. It is therefore  left to Senators to use their own judgment  in considering their vote. The  factors  involved  in  such  judgments  may  vary  among  Senators,  among  nominees, and may even change in response to the needs of the times.  The position of Secretary of State is  among the most important offices for  which the Constitution requires the advice and the consent of the Senate. It  is the Secretary of State who sits at  the right hand of the President during  meetings of the President’s Cabinet.  The Secretary of State is all the more  important today, considering the enormous diplomatic challenges our country will face in the next 4 years.

100,96,2005-01-25,Mr. VOINOVICH.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to join Chairman LUGARand  other members of the Foreign Relations Committee to express my strong  support  for  the  nomination  of  Condoleezza Rice to serve as our next  Secretary of State.  Dr. Rice has the qualifications, the  educational background, and professional experience to serve as an outstanding Secretary of State. She is an  academic expert of the former Soviet  Union, earning her doctorate before the  age of 30, and rising to serve as provost  of Stanford University before turning  40. Her experience as provost at Stanford University allowed her to have  substantial management experience.  In addition to her experience in academia, Dr. Rice is an experienced professional  in  the  national  security  arena. She served as Director of Soviet  and Eastern European Affairs at the  National Security Council under the  administration of President George H.  W. Bush and most recently as the National Security Adviser to President  George W. Bush.  Dr. Rice brings a great deal of talent,  skill, and intellect to the table. As our  country continues to confront global  challenges  in  Iraq, Afghanistan, and  other parts of the world, it is essential  our Secretary of State have the stature, skill, and ability to help protect  our national security interests and promote the President’s vision of freedom  and democracy abroad that he so eloquently communicated in his inaugural  address.  This Senator from Ohio shares the  President’s vision. This vision must be  successful so our children and grandchildren are able to live in a country  free from the fear of terrorism.

101,110,2005-01-25,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to reflect on an important and  meaningful anniversary that is being  commemorated worldwide this week.  Two days from now, January 27, 2005,  will mark 60 years since the liberation  of Auschwitz, the concentration and  death camp at which over 1.1 million  innocent men, women, and children  were murdered at the hands of the  Nazis.  As many of my colleagues know, I  have long felt a very deep and personal  connection to the tragedy of the Holocaust. My father, who would later serve  two terms in this body, was the Executive Trial Counsel at the Nuremberg  trials of Nazi war criminals.  He left this country for Nuremberg  when I was only 11⁄2years old, and he  spent the next two years poring over  documents and conducting interviews  that  revealed  to him  the  shocking,  staggering process by which over 6 million people were systematically killed.  He  found himself  face to  face with  many of the men who had planned and  carried out Hitler’s ‘‘Final Solution.’’  He  found himself asking, wondering  how so many human beings many of  whom had loving families of their own,  had been educated in universities, had  enjoyed the fine arts how could they  possibly conceive and execute a mass  murder on an unimaginable scale? How  was it that only a tiny sliver of a minority in Europe stood up against a  plan to wipe out that continent’s entire Jewish population, as well as Gypsies, the disabled, and homosexuals?  And how was it that the United States  and its allies failed to act in time to  save millions of innocent lives?  When my father came home from Europe, he didn’t have answers to those  questions. Indeed, we have continued  asking these questions for the past six  decades. What my father did bring back  from Nuremberg was an unyielding and  firm  conviction  to  teach what  he  learned to as many people as he could,  beginning with the members of his own  family. From an early age, I can remember  learning  from my  father  names  of  people  like  Goebbels,  Mengele, and Eichmann, and places  like Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Treblinka.  As an Irish Catholic boy growing up  in Connecticut, my early education in  the history of the Holocaust was something of an anomaly. Fortunately, this  is no longer the case today. Yet there  are still communities, here in America,  and even more so around the world,  where far too little is known about the  Holocaust. More shockingly still, there  are those individuals and groups which  question or deny the very existence of  the Holocaust a charge that is often  interwoven with the very same poisonous anti-Semitism that led to this  human tragedy.  On this anniversary, therefore, it is  critical not only to remember those  who perished, but to redouble our efforts to enhance and increase awareness of the Holocaust. This is particularly  important  today, as each day  there remain  fewer and  fewer  living  witnesses to the Holocaust those who  themselves wore the yellow star and  still have prisoner numbers tattooed on  their arms.  In the effort to keep the memory of  the Holocaust alive, we have an invaluable resource located just a few minutes from here, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. That museum  represents a steadfast commitment by  our Nation to ensure that the Holocaust will never, ever fade away into  the mist of history. I  imagine that  most, if not all, of my colleagues have  already visited the museum. I would  certainly urge any of my colleagues  who might not have done so to visit,  and to encourage their staffs and their  constituents who visit our Nation’s  Capital to do the same.  Finally, it is crucial that on this anniversary, we take meaningful steps to  address acts of genocide in our own  time. Today, in the Darfur province of  Sudan, tens of thousands have already  died as a result of a murderous ethnic  cleansing  campaign  by  the  government-supported Janjaweed militias. It  is estimated that as many as 350,000  could die in the coming months if action is not taken. Certainly, the sheer  magnitude of the events in Darfur does  not approach that of the Holocaust. On  a  fundamental  level,  however,  the  world is facing the same choice we did  over 60 years go: do we respond to heinous crimes against humanity, or do  we ignore a growing tragedy until it is  far, far too late? This is the challenge  that confronts us today, as we commemorate the liberation of Auschwitz  and the other Nazi death camps to ensure that the cry of ‘‘never again’’ does  not ring tragically hollow.  In closing, Mr. President,  I would  like to note that in addition to the anniversary that we are commemorating  this week, today’s date marks a special  occasion in the Jewish calendar. Today  is the holiday of Tu B’Shvat, the traditional New Year for trees. It heralds  the coming of the spring, and is an occasion for celebrating renewal, transition, and hope. It is my hope that as  Americans and people around the world  reflect on the 60th anniversary of liberation, we can seize this solemn occasion to look towards the future, and to  plant new seeds of hope, tolerance, and  justice among all of humankind.

102,110,2005-01-25,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President,  the  world pauses this week to observe the  60th anniversary of an event that calls  for the deepest solemnity and reflection. In early 1945, as American and  British armies closed in on the Third  Reich from the west, Soviet forces were  on the march through Poland. On January 27, they came to a place called  Auschwitz.  In the Nazi death industry, Auschwitz was its most productive factory. It  is estimated that some one and a half  million were murdered there. The victims were Poles, Slavs, Russians, Gypsies, but the majority were Jews. They  died from disease, starvation, exposure  and exhaustion, on the gallows and in  front of the firing squads, but mostly  they were marched into the gas chambers.

 (13) the Apology Resolution acknowledges  that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii  occurred with the active participation of  agents and citizens of the United States and  further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the  United States their claims to their inherent  sovereignty as a people over their national  lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii  or through a plebiscite or referendum;  (14) the Apology Resolution expresses the  commitment of Congress and the President— (A) to acknowledge the ramifications of  the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii;  (B) to support reconciliation efforts between the United States and Native Hawaiians; and  (C) to consult with Native Hawaiians on  the reconciliation process as called for in the  Apology Resolution;  (15) despite the overthrow of the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their  separate identity as a distinct native community through cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give expression to  their rights as native people to self-determination,  self-governance,  and  economic  self-sufficiency;

104,166,2005-01-25,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, I am  proud to introduce the ‘‘Ojito Wilderness Act’’. This bill was passed in various forms by both the Senate and the  House of Representatives in the 108th  Congress. I am pleased that the senior  Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, is cosponsoring this bill.  The support for this proposal truly is  impressive. It has been  formally endorsed by the Governor of New Mexico;  the local Sandoval County Commission  and the neighboring Bernalillo County  Commission;  the  Albuquerque  City  Council; New Mexico House of Representatives Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman James  Roger Madalena; the Governors of the  Pueblos of Zia, Santa Ana, Santo Domingo, Cochiti, Tesuque, San Ildefonso,  Pojoaque, Nambe, Santa Clara, San  Juan, Sandia, Laguna, Acoma, Isleta,  Picuris, and Taos; the National Congress of American Indians; the Hopi  Tribe; The Wilderness Society; the New  Mexico Wilderness Alliance; the Coalition for New Mexico Wilderness, on behalf of more than 375 businesses and organizations; the Rio Grande Chapter of  the Sierra Club; the National Parks  Conservation Association;  the Albuquerque Convention and Visitors Bureau; 1000 Friends of New Mexico; and  numerous individuals.  The Ojito provides a unique wilderness area that is important not only to  its local stewards, but also to the nearby residents of Albuquerque and Santa  Fe, as well as visitors from across the  country. It is an outdoor geology laboratory,  offering  a  spectacular  and  unique opportunity to view from a single location the juxtaposition of the  southwestern margin  of  the Rocky  Mountains, the Colorado Plateau, and  the Rio Grande Rift, along with the  volcanic necks of the Rio Puerco Fault.  Its rugged terrain offers a rewarding  challenge to hikers, backpackers, and  photographers.  It  shelters  ancient  Puebloan ruins and an endemic endangered plant, solitude and inspiration.  Designating Ojito as a wilderness area  ensures that the beauty of this special  place will be protected and enjoyed for  years to come.  I have made a number of changes to  this bill in order clarify a number of  issues and to facilitate its enactment,  and  I hope that  it will be enacted  quickly.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of the bill I have introduced today  be printed in RECORD.

106,187,2005-01-25,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, today I  offer a resolution celebrating the December 26 election in Ukraine. I am  pleased that Ukraine has dominated  newspaper headlines and media broadcasts all over the world for the last  sixty days. In that time, extraordinary  events have occurred. A free press has  revolted against government intimidation and reasserted itself. An emerging  middle class has  found  its political  footing. A new generation has found its  hope for the future. A society has rebelled against the illegal activities of  its government. It is in our interests to  recognize and protect these advances.  I congratulate the people of Ukraine  in their undeniable quest for freedom  and democracy. Furthermore, I would  also  like  to  congratulate President  Viktor Yushchenko, who was inaugurated last Sunday, for his victory.  The December 26 election in Ukraine  was a tribute to Ukraine’s maturing  democracy and places Ukraine on a  path to join the community of European democracies. A fraudulent and illegal election would have left Ukraine  crippled. The new president would have  lacked legitimacy with the Ukrainian  people and the international community.  With the stakes so high, I commend  President Bush, his Administration,  and the international community for  providing the people of Ukraine with  the support they needed to withstand  the threats to free and fair elections.  Even in the face of repeated attempts  to end any hope of a free and fair election, I was inspired by the willingness  and courage of so many citizens of  Ukraine to demonstrate their passion  for free expression and the building of  a truly democratic Ukraine.  I am hopeful that the momentum to  foster democratic freedom around the  world will continue. In his inaugural  speech last week, President Bush stated his unequivocal support for democracy and put securing individual freedom at the forefront of America’s foreign policy. I agree with the President.  We must be prepared to play an active  role in ensuring that democracy and  basic freedoms are promoted and preserved around the world.  The future of Ukraine rests with its  leaders and its people, but the United  States and Europe must continue to  support a  foundation of democracy,  rule of law, and a market economy,  which will allow Ukraine to prosper  and reach its full potential. I urge my  colleagues to lend their support to U.S.  policy in Ukraine and ask their support  for this resolution.

107,194,2005-01-25,Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  today  to  recognize  the  lifelong accomplishments of Jack Rosenberg. Mr. Rosenberg  died January 11, 2005, at the age of 84.  A graduate of Milwaukee’s Riverside High  School, Jack Rosenberg went on to serve in  the armed forces in WWII before settling into  a long and successful business career. He led  several corporate entities, and retired in 1995  after  overseeing  the  national  franchise  of  TeleCheck for over 18 years.  Throughout his life Jack maintained a strong  commitment to improving life in the City of Milwaukee. He had a great variety of  interests  and he never hesitated to offer hands-on leadership when needed. His  concern  for  the  needs of low income families is evident in his  work with the COA Youth and Family Center.  He  received  the Grand Avenue Leadership  Award in recognition of his efforts to provide  work opportunities and cultural experiences for  people with disabilities. Several noted small  businesses benefited from a loan fund he endowed with the Wisconsin Women’s Business  Initiative Corporation.  His financial contributions to productive non-  profit organizations working  in  the areas of  arts, civil liberties, entrepreneurship, and education are too numerous to list.  It saddens me to note the passing of such  a committed and distinguished individual. I am  pleased to have this opportunity to recognize  Jack  for  these profound contributions  to so  many  individuals, as well as  the entire Milwaukee community.  f  CONGRATULATING THE ST.

109,194,2005-01-25,Mr. GRAVES.," Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause  to recognize Ryan Gary Frazer, a very special  young man who has exemplified  the  finest  qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 45, and in earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Ryan  is currently a senior at Central High School in Saint  Joseph, Missouri, and is the son of Gary and  Sandy Frazer.  Ryan began his scouting career as a Tiger  Cub Scout before advancing to Webelo Scout.  After  completing Cub Scouts, Ryan  rose  through the ranks of the Boy Scouts, achieving  the  ranks of Tenderfoot, Second Class  Scout, First Class Scout, Star Scout, Life  Scout, and now Eagle Scout. Ryan served his  troop in numerous leadership positions, including Librarian, Historian, Scribe, and Patrol  Leader. Along the way, Ryan earned 24 merit  badges  and  several  awards  including  the  Arrow of Light Award and the 50 Miler Award  on  three separate occasions  for Adventure  Trips  to Wyoming, Mississippi, and Philmont  Scout Ranch in New Mexico. Ryan is also a  member of the Tribe of Mic–O–Say, where he  holds the name ‘‘Ice Badger.’’  For his Eagle Scout project, Ryan  led a  team of volunteers  that  renovated  the children’s playground area at Ashland United  Methodist Church in Saint Joseph. The playground area is an integral part of Church life,  as it sits in the center of the Ashland United  Methodist’s courtyard; the playground is used  by children attending numerous church classes and activities. Ryan and his  team spent  over 100 hours completing this project.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  commending Ryan Gary Frazer for his accomplishments with  the Boy Scouts of America  and for his efforts put forth in achieving the  highest distinction of Eagle Scout.  FILIPINO VETERANS’ EQUITY ACT  INTRODUCTION  HON. RANDY ‘‘DUKE’’ CUNNINGHAM  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 25, 2005  ",2005
110,194,2005-01-25,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  introduce the Filipino Veterans Equity Act, bipartisan legislation which would grant full recognition of the service and sacrifices of a key  group of veterans and return to them the benefits promised  to  them by  the U.S. government.  On  July  26,  1941, President Roosevelt  issued a military order, calling members of the  Philippine Commonwealth Army into the service of  the United States Forces of  the Far  East, under the command of then Lieutenant  General Douglas MacArthur.  From 1941 to 1945, over 100,000 Filipinos  of the Philippine Commonwealth Army fought  alongside the allies to reclaim the Philippine  Islands from Japan. A second group of Filipino  veterans, the New Philippine Scouts (or ‘‘Special Philippine Scouts’’) enlisted under U.S.  Armed Forces  command  after October  6,  1945. Regrettably, instead of fulfilling promises  made and providing equal benefits  in return  for  their service, Congress enacted  the Rescission Act of 1946. The Rescission Act limited Filipino veterans’ eligibility for service-connected disability pensions, death benefits, and  other benefits provided to U.S. Armed Forces  veterans.  Correcting  this  inequity  is  long overdue.  There are  less  than 50,000 survivors of  the  total estimated 300,000 Filipino veterans who  served during World War  II. Approximately  20,000 of these survivors are not receiving the  full benefits they earned. By 2010, the VA estimates  there will only be a  total of 20,000  World War II Filipino veterans in all categories.  I urge my colleagues to join me in moving this  legislation forward in the 109th Congress, and  working with me  to provide  these deserving  veterans the benefits they deserve.  f  HONORING DONALD A.

Major General Matheson’s life-long dedication to military  service will  forever remind us of  the  importance of courage and dedication, even in trying times.  Born  in Seattle, Major General Matheson  and his  family moved  to Monterey  in 1920.  After graduating from UCLA, he was commissioned as a second  lieutenant  in  the U.S.  Army. During World War  II, Major General  Matheson participated in D–Day at Normandy,  the liberation of Holland, the storm of Hitler’s  ‘‘Eagle Nest’’ and  the defense of Bastogne.  The heroics of his unit were  forever  immortalized by historian Stephen Ambrose  in  the  1992 novel ‘‘Band of Brothers.’’  During  the Korean War, Major General  Matheson continued to play key roles in major  military operations, such as  the amphibious  landings at Inchon and Wonsan. In the Vietnam War, he commanded the 1st Brigade of  the 101st Airborne Division and participated in  the Tet Offensive. Major General Matheson  continued his military career in Korea in the  late 1960s by commanding  the 2nd  Infantry  Division along the demilitarized zone.  Mr. Speaker,  I wish  to  remember Major  General Matheson for his distinguished career.  His contribution  to our country  is  immeasurable. MG Salve H. Matheson has left a legacy of leadership and service to his community that will not soon be forgotten. While he  will be sorely missed, his life will continue to  inspire those he touched.  f  HONORING WILLIAM SAFIRE  HON. RAHM EMANUEL  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 25, 2005  ",2005
116,208,2005-01-25,Mr. EMANUEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  order to recognize the long and distinguished  career of a great writer and  thinker—and a  close and dear friend—Mr. William Safire. This  week marks the last of his columns on the Op-  Ed page of the New York Times, closing out  one of  the most  respected,  thoughtful and  longest-running series of commentaries in the  history of American media.  Bill Safire has worn many hats throughout  his career, starting out as a radio and  television producer,  then as a U.S. Army correspondent, and later as a speechwriter and  political strategist in the Nixon Administration.  Bill Safire is best known, though, for his column which  first appeared  in  the New York  Times in 1973. Even among the all-star line-  up at  the Times, Bill Safire’s  star  shines  brightly, as he stands out among the Nation’s  most celebrated and thought-provoking writers  in the newspaper business.  While we might find ourselves on opposite  sides of a policy or political debate, I have always enjoyed  reading Bill Safire’s opinions.  I’ve also looked forward to his Sunday column,  ‘‘On Language,’’ in the Times’ Magazine which  has spun off into 10 books and ranked him  among  the world’s most widely  read commentators on English grammar, etymology and  usage.  I am sure  that Bill’s wife, Helene, will be  glad to have him around more often and to  spend more time with their two children and  granddaughter. While the rest of us will miss  his words of wisdom, his  thoughtful  insight,  and the discussion prompted by his opinions,  we can still look forward to his ‘‘On Language’’  column each Sunday, and hopefully, well into  the future.  Mr. Speaker, I wish the best of luck to Bill  and  his  family  during  his  retirement  and  throughout his future endeavors, including his  ongoing written works and as chair of  the  Dana Foundation, a philanthropic organization  promoting science, health, and education, particularly  in  the area of brain  research. Bill  Safire’s voice  in America’s commentary will  not be easily replaced, and I am among the  many devoted  readers who will miss him  dearly.  f  IN HONOR OF CHARLIE J.  FABYANSKI  HON.

117,208,2005-01-25,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor Charlie J. Fabyanski for his dedicated  service  to  the  community  throughout  the  years. Mr. Fabyanski was honored at a dinner  dance for the Richard A. Rutkowski Association’s 26th anniversary gala on January 15,  2005, in Bayonne, New Jersey.  Mr. Fabyanski has  served  the Bayonne  community in a variety of capacities. For more  than ten years, he has worked as the institutional  representative  of St. Andrew’s Boy  Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Sea Scouts. He has  also graciously volunteered his  time at  the  Special Olympics  of Hudson County,  the  Windmill Center, the Highways programs, and  as an usher at church.  A  leader  in  many  organizations,  Mr.  Fabyanski has been a trustee of Hudson Milestone, president of the Hudson Ability Bowling  League, treasurer of the Bayonne Friends of  the Handicapped, secretary of St. Andrew’s  Holy Name Society, and past president of his  parish’s seniors’ group.  Mr. Fabyanski’s honorable service has extended well beyond the Bayonne community.  A veteran of World War II, he bravely served  his country as an army sergeant and fought in  the infamous battles of Normandy and St. Lo.  As a licensed state engineer, he worked for  25 years as a supervisor of air conditioning  and refrigeration at the former Military Ocean  Terminal. Mr. Fabyanski graduated  from  the  Lincoln Technical  Institute and  is  the proud  parent of two sons and two grandchildren.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Charlie J. Fabyanski for his years of  devoted  volunteerism  and  leadership. His  deep commitment to serving others is well respected and his work has positively impacted  the lives of those in his community.  IN HONOR OF MEL VERCOE  HON. SAM FARR  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 25, 2005  ",2005
118,208,2005-01-25,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor Mel J. Vercoe, who passed away on  October 6th at the age of 89. Mel’s life-long  dedication to activism and public service will  forever remind us of the importance of courage and service in our community.  Mel was a 1933 graduate of Mt. Vernon  High School in Washington State. He served  in  the United States Marine Corps during  World War II and moved to the Monterey Peninsula in 1963 with his wife Dolores and his  two children Ken and Linda.  As an architect and contractor, Mel was involved in the construction business for over 50  years. Mel was well known for his many ‘‘Letters to the Editor’’ which appeared in the Monterey Herald and other  local newspapers. A  politician at heart, Mel always gave his take  on issues to help the community.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to remember Mel for his  honorable service to our country and his contributions to our community. While he will be  sorely missed, his life will continue to inspire  those he touched.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE LATE FORMER  MAYOR VICKI COCEANO  HON. KENDRICK B.

119,208,2005-01-25,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  great sadness that I rise to pay tribute to a  truly great  lady, Mayor Vicki Coceano, who  became  the City of Miramar’s  first  female  mayor in 1989 and led the city through an unprecedented  period  of  growth.  Mayor  Coceano, who was known as the ‘‘Matriarch of  Miramar,’’ died at the age of 81. She was a  remarkable leader in many ways, a proactive  and energetic public servant and a Mayor with  an open door policy who spoke her mind on  the dais.  Mayor Coceano  first became  involved  in  politics after a hurricane damaged her back  yard in 1960 and she couldn’t find the mayor  at the time for help. She fought the city and  her developer before running for the commission in 1966, a bid she lost.  She ran again in 1977 and won. She became one of Broward County’s most recognizable and outspoken politicians during her 22  years  in public office. During her  tenure as  Miramar’s Mayor, Coceano oversaw landmark  changes as the city grew from a sleepy bedroom community with cow pastures and vast  tracts of empty land to a Broward boomtown,  home to WTVJ–NBC 6 and a host of national  companies.  Her accomplishments  included weakening  her own job, using a city manager to run the  city and raising money in the 1980s to build  the youth center that now bares her named.  Vicki Coceano, a native of  Italy,  retired as  Mayor of Miramar in 1999.  Outside of politics and family life, Coceano  worked tirelessly to help senior citizens, serving on the Board of Directors for the Broward  VerDate Aug 04 2004  06:09 Jan 26, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A25JA8.080 E25PT1 ",2005
120,215,2005-01-25,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to the  Rotary Club of Brandywine as they celebrate  their 50th anniversary  in  the State of Delaware.  While serving as the Vice President of the  Phoenix Steel Corporation, Otis Zwissler chartered the Rotary Club of Brandywine on March  8, 1955. Over its 50-year history, the Rotary  Club has raised more than $500,000 dollars to  benefit numerous service projects, both locally  and internationally. During this time, the Rotary Club has engaged in efforts to eradicate  polio, and has been  involved  in numerous  community  food drives. The Rotary Club of  Brandywine recently aided in the construction  of the Can-Do Playground, which will enable  disabled children to join with the rest of their  friends in a common play area. In addition, the  Rotary Club has hosted many well-known  guest speakers over the years, including the  former United States Secretary of Housing  and Urban Development and  first Cuban-  American ever elected  to  the United States  Senate, Senator Mel Martinez; all of the current and several previous members of  the  Delaware federal delegation; the current Governor of Delaware, as well as many previous  Governors; and the President of Rotary International.  The 46 members of  the Rotary Club of  Brandywine are part of the Delaware Eastern  Shore of Maryland Rotary District. This district  contains 2,000 Rotarians, and is one of over  31,000 worldwide  clubs  in  160  countries.  Globally, over 1.2 million people take part in  Rotary Club activities.  The Rotary Club of Brandywine’s accomplishments and service to the State of Delaware deserve  to be recognized and  I commend the club on their great efforts to support  others in our community. I look forward to the  Rotary Club of Brandywine’s continued success. Its contribution in Delaware should serve  as an example to us all.  f  H.R. 304—AIRCRAFT CARRIER END-  STRENGTH ACT  HON. ANDER CRENSHAW  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 25, 2005  ",2005
121,215,2005-01-25,Mr. CRENSHAW.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to introduce H.R. 304—the Aircraft Carrier End  Strength Act. Recently, in a last ditch effort to  reach OMB budgetary goals, the Department  of  the Defense approved drastic cuts  in  the  Navy’s Fiscal Year 2006 budget. Only one of  these cuts is both operationally unsound AND  irreversible  . . .  that  is  the reduction  in  the  Navy’s fleet of aircraft carriers from twelve to  eleven.  This decision was not made by the military  and policy experts who are now working on  the 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR).  This irreversible decision was made by budget  crunchers looking to reduce the budget topline  without considering all of the operational impacts. Congress has worked hard to re-build  our national defense architecture and now is  not the time to retreat. That is why I have introduced legislation, H.R. 304, which will ensure that the Navy maintains their current minimum requirement of twelve aircraft carriers.  Just  last year,  the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Vern Clark, stated;  ‘‘Aircraft  carrier force levels have been set at 12 ships  as a result of fiscal constraints; however, real-  world experience and analysis indicate that a  carrier  force  level of 15 ships  is necessary  . . .’’ And in 2001, then-Vice Admiral Timothy  J. Keating stated, ‘‘The United States needs  15 carriers to provide continuous combat-credible sovereign presence  in each area of responsibility. . . . The United States accepts a  risk by leaving areas of the world uncovered  at times.’’  Over  the  last  few  years, Congress has  heard a consistent message from the Department of Defense—the important tactical missions accomplished  in Afghanistan and  Iraq  would not have been possible without our fleet  of aircraft carriers. Aircraft carriers are in constant demand all over the globe and there is  no technology that will allow them to be in two  places at the same time. In the face of terrorist threats and other dangers that this nation is facing and with the proven operational  need of aircraft carriers, now is not the time  for  the Navy  to contemplate decreasing  the  number of aircraft carriers available for our national security strategy.  Please support H.R. 304—the Aircraft Carrier End-Strength Act.  VerDate Aug 04 2004  06:09 Jan 26, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A25JA8.108 E25PT1 ",2005
122,5,2005-02-03,Mrs. BOXER.," The President’s solution to Social Security is to borrow,  borrow, borrow,  throwing us deeper  into debt. I will tell you, this is not  going to happen under our watch.  I will show you one more chart very  quickly.  The plan the President has talked  about a lot results in benefit cuts of 45  percent. The average yearly payment  for a widow would only be $5,700. Who  can live on that? Certainly not those of  us here or those in the White House.  Widows would be 35-percent below the  poverty  line  if  the President’s plan  goes into effect.  We think Social Security Plus is a  place we can start. Keep Social Security  and  strengthen  it,  as Ronald  Reagan did. We can work together to  do that for our young people. I think  we can solve this problem and keep one  of the greatest programs ever known in  the history of our country.  I thank the Senator from Maryland.  ",2005
123,5,2005-02-03,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President,  I  thank the Senator from California for  her  longstanding  commitment  in  standing up for what is right in this  country, for her eloquent statement on  why we need to preserve Social Security, and for outlining what is the real  crisis in our country.  We are going to continue our debate  with the other Democratic women.  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?  ",2005

Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Michigan is in the Chamber,  a sister social worker, and actually a  person who is licensed to be a do-gooder in our country. She is one who stood  up for seniors and who spoke with such  passion on the need  for prescription  drugs. I now yield 10 minutes to her to  speak on Social Security.  ",2005
126,5,2005-02-03,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Michigan.  ,2005
127,5,2005-02-03,Ms. STABENOW.," Mr. President,  I  thank the dean of our women in the  Senate, the woman who was first and  blazed the way for all of us, the distinguished  Senator  from Maryland.  I  thank her so much for her leadership  on this and other issues.  Our dean has said so many times,  honor thy father and thy mother. They  are not just important words in the  Bible, but they are important words to  live by. This debate about Social Security certainly reflects our values  in  honoring our fathers and our mothers.  So I thank her for that.  I rise with my colleagues to speak  today about  the greatest American  success story of our time, Social Security. Prior to Social Security, 50 percent of our retirees lived in poverty.  Today, it is 10 percent. If that is not a  great American success story, I don’t  know what is.  We are here unified to say that we  want to keep that success story by  keeping the ‘‘security’’ in Social Security. That is what this is about. We  join in advocating for additional ways  for people to save. I know my 20-something-year-old  children are  tired of  hearing from me about the fact that  they need to be putting dollars aside  for the future and not just rely on Social Security.  There are ways we can come  together.  I was,  frankly, disappointed  last evening that we did not hear more  from the President about ways we can  come together to be able to develop  those opportunities  for  everyone  to  create wealth and retirement security.  But we don’t do that by undermining  the ‘‘security’’ of Social Security. Social Security represents the best of  who we are, the best in American values. Our belief is that if you work hard  and you play by the rules, you earn retirement security. We pay into that,  all of us together pay into this insurance policy called Social Security. We  deserve a basic quality of life and dignity in older years. Everyone does. And  that comes from a joint community effort called Social Security, into which  we all pay.  I think it is also important to look at  the fact that Social Security is not  just about tomorrow. It is an insurance  policy, whether you are a 25-year-old  like my daughter who is starting a career or you are a 78-year-old like my  mother, whom I can barely keep up  with, and who  is  in her retirement  years. The fact is, Social Security is  there for both of them. Heaven forbid  that something were to happen to one  of my children and they become permanently disabled. But Social Security  would be there as a disability policy.  When they have children, if something  were to happen and they would no  longer be able to care for their children, Social Security steps in as a life  insurance policy.  Think about it. This great American  success story is a retirement policy, a  life insurance policy, and a disability  policy. We all do this together. That is  what the ‘‘I’’ in FICA means. It is an  insurance system.  We want to build upon that just as  Federal employees are able to build  upon  that with  thrift  savings, and  there are others, such as 401(k)s, and so  on.  By the way, that is on top of Social  Security—not in the place of Social Security.  But we stand here today, particularly  because we know this insurance plan is  of particular importance to women in  the country. In fact, 60 percent of all  Social Security recipients are women;  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:47 Dec 28, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\S03FE5.REC S03FE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2005

129,12,2005-02-03,Mrs. DOLE.," Mr. President, we must  do everything possible  to  show our  military men and women and  their  families how much we appreciate and  honor their service. Last week I was  proud to cosponsor  legislation  introduced by Senators ALLEN, SESSIONSand  reaffirming  the  commitment of this Congress to our military  men and women and their  families.  This effort has received my strongest  support, and thanks to the endorsement of the Leadership and the work  over the past years by many of my  other colleagues, an increase in financial support to the families of men and  women killed in combat could soon be  a reality.  When a soldier pays the ultimate sacrifice, no amount of money can ease  the grief of his or her family, but a significant increase in the benefits paid to  our military families sends a strong  message of our gratitude and support.  Currently, when a service member is  killed in combat, the family receives  only $12,420. This is simply unacceptable. We are a strong, prosperous Nation, a Nation that honors and respects  our sons and daughters in the Armed  Services. We can and must do better to  provide for the families of those who’ve  lost their lives. The current proposal to  increase what is called the ‘‘death gratuity’’ to $100,000 is most certainly a  step in the right direction.  This increase, retroactive to October  2001, is critically important not only to  the families who lose loved ones, but to  soldiers currently serving or those who  are considering enlisting. It sends the  message that we value their service,  and should something happen to them,  their families will be generously cared  for.

He has the experience and  credentials to be our Attorney General.  He clearly has the confidence of the  President, and, as a general matter,  the President should be given broad  discretion in choosing his Cabinet.  Alberto Gonzales’s personal history,  as the son of  immigrant parents,  is  truly inspiring, and he would be the  first Hispanic Attorney General in our  Nation’s history.

136,40,2005-02-03,Mr. KENNEDY.," I will not take long,  but I welcome the opportunity to address this issue in the final moments  before the Senate will make an extremely important judgment.  We face a fundamental choice in the  Senate today. The nominee for Attorney General of the United States is a  good person, with an extraordinary life  story that reflects, in many ways, the  best of the American dream. If we were  voting on  that  story, Mr. Gonzales  would be confirmed in an instant.  But our vote today is not a vote on  whether he is a good person or whether  we admire and respect his life story. It  is a vote on whether his performance in  the highest reaches of our Government  has shown that he should be entrusted  with the Department of Justice. It is a  vote on whether we mean what we say  when we express our commitment to  America’s fundamental ideals, for abhorrence to torture is a fundamental  value, and the world is watching us and  watching what we do on this nomination.  Torture is an issue that cannot be  wished away. Our attitude toward torture  speaks volumes about our national conscience and our dedication to  the rule of law.  Mr. Gonzales was at the heart of the  Bush administration’s notorious decision to authorize our forces to commit  flagrant acts of torture in the interrogations of detainees  in Afghanistan,  Guantanamo, and Abu Ghraib. The war  room in the White House became the  torture room. Under this policy, our  own  agents  burned  detainees with  lighted cigarettes. They bound them  hand and foot and made them lie down  in their own urine and feces. They administered  forced enemas. They exploited our own female agents by ordering them to humiliate and degrade  their male Muslim prisoners. They terrorized prisoners with unmuzzled dogs.  How did  this  start? Where did  it  start? Who is responsible?  We do not know everything because  the administration  refuses  to  come  clean. But what we do know gives us  some clear answers. And those answers  should disqualify Mr. Gonzales from becoming Attorney General.  It started when those who wanted to  use extreme methods of coercion approached the White House and asked  for legal cover. They went to the Office  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:47 Dec 28, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\S03FE5.REC S03FE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2005

140,47,2005-02-03,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, for the  most part, this has been a substantive  debate. Actually, it has been a necessary debate. Now, partisans on the  other side of the aisle at times have  tried to smear anyone who has voiced  concern about this nomination, notwithstanding that anyone who listened  to the statements of those of us who  oppose this nomination know that each  of us has praised the journey Alberto  Gonzales and his family have taken.  I am a grandson of immigrants who  came to this country not even speaking  the language, so I have unbounded respect for all that he and his family  have accomplished. In fact, I am the  first Leahy to get a college degree; my  sister is the second. So I applaud anybody who takes such a journey.  On Tuesday, the Senate heard from  Senators FEINSTEIN, SCHUMER, KENand  STABENOW. Yesterday, the debate on  this side of the aisle included eloquent  and powerful statements by Senators  BYRD, DURBIN, JACKREED, and JEFFORDS, all stating their reasons for opposing this nomination on the merits.  No one should be accusing these Senators of doing anything except their  constitutional duty. Today, we heard  as well from Senators DODD, OBAMA,  MIKULSKI,  DAYTON,  NEDY,  CANTWELL, BINGAMAN, JOHNSON, LEVIN,  and FEINGOLD. Each has spoken from  conviction. They are voting their conscience.  We have also made time to hear from  one of our newer Democratic Senators,  Mr. SALAZARof Colorado, regarding the  assurances and commitments he has  obtained  from  the nominee and on  which he is relying in his vote. I also  note that today he returned to the Senate floor to make another important  statement  that  rejected  those who  have tried to play a divisive ethnic  card. He spoke about the true meaning  of diversity and our national journey  toward equal rights  for all. Senator  SALAZAR spoke to me before he spoke  on the floor. I commend him for what  he has done. I thank him for his remarks. It  is what I would have expected from a man of his integrity and  quality.  Senator BIDEN observed during the  confirmation hearing that none of us  came to that hearing having determined to vote against the nomination.  In fact, most of us, I would say, if not  all of us on the Democratic side of the  aisle in the Judiciary Committee came  there assuming we were going to vote  for him. We listened. We asked questions. We sought answers. We weighed  the record.  It was not an easy decision for any of  us. Each of us would have liked to have  supported the first Hispanic nominee  to be Attorney General. We each made  a decision on the merits of the nomination. We did not ignore his judgments  that contributed to the scandals in the  war against terror and the mistreatment of detainees around the world.  Some have said that some of those positions were embarrassing. They were a  lot more than embarrassing; they were  a complete scandal.  When  this  nomination  was  announced last year, many of us were inclined to support Judge Gonzales. But  as the confirmation process unfolded,  one by one, members of the Judiciary  Committee began to have doubts. Many  were troubled by the nominee’s refusal  to engage with us in an open discussion  of his views on a wide range of issues.  I was particularly concerned because  I had actually sent to him and to the  Republicans in the committee a number of the questions I was going to ask  so he would have plenty of time to prepare to answer. Instead, he did not answer.  For some, the key question was how  Judge Gonzales interprets the scope of  Executive power and his belief that the  President possesses authority to ignore  our laws when acting as Commander in  Chief. No President  of  the United  States can ignore our laws, no President of the United States is above the  law any more than any of us are above  the law. For others, the tipping point  was the nominee’s continued adherence  to flawed legal reasoning regarding torture, a stubborn commitment betraying seriously poor judgment. Finally,  and deeply troubling to many of us, is  the nominee’s  lack of  independence  from the President.  In the end, after serious consideration of the record, each of us arrived  at the same conclusion: In good conscience, we could not vote  for this  nomination.  Now, some have talked about the  legal memos he was  involved  in as  legal niceties. Well, Mr. President, torture is not a legal nicety, especially if  you are  the person being  tortured.  Those of us who have been in the military or who have had members of our  family  in  the military have always  hoped we would hold to the highest  standards so we could demand that  other countries do the same.

141,61,2005-02-03,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  today in honor of an Iowa Marine who  has fallen in service to his country in  Iraq. Marine Corporal Nathan A. Schubert, of the 1st Battalion 3rd Marine  Regiment, was killed on January 26,  2005 when his helicopter crashed during  a sandstorm near Ar Rutbah, Iraq. The  helicopter carried Corporal Schubert  and  thirty other Marines who were  part of a security mission to aid in the  safe conduct of  the national democratic elections last Sunday. He is survived  by  his  mother,  Cheryl  Winklepeck, a sister, Elizabeth Householder, and a brother, Matt. Corporal  Schubert died one day before his 23rd  birthday.  A native of Cherokee, IA, Cpl. Schubert attended Washington High School  and went on to continue his studies at  Kirkwood Community College  in the  fall of 2001. Just weeks after the terrorist attacks on September 11, Nathan  Schubert enlisted in the Marines to fulfill what he saw as his patriotic duty.  Describing Corporal Schubert  as  a  friendly, likable, and patriotic young  man, his brother noted that he ‘‘lived  life to the fullest.’’  I ask all of my colleagues in this  body and all Americans to remember  with respect, admiration, and gratitude  this courageous Marine who made the  ultimate sacrifice in the name of the  principles we value most as Americans:  freedom, democracy, and justice. Corporal Schubert died honorably while  supporting and defending these values  by aiding the birth and development of  democracy in Iraq. He is to be commended for his bravery as he joins the  honorable ranks of those Americans  who have gone before him in service of  their country. My prayers go out to  Nathan’s  family and  friends and my  greatest respect and appreciation go to  Cpl Nathan A. Schubert.  f  A STEP BACKWARDS IN NEPAL  ",2005
142,61,2005-02-03,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, earlier  this week, for the second time in less  than 3 years, King Gyanendra of Nepal  dismissed the multiparty government  and declared a state of emergency suspending  fundamental  constitutional  rights. Apparently, he will assume the  duties of the deposed Prime Minister  and appoint a new cabinet.  Throughout its troubled past, Nepal  has suffered from the neglect and often  violent and corrupt misrule of many  monarchs. For that reason, those familiar with  its history may not be  completely surprised by this unfortunate development.  Yet one would have thought that in  the 21st century, this type of thing  would, by now, be a distant memory.  At a time when a vicious Maoist insurgency is gaining ground in Nepal, it  would be hard to conceive of a worse  time for the King to repeat his past  mistake.  There is no military solution to this  conflict. Nepal is a place where, not unlike Afghanistan, a handful of extremists with  rifles  and  explosives  can  wreak havoc and easily disappear into  the rugged countryside. By terrorizing  rural villagers and exploiting the Government’s neglect of them, the Maoists  have steadily extended their reach to  large areas of the country.  The Nepalese army, while somewhat  more effective than a few years ago  when it performed little more than ceremonial duties, has likewise alienated  much of the rural population by arbitrarily arresting, disappearing and killing civilians suspected of sympathizing  with the Maoists. Today, the army,  rather than defending democracy,  is  defending the King. It is clear that the  King and the army concocted this together, despite having assured the UN  High Commissioner for Human Rights  last week that concerns about violations of human rights would be addressed.  This year, the United States plans to  provide some $40 million in economic  aid to Nepal. Much of this is channeled  by USAID  through nongovernmental  organizations. But we are also providing support to the Nepalese government, as well as training and equipment to the Army.  In  fact, several  months ago we approved the transfer of  $1 million in fiscal year 2004 military  equipment that had not initially been  appropriated for Nepal.  The Indian government, to its credit,  issued a strong statement critical of  the King’s actions. The State Department has also called for the immediate  restoration of multiparty democracy.  King Gyanendra is on notice that he  will be held responsible for infringement of the rights of free speech and  assembly, or abuses of citizens who  have defended human rights and democracy.  The State Department should also  make clear that unless democratic government and  fundamental rights are  promptly restored, the United States  will cut off aid to the government and  the army under Section 508 of the Foreign Operations Act which was designed to deter and punish this type of  act. Regardless of whether or not the  King may have acted within his authority under Nepal’s constitution, and  I do not know if he did or not, that is  not the issue. The intent of our law to  safeguard democracy is clear. The price  is losing U.S. aid. Furthermore, if the  $1 million in military equipment previously transferred has not yet been  delivered, it should be withheld.  Everyone who has followed Nepal’s  recent history would agree that its 10  year ‘‘experiment’’ with democracy has  not been easy. Democracy  is never  easy, and no one should minimize the  threat the Maoists pose. But the answer is not to undermine democracy.  The answer, as President Bush  expressed in his Inaugural Address, is to  work, with help from the international  community, to strengthen democracy.  The United States Congress would welcome that opportunity.  King Gyanendra has made a tragic  blunder. He still has time to prevent a  momentary crisis from becoming a disaster for his country and perhaps for  the monarchy itself.  f  LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT  ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005  ",2005
143,61,2005-02-03,Mr. SMITH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to speak about the need for hate  crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator KENNEDY and  I  introduce hate  crimes legislation that would add new  categories to current hate crimes law,  sending a signal that violence of any  kind  is unacceptable  in our society.  Likewise, each Congress I have come to  the floor to highlight a separate hate  crime that has occurred in our country.  In January  2005, a  teenage Texas  male was repeatedly beaten by a group  of teenage boys. The apparent motivation for this attack was the victim’s  sexual orientation—he was gay. The  attackers  punched  and  repeatedly  kicked the victim with a steel-toed  boot while yelling slurs regarding his  sexual orientation.

144,75,2005-02-03,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I rise  today with my  colleague,  Senator  BINGAMAN, to introduce legislation to  address a serious problem in the State  of New Mexico. State case  law currently holds that the State of New  Mexico does not have jurisdiction to  prosecute crimes that occur on privately held  land within the exterior  boundaries of a Pueblo. Federal case  law holds that the Federal Government  does not have jurisdiction to prosecute  crimes that occur on these lands. Read  in tandem, these court decisions lead  to  the  result  that neither Federal,  State nor tribal law-enforcement officials have jurisdiction on thousands of  acres of privately owned lands within  the boundaries of Indian pueblos. As a  result, in recent years there have been  stabbings,  criminal  sexual-contact  cases, and aggravated battery charges  that have stalled in court over jurisdiction questions.  The prospect of having lands in my  State where anyone can commit any  crime and not be prosecuted for it is  untenable and something that needs to  be fixed. The legislation I am introducing today clearly outlines who is responsible  for  trying  these cases by  clarifying when a crime should be prosecuted  in Federal,  tribal, or State  court. At the same time, the bill honors tribal sovereignty.  If we do not address this problem, it  will only worsen. This legislation culminates a lot of work among the New  Mexico delegation, the pueblos, and the  State. It is a necessary bill. It is a good  bill. And I hope that my colleagues will  act quickly to clarify jurisdiction over  these lands.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 279  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

147,6,2005-02-14,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. President, in considering the nomination of  Mr. Chertoff, I want to share with the  Senate a conversation I had with him  last week. It was about an issue that  has plagued my State of Florida since  last August, since we were hit by four  hurricanes in a row within a 6-week period. That  is  enough  that anybody  should have to endure.  FEMA, which will be under the leadership of the new Secretary, once confirmed, responded and did an admirable  job to begin with. But since then, we  have had some problems. You heard me  speak about them almost ad infinitum  over the course of the session in September and October, and then again  when we came back after the election  in our special session. Congress stepped  up and appropriated  $13.6 billion  in  emergency  funding  for  that natural  disaster series. I thank our colleagues  for moving so quickly to address the  needs of the people in Florida especially but the other States that were  affected as well.  I applaud the quick response, the coordination of the relief agencies, including FEMA, in the immediate aftermath of those four storms. In Congress  we specifically directed that $8.5 billion of that money was going straight  to FEMA to help hurricane victims.  Well,  I wish  I  could  report  that  things are going smoothly. I cannot. I  spoke with Judge Chertoff about these  issues. I also spoke with FEMA Director Mike Brown  in a meeting with  other members of the Florida delegation.  Boiled down, we have two big issues:  The very slow, if any, reimbursement  for debris removal off of private rights  of way; and then a second issue, that  money was being poured  into areas  that did not have hurricane velocity  winds, while for the places that got hit  the hardest, it is so very difficult for  them to get the funds they need, and  now those counties and cities are having to pay themselves without FEMA  reimbursement.  I hear on a daily basis from communities across our State that are having  problems getting reimbursed for debris  removal. Some of these counties and  cities have even had to borrow money  to go out and pay their bills while they  are waiting for FEMA reimbursement.  I will give you an example. Lake  County, to the northwest of Orlando,  submitted a $17 million bill for reimbursement months ago. Do you know  how much they have received thus far?  Three thousand dollars. There is no excuse for that. Plus, these counties that  are begging, pleading, guess who they  are coming to. They are coming to  their handy-dandy Senator. They are  begging and pleading for consistent information.  I will give you an example. Santa  Rosa County reports they submitted a  request for $27 million in October. They  have seen no reimbursement, and they  are  receiving mixed  signals  from  FEMA as to what further information  they may have to submit in order to  get their application finally processed.  I will give you another  example:  Charlotte County. Charlotte County is  down on the southwest coast of Florida. It is where the first monster hit.  Charley hit with full force, with winds  of 145 miles an hour, right off the  water. It came right off the Gulf of  Mexico, up Charlotte Bay, and hit  Punta Gorda in Charlotte County. The  county officials have stated that one  day a FEMA official will declare some  piles of debris eligible for reimbursement and the next day a different inspector will look at it and declare it is  ineligible for reimbursement. This has  to stop.  I will give you another  example.  Escambia County has received some relief but Pensacola, which is the main  city in Escambia County, has not.

148,34,2005-02-14,Mr. HAGEL.," Mr. President, I rise to  honor the life of Frederick Douglass as  we celebrate his 187th birthday this  month. Frederick Douglass was  an  American who devoted his life to enacting permanent and positive change  for all Americans by advocating the  abolition of slavery and equal rights  for women.  Born into slavery in 1818 and abandoned by his mother, Frederick Douglass rose above a debilitating situation  to become one of America’s greatest  abolitionists and orators. He escaped  slavery when he was 20 years old by  disguising himself  as  a  sailor. Mr.  Douglass traveled north and settled in  New Bedford, MA where he discovered  the profound impact his oratory and  literary talents had on others.  Always believing in himself and taking advantage of every opportunity he  could, Frederick Douglass set an example for all Americans by working toward  a  greater  purpose  and  racial  equality. He became a respected advisor to President Lincoln, he traveled  extensively in Europe to speak about  his experience in America, and he inspired those he encountered to fight for  better lives for African Americans and  women. We are grateful for Frederick  Douglass’ life and work.  f  PITTSBURGH STEELERS AND  PHILADELPHIA EAGLES  ",2005
149,34,2005-02-14,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President, football is a staple in our communities—  bringing families and friends together  and helping to build connections and  affiliations. Fantasy football has taken  the game one step further and individuals can now draft their own team and  compete weekly for the championship.  Fans live and die with their team—  they  sport  their  colors,  sing  their  chants, and collect team memorabilia.  Personally, I have a Pittsburgh Steelers’ ‘‘Terrible Towel’’ behind my desk.  Most significantly, football gives us a  chance to be a part of something bigger  than ourselves.  To that end, I was proud to be a  Pennsylvanian this football season and  to join with others to cheer on the  Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia  Eagles. Both teams had an outstanding  season and did not let their fans down.  The Pittsburgh Steelers, my hometown team, had an incredible season.  This was a historic year for the Black  and Gold having secured the most wins  in Steelers history, the most wins by a  rookie quarterback, and  the  largest  home attendance for a Steelers season.  They also made an appearance in the  AFC championship game.  The Eagles had quite an impressive  year as well, capturing the NFC Championship  and  playing  in  the Super  Bowl.  A day before the big game, Eagles  head coach Andy Reid shared his feelings on being a part of the Super Bowl:  ‘‘This is what it is all about. You want  your football team to have an opportunity  to play  in  the Super Bowl.  You’re here and you’re ready to go. I  think every head coach has that goal.  We’re lucky enough for it to be a reality.’’  The Super Bowl is the pinnacle of  every football season, and it is impressive that the Eagles made it that far.  As I watched the game, it was remarkable to hear the chants of thousands of  Eagles fans in Jacksonville shouting,  ‘‘Fly Eagles Fly’’  and witness  the  amount of support for the Philadelphia  team.  The Eagles had an outstanding Super  Bowl game, and despite the outcome of  the game, should be proud of their efforts. I join the thousands of Eagles  fans and Pennsylvanians in saying that  I was proud to have the Eagles representing Pennsylvania  in the Super  Bowl for the first time since 1981.  What a tremendous season it was to  have both Pennsylvania teams make it  to their respective conference championships. The spirit and enthusiasm of  the fans and the determination of the  players on the field this season was an  incredible sight to behold. I look forward to next season, when both teams  have another chance to represent their  respective Pennsylvania cities and win  big for their fans.  f  LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT  OF 2005  ",2005

The  nature  of  the  wounds suggests that the motive behind the murder was the fact that the  victim was gay.  I believe that the Government’s first  duty is to defend its citizens, to defend  them against the harms that come out  of hate. The Local Law Enforcement  Enhancement Act is a symbol that can  become substance. I believe that by  passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and  minds as well.  f  TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN FRANK A.  MANSON, 1920–2005  ",2005
151,34,2005-02-14,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  commemorate  the  life  of  CAPT Frank Albert Manson, an outstanding Virginian who  served  his  country with valor during World War II  and the Korean War. While Captain  Manson passed from this earth on January 20, he has left an exceptional legacy through his humanitarian vision,  his insightful observation of naval conflict, and especially in the hearts of his  loving wife, three children, and ten  grandchildren. His daughter Jennifer  Joy Wilson was a longtime member of  my staff and remains a valued advisor.  Born  in Oklahoma  in  1920, Frank  Manson earned a bachelor of science in  education  from Northeastern Oklahoma State University  in 1941. Following 2 years of teaching at the high-  school level, he attended officer candidate school at Cornell University and  gained his commission for the United  States Navy.  Like many other brave young men  who answered the call of duty in World  War II, then-Lieutenant Manson was  sent to combat in the Pacific Theater.  Appointed as the communications officer on the USS Laffey DD724, he was responsible for providing the media with  the detailed accounts that followed the  Laffey’s triumphant efforts of April 16,  1945. On that fateful day, the ship and  its resilient crew outlasted an attack  of at least twenty-two Japanese aircraft, the worst offensive endured by  any United States ship that remained  afloat. While bombs strafed its deck  and as many as eight planes crashed  into  the  ship,  the Laffey  responded  with courage befitting an American  vessel. Eight planes were shot down,  and another six were harmed despite  the extensive damage inflicted by the  enemy  forces upon  ‘‘the  ship  that  would not die.’’ During his briefing  with reporters covering the war, the  young officer recounted the infamous  words of the Laffey’s commanding officer, LCDR Julius T.

152,41,2005-02-14,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, over the  past several years, among the most  challenging issues for this Congress has  been reform of the Nation’s energy policy.  Despite rising fuel costs and growing  dependence on  imported oil, despite  evidence of global warming and concerns about the quality of our air and  water, despite all the recent advances  in  renewable energy  technology, we  hobble along on an energy policy that  is more than a decade out of date.  Fortunately, there are several initiatives in energy policy on which there is  wide bipartisan support.  Perhaps the best example of an idea  on which there is solid agreement is  the importance of developing our hydrogen economy.  Hydrogen has the potential to transform completely the way we think of  transportation, with vehicles that consume no foreign oil, spew no smog, no  toxic emissions, and zero greenhouse  gases. But only if we make it the right  way.  You see, to get energy out of hydrogen, first you have to make it. And the  way we make it is going to make all  the difference to our energy future.  Right now, the main way we make  hydrogen is from natural gas.  Natural gas is a clean-burning fuel,  but its price is volatile. And as a fossil  fuel, it is a finite resource and releases  carbon dioxide and other greenhouse  gases when burned.  Ultimately, we hope to form hydrogen  from pollution-free water, using  wind or solar energy to extract the hydrogen—the H2—from the H2O. But this  technology  is still too expensive to  make a significant contribution to our  energy needs today.  Thanks to research at some of the  country’s leading institutions, including those in my state of Iowa, a cost-effective technology is now available to  produce hydrogen from another clean,  renewable energy source: one that we  grow right here at home.  Hydrogen can now be formed from  ethanol made entirely from corn and  other  agricultural  products  grown  right here on American farms.  Ethanol is an increasingly important  source of fuel. It is made from corn and  other agricultural products from farms  throughout the Midwest and increasingly in other parts of the country. It  is manufactured  in plants  scattered  across rural America, and has become  one of the most important value-added  enterprises for our rural economies.  Today, ethanol is made from corn, as  well as from crop residues, stalks, and  other low-cost biomass.  By blending  ethanol  into  conventional gasoline we reduce our dependence  on  foreign  oil,  support  rural  economies, and make a cleaner-burning  fuel. But even blended fuel produces  some pollution, and we still depend on  imported oil for the gasoline component.  A vital next step is to begin using  ethanol to make hydrogen. Hydrogen  from ethanol produces little in the way  of pollution. Whatever carbon dioxide  is released gets absorbed by next year’s  crop as it grows; and it’s possibly the  most economical way to make renewable hydrogen for the foreseeable future.  Imagine  hydrogen  ‘‘Made  in  the  USA’’ from crops ‘‘Grown in the USA’’  with generating facilities in rural communities in desperate need of jobs and  economic growth.  So why aren’t all of our cars being  converted to run on renewable farm-  based hydrogen? As we all know, the  fuel cells needed to convert that hydrogen efficiently into usable energy are  still years  from being commercially  ready.  However, hydrogen-powered internal  combustion  hybrid  electric  engines  have been developed that can achieve  over 90 percent of the environmental  benefits and 100 percent of the reduced  oil import benefits of fuel cells, and  this technology is ready for demonstration right now.  American businesses are  ready  to  show the world that hydrogen can be  produced  from clean,  farm-based renewable sources, and that renewable  hydrogen can be used as a fuel for our  cars and trucks.  As we debate the bigger picture of  our Nation’s energy policy, we have the  opportunity to make a small investment with huge potential.  Now is the time for a renewable hydrogen  transportation demonstration  program.  I am introducing the Renewable Hydrogen Passenger Vehicle Act of 2005 to  provide a testing ground for renewable  farm-based  hydrogen  transportation  technology. We need to get renewable  hydrogen production out into fueling  stations, where it can be put through  its paces, analyzed and improved for  the day when fuel cells arrive, so we  can supply our fuel cells with clean, renewable hydrogen right from day one.  This bill would authorize $5 million  over three years to develop and demonstrate the cost-effective operation of  a  small  hydrogen-from-ethanol  reformer and a fleet of at least 10 internal combustion hybrid electric vehicles  converted to run on that hydrogen.  The program would allow investors,  manufacturers  and  entrepreneurs  to  see first-hand that clean renewable hydrogen can be cost-effectively produced  from farm-based fuels; that the technology to run our vehicles on renewable hydrogen is here and ready to deploy; and that renewable hydrogen is  ready for the day that fuel cell vehicles  arrive in local showrooms.  The  successful  demonstration will  help stimulate development of hydrogen fueling systems at existing gasoline fueling stations to convert ethanol  to hydrogen onsite,  thereby  significantly accelerating  the adoption of  super-clean domestic renewable hydrogen as an alternative to gasoline made  from imported oil.  It includes monitoring of emissions  and fuel economy data, quick start-up  and rapid deployment—all for a tiny  fraction of the funds already being invested in fuel cell research.  This is not a large or costly initiative, but it is one that has the potential to take us a big step towards a  clean, renewable hydrogen-based economy. I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—  (1) reductions in local air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil imports resulting from the introduction of vehicles with  gasoline-powered internal combustion hybrid  electric engines will be only temporary, as  improved fuel economy of the hybrid vehicles is offset by increases in vehicle miles  traveled;  (2) direct substitution of farm-based renewable fuels for gasoline in gasoline-powered  internal combustion hybrid electric engines  will result in further reductions in local air  pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil  imports;  (3)  for permanent reductions  in criteria  pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil  imports, Congress should establish as a national goal the development of renewable hydrogen as a clean effective energy carrier;  (4) the development of vehicles powered by  hydrogen derived from domestic renewable  resources such as ethanol, energy crops, agricultural waste, landfill gas, municipal solid  waste, wind power, and  solar electricity,  will—  (A) substantially and permanently reduce  local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions;  (B)  improve the energy security of the  United States; and  (C) create domestic jobs;  (5) notwithstanding paragraph (4), as of the  date of enactment of this Act, the fuel cell  technology required to make the most efficient use of renewable hydrogen is too costly  and has not achieved the reliability necessary for consumer acceptance in the near  term;  (6) in the near term (before affordable and  reliable fuel cell vehicles are developed), hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine  hybrid electric vehicles have been developed  that can achieve more than 90 percent of the  environmental benefits and 100 percent of  the oil import reduction benefits of fuel cell  vehicles;  (7) in addition to robust research and development for fuel cell vehicles, a program  to develop and demonstrate renewable hydrogen production and distribution  technology is justified;  (8) reforming ethanol at a vehicle fueling  station may be the least costly method of  producing renewable hydrogen;  (9) a low cost renewable hydrogen vehicle  demonstration program that will yield valuable information regarding an interim transition strategy of using hydrogen-powered  internal combustion engine hybrid electric  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:58 Jan 08, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\S14FE5.REC S14FE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005
153,55,2005-02-14,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today because February brings to mind a time  of year dedicated  to hearts  in  the  form of  chocolates,  cards,  candies  and  sweet  mementoes. Very little attention, however, is  given to the health and the condition of the actual heart these candies and mementoes symbolize: the human heart of a loved one. It is  imperative that we pause during this season to  recognize the importance of cardiac health in  our children, families, and loved ones.  There are nearly one million adults and children  living with Congenital Heart Defects  (CHD)  in  the United States alone, and his  number continues  to  rise as nearly 40,000  children are diagnosed each year. Despite  these figures, very little recognition is given to  the victims and families of those suffering from  CHD. Many of the children born with CHD are  not diagnosed until days or even months after  birth. This lack of detection endangers those  who live without knowledge of their illness.  Among the many infants affected, the symptoms drastically range in severity and medical  costs. Some children are barely affected by  their defect, requiring nothing more than occasional monitoring. However,  there are also  families placed under the heavy emotional and  financial burden of a severe heart defect that  requires lifelong medical attention. The cost of  multiple  open  heart  surgeries,  drugs,  and  raised insurance premiums becomes a special  problem for low income families. Numerous organizations provide these families with support  and financial aid to protect their loved ones,  but these groups are only able to help a small  percentage of people due to the lack of national recognition of CHD.  Raising a national consciousness about the  defects and their effects will provide hope and  comfort  for  those who have struggled with  heart defects.  Jeanne  Imperati,  the  loving  mother of a child with a heart defect, had the  foresight in 1999 to begin a campaign focused  on spreading awareness through a Congenital  Heart Defects Awareness Day on February  14. On a day already dedicated to hearts, it is  a simple and meaningful endeavor to remind  the nation of this worthwhile cause. More attention can be given to the regularity of the  defects and  research about  their possible  cause. Creating a network of informed people  throughout the nation is a simple way to provide support for survivors and their families.  While we go about the tradition of honoring  loved ones this Valentine’s Day, let’s also give  our support  to  those affected by Congenital  Heart Defects and their cause. Awareness is  the  first step  toward saving  lives and protecting those whom we love.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

155,55,2005-02-14,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, as our Nation honors and supports  the ongoing efforts of our  troops in Iraq and prays for the safety of all of  our uniformed men and women still  in  the  Gulf, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, now is also  an opportune time for Congress to do more to  help our Nation’s new and old veterans  in  need. To this end, I am joined by my distinguished colleague, U.S. Representative HENRY  BROWN, in introducing bipartisan legislation to  urge the establishment of a ‘‘National Hire-A-  Veteran Week.’’ Our legislation also urges a  presidential proclamation calling upon employers, labor organizations, veterans’ service organizations, and Federal, State, and local governmental agencies to employ more veterans.  In spite of the best efforts of the U.S. Departments of Defense, Labor, and Veterans  Affairs, imposing barriers continue to impede  many deserving veterans  from securing employment and achieving self-sufficiency. Just  this week, I read a disturbing article by Alexandra Marks  that appeared  in  the Christian  Science Monitor and  is entitled  ‘‘Back From  Iraq—And Suddenly Out On The Streets.’’ It  should alert all of us to the grim reality that  veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts  are now showing up in our Nation’s homeless  shelters. I submit this article for entry into the  CONGRESSIONALRECORDat the conclusion of  my statement.  Sadly, many veterans struggle to find jobs,  even with some opportunities  for  increased  training and education offered through government programs. Little more  than half of our  Nation’s veterans are employed today According to the 2000 census, for example, nearly 20  percent of Gulf War veterans are unemployed.  Moreover, it is troubling and shameful that  so many of our veterans who risked their own  lives in support of our country can’t find jobs  and must endure homelessness and lives of  poverty after they return home. Indeed, American veterans comprise one-third of the homeless male population in America; while an estimated  250,000  veterans  live  on  our  city  streets. In fact, the number of homeless Vietnam War veterans today exceeds the number  of service persons who died during that war.  Mr. Speaker, even as we tend to the well-  being of our men and women currently on active duty, we cannot forget those who have already served their country and deserve more  assistance in moving to the next phase of their  civilian  lives. A presidential proclamation of  ‘‘National Hire-A-Veteran Week’’ would provide  an effective and more focused way to do more  to help all of our veterans find good jobs and  ensure better living standards for themselves  and their families. I hope that all of my colleagues will support  this  legislation and will  take one more step to help repay the debt we  owe  to all of our Nation’s defenders.  I also  hope it can be promptly enacted and signed  into law during this session of Congress.  [From the Christian Science Monitor, Feb. 8,  2005]  BACKFROMIRAQ—ANDSUDDENLYOUTON  THESTREETS  (By Alexandra Marks)  NEWYORK.—Veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts are now showing up in  the nation’s homeless shelters.  While the numbers are still small, they’re  steadily rising, and raising alarms in both  the homeless and veterans’ communities.  The concern  is that these returning veterans—some of whom can’t find jobs after  leaving the military, others of whom are  still  struggling  psychologically with  the  war—may be just the beginning of an influx  of new veterans in need. Currently, there are  150,000 troops in Iraq and 16,000 in Afghanistan. More than 130,000 have already served  and returned home.  So far, dozens of them, like Herold Noel, a  married father of three, have found themselves sleeping on the streets, on friends’  couches, or in their cars within weeks of returning home. Two years ago, Black Veterans for Social Justice (BVSJ) in the borough of Brooklyn, saw only a handful of recent returnees. Now the group is aiding more  than 100 Iraq veterans, 30 of whom are homeless.  ‘‘It’s horrible to put your life on the line  and then come back home to nothing, that’s  what I came home to: nothing. I didn’t know  where to go or where to turn,’’ says Mr. Noel.  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:11 Feb 15, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A14FE8.009 E14PT1 ",2005
156,55,2005-02-28,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, in my  capacity as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  I am pleased to  join my distinguished colleague from  Vermont, the ranking member, in beginning the debate on this very important legislation.  At the outset, I congratulate Senator  for the work he has done  over the past decade, and also former  chairman, Senator HATCH, for the outstanding job he has done. I thank Senator HATCHespecially for filling in for  me a week ago Thursday on the executive session when the committee took  up the bill and reported it to the Senate.  I thank both Republicans and Democrats on the committee for withholding  amendments until the floor.  We had one very extensive hearing. I  know there was an interest in having  more hearings, but the reality is this  issue has been debated and has been  heard. There is a very comprehensive  idea on both sides as to the underlying  merits of the bill.  It is important to note that going  back to the 105th Congress the Senate  passed a similar bill by a vote of 97 to  1, and subsequently voted to proceed to  conference by a vote of 94 to 2. The  Senate again took up a similar bill in  the 106th Congress and passed legislation again by a wide margin, 83 to 14.  The House also passed legislation during the 106th Congress, but President  Clinton resorted to a pocket veto, so  the bill was not enacted. The Senate  took up the bill again in the 107th Congress  but never  reached  agreement  with the House on certain language. So  here we are today with reform legislation that seeks to protect the interests  of the debtors, honest Americans, who  need relief from bankruptcy, and still  address those who take advantage of  the bankruptcy laws.  Bankruptcy is obviously a necessary  tool  for many people who  find they  simply are not able  to  repay  their  debts.  Indeed,  the vast majority of  bankruptcy  filers have nothing with  which to pay their creditors. They file  for bankruptcy as a last resort. And for  them bankruptcy will continue to provide a fresh start.  Unfortunately, at  the  same  time,  there are some who use bankruptcy as  a means of avoiding debts they have  the ability to pay. Some bankruptcy  filers have the ability to pay a significant portion of their debts, but the current bankruptcy  system, which presumes that most people are acting honestly, does not require them to do so.  At a recent Judiciary Committee hearing on the bill, the expert testimony  was that up to 10 percent of people who  file for bankruptcy have the ability to  pay for at least part of their debts.  The consequence of having people  avoid their debts when they can pay for  them has resulted in having these obligations absorbed by other people in the  commercial system. The estimate  is  that there are some $44 billion in debts  discharged annually. There has been an  enormous increase in the filings. In recent years, annual bankruptcy filings  have exceeded 1.6 million for the first  time in history. They more than doubled  in the 1980s and again doubled  from 1990 to the year 2003.  This  legislation  is  an  effort  to  achieve some balance, balance to see to  it  that  people who genuinely need  bankruptcy and cannot pay their debts  are able to get the relief  in bankruptcy, and at the same time looking  at many practices which are in need of  reform.  For example, this legislation will require high-income debtors who have  the ability to repay some of their debts  to do so. The heart of this bill is a  means test. It requires the bankruptcy  trustee to examine the income and expenses of high-income debtors and determine whether they have the ability  to pay something toward their debts. If  so, they must complete a chapter 13 reorganization plan, which requires that  they repay part of their debts over  time before they can have the rest discharged.  The legislation will also bring to an  end other abuses that occur under the  current bankruptcy system. For example, it closes the ‘‘mansion loophole,’’  which allows opportunistic debtors to  avoid paying their creditors by buying  a house in a State with an unlimited or  extremely generous homestead exemption, and then declaring bankruptcy. It  extends the statute of limitations for  fraudulent use of the homestead exemption to 10 years.  Another provision prevents debtors  from purchasing large amounts of luxury goods on credit and then filing for  bankruptcy  to have  that  debt  discharged. Other provisions will discourage debtors from repeatedly filing for  bankruptcy,  and  then  invoking  the  automatic stay to avoid repaying their  creditors.  The legislation also aims at ensuring  that debtors cannot escape their spousal and child support obligations by filing for bankruptcy. That is, of course,  a very important item, with dodging  child support and spousal support being  a matter of an enormous problem nationwide. Chapter  13 debtors cannot  have a repayment plan approved or  their debts discharged until they are  current on their spousal and child support obligations.  The legislation will further improve  the bankruptcy process for small businesses and enhance bankruptcy protections for family farmers as well as family  fishermen. Small businesses that  can restructure will still be able to obtain a  fresh start. However,  for the  many small businesses that will never  survive a protracted bankruptcy, the  bill  imposes deadlines to keep cases  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:42 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S28FE5.REC S28FE5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005
157,3,2005-03-10,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I very much appreciate my colleague from California yielding me a  moment. DORISknows that Bob and I  were very, very dear friends. We came  to the Congress together. At that time  we talked a lot about our hometown,  for the Matsui family knows that Arlene and I consider in many ways Sacramento to be really our second home.  It was our privilege to spend a decade  there working in the legislature on behalf of public affairs; and the reputation of the Matsui family went well  ahead of their service here. Bob served  as a member of the board of supervisors  and was a fabulous local leader.  In turn, his tragic loss was a shock to  all of us, but clearly the voice expressed by that vote by the people in  that district that surrounds and  includes Sacramento is a reflection of  the fact that their people know and  deeply believe that DORIS is the person  to reflect the view and the future that  Bob would have for the country.  DORIS, I want you to know that we do  not just welcome you to the family  today but it is very important for you  and I to know that we will continue to  work together on behalf of California  and our  second home; and,  indeed,  there are wonderful things as well as  great things in the future that need to  be done.  So welcome, God bless you, Godspeed.  ",2005

MATSUI  (Ms. MATSUI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2005
159,3,2005-03-10,Ms. MATSUI.,"  Speaker  Leader PELOSI, Chairman LEWIS and  Mr. STARK, thank you very much and  all  the  distinguished Members  and  friends here  for welcoming me here  today.  As I look around this Chamber, I see  so many of you who have been my  friends throughout these years. And  now today I have the honor of calling  you my colleagues. The last time I was  here in this Chamber was December 23.  Obviously, the House was out of session  then. But Bob was so excited because  he was going to bring Anna on the floor  to witness his swearing in for his 14th  term. So that morning of the 23rd we  decided to do a practice run, and we  brought Anna here on the floor of this  awe-inspiring Chamber to get her used  to it. After that, we went back to his  office and we just happened to take a  picture of Anna sitting on her grandfather’s  lap behind a desk with the  Capitol behind. The next day, Bob fell  ill and was hospitalized. And he tried  so hard to get well, because he wanted  to be here with his colleagues and with  Anna.  As you all know, he loved this body.  He loved coming to work here. And he  loved all of you. But he did not win  that battle. In the days since, I spent a  lot of time talking with the people of  Sacramento, and I have come to appreciate even more what Bob maintained  all along,  that his  commitment  to  equality, his dedication  to ensuring  dignity to the elderly, his work to  make Sacramento even a better place  to live and work and to raise a family,  and his driving desire to make America  stronger  for each successive generation, those things were not about him  at all. They were about us. They were  about our future.  And so I take this oath today with a  heart both heavy and hopeful that we  can all work together to build that better future. The challenges facing the  people of Sacramento did not end with  my husband’s service. I know that Bob  made all of you aware, in some cases  painfully aware, how  important  the  issue of flood control is to Sacramento.  For many, many years, probably a couple of decades, my husband bent your  ears on that. You will not be surprised  to hear that that pain in your ear is  not going to go away until we get it  done.  This is truly the people’s House, and  that is why Bob loved it so. And I realize as I was talking and listening to the  people of Sacramento how important it  is to connect with the people. As I was  talking with  them  in  the  grocery  stores and the coffee shops, at the service stations, I heard from many people.  Bob’s high school teacher came up to  me one day and said, DORIS, please,  please make sure that Social Security  is secure. I ran into a young mother at  the grocery store who stopped me as I  was picking up a can of peas and said,  Mrs. MATSUI, I lost my husband a year  ago, and I need those Social Security  benefits for my son and myself.  When I was in a coffee shop, a young  man rolled over to me and said, Mrs.  MATSUI, I really need those disability  benefits, because I don’t want to have  to depend on my parents. I talked to  the hardware store owner and I  listened really hard because he wants to  provide health care benefits for his employees, but finds it to be very difficult.  Social Security, health care, the war  in Iraq, these are all local issues. We  happen to talk about them here, but  they are all local issues. And on these  issues and so many more, I look forward to working with all of you to find  common ground and achieve common  good.  I mentioned  earlier  the photo of  Anna sitting on her grandfather’s lap.  One of our other family treasures is a  photo of Brian here at age 6 witnessing  his father’s first swearing in. He sat  right there. He is sitting there now. He  is sitting there with his own daughter,  Anna. Seeing him  there and  seeing  Anna is a reminder that despite tragedy and heartbreak, life indeed does go  on. And I know that somewhere Bob is  looking down and  smiling, knowing  that Anna was here on the floor having  watched her grandmother being sworn  in.  Life does go on. And so it is with  Bob’s example and Anna’s inspiration  of  future generations and with  the  hopes and dreams of the people of Sacramento, I take this honor and I have  taken this oath to join you today as a  colleague. And I truly, truly appreciate  being here.  Thank you so very much.  f  PERMISSION FOR COMMITTEE ON  APPROPRIATIONS  TO  HAVE  UNTIL  MIDNIGHT,  FRIDAY,  MARCH 11, 2005, TO FILE PRIVILEGED REPORT ON EMERGENCY  SUPPLEMENTAL  APPROPRIATIONS BILL, 2005  ",2005

168,10,2005-03-10,Mr. PASCRELL.," Mr. Speaker, in a  letter that went from Suzanne Novak  on behalf of the Brennan Center for  Justice at NYU to the gentleman from  Alaska  (Mr. YOUNG),  the  honorary  chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. OBERSTAR), ranking member, she wrote in  that letter in support of the Federal  Government  supporting  States  and  being very specific about the bidding  laws in contracting to respond to the  collusion or the possibilities of collusion that have existed, I can assure my  colleagues, not only in the State of  New Jersey.  She wrote this: ‘‘Several recent scandals regarding government contracting  in New Jersey prompted New Jersey to  establish a criterion of responsibility  for government contracting which prohibited  the State  from  contracting  with an entity that has contributed to  a candidate for or holder of the office  of Governor, or to any State or county  political party committee, within certain time frames. The executive ‘‘order  of  the Governor’’  ‘‘explicitly  stated  that ‘the growing infusion of funds donated by business entities into the political process at all level of government has generated widespread cynicism among the public that special interest groups are ‘‘buying’’ favors from  elected officeholders.’’’  Mr. Speaker, the courts have recognized that contributions from government contractors present a severe risk  of engendering corruption, the appearance of corruption and, thus, have generally upheld pay-to-play contribution  bans, and this is what this amendment  is all about. It is a bipartisan amendment to reform government, to help  government clean up its act. We have  similar  laws on  the Federal books  about  contracting  and  bidding. We  want to remove cynicism from the public about when the government does  business that there is proper conditions  that will be implemented to make sure  that it is done according to the law.  Blount v. the SEC was a perfect example. The Securities and Exchange  Commission made it very clear that if  you were going to do some bonding  work, that if you give a political contribution  to  the  entity  beforehand,  that is rather suspect. So let us remove  that possibility. There is no doubt, if  we do not allow the States to do what  the Federal Government has on the  books, how are we going to  justify  that?  This is a win-win situation. Neither  party is the source of corruption and  neither party is privy to virtue; let us  accept that. Let us also accept that  this is a bipartisan amendment, introduced in good faith, so that each of the  parties, if you will, look good. Not only  talk the talk but take that extra step  to clean up their own acts. How can we  in this House not permit or allow each  of the States to provide  for cleaner  governments?  This is reality. The Federal law, the  court cases have backed up this effort.  There is no reason under the sun. This  is bipartisan. It will help both parties  and it will reduce the cynicism that exists in many, many areas of the public.  So, Mr. Speaker, this great H.R. 3,  the Transportation Equity Act, we  have worked on it a long time. I have  saluted both the Chair, as well as the  ranking member. I have not heard one  cogent argument as to why we should  not pass and allow States to reform  their own act and clean up their own  acts.  One criticism I heard is that this is  going to open up a Pandora’s box. The  Federal Government has rules on the  books already. Are we going to tell the  Federal Government, you have opened  up a Pandora’s box because you are  trying to implement clean-government  rules? That  is absurd. Give me one  legal  reason why  this  amendment  should not only be in order, which it is,  but it should not be both sides of the  aisle  supportive. Give me one good  legal reason.  ",2005
169,10,2005-03-10,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume,  and we have no further requests for  time.  So let me just again say that while I  wish the funding level of this bill were  higher, TEA–LU is a good bill. It is a  tribute to the gentleman from Alaska  (Chairman YOUNG) and the gentleman  from Minnesota  (Ranking Member  I urge my colleagues to  support it. We also will support the  rule.

170,10,2005-03-10,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to thank my colleague,  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts,  and I would like to reiterate as well  that this legislation is crucial to the  continued growth of our economy. We  are creating  jobs and  improving the  ability of current workers to commute  to their places of employment, among  a myriad  of  other  transportation  issues.  I look forward to the strong bipartisan support of this legislation. I urge  a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and the underlying legislation.  ",2005
171,10,2005-03-10,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take this opportunity to express my support for  the rule, H. Res. 144, to the TEA–LU, H.R. 3,  bill, which makes in order the Pascrell/Menendez/LoBiondo Pay-to-Play amendment. The  OBERSTAR).  consideration of this amendment is crucial to  restoring the integrity of New Jersey’s government and to protecting federal funds allocated  to the State.  New Jersey government and politics are  long overdue  for a cleansing. For  too  long,  New Jersey taxpayers have paid a corruption  tax—the cost of decisions made  to benefit  campaign donors rather than taxpayers. At the  present time, the New Jersey legislature is attempting to restore its integrity by barring companies, who have made political contributions  to a state government or political party official,  from receiving state contracts worth more than  $17,500. This  is a critical component of  the  State’s reform package and must be enacted  and maintained for genuine change to occur in  New Jersey.  Standing in the way of New Jersey’s cleansing  is  the US Department of Transportation,  USDOT, who has cited concerns  that our  State’s pay-to-play reform would illegally stifle  competition  for government contracts. New  Jersey has challenged the USDOT’s decision  in the court. Currently, the case is pending.  To weed out the corruption that has plagued  our State and resulted in our citizens mistrust  of  their government,  the Pascrell/Menendez/  LoBiondo amendment is essential.

173,38,2005-03-10,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I intend to ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment, but before I do, I would like to  engage  the  gentleman  from Alaska  (Chairman YOUNG) in a brief colloquy  on this issue.  Mr.  Chairman,  in  1998  Congress  passed TEA–21. And as enacted, TEA–21  contained  congressional  intent  and  guidance language to the United States  Department of Transportation to implement design-build contracting rules.  But, Mr. Chairman, the final rules did  not mirror Congress’  intent  in  the  slightest.  H.R. 3, as introduced and passed by  the committee, included section 1501 on  design-build, and I thank the chairman,  the  ranking member, and  the  committee  staff  for  recognizing  the  level of importance that design-build  holds  in the reauthorization debate.  However, the language currently in the  bill does not repair conflicts in the law.  My concern is that the Federal Government has been slow to respond to  initiatives at the State level that advance  those  goals. Current Federal  rules dampen the efficiency of design-  build with a complicated procurement  process, taking the wind out of the  sails of innovation.  Federal processes still favor a consecutive approach to project development,  requiring  separate  environmental review, design and construction  contracts.  This  causes  unnecessary  delay, added  cost and  reduced  efficiencies in delivering critical transportation projects.  I want to work with the committee  in conference to repair the design-build  law so States can benefit from its intended efficiency.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Alaska has visited my State, and I am  grateful for that. The gentleman has  heard from our constituents and our  commissioners and our governor. This  is necessary to take our work to the  next level. Sure we talk about changing funding formulas, but that alone is  not enough to satisfy everyone, and we  all know that. All I am asking for is a  chance to show that we can be innovative in using the limited funds that we  receive.  ",2005

178,38,2005-03-10,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Chairman, I offer an  amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk  will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 5 offered by Mr. ISSA:  At the end of section 1208 of the bill, insert  the following:  (d) SENSEOFCONGRESS.—It is the sense of  Congress that the Secretary and the States  should provide additional incentives (including the use of high occupancy vehicle lanes  on State and Interstate highways) for the  purchase and use of hybrid and other fuel efficient vehicles, which have been proven to  minimize air emissions and decrease consumption of fossil fuels.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to  House Resolution 144, the gentleman  from California (Mr. ISSA) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from California (Mr. ISSA).  ",2005
179,38,2005-03-10,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am  hopeful and believe that there will be  no opposition to this well-crafted, narrowly crafted amendment to this legislation.  I want to thank Chairman YOUNGand  the members of the committee who  helped make this a very good amendment. This amendment, Mr. Chairman,  seeks to empower our States when they  have  excess  capacity  in  their HOV  lanes to use that capacity to encourage  and promote  the  superlow-emissions  hybrid vehicles that are just emerging  on our highways today. California and  other States have passed laws in anticipation of our doing our job to allow  this.  I believe that  it will promote  superlow  emissions, higher-efficiency  vehicles for a period of only 4 years to  give this an opportunity.  I would urge all of our colleagues to  bear in mind that when we authorized  HOV lanes, we did so for two purposes:  one was to reduce congestion; the other  was to save fuel. Hybrid vehicles do an  excellent job of saving fuel. I urge my  colleagues to vote for this amendment.  ",2005
180,38,2005-03-10,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in support of the Issa amendment.  Quite simply, the increased use of fuel efficient vehicles is a boon to our country.  Hybrid  vehicles benefit our environment.  Our cities and  towns are being choked by  smog. The  increased use of hybrid vehicles  would reduce this problem.  Hybrid vehicles also benefit our economy.  The Ford Escape Hybrid is assembled in my  home State of Missouri. Sales for the Escape  hybrid have been so strong that this plant cannot keep up with demand. This plant provides  thousands of good paying  jobs here  in  the  United States.  I assure you that is you ask the workers in  that plant if they support increased incentives  for the purchase of hybrid vehicles, their answer would be a resounding ‘‘yes.’’  Finally, vehicles that reduce our use of gasoline mean greater energy security  for our  country, and less U.S. dollars going to countries with hostile regimes.  The increased use of hybrid vehicles is truly  a win-win-win situation and  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  ",2005

Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. SHADEGG) raises a very serious matter, modifying the Congestion  Management and Air Quality Improvement provisions in current law and the  formula.  The manner in which the gentleman  proposes to do this  is a  little more  complicated than I think is appropriate  to resolve in amendment form on the  floor. But I, in cooperation with the  chairman of the  full committee, believe we can work this out with the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SHADEGG)  as we proceed to conference.  If the gentleman is inclined to withdraw the amendment, having given a  very thoughtful discussion of it, I believe as we did last year in the effort to  reach a bill which we ultimately did  not, not for this reason but for other  reasons, that we can work this matter  out.

185,45,2005-03-10,Mr. SHADEGG.," Mr. Chairman, as we  have discussed, this is an issue which I  raised last year and on which the gentleman graciously agreed to address,  both the gentleman and the full committee chairman, in the conference.  It is a complicated issue. When we  dealt with this issue last year, one of  these two pollutants had been included  in the bill on the Senate side; the other  had not. So our concern was to make  sure that,  if we dealt with one, we  should deal with both because some  States are confronted by a problem by  one of those, and some States are confronted by a problem with the other.  Quite frankly, some States have both.  But I am prepared at the right point in  time  to withdraw  the  amendment  based on my understanding from both  the full committee chairman and the  ranking member that this is an issue  which can be addressed. It is indeed a  more complicated  issue than can be  dealt with in a floor amendment and it  can be addressed  in conference. And  based on the assurances I received I am  more than willing to do that.  I am not anxious to do it now because I have one gentleman who would  like to speak to the issue, but once he  has had a chance to do so I will be  happy to proceed as agreed.  ",2005
186,45,2005-03-10,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Chairman, I assure the gentleman that we will reach  in every good faith a resolution to this  matter.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2005

I believe that  the Federal government and the Congress need to be part of the solution to  cities around the country that are in  non-attainment status.  This amendment is a good step in  providing relief for cities such as Columbus, Georgia, in Muskogee County,  part of my 11th Congressional District,  that only recently has been designated  non-attainment, and it is non-attainment of  this PM–2.5  that  the gentleman  from Arizona  (Mr. SHADEGG)  was just talking about, these tiny 2.5  or below microparticulate matter.  We can save for another day, I guess,  the  debate  over  particulate matter  non-attainment  and  whether  cities  such as Columbus should be designated  as such. But today, I would like to say  thank you to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SHADEGG) for offering this  amendment that will allow funding to  be provided to these cities.  I  understand  the  gentleman may  withdraw the amendment. I appreciate  the ranking member being willing to  work with him on trying to resolve  this. But on behalf of the people of  Muskogee County and the City Columbus and Phoenix City, Alabama, as  well, I think this is a good idea and I  commend the amendment.  ",2005

193,52,2005-03-10,Mr. WEINER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today to  thank the leadership of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee  for  their hard work  shepherding through TEA–LU, a bill that I will  support despite its flaws. The Department of  Transportation studied the Nation’s infrastructure and prescribed a $375 billion solution. In  the 108th Congress, I joined the leadership in  endorsing the original version of this bill, which  filled that prescription. Unfortunately, the administration is unwilling to come up with the  support necessary to ensure that we are able  to maintain and  improve  the Nation’s  infrastructure, and threatened to veto any bill that  authorized more than $283.9 billion. As a result, we are today considering a bill that does  not do nearly enough to improve the quality of  life for individuals living in New York City and  around the country. I look forward to working  with the Committee leadership to see that this  bill is improved in conference.  Mr. Chairman, as  this bill moves  to conference, I want to highlight four issues that are  of particular import to me and my constituents.  It is my hope that the conferees will include  these improvements in the conference report.  First, this bill should ensure that resources  are devoted by formula to states that require  improvements. The minimum guarantee program shifts funding from states that have the  greatest  need—like  New  York—to  other  States. Each year, New York provides $20 billion more  to Washington  than  it gets back.  New Yorkers ought not be punished for our efforts to conserve fuel, as any expansion of the  minimum guarantee program would do.  Second, this bill shortchanges New York on  transit funding. Despite having almost half of  the Nation’s  transit  ridership, New York’s  share of transit funding leaves much to be desired. Transit  funding  should better  reflect  need.  Third, I hope that conferees will ensure that  States starved for a consistent funding stream  for ferries and waterborne transportation can  count on funding from the Ferry Boat Discretionary Fund. I am acutely aware of how much  a guaranteed stream of funding would mean  to improve both congestion and homeland security all across the country, and particularly in  New York City, where roads are clogged on a  normal day, and  ferry  transportation would  provide not only congestion relief but another  way to ensure escape from Manhattan in the  case of a terrorist attack. At a minimum, New  York should receive $5 million per year. I hope  conferees will work with me and other Members who represent districts that would benefit  from a guaranteed ferry funding stream.  Fourth, I hope that conferees will work with  me  to ensure  that  the generous  funding we  have provided for Senior transportation in this  bill is put to its best use. I believe that establishing a center for best practices and a technical assistance  center, would provide an  enormous service to this nation’s elderly population.  Nevertheless, Chairman YOUNG, Mr. OBERSTAR, Chairman PETRI, and Mr. DEFAZIOdeserve  the  thanks and appreciation of every  Member of this House for their tireless effort to  ensure that the Nation’s surface transportation  systems  receive  the  resources  required  to  keep America moving.  In particular, I would like to thank both the  Democratic and Republican staff of the Transportation Committee, both of whom worked  tirelessly on this piece of legislation, and who  deserve  the entire House’s  thanks.  In particular, I would like to thank Ken House, Clyde  Woodle,  Eric  Vanschyndle,  Ward  McCarragher,  Kathleen  Zern,  David  Heymsfeld,  Dara  Schleiker,  and  Sheila  Lockwood of Mr. OBERSTAR’s staff. Additionally, I would like to thank Jim Tymon of Mr.  YOUNG’s staff for his willingness to work with  me on the issue of Ferry Transportation.  I would also  like  to  thank Tom Kearney,  Tom Herritt and their colleagues at the Albany  Office of the Federal Highway Administration,  Nancy Ross, Fred Neveu, Ron Epstein and  their colleagues at the New York State Department of Transportation, and Andra Horsch and  David Woloch and their colleagues at the New  York City Department of Transportation.  ",2005
194,52,2005-03-10,Ms. LEE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of  H.R. 3, the Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users.  Mr. Speaker, TEA–LU represents the Federal government’s ongoing commitment to improving our Nation’s entire transportation system for the benefit of everyone.  Our  taxes pay  for  this  infrastructure, and  this infrastructure is the lifeblood of the commerce  that  fuels our Nation. The profits of  every single business are dependent on this  transportation network, and  in  turn, are dependent on our willingness to pay the taxes  that fund this network.  for  the  future,  the benefits  The very existence of our roads, our highways, our rail lines, our ports and our airports  is testament to the critical role of the Federal  government as the embodiment of our collective responsibility.  It’s the elegantly simple idea that by paying  your taxes you improve the quality of life of  every person in this country and lay the foundation for a strong economy that benefits everyone.  Federal, State and local governments, corporations, small businesses, individuals—all of  us have a  responsibility  to  contribute our  share. It is our right to use this infrastructure,  but it is also our duty to maintain and improve  it for the future.  While we plan  are real, now.  In my district this bill will provide funding to  a number of worthwhile projects that will improve  the quality of  life  for my constituents,  the State of California and the entire Nation.  One project in particular that I’m very proud  of is the Ed Roberts Campus. This state of the  art project makes it easier for people with disabilities to get around. It links eight disability  organizations  to create a multi-tenant  facility  that will serve as an intermodal transit center  as well as a  transportation  information and  travel-training center  for people with disabilities.  The Ed Roberts Campus will play a major  role in assisting and teaching people with disabilities to live their lives independently. And  because  it will be  located above  the Ashby  BART station in Berkeley, its reach will stretch  throughout  the  entire Bay Area,  simultaneously serving as a model  for urban  independent living throughout the Nation.  I’m proud to support the Ed Roberts Campus, and I’m happy to announce that $3 million will go towards it through TEA–LU.  Another set of projects  that  I’m also very  proud of are the transit oriented developments  planned in the City of Oakland and the City of  Emeryville. Transit oriented development is a  relatively new concept that joins housing, business, public  transportation and  recreational  areas into one liveable community.  We have been on the cutting edge of transit  oriented development in my district from the  very beginning. And  last year’s successful  opening of the Fruitvale Transit Village in Oakland has served as a model for other transit  oriented development projects in the Bay Area  and throughout the country.  I’m happy to announce that TEA–LU will directly provide another $2 million  for  such  projects in Oakland and Emeryville.  Another  issue of  concern and an area  where this bill makes an immediate impact for  my constituents  is  the construction of sidewalks in several unincorporated areas in Ashland and Cherryland in my district.  Even though sidewalks are often taken for  granted—for a child, the simple act of walking  to school can be  treacherous without  them.  Thanks to TEA–LU, we will have another $1  million to construct those sidewalks and keep  these kids safe in many neglected parts of my  district.  The funding in TEA–LU for these and other  projects is incredibly important to me and my  constituents. But the truth is we need much  more funding and not just in my district, but  throughout the country.  Our  transportation  system  is aging.

I can assure the gentleman  it will be a fair and balanced rule. But  I will oppose putting it out unless it is  a fair and balanced rule that allows for  consideration of very important measures.  I know my colleague  joins me  in  wanting to ensure that we get the resources necessary  to  our men  and  women in uniform who are having such  great success in Iraq.

209,59,2005-03-10,Mr. DREIER.," I am happy to say that,  again, that we anticipate that the first  major measure of the week that we will  consider, following suspensions, will be  the supplemental appropriations bill.

In fact, when we are completed here, I will be making an announcement for the deadline for consideration of amendments. I will tell  the gentleman, as in the past, the Committee on Rules has had a tendency,  and I hope to continue that pattern, for  actually showing preference  for substitute packages that would be offered  by Members. And we want to encourage  Members who would like to offer budget substitutes to get those to us just as  quickly as we possibly can.

Obviously, if we do as I suspect,  the Committee on Rules will make in  order  different  substitutes; we will  need to have time for that. So it will be  later in the week next week. So I cannot tell the gentleman exactly what  day it will be, but it will be into the  week. And again, quite possibly,  it  could extend until Friday.  ",2005

222,66,2005-03-10,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. MUSGRAVE)  is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2005
223,66,2005-03-10,Mrs. MUSGRAVE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Eva Bowman and her  late husband, Ralph, for their commitment to education and, specifically, for  their commitment to the Wray School  District located on the eastern plains  of Colorado.  The Bowmans’ dedication to and involvement  in the school districts of  East Yuma County spans five generations. As a young girl, Eva rode her  horse  to  school  southeast of Wray.  That schoolhouse was made of sod. It  was heated using wood and cow chips.  She graduated from Laird High School.  Her father, Fred Peterson, was also active in education and served as a member  of  the Starnes County School  Board at the turn of the last century.  Ralph attended the nearby East Beecher Island County School, but had to  quit after the eighth grade in order to  work on the farm.  Because he was not able to finish his  education, Ralph felt it was very important for his children and his grandchildren to receive a good education.  All three of the Bowman children graduated from Wray High School. The ten  Bowman grandchildren and  21 great  grandchildren all attend or have graduated  from the schools within East  Yuma County. By the time the Bowmans’ youngest great granddaughter  completes her schooling, their family  will be celebrating well over 100 years  of education within these wonderful  educational institutions.  As an additional testament to their  devotion, Eva recently donated $200,000  to the Wray School District wind turbine project on behalf of her late husband, Ralph, and her children, Jean  Brophy, Geraldine Baird,  and Jack  Bowman. Upon completion, the wind  turbine project will make Wray the  first school district in Colorado to own  a renewable energy source.  Recently, when her loving grandson  Michael was  talking  to his  grandmother, they commented on the technological changes Eva has experienced  during her  life. Michael praised his  grandmother for her excitement about  life, and she said, ‘‘I am not afraid to  die; I just wish I could keep on living  so I can see what happens next.’’ That  epitomizes  the kind of woman Eva  Bowman is.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is people of optimism, perseverance, and commitment  to education, like Eva and Ralph, that  make America the strong, innovative  country that it is today. We owe the  Bowmans a heart of gratitude for setting such a positive example for all of  us to follow.  f  THE FAILURE OF CAFTA  ",2005
224,66,2005-03-10,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BROWN) is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2005
225,66,2005-03-10,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  this is the face of CAFTA. This photo  was taken by Reuters News Service  yesterday  in  Guatemala  as  police  forces used tear gas and water cannons  to beat back hundreds of demonstrators who had united  to  speak out  against  the Central American Free  Trade Agreement, CAFTA. This is the  face of CAFTA.  More than 25,000 letters have been  signed by workers in Guatemala begging  their  Congress  not  to  rush  through  this  bad  trade  agreement.  Throughout the developing world, from  Guatemala to every other developing  country, workers do not share in the  wealth they create. Nike workers in  Vietnam cannot afford the shoes they  make. Disney workers in Costa Rica  cannot buy the toys for their children.  Motorola workers in Malaysia are unable to purchase the cell phones.  The North American Free Trade  Agreement promised to create a thriving middle class in Mexico, to raise  wages and lift people out of poverty. A  dozen years later, there is no middle  class realizing their dreams. Instead,  there is a fallen minimum wage and  the ongoing nightmare of abject poverty despite  the backbreaking work  and deplorable working conditions.  Now President Bush wants to expand  this  failed  trade  agreement  with  CAFTA,  the Central America Free  Trade  Agreement,  a  dysfunctional  cousin of NAFTA, involving five Central American countries: Costa Rica,  Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and  Guatemala. CAFTA nations are not  only among the world’s poorest countries; they are also among its smallest  economies. With a $62 billion combined  economic output, about that of Columbus, Ohio, these countries can hardly  serve as a growth engine for the $10  trillion U.S. economy. CAFTA is more  about access to cheap labor and exporting American  jobs  than  exporting  American goods.  Trade pacts like NAFTA and CAFTA  enable  companies  to  exploit  cheap  labor in other countries, then import  their products back to the U.S. under  favorable terms. As a result, our country, especially my State of Ohio, bleed  manufacturing jobs and run unprecedented trade deficits.  Gregory Mankiw,  the  President’s  former chief economist, portrays the  exporting of jobs as inevitable and desirable, saying, ‘‘When a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it  makes more sense to import it than to  provide it domestically.’’  Mr. Speaker,  I would  say  to Mr.  Mankiw that what really makes sense  is a trade policy that lifts workers up  in rich and poor countries alike while  respecting human  rights and democratic principles.  Proof that CAFTA  is a  legacy of  failed trade policies  is evidenced  in  Congress’  own  inaction. Since  2001,  Congress  typically  votes  within  8  weeks, about 60 days, of President Bush  signing a trade agreement. Nearly 300  days have elapsed since President Bush  signed  the  Central American Free  Trade Agreement. That delay is proof  that CAFTA is a failure and further  proof of CAFTA’s failure can be seen in  this photo when police have turned on  their own protesting public, people who  are exercising their rights simply to  petition their Congress and ask that  they not pass this trade agreement.  And yet, the U.S. continues to push  for more of the same, more trade agreements that ship  jobs overseas, more  trade agreements that neglect essential  environmental  standards, more  trade agreements  that keep  foreign  workers in poverty.  Madness, Mr. Speaker, is repeating  the same action over and over and expecting a different result. The United  States, with its unrivaled purchasing  power  and  our  enormous  economic  clout, we are in a unique position to  help empower poor workers in the developing world while promoting prosperity at home. When the world’s poorest people can buy American products  rather than just make them, then we  will know that our trade policies are finally working.  f  b1545  RU–486: BABY POISON THAT ALSO  KILLS WOMEN  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  DENT). Under a previous order of the  House, the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. SMITH) is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr.  SMITH  of New  Jersey. Mr.  Speaker, RU–486  is baby poison, and  now we know it is also fatal to women.  RU–486 is a powerful pesticide that was  developed to kill human beings, not  cure them. It targets unborn children  for elimination as if they were cancers  or viruses and hurts the women who  take  it. The  fact  that pro-abortion  groups led the charge to water down  the FDA’s safety measures on RU–486  and now have been silent in the death  of Holly Patterson  is an  indictment  against them. They care more about  abortion than they do women. These  groups have actually chosen to subjugate women’s lives and health to the  insatiable desire for legal abortion at  any time and  for any reason. They  have chosen abortion over women, but  our current FDA should not continue  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:41 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H10MR5.REC H10MR5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005
226,73,2005-03-10,Mr. CONAWAY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for those kind remarks.  And I actually chose the office that  you vacated, so that, as my  initial  start in this chamber, I would have the  good vibrations that you left behind on  your good start in this body.  I want to make a few points, some of  which play off of the ones that you  have already made. Unfortunately, we  got off on what I think is the wrong  foot when we began to call this situation a crisis. We in America have a relatively short attention span, and crisis  means something is going to happen in  the next 15 minutes or certainly by tomorrow. So that was probably an ill  word to use, and we spent an inordinate  amount  of  time  arguing  over  that  word.  I am a CPA by background, 30-plus  years of business experience. And as I  look at what I believe to be the very  compelling arguments and facts that  you present, then that leads me to believe that we do have something we  ought to deal with, and that we ought  to deal with that today and not continue to put that off.  Now, is the time to fix this problem.  You have already mentioned that, each  year that we delay in this fix, it adds  an additional $600 billion of unfunded  benefits and liabilities to our problem.  So, in your family, my family, my  business, the clients that I have, if we  had circumstances where we had cash  flow deficits and I went to the Chairman and the CEO and I said, you know  you are going to bring in less money  than you are spending this year, do not  worry about it, it will be okay, let us  just do not fix it, wait 3 or 4 years from  now.  b1645  Well, that is nonsense. Nobody does  that in the real world, and we should  not be about doing that here in Congress.  So I think the facts compel us to see  the problem, see the issue that needs to  be done and also compel us to say, we  should be the ones who fix it. If you  agree with the facts that we have a  system that is no longer sustainable,  there is a great adage that I picked up  in one of the briefings that we had  early  in November that said, things  that cannot be sustained will not be  sustained.  It  is  a  pretty  straightforward  statement. That  is  exactly  what we have here. We have something  that will not sustain itself.  When it originally came into being in  1935, it could clearly sustain itself. The  more callous of some would look at  that system and say, that is nothing  more than a pyramid scheme where  you collect from all these people and  give it out to a few.  In this instance, it is a legitimized  pyramid scheme, but as every pyramid  scheme in history it runs out of gas.  The facts compel us to say that this  system that we have got is running out  of gas.  We hear the phrase PAYGO bandied  about this body and in committees a  great deal with some passion and disdain. This was an original PAYGO system, pay as you go. The monies you  bring in are paid out to beneficiaries. I  do not think it applies to Social Security and here is why. PAYGO means in  this circumstances you pay, and if I am  retired, I go. PAYGO ought to mean  the folks incurring the bills ought to  pay the bills. So I do not think the  term PAYGO really applies to Social  Security.  The next thing is once you have this  issue in front of us, let us take a step  back and put ourselves back 75 years  ago when  it was conceived and the  leadership at that point in time, the  wonderful  leadership  it was, clearly  thought a lifetime benefit, a Social Security stream of cash flow that you  cannot outlive, was an important public policy arrangement.  I do not hear anybody on either side  of the aisle hinting that this is not still  really a good public policy  for our  country  to have.  I have  counseled  many clients who as they approach retirement age one of the first questions  they ask is, am I going to outlive my  money? I have got all this put away  that I have saved and scrimped and  foregone purchases and have put this  money away. Am I going to outlive  that?  Well, the wonderful thing about Social Security is you have got the security of knowing you simply cannot outlive this lifetime benefit. So if we are  compelled to fix it, and I think we are  compelled to keep it, if it is good public policy for my mom and dad and for  me, then I would argue that it ought to  be good public policy for my grandchildren and my children, just like the  gentleman has talked about his children as well. So I think we are coming  to some things we can all agree on as  we begin to move toward how do we  come about this conclusion of fixing  whatever is in front of us.  I have six wonderful grandchildren.  God has blessed me  immensely with  four wonderful children and two daughters-in-law and a son-in-law and six  magnificently  wonderful  grandchildren. It would never ever occur to  me to gather those six little critters  up, take them down to my local bank  and say, Mr. Banker, I want to borrow  a lot of money. And I want to spend  that money over the rest of my life  time, and I want my six grandkids to  sign that note. And when they grow up  they will pay off what granddad spent.  If you individualize what we are really doing every single day in this country,  there  is not a grandparent on  Earth I do not believe who would do  that, who would obligate their  individual grandchildren  for  some  individual debts that they might incur. So  if it is not good public policy on an individual  grandparent-to-grandchild  basis, then it really should not be good  public policy on a corporate basis to do  this very exact same thing.  We are a Nation at war, and we have  these wonderful stories coming back  from men and women and the sacrifices  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:41 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H10MR5.REC H10MR5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005
227,80,2005-03-10,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," To add  insult to  injury,  if we are going to  spend time talking about private accounts and that really seems to be the  way the President has shaped this debate, that is the issue around which the  President has shaped this debate, what  is unbelievable is that private accounts  by anyone’s admission do not even  solve the problem. Private accounts do  not shore up Social Security, they do  not improve its solvency, they do not  solve the 2042 problem. They just create private accounts and privatize Social Security and pull the rug out from  under people’s future retirement security. That is all they do.  Just so that we can stick to the facts  and not hyperbole, I will highlight the  gentleman from New York (Mr. RANGEL), our ranking member on Ways and  Means. The other day, he spoke to Mr.  Walker and asked him about private  accounts and his opinion. Mr. Walker,  the Comptroller, said that as a carve-  out, and this was in front of the House  Committee on Ways and Means, personal accounts financed with payroll  taxes could worsen the program’s financial stability. He said if it was designed as a supplement to traditional  benefits, as an add-on, that personal  accounts would not cause a problem.  And, essentially, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) said, well, what  the President proposed was a carve-  out. That  is clearly not acceptable  under the Comptroller General’s concept.  By the President’s own experts’ admission, Social Security is not in crisis, Social Security is solvent until at  least 2042; and then what is unfortunate is the hyperbole, because our colleague from North Carolina, who was  spending some time on the floor a little  while ago talking about their view, his  view, on Social Security referred to the  solvency issue and said that out in 2042  that Social Security would be  flat  busted, I think was the term he used  while I was  listening to his debate.  That is absolutely incorrect. Flat busted. My definition of flat busted means  no money, gone, cannot provide any  benefits at all. Then he, a few minutes  later, said, well, it would provide 60 to  70 percent of benefits.  The reality is that the factual numbers from the Social Security Administration itself, from the trustees who  manage the Social Security trust fund,  they say that at the earliest in 2042,  Social Security would pay 80 percent of  benefits if we do nothing, which you  and I and others continue and the leader and the whip and the chairman of  the caucus continue to stress, we are  not suggesting that we do nothing. We  are suggesting that if we are going to  focus on this problem, that we call it a  problem and not a crisis, couch it the  way it is, and let us come together in  a bipartisan fashion and sit down and  hash out solutions.  Our point is why spend time wringing  our hands, gnashing our  teeth, and  stressing out our constituents who are  really concerned about whether or not  Social Security is going to be there for  them talking about privatizing Social  Security which is the vast majority of  what we are spending our time talking  about when it does not even solve the  problem. That is the bottom line.  When I had my town hall meetings,  Democrats have held more than 300  town hall meetings, like the gentleman  said, more than 80 percent of our colleagues in the caucus have had town  hall meetings, there have literally been  more than 300 of those. At so many of  those, senior citizens, our wonderful  senior citizens who  literally we all  stand on their shoulders today, you and  I especially, our generation has been  able to achieve what we have been able  to achieve by standing on their shoulders.  People  ask, why  do  seniors  care  about this  issue? The President has  said, people 55 and over are not going  to have to worry about it. They care  because they care about their grandchildren. They also care because they  have a healthy dose of  skepticism.  What they lived through in their lifetimes has taught them not to take everything at face value. And they understand that when you have such a gargantuan, mammoth change to a system  as large as Social Security, there is no  way that you can trust that people who  are 55 and older will not have to worry.  They also understand that they need  to be concerned about their children  and their grandchildren. That same AP  story that the gentleman quoted a little while ago focused on the President  and what he has said about this issue.  The President commented on people 55  and older. At the same time he was  saying they would not need to be concerned about his plan, he also said  grandmothers and grandfathers need to  be worried about their grandchildren  when it comes to Social Security. So at  least the President acknowledges that  people 55 and older have a legitimate  reason to be concerned about this. We  have got to make sure that we continue to disseminate the facts and not  engage in the hyperbole that the Republicans have been.  ",2005

230,108,2005-03-10,Mr. KENNEDY.," I yield myself such  time as I might use.  Mr. President, I speak now in morning business because at 11 o’clock we  will have a continuation of votes in the  Senate on the bankruptcy bill. Then we  will have a series of votes later on in  the afternoon, with a time to be designated by the leadership. Then we will  move to final passage. There would not  be otherwise an opportunity to express  my views about the bankruptcy bill in  general and on a number of the items  we have debated and on which we have  failed to persuade the majority of our  colleagues. I want to reference those in  my remarks this morning.  America at its best is when we are  united in common cause and a unified  purpose. We came together to overcome the Great Depression. We came  together  to  fight  two world wars  against tyranny. We came together in  the Cold War years to contain and defeat Communism. We came together to  fight polio, to explore the heavens, and  to create a secure retirement for our  seniors. We came together after much  struggle to expand the circle of opportunity in America for civil rights, voting rights, disability rights, and women’s rights. We came together on 9/11 as  a nation determined to fight terrorism  and defend our land.  As Americans, we know how to come  together  to achieve great goals,  to  make stronger our communities, our  families, our economy, our schools, and  our nation. That is the America I believe in. That is the America I fight for  every day. An America where we are  joined arm in arm to advance the cause  of opportunity, freedom, and fairness  for all of our people.  But this legislation breaks the bond  that unites America, the bond that  makes our country strong. It says the  concerns  of  low  and middle-income  families don’t matter. They no longer  have a voice in the United States Senate. What matters are the special interests. This bill sacrifices the hopes  and dreams of average Americans to  the rampant greed of the credit card  industry. It turns the United States  Senate into a collection agency for the  credit card companies,  reaching  the  long arm of the law into the pocketbooks of average Americans who have  reached the end of their economic rope.  That is wrong. That is not what we  should be doing here. We have a responsibility to the people to fight for them  and their needs, not to do the bidding  of the almighty credit card companies.  A lot of people are going to be pained  with this bill. Make no mistake. The  idea that this bill is focused on spendthrifts is laughable when the other side  admits that the most we have in terms  of spendthrifts is maybe 10 percent of  the total of those who go into bankruptcy, and most of the bankruptcy attorneys say it is anywhere from 5 to 7  percent. We are picking up all these individuals who are going to be forced to  pay and be treated more harshly with  this bill than they otherwise would be  under the regular Bankruptcy Act.  Our bankruptcy laws are intended to  give  families  a  second  chance. As  Americans, we believe that if you work  hard, live responsibly, but fall on hard  times, our bankruptcy laws should be  there to help you get back on your  feet. If you get sick and face a mountain of medical bills, if you face divorce and no longer have two incomes  to support your family, if your job gets  sent overseas, then Americans believe  you should have an opportunity to rebuild your lives.  These are the principal causes  for  bankruptcy. We know that more children drop out of college every single  year, not academically, but because of  the cost of student loans. They can’t  pay them. We have been through this  during the course of the debate. If you  have a heart attack, if you are diagnosed with cancer, even if you have  health  insurance, you basically have  overwhelming  bills  and more  often  than not get thrown into bankruptcy.  If you get divorced—as we will have a  chance to vote on—200,000 women don’t  receive alimony and don’t receive child  support, these are hard-working Americans who are going to get thrown into  bankruptcy. And rather than be let out  so that they will have a new chance  and a new opportunity in life because  they have done nothing wrong, they  are going to be tied up and paying the  credit card companies for the next 5  years. That is the way this bill works.  This bill changes everything. It takes  dozens and dozens of bankruptcy rules  and rewrites every single one of them  in favor of the credit card industry.  Yesterday, we witnessed the powerful  grip of this industry over the Republican Party. The Republicans defeated  amendment  after  amendment  after  amendment  after  amendment  that  tried to give average Americans a fair  chance when they face the credit card  company lawyers in bankruptcy court.  But when it appeared that a special interest loophole for the financial services industry threatened to be closed  by the Leahy-Sarbanes-Warner amendment, the Republicans shut down the  Senate.  It is not as if the credit card industry  is suffering. As we can see from this  chart, the profits are in the billions of  dollars: $6.4 billion 1990; $12.9 billion in  1995; $20.5 billion in 2000; and they expect as a result of this bill that it will  be 5 billion more dollars  in profits.  That is what this bill will mean. Over  who?

238,115,2005-03-10,Mr. BYRD.," Madam President, freedom is a fragile thing and never more  than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours by inheritance; it  must be fought for and defended constantly  by  each  generation,  for  it  comes only once to a people. Those who  have known freedom and then lost it  have never known  it  again. These  words come  from the  lips of  former  President Ronald Reagan.  I rise today to discuss freedom, not  the  grandiose  worldwide  ‘‘freedom  talk’’ one hears so much about. No. Not  far-flung  foreign  policy  goals,  but,  rather, my concern today is preserving  our freedoms right in our own backyard at home.  Freedom, like a good garden, needs  constant tending. One must watch for  the worms  in the wood. As Wendell  Phillips, the abolitionist, orator, and  the columnist, once said, ‘‘eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.’’ One must  pay the price if one wants the blessing.  In a culture where sports metaphors  are more common public parlance than  historical analogies, our unique form of  government, carefully restraining powers while protecting rights, presents a  special  challenge  to maintain. The  ‘‘winning is everything’’ philosophy so  beloved by Americans may, without  careful balance, obscure the goal of  justice for all that must be the aim of  a representative democracy. Demeaning minority views, characterizing opposition as obstructionist—these are  first steps down the dark alley of subjugating rights.  Majorities can prevail by numerical  force. They do not need protection  from minorities. Yet some would have  us believe that minority voices threaten the larger public good in the case of  Presidential  judicial  appointments.  The opposite is true. It is minorities  who are most in jeopardy without fairness from the Federal bench. I am talking about those who are in the minority. The persecuted, the disadvantaged,  the poor, the downtrodden—these are  the very citizens who need the strong  protection of an unbiased legal system.  Appointees  to  the Federal  bench  should be scrutinized for traces of ideological rigidity or allegiance to political movements which could cloud impartial judgment. I for one do not favor  activist judges of any stripe. I do not  think the proper role for a judge is to  make new law from the bench. My own  preference  is usually  for strict constitutionalists.  Conservative  judges  can hold activist views, just as can liberal judges. Such labels tell us very little. What we should strive for on the  Federal bench is blind justice; that is,  justice absent a political agenda.  Judicial appointments must never be  a sure thing for the bench simply because they please the majority party,  whether that majority is Democratic  or Republican. Federal  judges enjoy  life tenure. Remember that. Federal  judges enjoy life tenure, making decisions of huge importance to the lives  and the livelihoods of our citizens. Are  they accountable to anyone? No. They  are accountable  to no one, and no  President can fire them. No President  can say: Go home, you are sick today.  It is ridiculous to suggest that mere  superiority of numbers in the Senate  should alone guarantee confirmation to  a Federal judgeship. Such a claim reduces  the constitutional advice and  consent function of the Senate to a pro  forma rubberstamping of Presidential  judicial  appointments whenever  the  President’s party controls the Senate.  We are talking about a separate branch  of the Federal Government.

239,122,2005-03-10,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, the Peoples Republic of China recently enacted  an antisecession or antiseparation law,  the intent of which may believe would  restrict the Taiwanese people’s  freedom of speech and allow the Chinese  Government to use force to annex Taiwan if China suspects separatist speech  making or any other separatist activities on the island. This law has caused  a tremendous uproar in Taiwan. Taiwan’s foreign minister and chairman of  Taiwan’s Mainland  Affairs  Council  have both denounced the law as a unilateral act on the part of China. It will  cause tensions in the Taiwan Strait to  rise  and may  have  serious  consequences for future Taiwan-China relations.  I agree with  the assessment  that  China is seeking to change unilaterally  the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.  China seems to have abandoned any attempt at future dialogue between the  two sides and seeks to impose this law  on the 23 million people of Taiwan. Chinese assumptions are that Taiwan and  China are now already unified and that  China has jurisdiction over Taiwan, especially the authority to serve penalty  and punishment to Taiwanese people  and their leaders. China has ignored  the fact that Taiwan and China have  been  two  separate political  entities  since 1949 and neither has jurisdiction  over the other. China, therefore, has no  right to carry out punishment to Taiwanese people and  leaders whenever  China sees fit.  Predictably, Taiwanese  people  are  outraged by the latest Chinese act and  ask the  international community to  oppose China’s new law. So far, with a  wait-and-see  attitude,  the  international  community  has  remained  quiet on the subject. It is important  that we not appease China.  Inaction of the international community will send a dangerous signal and  will further encourage China to indulge  in its political rhetoric and war-like  actions. We must single out the dangers  inherent  in China’s  new  law,  whose enactment will totally discourage the Taiwanese people from seeking  a  peaceful  solution  to  the Taiwan  issue. Now is not the time to empower  China to prepare for military conflicts  across the Taiwan Strait, just as the  EU stands to do by lifting the Chinese  Arms Embargo.  In this era of global terrorism and  natural catastrophes, war is the last  thing we would like to see in the Asia-  Pacific region. I urge all Americans  and the  international community to  oppose  China’s  enactment  of  the  antisecession  law, and  I plead with  both Chinese and Taiwanese  leaders  not to resort to any extreme measures  and not to make a bad situation worse.  Both sides should allow tempers to cool  and keep dialogues open.  May the Lunar New Year bring good  will to the Chinese and Taiwanese peoples and may they continue to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan  Strait.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  ",2005

244,122,2005-03-10,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, for those  who do not follow the debate in the  Senate very closely, this 500-page bill  has been the subject of our debate and  discussion for the last 2 weeks. It is  likely to be concluded today with a  vote, and the vote is likely to be in  favor of this legislation.  It  is about bankruptcy  law.  It  is  something everyone dreads the thought  of, that you would reach a point in life  where you have more debts than assets,  and finally say: I have to go to court  and ask for help.  But bankruptcy is an institution created by Western civilized society to respond to a terrible injustice. There was  a time in this world when if you were  deeply in debt, you ended up deeply in  jail—debtors’ prison—put in an unconscionable situation where you could  not pay your bills and, once in prison,  did not have any place to turn.  We decided that in a more civilized  society we would acknowledge the fact  that through misfortune or miscalculation some people reach a point where  they do not have enough money to pay  their bills. And if they are prepared to  go into a bankruptcy court, file extensive documentation to establish their  debt and their assets, the court may  consider discharging  them  in bankruptcy. As a result of that discharge,  people lose most of what they have on  Earth, but also walk away from their  debts and have a chance for a fresh  start, for a new day.  That is something that has been in  the law for a long time. The law has  been amended over the years. We have  chapter 7, where you walk out of the  bankruptcy court with your debts behind you. Chapter 13 is where an individual tries to repay, says to the court:  I don’t want to be found to be bankrupt. I am willing to work out with my  creditors a repayment schedule. That  is what chapter 13 does. So you try to  take a limited amount of money and  pay it out over a period of time.  For years and years the credit card  companies and big banks have said: We  want to change this law. Too many  people are going to bankruptcy court.  The numbers range from 1.3 million to  1.5 million each year, but there is no  doubt the numbers are going up.  The  credit  industry  argues:  Too  many people are in bankruptcy court,  and as a consequence, we should limit  the opportunity for bankruptcy. So for  almost 10 years they have been pushing  for this bill—year after year after year.

245,129,2005-03-10,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President,  this  amendment will  exempt  from  the  bankruptcy bill’s means test those disabled veterans whose indebtedness occurred primarily during a period of  military service. They have given us  their arms, their legs, very important  parts of their lives.  After 2 weeks of debate, after scores  of amendments that have failed, I ask  my colleagues, just once, in the consideration of this bill, whether they will  take  into  their  consideration  those  who, because of misfortunes they could  not control, have had their lives seriously changed. We need to honor these  veterans who have given so much to  America.  If the Senate owes a great debt to the  credit card industry, don’t we owe a  greater debt to these brave soldiers?

264,129,2005-03-10,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. President, we  have debated this before when I offered  an amendment to close the millionaire’s loophole. My colleagues may recall  the millionaire’s  loophole will  allow a millionaire to shield his or her  assets in a certain type of trust. It  would not  be  susceptible  to  bankruptcy. The millionaire could then declare bankruptcy, shed his debts, and  still have the assets in the trust. It is  an egregious abuse.  Unfortunately, my amendment was  voted down. My friend from Missouri  has offered an amendment that frankly  keeps  the  status quo.  I understand  many on the other side are sort of  pained that they had to vote against  this amendment, but let me tell colleagues what the Talent amendment  does.  It requires a showing of intent to defraud in order to not shield the assets.  4 minutes  it  is  OFFICER. Who  Well, give me a break. Or as my kids  would say: Hello.  Which millionaire is going to hire a  lawyer and say, make sure you leave a  paper trail so they can prove intent? Of  course, one cannot prove intent, particularly if the actual intent is to hide  the assets.  So  in all due respect to my good  friend from Missouri, this amendment  is simply a subterfuge. Make no mistake about it, the Talent amendment  will not rectify the millionaire’s loophole, will not provide cover for people  who seek cover. If we want to correct  the Talent amendment, vote  for the  Schumer  second-degree  to  Talent,  which eliminates the  intent requirement.  One more point. Aside from the intent issue——  ",2005

267,129,2005-03-10,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, one can  have  self-settled  trusts. What  the  amendment of the distinguished Senator from New York does is do away  with essentially all self-settled trusts.  Frankly, Senator SCHUMER’s amendment is so broad that it covers all settled trusts, not just fraud.  The amendment of the distinguished  Senator  from Missouri covers  fraud,  and he does it in the appropriate way,  a legal way, the way it should be done.  I yield the remainder of my time to  the distinguished Senator  from Missouri.  ",2005

269,129,2005-03-10,Mr. TALENT.," I thank the Senator  from Utah.  Very briefly, we should not allow  criminals to hide their assets and avoid  paying  their bills. This amendment  makes certain that dishonest people  can’t hide their assets, especially  if  they have caused others to lose their  jobs, retirement pensions, health care  benefits and, in some cases, their life  savings.  One  of  the  reasons  the  economy  plunged into a recession a few years  back was because of corporate fraud.  And those crimes caused companies to  fail, eliminating thousands of jobs. It is  fundamentally unfair to allow these  crooks to abuse the trust laws of certain States to hide their wealth.  My amendment is simple. It closes  the asset protection trust loophole by  empowering bankruptcy courts to go  back 10 years to take away fraudulent  transfers that criminals have sheltered  away in an attempt to avoid paying  back their debts.  Here is a little background on the  problem. Asset protection trusts are  trusts that a person forms to shield assets for his or her own benefit.

270,157,2005-03-10,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education  Improvement Act of 2005. To compete in  this global economy, we need to make  sure our students have 21st century  skills for 21st century jobs. Vocational  and  technical  education  is  an  extremely important part of this effort.  The Perkins Act, which provides $1.3  billion to help train more than 10 million Americans across the country, is a  vital investment in our nation’s high  schools, community colleges, and our  students.  The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical program gives a boost to America’s workforce development system by  providing funds to schools that teach  technical skills ranging from auto shop  to computer programming. The Perkins Act also supports practical career  programs and links between secondary  and post-secondary education, helping  students to move up the opportunity  ladder and prepare them for high-skill,  high-wage  jobs. Students who have  completed Perkins-supported programs  are better prepared not only for higher  education but for the workplace.  The President has proposed eliminating funding for all vocational and  technical education programs. This is  the wrong way to go. If Perkins was  eliminated,  high  schools,  technical  schools, and community colleges  in  every state would suffer. In Maryland,  our schools would lose almost $19 million. Last year, we had more  than  150,000 students enrolled in career and  technical programs in Maryland. In the  United States, 97 percent of high school  students take at least one career and  technical education course. One-third  of college students are involved in career and technical programs. And almost 40 million adults attend short-  term occupational training.  If these  schools had to close their doors or shut  down their vocational programs, where  would these students go to learn the  skills they need to get good paying  jobs?  Vocational and technical education  provides students across the country  with opportunities to develop academic  and technical skills that are critical  for economic and workforce development. It is our job in the United States  Senate to make sure these opportunities are there for the people who need  them and to invest in our human capital to create a world class workforce.  That is why I strongly support this bipartisan bill and I oppose any cuts to  the Perkins Vocational and Technical  Education programs.  ",2005
271,157,2005-03-10,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education program.  By the year 2010, 80 percent of all  jobs  in the Nation will require secondary and postsecondary  education  and training as a prerequisite for a job  that supports a middle-class lifestyle.  The Perkins Vocational and Technical  Education program provides business  and industry with the skilled workers  they need to compete in the 21st century economy and provides a future of  hope for those workers.  Unfortunately, President Bush has  proposed eliminating Federal funding  for these programs in his fiscal year  2006 budget. This would have a tremendous negative impact across the nation  and especially in Illinois, which is receiving $49.6 million dollars in fiscal  year 2005 for these programs. In fact, in  Illinois, 3 out of 5 high school students  are enrolled in Vocational and Technical Education annually, representing  more than 348,000 students.  The Senate’s strong support for this  legislation  today  demonstrates  that  the Bush  administration  is  out  of  touch with regular people and the state  of our economy. We need to create  more good jobs in America; that’s what  vocation education programs do.  For example, we need more teachers.

287,171,2005-03-10,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  to urge my colleagues to vote for final  passage of the bankruptcy reform bill.  I have been working on this piece of  legislation for a long time, and I am  pleased to see that we are nearing the  end. This bipartisan bill has been maligned by many, and I want to set the  record straight. What we are trying to  do is fix a bankruptcy system that has  gone awry, where individuals who have  the ability to repay their debts don’t  do so, and the rest of us are left holding the bag.  What we have tried to do with this  bill is inject some fairness into the system, whereby people who have assets  and the ability to repay back their  debts go into a chapter 13 repayment  plan, and people who do not have any  means and no ability to repay go into  chapter 7. We’ve kept the safety net of  full chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge for  those who truly need it, and channeled  others that can pay their creditors into  a repayment plan.  This is done through a means test,  which is fair and flexible enough to  take into account all the unique circumstances a debtor and his  family  face. The means test takes  into account all reasonable and necessary expenses for a debtor and his family. We  provide for a court to consider ‘‘special  circumstances’’, so that a debtor can  show that he doesn’t have the ability  to repay, and should stay in chapter 7.  The bill excludes from the means test  poor people, those individuals who are  below the median income. So if individuals can pay and they really don’t have  the ability to pay, they will continue  to have their debts fully discharged in  chapter 7 bankruptcy, while those who  do have assets cannot hide them from  their creditors and escape repayment.  Let me mention a couple of things  this bill does not do. This bill doesn’t  put the credit card companies first or  leaves hard working  families out to  dry, as some of the bill’s detractors  have claimed. In fact, the bill helps  women and children and improves their  situation when someone files for bankruptcy because it provides new priorities and tools so that child support  and alimony will be collected before  other creditors. We move child support  up in priority, up to number one from  number seven in line, and that means  that they will be paid before a lot of  other creditors,  including the credit  card companies. The bill makes staying current on child support a condition of discharge. We provide that debt  discharge in bankruptcy is made conditional upon full payment of past due  child support and alimony.  Domestic  support  obligations  are  automatically non-dischargeable, without the costs of litigation. The bill also  makes payment of child support arrears a condition of plan confirmation.  The bill provides better notice and  more  information to  facilitate child  support collection, and tracking down  deadbeat parents. Further, the bill protects the name of a debtor’s minor children from public disclosure in a bankruptcy case.  This bill also doesn’t help credit card  companies and other lenders take advantage of honest consumers, as some  have alleged. In fact, the bankruptcy  bill contains some new real and significant consumer protections. The bill requires credit card companies to make  new disclosures that benefit customers  and prohibits deceptive advertising of  low  introductory  rates.  It  requires  credit card companies to provide key  information about how much money  people owe and how long it will take to  payoff their credit card debt by only  making a minimum payment. The bill  requires  lenders to prominently disclose when late fees will be imposed,  the date on which introductory or teaser rates will expire, and what the permanent rate will be after that time.  The bill also prohibits  lenders  from  canceling an account because the consumer pays the balance in full each  month to avoid finance charges.  The bill also provides that consumers  will be given a toll-free number to call  where they can get information about  how long it will take to payoff their  own credit card balances if they only  make minimum payments on their balance. This will  educate  consumers  about their financial situations. In addition, the bill allows for more judicial  oversight of reaffirmation agreements,  to protect consumers from being pressured into onerous agreements.  The bankruptcy bill also includes a  debtor’s bill of rights to prevent bankruptcy mills from preying upon those  who are uninformed of their rights.  The bill provides for penalties on creditors who refuse to renegotiate reasonable  payment  schedules  outside  of  bankruptcy. The bill provides for penalties on creditors who fail to properly  credit plan payments in bankruptcy.  The bill strengthens enforcement and  penalties against abusive creditors for  predatory debt collection practices. Finally, the bill contains credit counseling  programs  to help  consumers  avoid the cycle of indebtedness.  So with the bankruptcy bill, we’ve  tried to close loopholes in the system  and eliminate abuses. We’ve created  new consumer protections. We’ve made  chapter 12 permanent. We’ve made sure  that financial markets are not subject  to risk. Although the bill doesn’t contain everything I would have liked to  include, it is a good start to putting an  end to the abuses.  It has been a long haul, but I think  we are finally seeing this bill through  to the end. And there are many people  that I’d like to thank because they’ve  been instrumental in getting us to this  point. I’ve been quite busy lately as  chairman of the Finance Committee,  working on social security, medicare  and tax reform. I take that responsibility very seriously. Because of Finance Committee markup and hearing  conflicts, I have had to rely on my colleagues  to manage  this bill on  the  floor. But the job has been in very good  hands.  In’ particular, I appreciate Senator  HATCH and the diligence that he has  shown towards this bill. On more than  one occasion, he made sure that the  bankruptcy bill made it through the  committee process so that we could  have it considered on the floor. He has  stepped up to the plate many a time to  manage the bill, work on compromises,  and keep the engines running.

288,192,2005-03-10,Mr. THOMAS.," Mr. President, today, I  rise to introduce the ‘‘Electric Transmission and Reliability Enhancement  Act of 2005’’. It is my intention to build  on the competitive wholesale open access policies adopted by the Congress  in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. My legislation would  extend  and  improve  these open, non-discriminatory access  policies;  remove  antiquated  federal  statutory barriers that stand  in the  way of competitive wholesale markets;  encourage increased investment in our  transmission system and establish enforceable reliability standards to help  ensure the continued reliability of the  interstate transmission system.  The Congress has been debating how  to update the antiquated statutory and  regulatory  framework governing  the  electric industry for over eight years.  We repeatedly have tried and failed to  enact  legislation that would provide  the right economic signals and regulatory certainty necessary for industry  and wholesale market modernization.  The loser in all of this has been the  consumer, who has been denied the full  benefits that access provides to fairly  priced,  reliable  supplies of power.  I  have come to the conclusion that if we  are to legislate successfully, we will  have to pare down our wish list to the  bare essentials plus those issues necessary for the electric industry to attract the capital it needs to keep our  lights on and ensure that customers  pay no more for their power than is  fair and necessary.  It seems clear that if truly competitive wholesale markets are to exist,  there is a need to ensure that all industry  participants  play  by  the  same  rules. While the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has tried to ensure  this, the Commission’s tools are limited. Only Congress can give FERC the  tools it needs to ensure that all industry participants in competitive wholesale markets play by the same rules.  Under present federal law FERC has  no jurisdiction or authority over transmission  facilities  owned  by  public  power agencies, municipalities and cooperatives. In the West these types of  entities own a substantial portion, perhaps as much as half of the interstate  electric  transmission  system. As  a  matter of fact, in the Western Electric  Coordinating Council, an area that encompasses all or part of 11 Western  states and parts of Canada, non-FERC  jurisdictional facilities account for 52  percent of transmission miles.  My legislation would permit FERC to  require certain nonregulated utilities  to offer transmission service at comparable  rates  to  those  they  charge  themselves, and on terms and conditions comparable to those applicable to  jurisdictional  public  utilities.  Currently nonregulated transmitting utilities would not be subject to the full  panoply of FERC regulation under this  provision.  Instead, a  ‘‘light handed’’  form of regulation would apply and  small nonregulated entities, such as  those that sell less than 4,000,000 MW/h  per year, would be entirely exempt  from these nondiscrimination requirements.  It also seems clear that the Public  Utility Holding Company Act is hindering necessary restructuring of the  industry and the deployment of capital  into an industry that desperately needs  it. Investors are deterred simply because they do not want to deal with the  PUHCA rules and restrictions. If repealed, utility securities will continue  to be regulated by the SEC, FERC and  most state commissions. Mergers and  acquisitions  of  jurisdictional  assets  would  still  require FERC and  state  commission approval and review by the  Department of Justice, DOJ, and the  Federal Trade Commission, FTC. FERC  and state commissions would still be  able  to monitor  rates  and  prevent  cross-subsidies.  Despite State  progress  in  administering the Public Utility Regulatory  Policies Act of 1978, it is clear that  PURPA continues to provide special  privileges to certain favored generators  at the expense of utilities and their  customers. Like PUHCA, PURPA is no  longer needed in today’s competitive  wholesale markets. My legislation prospectively eliminates the mandatory  purchase  and  sell  obligations  of  PURPA.  Over the years the grid has been well  protected through voluntary standards  established  by  the North American  Electric Reliability Council. NERC’s  voluntary reliability standards—which  are  not  enforceable—have  generally  been complied with by  the electric  power industry. But with the opening  of the wholesale power market to competition, our transmission grid is being  used in ways for which it was not designed. New system strains are also  being  created  by  the  break-up  of  vertically integrated utilities and by  the emergence of new market structures and participants. The results of  these changes have been an increase in  the number and severity of violations  of NERC’s voluntary rules.  My legislation converts the existing  NERC  voluntary  reliability  system  into a mandatory reliability system. A  North  America-wide  organization  would have the authority to establish  and enforce reliability standards, and  take into account regional differences.  The new reliability organization will  be run by market participants, and will  be overseen by the FERC in the U.S.  The organization will be made up of  representatives of everyone who is affected—residential, commercial and industrial consumers; State public utility  commissions;  independent power  producers; electric utilities and others.  There is no question that we need a  new system to safeguard the integrity  of our electric grid. My  legislation  would do this, using language that was  agreed upon in the last Congress by  House and Senate conferees for the energy bill.  During the last energy debate, efforts  were made to address some of the more  egregious behavior and attempted market manipulation by certain entities  through legislation. While this area is  obviously very complex, we need to address this issue if regulatory gaps truly  do exist. I realize my attempt might  not be perfect, but I wanted to initiate  discussion on this very important topic  if in fact regulatory agencies do need  additional  authority  to  police  and  monitor the industry.  My legislation will provide more information on prices of electricity and  VerDate Aug 04 2004  05:03 Mar 11, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A10MR6.032 S10PT1 ",2005
289,199,2005-03-10,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, the second reason I rise is literally a coincidental but important offshoot of what  Christopher Dodd, Senator DODD’s father, did at  the Nuremberg Trials.  What they did—he and Justice Jackson—was  they understood  that you  could uncover, deal with, and expose to  the world atrocities humanity commits  upon humanity and at the same time  do it under the rule of law, give people  a fair trial, actually abide by what we  say we stand for.  All of us are aware of the genocide  now taking place in the Darfur region  of Sudan. We passed a resolution last  July which called Khartoum’s abuses  in Darfur genocide, which is what they  were, what they are, and what they  continue to be. The then-Secretary of  State Colin Powell made the same assessment in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  in  September of 2004.  The President of the United States,  President Bush, signed legislation imposing sanctions on Khartoum for the  actions in Darfur this past December.  With the signing of the North-South  Peace Agreement on January 9, administration officials believed the situation in Darfur would improve. Unfortunately, they have only gotten worse.

A  lifetime hunter and fisher, Mr. Gibson soon realized his true passion was in the outdoors, and  he followed his calling to become the most famous wilderness guide in our area.  Johnny dedicated his life to introducing people to the enchanting wildlife and beauty of the  West Tennessee countryside. Some of his patrons have included country music stars, such  as Ricky Shelton, Hank Williams Jr., and Little  Jimmy Dickens, and political leaders like Walter Mondale and Al Gore. His years as a guide  behind him, he is now dedicated to spending  time with his wife of 43 years, Jane, their five  children and ten grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me today in  recognizing  the exceptional  service of my  friend, Mr. Johnny Gibson.  f  IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP, AND  NATIONAL  SECURITY:  THE  SILENT INVASION  HON. THOMAS G. TANCREDO  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 10, 2005  ",2005
291,206,2005-03-10,Mr. TANCREDO.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to submit the foreword to an article I authored  in  the Fall 2004 special migration  issue of  Mediterranean Quarterly. People on the Move:  The Security, Social, and Economic  Implications of Migration Foreword  The long cycles of history are revealing to  those who study  them but may harbor surprises for those who choose to ignore them.  The editors of Mediterranean Quarterly, cognizant of lessons learned or ignored, decided  to take a closer look at a pattern of history  that seems to be at the core of current global  instability:  the mass migration of people  in  search of basic means of survival, or just survival from brutal rulers.  On an annual basis, approximately 100 million people either attempt  to or actually do  leave  their place of birth, often not knowing  where they will end up. More than 10 million  illegal  immigrants have entered  the United  States since the last ‘‘amnesty’’ in 1986, and  the flow continues despite the promises of the  North American Free Trade Agreement. Close  to 1 million Albanians, almost one-fourth of the  country’s population, have sought  refuge  in  neighboring countries since  the collapse of  their country’s communist  regime. Tens of  thousands of Turks leave their country annually in search of work in Western Europe and  endure the consequences of cultural discrimination. More tragically, young women from the  poorest components of the former Soviet Empire have vanished into the jungle of human  trafficking and become commodities in an ugly  form of trade that is managed by the new barons of a dangerous underworld. Recent statistics assembled by Greek authorities estimate  that seventeen thousand women are being exploited by sex merchants in the Balkans alone.  Albanian mafia lords, in association with their  former enemies and with links all the way to  Afghanistan, control  lucrative drug, gun, and  human-smuggling operations across national  borders with relative impunity. And as in times  past, the Mediterranean Sea has become the  crossroads of people on  the move and  the  stage on which human tragedy unfolds almost  on a daily basis.  Human cargoes float from island to island in  the eastern Aegean, with boat crews waiting  for the opportunity to dump these people on  dry land, after having extracted the last ounce  of resources  from  their helpless victims. On  the African shores of Gibraltar, thousands of  Africans patiently wait for the first opportunity  to cross the narrow stretch of water and set  foot on European soil. Egyptians, Iraqis, Pakistanis, Filipinos, and Bangladeshis have landed on  Italian, Greek, French, and Spanish  shores over the years. They bring along their  poverty, their energies, and their hopes. They  also bring social, political, and now security  concerns.  More than a dozen scholars, policy makers,  and political leaders present diverse views on  this critical  issue  in  these pages. The  lead  essay, on  the security  implications of  illegal  migration for the United States, is written by  Congressman Tom Tancredo, Republican of  Colorado, and the unfolding drama of African  refugees  is provided by Francis M. Deng,  United Nations  representative  for  internally  displaced persons. Rochelle Gershuni, head of  Israel’s Ministry of Justice, addresses sex exploitation and human  trafficking and  its consequences for her country. Scholars of diverse  origins and  viewpoints deal with migration  issues  in Spain, Egypt, Turkey, and Greece  and  the South-North migration  in  the United  States and Canada. Naturally, we do not pretend that we provide a complete picture of a  huge historical phenomenon, but we do hope  to spark a debate on the social, policy, security, and economic  implications  caused by  ‘‘people on the move.’’  Historical patterns show  that mass population movements have altered cultures, demolished empires, given birth  to new ones,  and ultimately compelled humankind to organize itself into nation-states, with sovereignty  determining their national characters. Now the  nation-state that saw its birth in the Treaty of  Westphalia is in retreat as an organizing concept  of  human  events.  Multiculturalism,  globalization, poverty, and  the North-South  global economic divide have altered the patterns of civilization to a degree unprecedented  since  the eastern  tribes overwhelmed  the  Roman Empire and the Ottomans reached the  gates of Vienna.  The advanced  industrial democracies,  the  ultimate destination of people on  the move,  have shown a lack of vision about the implications of mass movements of people in search  of a livelihood. In their pursuit of high profits  with cheap  labor  in  the shortest  time,  they  have adopted  immigration policies  that no  longer facilitate the orderly integration of cultures and the peaceful evolution of new forms  of ethnic identity. Instead of inviting potential  citizens seeking a better life, the industrial nations have institutionalized the transplantation  of ethnic communities and have set in motion  a process for their own national balkanization.  The essays included in this special issue of  Mediterranean Quarterly (with more to follow  in future issues) examine problems caused by  migration both in countries of destination and  countries of origin. It behooves the first to examine  their social policies and  the  latter  to  come to grips with their inability to match national resources with their peoples’ needs. By  selectively examining problems on both sides  of the divide, the editors hope to spark a debate that will be grounded on the reality that  a silent invasion is under way that could, if left  unattended,  transform world politics and  foment global turmoil for generations to come.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

294,213,2005-03-10,Mr. ROTHMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  join with my colleagues and Tibetan communities around  the world  to commemorate Tibetan Uprising Day, and to draw attention to  the continued serious human  rights abuses  committed by the People’s Republic of China.  On March 10, 1959, in reaction to rumors  that the Chinese were planning to kill or kidnap the Dalai Lama, thousands of Tibetan refugees  courageously  surrounded  the Dalai  Lama’s compound and began calling for the  Chinese to leave Tibet. This marked the beginning of the ‘‘Lhasa Uprising.’’ On March 17,  1959, fearing that Chinese troops would massacre the thousands of refugees who were refusing orders to disperse, the Dalai Lama disguised himself and took flight to India. Forty-  eight hours  later, believing  the Dalai Lama  was still inside, Chinese troops began shelling  his compound and other targets in Lhasa, killing  thousands of mostly unarmed civilians.  Chinese statistics estimate that 87,000 Tibetans  from all parts of Tibet were killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps during the  1959 Uprising. Only a small number of  the  thousands who fled to India survived Chinese  military attacks, malnutrition, cold and disease.  Over  the past 46 years, Tibetans  inside  Tibet and  in exile around  the world have  bravely  fought against  tremendous odds  to  preserve  their religious  identity, culture, and  history. It is estimated that 1.5 million Tibetans  have died as a result of Chinese occupation  since 1949 and 6000 monasteries,  temples,  and other cultural buildings were destroyed.  And  today, Tibetans,  including monks and  nuns, are continually persecuted for practicing  their religion, and voicing their support for His  Holiness the Dalai Lama. In fact, five Tibetan  monks were  jailed by Chinese authorities  in  February of this year for allegedly publishing  politically sensitive poems, and were given  sentences of two to three years.  The U.S. government has continually supported Tibetan self-determination, and  I am  proud of the dedication of the U.S. Congress  to drawing attention to the gross human rights  abuses committed by the People’s Republic of  China against  the Tibetan people. We must  continue to support the dialogue between His  Holiness the Dalai Lama and the government  of China, and remain committed to a peaceful  resolution  to  this  tragic conflict, keeping  in  mind our shared values of freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, and freedom from tyranny.  I commend to you the statement written by  His Holiness the Dalai Lama in commemoration of Tibetan Uprising Day, and I am honored to submit the statement in its entirety for  the RECORD.  THESTATEMENTOFHISHOLINESSTHEDALAI  LAMAONTHE46THANNIVERSARYOFTHETIBETANNATIONALUPRISINGDAY  On the occasion of the 46th anniversary of  the Tibetan People’s Uprising, I convey my  warm greetings to my  fellow Tibetans  in  Tibet and in exile and to our friends around  the world.  During these more than four decades great  changes have taken place in Tibet. There has  been a great deal of economic progress along  with  development  in  infrastructure. The  Golmud-Lhasa railway  link that  is being  built is a case in point. However, during the  same period much has been written by independent journalists and travelers to Tibet  about the real situation in Tibet and not  what they have been shown. Most of them  portray a very different picture than what  the  Chinese  government  claims,  clearly  criticizing China about the lack of human  rights,  religious  freedom and  self-rule  in  Tibet. What has actually happened and is  still happening is that since the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region the  real authority has been solely held by Chinese leaders. As for the Tibetan people, they  have been facing suspicions and growing restrictions. The lack of true ethnic equality  and harmony based on trust, and the absence  of genuine stability in Tibet clearly shows  that things are not well in Tibet and that basically there is a problem.  Prominent and respected Tibetan leaders  in Tibet have spoken out on this from time  to time and even suffered because of their  courageous acts. In the early 1960s, the late  Panchen Lama outlined the sufferings and  aspirations of the Tibetan people in his petition to the Chinese leaders. Baba Phuntsok  Wangyal, one of the foremost Tibetan communist leaders, in his recent biography published in English dwells at length on the  need to meet the interests of the Tibetan  people. In fact, it is clear that most senior  Tibetan officials  in Tibet deep  in  their  hearts are extremely dissatisfied.  This year  the Chinese government will  mark the 40th anniversary of the establishment  of  the Tibet Autonomous Region.  There will be much fanfare and many commemorative events to celebrate the occasion  but these will be meaningless when they do  not reflect the ground realities. For example,  the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural  Revolution were celebrated with great pomp  as real achievements at the time they took  place.  China  has made  tremendous  economic  progress during the past more than two decades. China today is not what it was twenty  or thirty years ago. Much has changed in  China. As a result she has become a major  player in the world and China rightly deserves this position. It is a big nation with a  huge population and a rich and ancient civilization. However, China’s  image  is  tarnished by her human rights records, undemocratic actions, the lack of the rule of law and  the unequal  implementation of autonomy  rights regarding minorities,  including the  Tibetans. All these are a cause for more suspicion and distrust from the outside world.  Internally, they are an obstacle to unity and  stability that are of utmost importance to  the leaders of the People’s Republic of China.  In my view, it is important that as China becomes a powerful and respectable nation she  should be able to adopt a reasonable policy  with confidence.  The world in general, of which China is a  part, is changing for the better. In recent  times there is definitely a greater awareness  and appreciation for peace, non-violence, democracy, justice and environmental protection. The  recent unprecedented  response  from governments and individuals across the  world to the tsunami disaster victims reaffirms that the world is truly interdependent  and the  importance of universal responsibility.  My involvement in the affairs of Tibet is  not for the purpose of claiming certain personal rights or political position for myself  not attempting to stake claims for the Tibetan administration in exile. In 1992 in a  formal announcement I stated clearly that  when we return to Tibet with a certain degree of freedom I will not hold any office in  the Tibetan government or any other political position and that the present Tibetan  administration  in exile will be dissolved.  Moreover, the Tibetans working  in Tibet  should carry on the main responsibility of  administering Tibet.  I once again want to reassure the Chinese  authorities that as long as I am responsible  for the affairs of Tibet we remain fully committed to the Middle Way Approach of not  seeking independence for Tibet and are willing to remain within the People’s Republic  VerDate Aug 04 2004  05:34 Mar 11, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A10MR8.026 E10PT1 ",2005
295,220,2005-03-10,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the Winnetka Park District on 100  years of service to our community.  In 1904, a group of  concerned  citizens  wanted to restore a piece of land in front of  the  village  train  station, which  had  been  strewn with debris from the local livery stable.  This small band of citizens came together and  collected  the $8,548.30 needed  to purchase  what is now Station Park.  From  those  humble  beginnings,  the  Winnetka Park District has developed into 28  park sites that represent more than 244 acres  of  land. The  lands under  the control of  the  Park District include some of the most beautiful shoreline of Lake Michigan. And from the  initial investment of $8,548.30, the district now  boasts a $9 million annual operating budget.  Through  these 100 years, with  the needs  and  desires  of  the  public  in mind,  the  Winnetka Park District has added new facilities  to meet  the continually growing population. Now, nearly 14,500 citizens enjoy the  Park District’s facilities, which include an 18-  hole championship golf course plus a par-3  course, the first indoor tennis facilities in the  Chicago area, platform  tennis courts, an  indoor ice arena, two outdoor rinks, four public  beaches, a skate park, and a 142-acre expanse of playfield.  The Winnetka Park District also runs hundreds  of  recreation  programs,  from  day  camps,  to athletics,  to classes. The district  plans special events throughout the year, and  thousands partake annually in skating, tennis  and golf lessons.  For one hundred years the Winnetka Park  District worked to provide a balance of quality  recreational and  leisure opportunities  to a  growing community, while protecting the natural resources and open spaces for the benefit  of future generations. I hope that the next hundred years is as successful.  f  IN MEMORY OF JIMMY RIDDLE  HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 10, 2005  ",2005
296,220,2005-03-10,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  give  tribute  to Jimmy Riddle,  from  the 26th  Congressional District of Texas, for his contributions to his community, country and other  nations. Mr. Riddle was working  for SOC–  SMG, which disposes of munitions  in  Iraq,  when an explosive was detonated within his  convoy, which took his life and that of a co-  worker. Mr. Riddle was 53 years old.  I would like to recognize and celebrate Mr.  Riddle’s life today. Jimmy Riddle consistently  served others  throughout his  life. He  joined  the Marine Corps while  in college and was  stationed  in Japan shortly after  the Vietnam  War. After serving for our country, Mr. Riddle  became  an  officer  for  both  the Sulphur  Springs and Carollton Police Departments in  Texas.  In addition to his career, he spent considerable  time with his  family and promoted  the  ideals of being a servant to his children. As a  result, his son Chris joined the U.S. Navy. Recently, Mr. Riddle was working as a defense  contractor in Bosnia during which time he was  able to see his son Chris for the first time in  two years. Shortly after  this meeting, Chris  was killed by a drunk driver. Always looking to  serve others, Mr. Riddle joined the SOC–SMG  and went to Iraq. Just as in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Qatar, the people in Iraq appreciated  Mr. Riddle and  respected him  for his kindheartedness and devotion to helping others.  It was my honor to represent Jimmy. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family and  friends. He was best described by his fellow  workers as an ‘‘unsung hero.’’  HONORING  THE  BASKETWEAVER,  COLEMAN  ACCOMPLISHED  MRS.  SUE  HON. JIM GIBBONS  OFNEVADA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 10, 2005  ",2005
297,220,2005-03-10,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the accomplishments of a truly remarkable woman, Sue Coleman. Mrs. Coleman is a member of the Washo nation on the  Dresslerville Reservation in my home state of  Nevada. Mrs. Coleman is nationally known as  a master in the art of basket weaving. Her art  is not only known in Nevada, but throughout  the nation.  Mrs. Coleman comes from a long line of distinguished basket weavers. She  learned  the  art of weaving  through her mother, Theresa  Smokey Jackson. Together with her mother,  Mrs.  Coleman  gathered  willow,  stripped,  cleaned and made thread by splitting the willows in three sections with their teeth. With the  wisdom and guidance of her mother, Mrs.  Coleman has a very diverse portfolio of artistic  designs. These  include; cradleboards, round  baskets, burden baskets, seed beaters and  winnowing trays all of which are true weaves  of the Washo tradition.  Mrs. Coleman has  received many prestigious awards for her art, and has won over  forty  first place  ribbons  for her baskets  in  many western art competitions. In 2002, she  was awarded the prestigious Governor’s Arts  Award for Excellence in Folk Arts. She is also  part of  the committee  that  is organizing  the  Folklife Festival that will be held on the National Mall in 2006. In addition to her many  other roles, Mrs. Coleman has the honor to be  part of the committee for the Smithsonian Museum’s  ‘‘Carriers of Culture: Contemporary  Native Baskets’’. One of her hand-crafted baskets is even part of the Smithsonian’s permanent collection and will be included in a travel  exhibit  that will  feature  the  finest baskets  made by Native Americans.  Mr. Speaker, prior  to  the passing of her  mother, Mrs. Coleman  promised  that  she  would continue the tradition that they enjoyed  together and pass weaving along  to  future  generations, so  that  this wonderful art will  never be forgotten. It is clear that with her with  passion and dedication to this rich cultural art  that she will continue to honor her mother’s  wishes. I am proud to have this opportunity to  acknowledge her work.  f  RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS  OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL OF  CRANSTON HIGH SCHOOL WEST  WITH REGARD TO  ‘‘THE FEINSTEIN YOUTH HUNGER BRIGADE  PROGRAM’’  HON.

301,11,2005-04-04,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, today  we mourn the passing of a great man.  In the long history of Roman Catholic  Popes, John Paul  II  is among  the  greatest  in championing human dignity. He also was a champion for the  sanctity of human life and for the family and for working for the good of his  Church. He is the kind of leader who  only comes along once in a very great  long time.  As the most traveled pontiff of all  time, Pope John Paul personally delivered hope, encouragement, and inspiration to more people  in more places  than any other person in human history. And he was especially beloved by  the youth, the future of our world, with  whom he had a very special relationship.  Catholics  and  non-Catholics  alike  should feel fortunate to have had such  a leader in our midst, a man who gave  so much to humanity.  Undeterred, perhaps even driven a bit  harder by an assassin’s bullets, this devout man embarked on an exhausting  journey over a quarter of a century to  spread words of freedom, compassion,  and justice. His mission seems to have  been nothing less than redemption of  the world. Surely, but for men such as  this, the world would have long fallen  into irreparable chaos and decline.  Elected Bishop of Rome on October  16, 1978, Pope John Paul II’s faith and  courage was  forged and proven as a  Polish priest standing up to the horrors of the Soviet Union. He took his  stance at a time when dissidents were  whisked away in the dark, never to be  heard from again. Yet John Paul’s perseverance  eventually  awakened  the  soul of a nation of secret believers who  stood in candlelit solidarity to bring  down an evil empire.  According  to  Harvard  theologian  George Williams, a Protestant who befriended the Pope many years ago, he  is an imposing man in physique, big in  intellectual vision, who deeply enjoys  people. In a most remarkable way, he  is a man whose soul is at leisure with  himself.  Only two Popes have served longer  and none with more sustained vigor,  clarity, or cheerfulness. Even after his  step faltered and his voice began to  waiver, he bore his  infirmities with  honor and humor. Although his body  was failing, his indomitable spirit continued to touch the world and teach us  about the strength and promise of the  human heart.  This great Pope was loved by people  of various religions and across ideological spectrums. Even many who disagreed with him respected his grand vision and his convictions. Having captured the world’s attention and admiration by standing for our better angels for so long, Pope John Paul II will  surely  stand with President Ronald  Reagan as one of the giants of our  time.  Both men understood deeply where  the hope of mankind lay—in faith, in  courage, in liberty. On October 11, 2001,  1 month after the devastating terrorist  attacks of 9/11, John Paul offered this  prayer:  O God almighty and merciful, he who sows  discord cannot understand You. He who loves  violence cannot welcome You. Watch over us  in our painful condition, tried by the brutal  acts of terrorism and death. Comfort Your  children and open our hearts to hope that in  our time, we again may know serenity and  peace.  I can only add my own amen to that  prayer.  I yield the floor to Senator ALEXANDERunder the terms of the previous  order.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.  ",2005
302,11,2005-04-04,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President, I  thank the Senator from Texas. I join  with him in his thoughts about Pope  John Paul II and the thoughts of our  other colleagues that have been expressed. He was a man of sincerity and  great character. He traveled more than  any other Pope. He traveled the United  States more than any other Pope. He  carried a message of peace. He carried  a message of charity. He had a profound impact on the world and his native country of Poland. It can fairly be  said that Poland would not have overthrown communism, at least not when  it did, had it not been for Pope John  Paul.  I remember in 1987, our family had  lived in Australia for 6 months, three  teenagers and a  7-year-old, and we  came home from around the world in a  little different way. We took a train  from Moscow to Paris. This was before  the Berlin Wall came down. All of us,  our different ages in our family, remember how in Poland the churches  were open and vibrant, they were active, and people were there. In Russia,  they were museums.

306,18,2005-04-04,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today with a heavy heart and deep  sense of gratitude to honor the life of a  brave young man from Bluffton. Master Sergeant Michael Hiester, 33 years  old, was one of four Indiana National  Guardsmen who died on March 26 when  a land mine exploded under their military vehicle south of Kabul. With his  life before him, Michael risked everything to fight for the values Americans  hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.  A devoted father of two young children, Michael served as a part-time  firefighter in his hometown of Bluffton,  in addition to being a member of the  Indiana National Guard. Like most  things Michael set his mind to, he was  successful  in his military career. A  full-time Guardsman  since  1990, Michael was promoted to master sergeant  3 months ago. He had previously served  his country in Bosnia-Herzegovina as  part of  the  Indiana Guard’s peacekeeping  assignment.  According  to  friends and family, Michael was also a  real estate appraiser and an avid athlete who  loved diving and  cycling.  Mayor Ted Ellis shared memories of  Michael with  the Associated Press,  saying, that he ‘‘was just the kind of  guy that every parent wants their child  to be like—outgoing and hardworking  and always thinking about something  that they could do out there for the  community.’’ I stand here today to express gratitude for Michael’s sacrifices  and  for  those made  by  the  entire  Hiester family on behalf of our country.  Michael was killed while serving his  country in Operation Enduring Freedom. He was a member of the Indiana  National Guard’s  76th  Infantry Brigade. This brave young soldier leaves  behind his wife Dawn, a  6-year-old  daughter, Emily, and a 4-year-old son,  Adam.  Today, I join Michael’s family, his  friends and the entire Bluffton community in mourning his death. While we  struggle to bear our sorrow over this  loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make  the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of  Michael, a memory  that will burn  brightly during these continuing days  of conflict and grief.  Michael was known for his dedication  to  family and his  love of country.  Today and always, Michael will be remembered by family members, friends  and fellow Hoosiers as a true American  hero and we honor the sacrifice he  made while dutifully serving his country.  As I search for words to do justice in  honoring Michael’s sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln’s remarks  as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ‘‘We cannot  dedicate, we  cannot  consecrate, we  cannot hallow this ground. The brave  men, living and dead, who struggled  here, have consecrated it, far above our  poor power  to add or detract. The  world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never  forget what they did here.’’ This statement is just as true today as it was  nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain  that the impact of Michael’s actions  will live on far longer than any record  of these words.  It is my sad duty to enter the name  of Michael Hiester  in  the CONGRESSIONALRECORDof the U.S. Senate for  his service to this country and for his  profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about  this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that  comes with the loss of our heroes, I  hope that families like Michael’s can  find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ‘‘He will swallow up  death in victory; and the Lord God will  wipe away tears from off all faces.’’  May God grant strength and peace to  those who mourn, and may God be with  all of you, as I know He is with Michael.  ARMYSPECIALISTBRETTM. HERSHEY  Mr. President, I also wish to honor  the life of a brave young man who grew  up in Indianapolis. Army SPC Brett M.  Hershey, 23 years old, was one of four  Indiana National Guardsmen who died  on March 26th when a land mine exploded under  their military vehicle  south of Kabul. With his entire life before him, Brett risked everything to  fight  for the values Americans hold  close to our hearts, in a land halfway  around the world.  A  2000 graduate of North Central  High School in Indianapolis, Brett was  just seven credits shy of graduating  from  Indiana University  in Bloomington, when he left for Afghanistan.  Friends and teachers recount that at  North Central, Brett was a model student with an ever-present smile, who  was involved in religious groups, varsity lacrosse and student government.  Brett’s older brother, Nate, recalled his  brother’s vibrant spirit when speaking  to the Indianapolis Star saying, Brett  ‘‘loved people very well, and he loved  them because his first love was Jesus.  He was  funny, witty and passionate  about just sucking the marrow out of  life. He always wanted people to know  they were loved.’’  Brett was killed while serving his  country in Operation Enduring Freedom. He was a member of the Indiana  National Guard’s  76th  Infantry Brigade.

307,25,2005-04-04,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, a  Federal budget is about setting priorities, and the priorities contained in  this budget are all wrong.  About a year ago, Tom Friedman of  the New York Times, described the  President’s  budget  as  ‘‘faith-based.’’  Faith-based tax cuts were going to generate faith-based revenues, and we were  all going to be better off. Well, the deficit is skyrocketing, interest rates are  going  up,  and  additional  revenues  haven’t magically appeared.  If the budget before us were to pass  unchanged, the deficit would increase  each and every year for the foreseeable  future. Vermonters understand  that  this is a burden we don’t want to pass  on to our grandchildren. We have fallen  into a borrowing pattern that makes  this Yankee cringe.  But let me emphasize that the deficits that we are now facing are primarily caused by a drop in revenues,  not  by wasteful  spending  on  such  things as education, veterans’ benefits,  and Amtrak. We could eliminate all of  the  Federal  Government’s  discretionary spending outside of defense and  we would still have a deficit.  On the mandatory side of the budget,  I agree that we need to get a handle on  increases in Medicaid spending and the  pressures on Social Security due to the  aging baby boom generation. But this  budget  fails to confront these challenges and in the case of Social Security pretends there is no problem.  How can we pass a budget that ignores the cost of the Iraq War after  September 30? How can we pass a budget that includes more tax cuts for the  few, but doesn’t budget for the reform  of the alternative minimum tax or the  President’s own Social Security proposal?  How can we pass a budget that forces  us to ‘‘pay for’’ any increases in programs  for our neediest citizens but  doesn’t require us to ‘‘pay for’’ tax cuts  for the well-to-do? If we are to reinstate the pay-as-you-go rule, then it  should, as it always has, include paying  for both new spending and new tax  cuts.  Speaking of tax cuts, I have grown  very tired of the economic doublespeak  now in fashion. If tax cuts were the  policy of choice when we had large surpluses, and they are still the policy of  choice when we now have large deficits,  when if ever are tax cuts not the appropriate policy? Perhaps the families in  Vermont who used up their heating assistance funds before winter was over,  or the veteran on a waiting list for a  medical procedure at a VA hospital,  would prefer an increase in government  spending to a tax cut.  Priorities, it is all about priorities.  We are 2 years into a war. American  service men and women continue to  come home with horrific wounds, both  physical and mental. While the Department of Defense is keeping wounded  soldiers  in  its medical  system  for  longer periods of time and is shouldering a greater share of the costs, the  long-term costs of health care and rehabilitation still fall heaviest on the  Veterans Administration.  This  budget  responds  by  underfunding the VA by almost $16 billion  over the next 5 years. How can we do  this in the midst of a war? How can the  President in good conscience insist on  maintaining large numbers of troops in  Iraq, and yet refuse to provide for the  health care needs of veterans? This is  unacceptable.  This  budget  drastically  cuts  the  Community Development Block Grant,  CDBG, program and other programs  that our communities rely on. These  programs  now  benefit  so  many  Vermonters who struggle to make ends  meet. This budget would consolidate 18  programs,  including  the CDBG, and  slashes their funding by 34 percent. In  Vermont,  this  budget would most  harshly affect middle and low-income  citizens by making safe and affordable  housing unattainable, ending quality  childcare programs, and compromising  nutrition assistance. Funding for these  important economic development programs must be restored.  I am very concerned that agriculture,  conservation, and food assistance programs are faced with drastic cuts in  funding. The Milk Income Loss Contract Program, MILC, which the President saw fit to include in his proposed  budget, has been left out of this budget  resolution. The MILC Program is necessary to help family farmers through  tough times when milk prices are low.

308,39,2005-04-04,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce the ‘‘American Indian Reservation Transportation  Improvement Program Act.’’ This act will  provide the people of Indian Country  with the resources they need to upgrade their decaying road system.  In 1982, when I served on the Senate  Environment and Public Works Committee, several members of the Navajo  Nation Tribal Council Committee on  Transportation approached me with an  interesting proposition. These Navajo  Councilmen  believed  the  time  had  come for Indian tribes to participate  directly in our National Highway Trust  Fund programs.  I agreed with these gentlemen, the  Senate agreed with me, and the Congress and President Reagan approved  Indian tribal participation in the U.S.  Department of Transportation highway  construction program for the first time  in our Nation’s history.  By the mid-1980s, Indian Reservation  Roads, IRR, funding was at about $100  million per year nationwide. By the  late 1980s, however, IRR funding fell to  about $80 million per year. In the Intermodal  Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA, for the 1990s, we  were able to raise this critical highway  construction funding to about $190 million per year.  Then, in TEA–21, The Transportation  Equity Act for the 21st Century, we  succeeded in bringing annual IRR funding up to $275 million for fiscal years  1999 through 2003.  As we seek to promote economic opportunities on our Nation’s tribal reservations,  I believe  it  is  imperative  that we once again increase this vital  infrastructure  funding.  I  am  aware  that many groups have advocated for  much greater increases in funding for  Indian Reservation Roads. While I am  sympathetic to the need for such large  increases, I am keenly aware of competing needs around the country for  medical research, economic stimulus,  and for our national defense, to name  just a few. Therefore, I am compelled  to recommend increases for the IRR  program that are more likely to win  acceptance among my colleagues.  For highway construction, I am recommending an immediate increase of  $55 million in the first year to a new  total of $330 million. My bill would  then increase the amount for construction by $30 million each year so that  the program receives $480 million in  the final year of the authorization. For  the Indian bridge program, I am recommending $15 million per year, an increase of $6 million annually. And for  state  roads  that  serve as key bus  routes for Indian children, primarily on  our Nation’s  largest  Indian  reservation—the Navajo Nation—I am recommending increasing this vital funding  from $1.5 million per year to $3 million  to retroactively fund fiscal years 2004  and 2005, to $4 million in fiscal years  2006 and 2007, and $5 million for fiscal  years 2008 and 2009.  My final recommendation is to create a rural transit program for Indian  reservations.  Because  the  Federal  Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration each have  their areas of expertise that can make  such a program a success, my legislation will require the two agencies to  work together for the benefit of the  tribes who participate in this program.  My suggestion is to fund this program  at $20 million.  In closing, I thank the Navajo Nation  Transportation  Committee  and  the  tribal  transportation department  for  keeping me informed of their progress  and continuing needs. I believe my bill  will be a positive answer to their requests. In addition, the Pueblo Indians  and Apache  Indians of New Mexico  have continuing development needs, including new and  improved  roads  to  reach their many attractions for tourists and other visitors.  I ask my colleagues to join me in increasing the Indian Reservation Roads  program funds in our Federal highways  programs  to  the degree  I have  requested in this bill. I thank my colleagues and urge  their  support  for  these increases as we reauthorize TEA–  21 for 6 more years.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 690  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

324,6,2005-04-08,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to recognize Hans-Peter Klein for  his nearly three decades of distinguished public service as Counsel for Mendocino County  in California. Peter’s devotion and  service  have left a lasting impression on Mendocino  County.  Born in Germany, Peter immigrated with his  parents to the United States at the age of four.  He received his Bachelors Degree  from  the  University of California before he was drafted  into the United States Army during the Vietnam War. Upon his military discharge, Peter  enrolled in an evening law school program. At  the time, he worked for the Port of San Francisco  and  volunteered with Marin County  Legal Aid. He received the Demetrius Sepatsis  Award for Academic Excellence upon graduation.  Peter joined the Mendocino County Counsel’s office in 1978, one month after its creation.  In  1983,  he  was  appointed  as  Mendocino’s County Counsel, a position  in  which he has served with dedication and distinction  for  the past 22 years. Peter also  served on the Board of Directors for the California  State County Counsel  Association,  where he has been a long time member of the  Association’s Ethics Committee. The Association  is dedicated  to  the maintenance of  the  highest professional standards in the practice  of governmental law and service to the public.  After so many years of serving others,  I  know that Peter is looking forward to spending  more time with his wife Toni, and their three  grown children.  Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we recognize Hans-Peter Klein for his commitment and  dedication to his profession and for his service  to  the people of Mendocino County and his  country.  THE DEATH OF POPE JOHN  PAUL II  to his  peace.  final  resting place. May he  rest  in  HON. LANE EVANS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 8, 2005  ",2005
325,6,2005-04-08,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with great  sadness that I join my fellow Catholics and all  citizens of the world in mourning the passing  of Pope John Paul II. Though he is no longer  with us, his extraordinary  influence and  tremendous contributions to the fight against tyranny and oppression will live on.  Pope John Paul II was the 263rd successor  to Saint Peter, and was elected on October  16, 1978. He was the youngest Pope in 132  years at age 58. He was also the first Polish  Pope and  the  first non-Italian Pope  in 450  years. He was seen as active and charismatic,  and could often be found on the ski slopes of  Europe.  Throughout his papacy, Pope John Paul II  worked  tirelessly on behalf of human  rights  and the dignity of all mankind. In contrast with  the Vatican’s preoccupation with Europe, he  was the most traveled Pope in history and involved the Church in world issues.  He visited Africa more than a dozen times,  yet refused  to visit South Africa until  it had  ended its apartheid system. He sought to end  religious and ethnic violence  in Sudan and  Rwanda.  In Latin America, John Paul pressured Chile’s General Augusto Pinochet  to  hold free elections and helped defuse a dispute between Argentina and Peru. He also  visited Southeast Asia,  the  Indian subcontinent,  the Philippines, Haiti, North America,  and Scandinavia, among other destinations.  Pope John Paul  II  is widely credited with  helping  depose  Eastern  European  communism. He helped inspire the worker rebellions and the Solidarity movement in his native  Poland soon after he was elected. Twenty million Poles greeted the Pope during his nine  day homecoming, an exceptional show of discontent with  the one-party dictatorship  that  ruled the country.  He also  insisted  that  the Catholic Church  confront its past misdeeds, including the Inquisition in the 15th century. In 1999, he ordered  the Vatican to issue an ‘‘act of repentance’’ for  the church’s failure to prevent Nazi genocide  against Jews  in World War  II and acknowledged centuries of preaching contempt  for  Jews. The pope expanded upon this in March  2000, when he asked forgiveness for many of  his church’s past sins, including its treatment  of Jews, heretics, women and native peoples.  While John Paul believed in the infallibility of  the church, he recognized that its servants are  human and sometimes stray from the teachings of Jesus.  Along with  John Paul’s  involvement  in  human rights, I have been moved and personally strengthened by his active engagement in  papal duties  in spite of  the development of  Parkinson’s disease. He did not shrink  from  activity or  the public eye  though his body  began to shake and become unsteady. In fact,  it became part of his mission:  to show  the  world the value of each life, even in those who  are suffering from physical pain and the aging  process.  The world is now coming to grips with the  passing of Pope John Paul II. We are comforted that his teachings live on as he moves  f  HONORING  THE  LIFE  AND  ACHIEVEMENTS  OF  HIS  HOLINESS POPE JOHN PAUL  II AND  EXPRESSING PROFOUND SORROW  ON HIS DEATH  SPEECHOF  HON. JAMES T. WALSH  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 6, 2005  ",2005
326,6,2005-04-08,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  mourn the loss of a great spiritual and moral  leader for the world. Throughout his lifetime,  he experienced Fascism, Communism and  rampant materialism. He never lost sight of his  own values and beliefs and lived his life as an  example that all of us regardless of faith could  look to.  The earthly light of this Pope has been lost  but his eternal light will shine forever. The millions of pilgrims flowing into St. Peter’s Square  reflect  the genuine warmth and respect  this  man of God had  throughout  the world. He  spoke for the poor, the homeless, the infirmed,  the oppressed and everyone  listened. His  message of caring and love certainly played a  major role in many of the changes we have  seen across the global map. Walls came down  and individual freedom arose from rubble.  To me it was especially noteworthy to watch  the Pope reach out to the youth of the world  and how warmly  they returned his affection.  Their bond will long be remembered.  In life Pope John Paul II showed us how to  live and in death, showed how to die. He has  returned to his Lord and Savior having earned  the reward of ‘‘Welcome home my good and  faithful servant.’’ We have been blessed by his  presence on earth and his  legacy will be a  strength for generations to come.  f  THE INTRODUCTION OF THE COLLEGIATE HOUSING AND  INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF 2005  HON.

328,3,2005-04-21,Mr.  MURPHY.,"  Madam  Speaker,  study after study associates untreated  depression with  increased  rates  of  chronic  illness and  increased health  care costs. For cancer, heart disease,  asthma, arthritis, diabetes  the  incidence of depression can be double that  of the general population. Untreated  depression complicates treatment and  can double health care costs. Untreated  depression can cost employers $51 billion per year.  Depression management  programs,  however, can save employers an average of $2,600 per employee through increased productivity and reduced absenteeism.  The time has come to improve health  care by integrating and coordinating  medical and mental health services for  more  effective  diagnosis  and  treatment.  Rather than just cut the payments  for health care, Congress can lead the  way to saving lives and money through  integrated care. Science supports this,  and I look forward to working with my  colleagues to transform our health care  system through  innovation,  information, and  incentives to  lower health  care costs for every American. I ask  my colleagues to learn more about integrated care by visiting my website at  Murphy.house.gov.  f  THE ENERGY BILL  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

Tomorrow  is Earth Day, and  the  theme this year is ‘‘Protect our children and our future.’’ Is this how the  Republican Congress  envisions  celebrating Earth Day and protecting our  children and the future?  This bill will pollute our air at a  time when childhood asthma rates are  growing. It exempts MBTE producers  from poisoning our water and keeps us  dependent on foreign oil. This environmentally irresponsible bill offers over  $37 billion in tax breaks and subsidies  to oil, coal, and nuclear power industries.  The energy industry does not need  this money. In 2004 the profits of the  top 10 oil and gas companies jumped by  more than 30 percent.  The Republican Congress and the administration  continue  to  prioritize  short-term corporate profits over long-  term health and safety of our children  and our earth. We should be protecting  our children, our future, and this planet. This energy bill destroys our environment.  It  is  a  danger  to  public  health.  It  forces  consumers  to pay  more for gas and keeps us dependent on  foreign oil.  f  GENERAL LEAVE  ",2005

Section 631  is typical of  this flawed, shortsighted energy bill,  which does not give us a national energy policy and does not help consumers with high gas prices.  Section 631 is a $30 million giveaway  to  dangerous  uranium mine  technology. It is unsound fiscal policy for  an unproven type of mining. Furthermore, this $30 million giveaway will encourage  a  company  to  pollute  the  groundwater of a community of 10,000  Navajo Indians.  At its worst, this section targets a  minority community with a dangerous  technology and uses them in an experiment. At best, it is an unwarranted  giveaway to the uranium mining industry.

341,24,2005-04-21,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN).  ",2005
342,24,2005-04-21,Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.," Mr.  Chairman, I guess this is a postponed  vote on MTBE. It is an issue we have  been dealing with, at least in the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a  number of years. MTBE was mandated,  maybe not specifically in the Clean Air  Act of 1990, but reformulated gas was.  And for an area like I have in Houston,  we have been using MTBE as a reformulated gas in our gas to clean up our  air because it replaced the lead that we  used to have because  lead was polluting. And now we find out that MTBE  does not smell or taste good and that is  right. But whatever we have in our gas  tanks is not something else we want to  smell or taste, either. We may not be  able to taste the benzene and everything else.  But EPA informed Congress in 1990  that a reformulated oxygenate requirement would be met almost exclusively  by MTBE,  and  congressional  statements at the time reflect that knowledge. Nowadays you can use ethanol,  which comes a long way, or MTBE.  It is true MTBE existed before the  Clean Air Act of 1990. In fact, it was  first approved by the EPA in 1979 to  comply with another Federal gasoline  mandate,  in reducing  lead. EPA  followed the  legislative history of the  Clean Air Act and its scientific analysis  and  repeatedly  reaffirmed  approval for MTBE. The reason this bill  has this provision in here is because we  mandated reformulated gas in certain  areas,  including  the district  I  represent. We have not had trouble with  MTBE in groundwater or surface water  pollution, at least in the Houston area.  I know some parts of the country have.  The oxygenate requirement has done  a great deal to clean up our smoggy  urban air; and to this day the EPA will  talk about the success of it, particularly in the Houston area. MTBE is on  the way out and being cleaned up  around the country, regardless of the  amount of litigation. Tank owners, insurance and State funds are doing the  real work, 96 percent of all cleanups according to the EPA. A case in point,  the city of Santa Monica is suing its  former law firm over the $66 million  legal bill for its trouble in suing over  MTBE.  b1415  I guess the concern I have is that  MBTE, if it is a defective product, we  mandated it. And let me quote from  some of the remarks earlier  in the  Clean Air Act. We had Members who  are still sitting Members of Congress  who were bragging about, we mandated  the oil companies to be able to do stuff,  for cleaning up our air; and yet nowadays, 10 years later, 15 years later, we  are going to say, no, they are responsible, even though we told them to do  it, and it has been successful.  My concern about the loss of MBTE,  we cannot trade clean air  for clean  water; we have to have both. And there  is a way we can have both, but not by  taking away the ability to have MBTE,  which is probably the most in use because it is the most efficient in reformulated gasoline.  But, again, Congress made a decision  to deal with ethanol more than MBTE,  and that will happen. This bill allows  for fixing the best by using the Leaking Underground Storage Tank fund,  and that will go a long way to help us.  ",2005
343,24,2005-04-21,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  for the purpose of making a unanimous  consent request to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. KENNEDY).  (Mr. KENNEDY  of Rhode  Island  asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. KENNEDY of Rhode Island. Mr.  Chairman, on behalf of the citizens of  Pascoag, Rhode Island, who have lived  with contaminated water from MBTE,  I rise in support of the Capps amendment.  I would like to thank my good friend Congresswoman CAPPS for  fighting  to bring  this  debate to the floor today.  I have seen  firsthand  the devastation  that  the gasoline additive MTBE can have on our  local communities.  In my home state of Rhode Island, the citizens of Pascoag were unable  to use  their  water for months due to this contamination.  No child should have to turn on the water  faucet to have their tap water smell like turpentine.  But the provision in this bill that seeks to  protect MTBE manufacturers is simply yet another one of many that puts the needs of individuals and families below the requests of industry in this dangerous bill.  I urge my colleagues to take a stand for the  forty-five million Americans whose water systems have been affected by MTBE contamination and vote to strike this provision from the  bill.  ",2005
344,24,2005-04-21,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. WAXMAN), who represents  Santa Monica, where a huge MBTE pollution problem has occurred.  ",2005
345,24,2005-04-21,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman,  the  Republican leadership in the House has  done everything it could possibly do to  keep us from voting on this issue. They  so badly wanted to protect the oil companies and to push the costs onto the  local governments to take care of the  polluted drinking water.  We had a vote earlier, as the gentleman from Texas (Chairman BARTON)  indicated, but it was on a procedural  vote. Now we have a vote on the merits. And if we do not support the Capps  amendment, we are keeping this unfunded mandate  in the bill and our  local governments are going to have to  pick up the billions of dollars of costs  to clean up the drinking water.  That is why it is an unfunded mandate. And that is why I am speaking  for the Republican side of the Chamber,  because the Republicans came in under  the Contract with America and said,  We want to do away with unfunded  mandates, and we will  let them be  challenged on the House floor.  And I congratulate the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. CAPPS) for bringing this to the House floor under a procedure that the Republicans allowed.  States’ rights, that used to be a Republican position. But this bill has the  view that Washington knows best. So  we do not let States decide things anymore. They cannot regulate, or participate even, in key energy decisions affecting States and localities such as  LNG facilities or relicensing of hydroelectric dams. Washington knows best.  And in this bill the most egregious example of arrogant  centralization of  power in Washington is this massive  unfunded mandate.  We have heard that Congress insisted  that MBTE be used for reformulated  gas. That is not true. Under the Clean  Air Act, we required reformulated gasoline, but we left it to the oil companies to decide how to do that, and they  were using MBTE before the 1990 Clean  Air Act was adopted. Now  that we  know what they may have known in  advance, that MBTE can cause problems in our drinking water, they want  to shift the costs from the oil companies that have caused the pollution to  the local taxpayers.  I remember when Republicans would  have objected to this. And I hope today  they will object to it as well. And I  guess the Republican leadership fears  that they might, because that is why  they  have  gone  to  such  enormous  lengths to not allow anybody in this  Chamber to vote on this specific issue.  Every time we asked the Committee on  Rules to allow a motion to strike be in  order, they denied it. There was a point  of order raised, and that way they were  able to keep us from voting on it.  But thanks to Newt Gingrich and the  Contract with America, we have this  way of bringing the issue on the merits. Vote for the Capps amendment.

349,31,2005-04-21,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise to congratulate my good friend,  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON), the chairman of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce, for his leadership in forging a comprehensive, cohesive energy policy for our Nation. I  also applaud the chairman for his attempts to ensure a reliable, efficient,  and affordable energy supply. We all  can agree that a transparent energy  market is essential to achieving the  overall goals of this bill.  I am concerned, however, Mr. Chairman, that the current language in title  12, specifically section 1281, weakens  the protections afforded the sensitive  and proprietary  information used to  determine energy prices.  Mr. Chairman, I seek the assurance  of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON) that he will work with me and  concerned  others  on  language  that  clarifies the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s  exclusive  jurisdiction with respect to accounts, agreements, and transactions involving commodity futures and options.  The CFTC has a long history of sharing futures and options trading data  with other Federal and State  regulators that agree to abide by the public  disclosure restrictions found in section  8 of the Commodity Exchange Act.  ",2005
350,31,2005-04-21,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for raising  these concerns and agree with the gentleman that market transparency is an  absolute need for an affordable energy  supply and that the protection of proprietary data is a must for the efficient  and effective use of U.S. futures markets. Regulation of United States futures exchanges is certainly within the  jurisdiction of the CFTC. I give the  gentleman my assurances I will work  with him on language that reflects the  Commodity Futures Trading Corporation’s jurisdiction in its vital role in  market transparency.  ",2005

Am I correct, sir, in understanding  that it was the committee’s intent to  grant the FTC rulemaking authority  with respect to the information practices of utility companies not already  regulated, or to the extent they are not  already regulated, under the Gramm-  Leach-Bliley Act?

355,31,2005-04-21,Mr. BARTON of Texas., The gentlewoman is correct.  ,2005
356,31,2005-04-21,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio., Am I further  correct that it was not the intention  that utility companies be restricted in  their ability to report payment history  information  to  consumer  reporting  agencies?  ,2005

LIMITATION ON RENT AND OTHER  CHARGES WITH RESPECT TO WIND  ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  ON PUBLIC LANDS.  (a) INGENERAL.—The Secretary of the Interior may  not  impose  rent  and  other  charges, excluding for the cost of processing  rights-of-way, with respect to any wind energy development project on public  lands  that, in the aggregate, exceed 50 percent of  the maximum amount of rent that could be  charged with respect to that project under  the terms of Bureau of Land Management Instruction Memorandum No. 2003–020, dated  October 16, 2002.  (b) TERMINATION.—Subsection (a) shall not  apply after the earlier of—  (1) the date on which the Secretary of the  Interior determines  there exists at  least  10,000 megawatts of electricity generating  capacity from non-hydropower renewable energy resources on public lands; or  (2) the end of the 10-year period beginning  on the date of the enactment of this Act.  (c) STATESHARENOTAFFECTED.—This section shall not affect any State share of rent  and other charges with respect to any wind  energy development project on public lands.  The Acting CHAIRMAN.

This amendment is part of our continuing effort to diversify our supplies  of energy by increasing the amount of  wind power we can generate off of our  Department of the Interior lands, principally, our Bureau of Land Management lands. It will do so by cutting in  half the royalty that is scheduled to be  applied under the BLM criteria. We are  actually quite high, probably  in the  neighborhood of almost twice sometimes what the private sector and private  lands  charge.

364,38,2005-04-21,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Castle-Markey amendment, and I  wanted this behind me. I do not oppose  this at all except that the color  is  burnt orange, which is the University  of Texas, and this is Aggie Muster Day,  April 21, when Sam Houston and his  Texans routed the Mexicans at the battle of San Jacinto and won independence for my great State. So this is a sacred day in Aggie history, and that is  the only thing I object to.  When I look at this, what I see is energy  for America, I see security  for  America, and I also see safety. Admittedly,  it  is a big boat and  it  looks  threatening, I will grant that; but we  already have existing provisions in law  to make sure that these terminals that  are already in existence are as safe it is  possible to be. I am not aware of any  major accident, and I would stand corrected if the gentleman from Delaware  (Mr. CASTLE) or the gentleman from  Massachusetts  (Mr.  says  there has been, but I am not aware of  that.  This particular section of the bill  that is before us simply says that we  are going to need more LNG facilities,  which is shorthand for liquefied natural gas; and we have tried to craft in  the guarantee that the State has a  stronger role, not a weaker role. We do  not preempt any State permit. If the  State of Massachusetts or Delaware or  California or any other coastal State,  if through their own permitting process they make the decision that the  terminal should not be built, it will not  be built.  What this provision does is, if a State  agency has not made a decision, has refused to make a decision, and one of  the parties goes into the district court  here in Washington, D.C., and asks that  a decision be made, that will expedite  the decision-making process.  For the first time, if this provision of  the bill were to become law, we would  give the States a guarantee to actually  go in and inspect these facilities under  Federal law, not under State law, but  under Federal law. They do not have  that right now.  I have told the gentleman from Delaware, and I will tell the gentleman  from Massachusetts, if we defeat this  amendment and we go to conference  with the existing language and we need  to in some way strengthen the States’  rights end of this provision, I am going  to be for that. I come from a coastal  State.  I come from a coastal State. I want  the safest possible. That  is why we  have the increased State guarantee in  the bill, because I insisted upon it; but  we cannot stick our heads in the sand  and say we do not need more LNG facilities.  We need more energy for America. I  wish we could produce it within our  shores, but it does not look like that is  going to be possible. We are going to  have to go offshore.  We have about 30 pending permits for  LNG facilities right now under consideration, and what this language does in  the bill is give an expedited provision  that the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission is the lead agency to expedite the Federal part of it. I believe  this actually  strengthens  the State  role.  So  I would respectfully ask  for a  ‘‘no’’  vote  on  the  Castle-Markey  amendment, and then what we need to  work on in the conference we will work  on.  Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Chairman, I  rise to express my support of the amendment  offered by Mr. CASTLE to strike the Liquefied  Natural Gas (LNG) Siting provision in H.R. 6.  The language included in H.R. 6 silences the  voices of state governments, local municipalities, and environmental advocacy organizations during  the LNG  terminal site selection  process.  Mr. Chairman, the language in H.R. 6 solidifying FERC’s exclusive  role  in  the siting of  LNG  terminals  is entirely unnecessary. Until  recently, only one LNG  importation  terminal  existed in the country. There are now five in  operation and 6 more have already been approved by federal regulators. The process for  selecting sites and approving LNG importation  terminals is working and in no way requires  removing partial-authority  from  states. The  new FERC rule would be another example of  catering  to  the already  too powerful oil and  gas industry.  Furthermore, when I cast my vote in support  of Mr. CASTLE’s  amendment  to  preserve  states’  rights and strike  this  language  from  H.R. 6, I know that I will also be speaking for  many others residing in my district and across  the Nation. Numerous organizations and legislative bodies who seek to be heard will speak  through my vote,  including, but certainly not  limited to the League of Conservation Voters,  National Association of Counties, U.S. Public  Interest Research Group, National League of  Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors, and  the  National Conference of States Legislatures,  and so many more.  A quarter-mile long floating LNG importation  terminal has been proposed in the Long Island  Sound between Connecticut and Long Island.  Lawmakers and civic organizations at every  level of government in my congressional district have expressed  their opposition  to  this  proposal and are furious at the prospect that  their voices will be silenced during the FERC  approval process. Mr. CASTLE’s amendment, if  passed, will allow their opinions to count.  The  Long  Island Sound  is  an  environmentally unique estuary that needs to be protected. The residents and elected officials of  Long Island have fought vigorously for many  years and spent millions of dollars to preserve  the quality of life that the Long Island Sound  offers. Additionally, our tourism and fishing industries, which provide billions of dollars to the  state’s economy, will be threatened, as fishermen will undoubtedly be displaced.  Mr. Chairman, I will speak for my constituents by  lending my support  to Mr. CASTLE’s  amendment. I urge my colleagues to support  this bipartisan measure.  ",2005
365,38,2005-04-21,Mr. ISRAEL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  support of Mr. CASTLE’s amendment.  Under current law three new liquid natural  gas facilities have been constructed in recent  years and six others approved. Current  law  permits construction of liquid natural gas facilities but  it doesn’t do what  this bill  in  its  present  form would do: virtually guarantee  construction of  liquid natural gas  facilities  in  any location where there is a strong energy  demand  regardless of state and  local concerns that arise. These concerns can include  safety,  environmental  risks  and/or  terrorist  threats.  These are not concerns that should be divorced  from  the approval process.  In  fact,  these concerns, and state and local governments’ ability to represent them, ought to be  elevated in importance. Our nation has a heritage of listening to the voice of its people. This  legislation serves only to silence the voice of  Americans.  The leadership of this House has turned a  deaf ear  to  the concerns of Long  Islanders  and to the many Americans in predicaments  like my constituents. By granting full authority  over the zoning of liquid natural gas facilities  to the federal government, this bill grossly violates  the  so-called Republican principle of  local control.  Before moving forward with any legislation  in regards to liquid natural gas facilities, this  body must fully vet the issue through hearings  and the commissioning of appropriate studies.  Not a single hearing on the pros and cons of  the consequences of shifting zoning authority  away from the states and to the federal government was held. This is nearsighted and irresponsible.  The Castle amendment ensures  that  local  oversight over  these vital zoning  issues  remains. It provides time for the proper detailed  review of potential legal changes.

367,45,2005-04-21,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition  to the energy legislation that we are debating  on the House floor today.  As an energy scientist who spent nearly a  decade working at one of  the nation’s premiere alternative energy research  labs  I understand the complex and challenging nature  of moving toward sustainable energy sources.  Having served in this body for more than six  years, I understand the difficulties in balancing  competing  interests  to obtain a policy  that  benefits the nation. Unfortunately, rather than  providing a productive and clear vision  that  leads  this nation  towards energy  independence, this bill subsidizes oil and gas companies and eases environmental regulations and  fails to put the U.S. on the right path.  This legislation sets a dangerous precedent  by allowing the destruction of one of our national treasures to extract a minimal amount of  resources. The very essence of the Arctic Refuge is that it is a pristine and untouched ecosystem. This unique environment serves as a  critical breeding or migratory habitat for over  200 species of animals  including polar and  grizzly bears. Arctic wolves, and endangered  species like the shaggy musk ox. This legislation completely ignores the precious nature of  this land and instead provides yet one more  opportunity for oil and gas companies to expand their operations. If this legislation is approved all Americans will lose something special and irreplaceable.  There are some good points in this bill. It  does authorize increases in research on efficiency and renewable energy in future years.  And I would like to thank my colleagues for  accepting my amendment for a study of fuel  savings from information technology for transportation.  But the good points of the bill are far outweighed by  the bad.  Instead of  investing  in  cleaner, long term solutions, this bill brushes  aside our nation’s  future energy needs  in  order  to provide nearly 8 billion of  taxpayer  dollars to the oil, gas and other traditional energy industries to promote short-term, polluting  energy sources. These tax incentives should  not be going to industries that are thriving, but  should be used to invest in our future by increasing research  funding  for alternative energy sources such as wind energy, fuel cells  and fusion.  Everyone knows that we have a serious energy problem in this country. Our dependence  on foreign oil affects not only our economy but  also our national security. We will never drill  our way to independence domestically. Yet we  have an energy bill that is stuck in the past  that yet again seeks to drill a little deeper, in  a few more places.  We need a responsible and sustainable approach  to  addressing  our  nation’s  energy  needs. On behalf of the residents of the 12th  District, I pledge to continue to work toward  the development of a balanced, comprehensive  energy  plan—one  that  finds  environmentally  friendly,  sustainable ways  to decrease our dependence on  foreign oil and  slow the degradation of our planet.  ",2005
368,45,2005-04-21,Mr. WELDON of Florida.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise today to speak in support of H.R. 6, the  Energy Policy Act of 2005. It’s a tremendous  step  in  the  right direction  for  this nation  to  achieve  energy  independence.  Through  a  combined strategy of strong R&D, efficiency  and incentives we can help ensure future generations of Americans a vibrant and growing  economy while not having to worry about the  whims of foreign influence on our energy.  The bill also authorizes $200 million for the  ‘‘Clean Cities’’ program, which will provide  grants to state and local governments to acquire alternative fueled vehicles. I have been  working in Central Florida over the past several years to promote research into hydrogen-  powered vehicles. I applaud the White House  for  taking such a proactive stance on new  technologies. This bill promotes a cleaner environment by encouraging new  innovations  and the use of alternative power sources by  launching a state-of-the-art program to enable  hydrogen fuel cell cars to compete in the marketplace by 2020.  Under  this bill, American consumers will  have better product labeling for a number of  commercial and household products so  that  they will be able to make more informed decisions when purchasing energy saving products. H.R. 6 further decreases America’s dangerous dependence on foreign oil by expanding domestic production and authorizing expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve’s  capacity to 1 billion barrels of oil.  America’s energy consumption is at an all-  time high and  rising, despite ongoing efficiency gains, with consumption projected  to  grow as our economy expands. If our nation is  to meet these needs in the coming decades,  it will be in part due to continued advances in  energy efficiency and conservation—helping to  reduce our demand on  foreign supply and  stimulating economic growth. One goal is to  save consumers and businesses’ money spent  on energy, so  they can  invest, spend and  grow the economy and improve our standard  of living. Expanding our energy production capacity is a key to long-term economic growth  and energy independence.  H.R. 6 encourages the great American tradition of  technological  innovation and creative  problem solving. It is America working at its  best and  this  legislation  is  long overdue.  I  stand in strong support of this legislation and  look forward to seeing it enacted into law.  ",2005
369,45,2005-04-21,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in opposition to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act  of 2005.  For the third time in 5 years, the House Republican leadership has passed up an historic  opportunity  to craft an energy policy  for  the  21st Century. With oil prices hitting record levels and repeated predictions that the cost of a  barrel of oil could hit over $100 in the coming  years, we should be focusing our efforts on alleviating our nation’s dependence on  fossil  fuels.  Instead, H.R. 6 is stuck in the past. Modeled  after the energy plan developed by Vice President CHENEY’s  secret energy  committee 4  years ago, H.R. 6 reflects the philosophy that  the only solution  to  the high price of oil  is  more oil. However, analyses by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration indicate that even if the provisions  of H.R. 6 becomes law, America’s imports of  foreign oil will still increase by as much as 85  percent during the next 20 years, thereby increasing our dependency.  H.R. 6 should have been an honest, bipartisan effort to halt America’s growing dependence on fossil fuels for energy. It could have  been  focused  on  developing  new  technologies,  improving  energy  efficiency,  promoting renewable energy, and conducting the  research and development that could produce  the breakthroughs that would power the world  of tomorrow.  I have no objection to supporting some new  or additional oil and gas exploration or production because, until we develop the energy alternatives of the future, we must continue to  VerDate Aug 31 2005  07:22 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H21AP5.REC H21AP5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005
370,52,2005-04-21,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in opposition to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act.  I believe every Member  in  this chamber  agrees that our country faces a potential energy crisis if we do not act quickly to establish  a new national energy policy. We need  to  make major  investments  in energy self-reliance,  infrastructure, and new  technologies.  However, where we differ is on how best to  achieve those goals. When I look at the provisions of this bill, I do not see a clear vision for  America’s future. Instead, I see a policy that  promises more of the same and that does not  end our nations’ dependence on foreign oil. It  astonishes me that the nation that mobilized to  put an American on the moon is not leading  the world in developing new, clean and renewable energy sources. Such an effort would revitalize our economy,  improve our environment, and strengthen our national security.  However, this mission can be successful only  with the leadership of Congress and the President, and I regret that we have not pursued  that goal here today.  Instead, this bill clings to the incorrect assumption that our nation can drill and dig its  way to energy independence. Although transportation is the largest source of oil consumption in the nation, H.R. 6 authorizes drilling in  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge rather than  making modest  improvements  to automobile  fuel efficiency standards. Instead of investing  in renewable energy sources, 93 percent of its  $8.1 billion in energy production tax incentives  are targeted toward gas, oil, and other non-renewable sources.  The measure also includes some very disturbing provisions that can damage the health  and safety of our citizens. H.R. 6 includes a liability exemption for manufacturers of MTBE,  the  fuel additive  that has contaminated  the  groundwater of communities  throughout  the  nation, including in Pascoag, Rhode Island. It  also strips states of their ability to provide for  the safety of their citizens by granting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission almost  unlimited authority in siting new liquefied natural gas facilities. A recent study by the Department of Energy noted a deliberate attack  on a LNG tanker could result in a deadly fire  reaching as far as a mile away. Nevertheless,  FERC is considering an application for a LNG  facility in Providence, in proximity to Interstate  95, schools, neighborhoods, and Rhode Island  Hospital, the only Level trauma center in the  state. A broad, bipartisan group of state public  officials,  including  the Governor, Lieutenant  Governor, Attorney General, Mayor of Providence,  and  the Congressional  delegation,  have expressed their united opposition to the  proposal, but the provisions in this bill would  place  the decision solely  in  the hands of  FERC without the consent of those elected to  protect the people of Rhode Island.  Last week, right before the April 15th tax filing deadline, this Congress passed an estate  tax bill that benefited only the wealthiest one-  third of one percent of Americans while adding  massive debt  to burden  future generations.  Today, the day before Earth Day, we are considering an energy bill that provides massive  tax breaks to the oil and gas industry instead  of investing in cleaner renewable sources and  energy efficiency. Again, Congress has identified a problem and responded  in a  fashion  contrary to the long-term interests of our nation. I am deeply disappointed in this measure  and urge my colleagues to vote against it so  that we can refocus our efforts on an energy  policy for America’s future.  ",2005
371,52,2005-04-21,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise regrettably in opposition to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act. While there are many good  provisions  in  the act  that make modest  improvements  in support of energy efficiency,  there are major deficiencies in this bill.  My constituents are very clear about  the  problems they face. First, gas prices are too  high at the pump. Second, our country will always have  to  rely on  foreign-produced oil.  Third,  the costs of electricity have been  inflated by the manipulations of energy corporations which have not been required to refund  their illegal profits. In addition, many are concerned about  the effect of greenhouse gas  emissions. This measure does not strongly address these issues.  The cost of gas is a function of supply and  demand. This body had  the opportunity  to  enact a wisely balanced policy to reduce the  demand for oil in this country and to address  the supply of fuel by investing aggressively in  VerDate Aug 31 2005  07:22 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H21AP5.REC H21AP5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005
372,59,2005-04-21,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia  (Ms. NORTON) is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2005
373,59,2005-04-21,Ms. NORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I come to  the House for a joyful moment.  On the front page of the Washington  Post today is a very large picture of  children of the District of Columbia  and one of their teachers, who was entertained yesterday by President Bush  at the White House to celebrate the  fact that he has been named Teacher of  the Year, the oldest and most prestigious award for teachers in our country.  This is a young man who teaches at  Sousa Junior High School  in Washington, D.C. Jason Kamras is his name.  He is a math teacher who graduated  from Princeton University. What does  he think to do with his life? Come to  the District of Columbia to teach disadvantaged children in our elementary  and middle schools.  He began teaching in 1996. He took 2  years out because he thought he ought  to go and get an education degree, and  he went and got a master’s degree in  education, but came right back to the  District of Columbia to teach math at  Sousa.  Typical of the way this young man  approached his job is the student he  first met when he was in middle school  at Sousa. His name was Wendell Jefferson. He said, Wendell, you keep trying;  you will do well. Wendell Jefferson  went on to high school. When he got to  high school, no longer under the care of  Mr. Kamras, Mr. Kamras tutored him  in math. Wendell Jefferson  is now  studying  electrical  engineering  at  Morehouse College.  This story is perhaps emblematic of  the way this young man approaches  teaching. He lobbied his principal for  double the time for students in math,  with two teachers for each student. He  redesigned the curriculum using technologies so as to adjust the curriculum  to all learning styles. He took to heart  this notion that every child can learn,  those words which have become such a  cliche, a cliche because we all know  them to be true, but we do not know always how to unlock what makes them  true.  In his first year, using his new curriculum, these children went from 80  percent below basic to 40 percent below  basic. Something happened to almost  40 percent of them when they got a  teacher who homed in on their individual needs. Now, we  are  talking  about a school where all but 40 of about  380 students qualify  for the reduced  price lunch. It tells us something of the  poverty level of the students.  Actually, the District of Columbia  public schools look a lot like every big  public school, except the Members of  Congress see this one up close. We are  very pleased  to have a new  superintendent, Mr. Janey, who is in the  process  of  restructuring  our  public  schools, but of course, the most basic  restructuring of  schools has  to do,  first,  with  the  children  in  those  schools, how the schools are restructured so that they are child-oriented  and how are they restructured so as to  understand the most important adult  in each child’s life during the school  day is the teacher. Somehow or the  other this young man, fresh out of college, understood that.  He works from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.  according to his principal. My mother  was a schoolteacher, so I want to say  that those long hours are fairly typical  of how teachers operate. They do not  do it at school. They are working that  hard because of the hours they put in  at home in preparing to teach.  But for Mr. Kamras, teaching in a big  city school system was much more difficult than it was for my mother when  she taught when I was a child because  of the concentration of poverty in big  cities today. This city was a much  larger city, 200,000 people more than it  has today, and it was far more mixed  economically. Then, of course, people  began to move to larger quarters in the  suburbs leaving concentrations of poverty here. We have lots of middle-class  people in the District, I am pleased to  say, but we have large concentrations  of poverty, and this is reflected in the  scores.  The fact that Jason Kamras was able  not only to reach the children, but to  reach the measurement, which I think  is the right measurement; there is no  way to get around the fact that test  scores are the only way to know for  sure that children are progressing. I  wish there were a better way. I wish  there were a more objective way, but  that is it.  b1730  This  teacher  has  somehow made  these test scores go up.  Mr. Speaker,  I do want  to quote  something that he said, because it tells  something of his world view. He said,  ‘‘My intense desire to see my school  excel comes not only from an unwavering belief that all students deserve an  excellent  education,  but  also  the  unique role Sousa played in the civil  rights movement.’’  This young man’s world view gives  him a sense that justice in the classroom must be done because he believes  in justice in our country for African  Americans, and he has brought it to  bear right here in the public schools of  the District of Columbia.  I know you would want  to, Mr.  Speaker, congratulate him; I know this  House would want to congratulate him.  We take great pride in his achievement  today, and we thank the President of  the United States for honoring him.

374,66,2005-04-21,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Rightfully so. I  am glad I am a Member of the Congress  and no one can walk in here and escort  me out. I mean, right now they cannot.  But I am glad. I am glad that that is  the case because I would be kind of  concerned if I were standing outside at  one of the stops that the President was  making and we were having this conversation. We may very well be asked  to spend some time in the parking lot  because we cannot go in.  ",2005
375,66,2005-04-21,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Absolutely, Mr. Speaker. And that is because they do not want the facts to go  out. Because if light is shed on their  proposal,  if they are  forced to  face  their accusers, so to speak, if they are  forced to respond to people who have  the facts, their facts just do not hold  up under the sheen of light.  So what I started to say a few minutes ago was what his proposal does is,  and like I said, I call it a proposal, but  I should say his vague outlines of a  proposal, he has promoted across the  country the concept or the belief that  private accounts would be a windfall  and has led people to believe that they  would both be able to have the money  in their private accounts as well as  their Social Security benefits, and that  is not the case. There would be a commensurate cut in Social Security benefits, about 46 percent, commensurate in  proportion to the amount in someone’s  private account.  An average 20-year-old, over their 20-  year  retirement, would  lose  about  $152,000  in Social Security  benefits  under the vague outlines of the President’s proposal.  Let us take disability insurance and  survivor benefits, because  I am not  sure  if  the gentleman  talked about  that before I got here; but Social Security provides disability insurance for  young families. There is no private insurance plan that could compete with  the disability benefits provided by Social Security. For a worker in her mid-  20s who has a spouse and her two children, and there are millions of those  across this country, Social Security  provides the equivalent of a $350,000  disability policy. Most people, especially a young widow with two children, cannot afford to go out and buy a  policy on the private market like that.  It would just not be available to her.  Suppose, God forbid, there is a young  parent who suddenly dies. Social Security provides for the children who are  left behind. Social Security provides  survivors benefits. Survivor benefits  replace as much as 80 percent of the  earnings for a 20-year-old average-wage  worker who dies  leaving two young  children and a spouse. For that parent,  Social Security survivor benefits are  equivalent to a $403,000 life insurance  policy.  That is what it means when we talk  about what privatization would do to  young  families. That  is  real. That  would be gone, that benefit. Because  when it comes to disability and survivor benefits, privatization does not  apply because there is no income being  generated. One has to have income in  order to have a private account. People  who are disabled and people who are  widows and widowers do not have that  income coming in by its very nature.  ",2005
376,66,2005-04-21,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  the thing about it is that Democrats,  Republicans,  Independents,  white,  black, Asian, name it, are part of the 48  million Americans that are receiving  benefits right now. And this issue is  not only in districts on the Democratic  side of the aisle, but on the Republican  side of the aisle. And I will tell the  Members this will not hold.  Now, it is not all doom and gloom because, guess what. Thank God  the  Democratic leadership is saying we do  not want to increase the debt to go on  a scheme of a $500 trillion over the next  20 years cost for individuals to have to  pay more on the debt and also for individuals to lose some of their benefits.  And the bad thing about what the  President and some Members on the  majority side, the Republican side, are  proposing is the fact that they are saying that, yes, it will go up and down  but over time private accounts will  win. Guess what. If one is in a private  account or they opt to be in a private  account from the Social Security philosophy, and  I must add  if  I  said  ‘‘plan,’’ I want to take that back, philosophy that the majority side has and  that the President  is talking about,  they are going to lose, too. They are  going to lose some of their benefits,  too, and I think it is important that  people understand that.  Also,  let us  just put  it this way:  Some people may  say what  is  the  Democratic plan? I will say what is the  Republican plan? Where  is  it? What  Web site can I go to? Is someone coming to my office with some sort of  bound copy? Maybe I need to come to  my office to find out if something came  since I have been here on the floor.  Where is the bill?  b1830  Well, there is a hearing that is going  to take place on Capitol Hill. Guess  what? There are over 200 hearings that  take place in every Congress. They do  not all result in legislation. I am hoping that in that hearing, if someone  wants to do something, or the majority  side wants to work with the minority  side, because I do know that the gentlewoman  from  California  (Leader  PELOSI), I know that the gentleman  from Maryland (Whip HOYER), and our  caucus chairman and vice chairman  and others in leadership would love to  sit down. The gentleman  from New  York (Mr. RANGEL) is always saying,  my door is open, I am ready to go. Let  us talk about this thing.  But let me just say this, because I  think it is important. The Democratic  plan is already in 48 million wallets of  Americans that have Social Security  benefits. That is the Democratic plan.  Hello? That is the Democratic plan. So  the Democratic plan is to make sure  that we do not add more to the $26,000  that every American already owes the  Federal Government, the highest deficit in the history of the Republic. The  Democratic plan is to fight to bring  that number down and to go into surplus where we were before this administration got in.  That is the Democratic plan.  ",2005

One of the things  that I got out of those meetings that  was clear and that has been written  about in the last few days is, let us remember what the foundation of this  whole privatization is built on. It is  built on the stock market. It is built  on stocks and bonds.  Now, last week, we had one of the  most significant drops in the market in  over 2 years.

380,80,2005-04-21,Mr. REID.," I understand we are in a  period for morning business. I will use  leader time.  Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my friend from South Dakota,  but his assertion of  facts  is simply  without foundation. When the Democrats took the majority in the Senate,  I, along with others, said that this was  not payback time; we were not going to  treat the Republicans the way they  treated us during the Clinton years.  During those years, they did not have  the decency even to have hearings for  judicial nominations; they simply left  them, 60 in number, in the committee.  We  thought  that was  inappropriate,  and that is the reason during the time  that President Bush has been President—we were in the majority, and we  are now in the minority—we have approved 205 judges for President Bush  and turned down 10, which is a pretty  good record.  For people to say there have not been  judicial filibusters in the past is simply  without historical foundation. In the  early days of this Republic, there was  no way to stop a filibuster. The only  way one could  stop a  filibuster on  judges or anything else was by virtue  of  agreeing  to  stop  talking. Many  judges were simply left by the wayside.  They were talked out and they simply  never came forward for a vote before  the Senate.  The most noteworthy filibuster of a  judge that would require a vote that  failed was in 1881. There was a filibuster of a judge that went to a vote.  Prior to that time, they never even  went to a vote.  It was determined in the Senate in  1970 that it would be appropriate to figure out  some way  to break a  filibuster—on judges, on Cabinet nominations, and on legislation. At that time  the Senate changed its rules by a two-  thirds vote and had filibusters broken,  then, by 67 votes. In the 1960s it was determined that was a burden that was  no  longer  necessary,  and  it  was  changed to 60 votes. From that time to  today, there has been the ability to  break a filibuster by 60 Senators voting.  There have been filibusters since that  rule was changed in 1960, filibusters of  judges.  The most  noteworthy,  of  course, was Abe Fortas.

391,94,2005-04-21,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," I certainly will. I  thank the Senator from West Virginia.  I know General Hayden will be a  four-star general very shortly. I think  that is very good news. So we will have  the first Director and Principal Deputy  Director of National Intelligence.  I believe these are both excellent  nominees. They will provide  strong  new overall management and leadership to the intelligence community as  it finally adapts to post-Cold War realities.  Ambassador Negroponte has served  with distinction, both in Washington  and around the globe. He served as  United States Ambassador to four nations and to the United Nations. As  Deputy National Security Adviser, Ambassador Negroponte was  intimately  involved in the formation and use of intelligence. He is well suited to overseeing  the collection of vital  intelligence needed for the United States to  protect itself. Ambassador Negroponte  comes to this new position without  strong ties or bias to any specific intelligence agency. That is an enormous  strength, and I believe he will be an  honest broker and manager  for  the  community. He has pledged that he  will be a neutral and apolitical provider of  intelligence  to Government  policymakers.  Although General Hayden’s nomination is not before us at this time, I  wish to say I hold him in the highest  regard. He is a skilled manager and an  expert in the workings of our Nation’s  intelligence apparatus. General Hayden  led a  remarkable  turnaround of an  enormously  complex  and  technical  agency, the National Security Agency.  He was first made Director of the NSA  under President Clinton and has had  his tour extended three times by President Bush. That is a true testament to  his leadership. He has proven his ability to establish a skilled and dedicated  workforce. In short, General Hayden is  a strong choice to be the day-to-day  manager of the  intelligence community.  Both men have the strength, the vision, and the determination that  is  necessary to be successful in their new  positions.  As my colleagues know, I introduced  legislation to create a DNI in the 107th  Congress and again in the 108th Congress. So I was pleased to see that with  the support of the 9/11 Commission and  the chairs and ranking members of the  Intelligence and Governmental Affairs  Committees, this position was finally  established.  As Director and Deputy Director of  National Intelligence, these appointees  face daunting challenges. The 15 intelligence agencies are a community in  name only. The fiefdoms and turf battles—the stovepipes—between agencies  may have lessened since September 11,  but they continue to hinder our intelligence operations.  Our technical means  for collecting  intelligence must be adapted to this  new nonstate terrorist world and its  challenges. The acquisition and development of new  intelligence  systems  need better management.  The demands for better human intelligence are well documented by  reports,  including  the  Congressional  Joint Inquiry, our Intelligence Committee’s Iraq study, the 9/11 Commission, and the President’s own WMD  Commission.

392,108,2005-04-21,Mr. WARNER.," Mr.  President,  I  strongly  support  the nomination of  Ambassador John D. Negroponte to be  the  first Director of National Intelligence.  This is not a moment without precedent  in history. President Roosevelt  faced a similar situation in 1941 when  he had disparate intelligence and information gathering organizations within  the government, but did not have a single person in charge. President Roosevelt convinced a reluctant Colonel  William J., Wild Bill, Donovan to be  the first ‘‘Coordinator of Information,’’  an organization  that eventually became the Office of Strategic Services,  OSS, and ultimately, the Central Intelligence Agency.  I would like to read a quote from the  book, ‘‘Donovan of O.S.S.,’’ by Corey  Ford:  The appointment of Colonel Donovan as director of COI was formally announced by executive order on July 11, 1941, and his duties  were defined in Roosevelt’s own words: ‘To  collect and analyze all information and data  which may bear upon national security, to  correlate  such  information and data and  make the same available to the President  and to such departments and officials of the  Government as may the President may determine, and to carry out when request by  the President such supplementary activities  as may facilitate the securing of information  important  for national  security not now  available to the Government.’  The directive was purposely obscure in its  wording, due to the secret and potentially offensive nature of the agency’s functions; and  the other intelligence organizations, jealous  of their prerogatives, took advantage of the  vague phraesology to set loose a flock of rumors that Donovan was to be the Heinrich  Himmler of an American Gestapo, the Goebbels of a controlled press, a super-spy over  Hoover’s G-men and the Army and Navy, the  head of a grand strategy board which would  dictate even to the General Staff. In vain,  the President  reiterated  that Donovan’s  work, ‘is not intended to supersede or to duplicate or to involve any direction of or interference with the activities of the General  Staff, the regular intelligence services, the  Federal Bureau of Investigation, or of other  existing agencies.’ The bureaucratic war was  on.  It was a war all too familiar to Washington, the dog-eat-dog struggle among government departments to preserve their own  areas of power.  Ambassador Negroponte and General  Michael Hayden, USAir Force, his deputy, face a similar situation today, and  I wish them well.  Some have said the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of  2004  uses  similarly  ‘‘vague  phraseology’’  in describing the authorities  and responsibilities of the new Director  of National Intelligence. Some say that  Roosevelt was intentionally vague to  allow the strong personality of Wild  Bill Donovan to make this new intelligence organization work.  I think we have two very strong personalities  in Ambassador Negroponte  and General Hayden who are up to the  task and will make this new Office of  National Intelligence work. Their work  will be even more effective as they  forge strong alliances with their colleagues in other departments of Government.  As Ambassador Negroponte begins  this  important effort,  I know he  is  mindful on the balance that must be  maintained between the needs of national policy makers, military commanders on distant battlefields, and  local and national homeland security  officials, who are all charged with the  safety and security of the American  homeland. The support these elements  enjoy today has not always been the  case.  When  General  Norman  Schwarzkopf testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in June  1991 regarding  lesson  learned during  the first Persian Gulf War, he told the  committee that responsive national intelligence support has been unsatisfactory from his perspective as the theater commander in charge of combat  operations. Clearly, much has changed  since 1991, but we must all remain vigilant in ensuring that intelligence support for our men and women in uniform  is maintained and enhanced.  Ambassador Negroponte has a strong  record of public service as the U.S. Ambassador  to Honduras, Mexico,  the  Philippines, the United Nations, and  most recently, Iraq. He has a great reputation as a problem solver who can be  counted on for the epitome of candor  and integrity.  John Negroponte has served his Nation faithfully and well. His willingness  to take on this daunting challenge is a  testament to a man who understands  service to Nation and has, once again,  answered the call to serve. We are fortunate to have a citizen of such character to undertake this important and  challenging task of bringing our Intelligence Community together as a coherent, well-coordinated entity.  I strongly support confirmation of  Ambassador John D. Negroponte to be  the  first Director of National Intelligence, and hope the spirit of Wild Bill  Donovan guides and  inspires his efforts.  ",2005
393,108,2005-04-21,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, today I  rise to give my enthusiastic vote of  support for President Bush’s nominee  to be this Nation’s first Director of National Intelligence. I have known Ambassador Negroponte for over 20 years,  and his professional career as one of  our Nation’s best diplomats began 20  years earlier. And rarely have I voted  in support of a Presidential nominee  with greater confidence. I trust that  my colleagues will lend their support  unanimously to the President’s selection for a position we are anxious to  fill.  As he assumes the position we created last year to unify the intelligence  community’s capabilities as they have  never been unified before, I offer Ambassador Negroponte my complete support, with three points to consider.  First, as I have told the nominee,  this will be the most difficult job he  will ever hold. And I say this to the  man who has just returned from serving as our first ambassador to a liberated  Iraq.  During  Ambassador  Negroponte’s nomination hearing two  weeks ago, the distinguished chairman  of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, who also has my greatest respect, while reviewing the job requirements for the new position of DNI, candidly asked the nominee: ‘‘Why would  you want this job?’’  The answer, for those who know him,  is that Ambassador Negroponte has always responded to the call by his country to take on difficult challenges. And  we in the Senate have supported him  by  confirming him,  to  date,  seven  times.  Second, as I also told the nominee,  and  I have  said  to my  colleagues:  Osama bin Laden is not quaking in his  hideaway because we have created the  position of Director of National Intelligence. Let us be candid to ourselves  about this. Too often in Washington, a  bureaucratic response is mistaken for a  solution. I hope we all recognize, after  the years of discussing reform, that the  legislation we passed last year initiates  the beginning, not the end of reform.  And this  leads to my third point.  Ambassador  Negroponte’s  mission,  once we confirm him, is to take the  elements of the  intelligence community and de-Balkanize them. His mission will be to create a whole that is  greater  than  the  sum of  the  intelligence community parts. He will do  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:14 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S21AP5.REC S21AP5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005

403,122,2005-04-21,Mr. ENSIGN.," Mr. President, in the  decade before 9/11, al Qaeda studied  how to exploit gaps and weaknesses in  the borders of the United States.  A few months ago, intelligence officials  confirmed  that  the  terrorist  Zarqawi plans  to  infiltrate America  through our borders. He plans to attack targets such as movie theaters,  restaurants, and schools.  A year-long  investigation  recently  concluded with authorities arresting 18  people who planned to smuggle grenade  launchers, shoulder-fired missiles, and  other Russian military weapons into  our country.  Let’s face it—the dual threat of illegal border crossing by people who wish  to kill us and the weapons they need to  do it is very real.  We are not dealing with rational people. We are not dealing with people who  respect life or freedom. It would be irresponsible to sit idly by and not treat  these threats seriously. We must continue to be diligent in our fight to defeat terror and protect our homeland.  Before 9/11, INS had only 9,800 border  patrol agents. With the agency focused  on  immigration  and  narcotics,  no  major counterterrorism effort was underway.  More  than  3 years after  the devastating terrorist attacks, the men and  women who serve on the border’s frontline of defense are still overwhelmed.  The Commissioner of the U.S. Customs  and Border Protection has admitted  they need more agents.  Our agents catch only about one-  third of the estimated 3 million people  who cross  the border  illegally each  year. Three and half years ago it only  took 19 to change the course of this  country.  The 9/11 Commission addressed this  very problem. They recommended banning terrorists from traveling to our  country. This  is  exactly what my  amendment attempts to accomplish.  We must commit resources to block  terrorists who attempt to enter our  country. Last year,  I  sponsored an  amendment  to  the National  Intelligence Reform Act that authorized the  hiring of 10,000 new agents to patrol  our borders over the next 5 years. And  last month,  the Senate approved a  Budget which  funded the hiring and  training of  2,000 new border patrol  agents next year.  Border  security  requires a  serious  commitment by Congress. There is no  question  that we need  to hire new  agents. Our security depends on it. But  it will take more than simply hiring  agents. Congress  needs  to  increase  funding for training and equipment. I  hope we will remember this during the  regular appropriations process.  We cannot wait another year to improve our border security. This is an  emergency. The amendment that I am  offering will put new agents on the  ground in the next few months.  My amendment begins to fulfill the  commitment Congress made last year.  It provides $147 million to hire and  train 400 new border patrol agents by  October; 400 new agents is the maximum number of new agents that the  Department of Homeland Security can  train before the end of this fiscal year.  My amendment does not require any  new spending. It is completely offset.  The  9/11  Commission  found  that  many of the 19 hijackers could have  been placed on watch lists. They were  vulnerable to detection by border authorities. Without adequate staff and  coordinated efforts, the terrorists were  allowed to enter the United States.  Once here they learned how to fly airplanes  at American  flight  schools.  They conducted surveillance to assess  our weaknesses. And they attacked.  In order to prevent another terrorist  attack on American soil, we must improve every aspect of our nation’s security. Our  security  is  truly only as  strong as our weakest link.  For too long, the lack of funding for  border agents has been a weak link. By  funding additional agents, we protect  both our southern and our, often neglected,  northern  border. This will  make it harder for terrorists to enter  the United States and attack us.  The world has changed dramatically  since 9/11 when the terrorists used our  open and trusting society against us.  We can not allow a repeat of that tragedy. This amendment will help those  who guard our frontiers by providing  necessary tools to ensure the safety of  our citizens.  AMENDMENTNO. 520  ",2005

409,129,2005-04-21,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Mr. President, as debate about the supplemental appropriations for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan  comes to a close, I would like to ensure  that our focus remains on the welfare  of our Nation’s troops.  That is why I would like to speak on  behalf of the men and women who are  serving in our Nation’s Armed Forces—  those currently on active duty as well  as  in  the National Guard and Reserves—who are serving today in Iraq,  Afghanistan, and across the globe.  Since the President declared an end  to major combat operations in Iraq on  May 1, 2003, 1,419 American troops have  died in Iraq and more than 11,000 have  been wounded.  Even if combat in Iraq is something  that no longer makes the front pages of  our newspapers, it is still agonizingly  clear that our troops remain in danger.  That is why it is even more important for this body to use sound judgment and good planning. One of my  major concerns is that year after year  we have found a way to take the process of funding military operations in  Iraq and Afghanistan out of our regular  budget process.  I am frustrated, quite frankly, that  we have been subjected to this biannual ritual. I am frustrated that questioning the timing of these requests  may cause our political opponents to  call us unpatriotic. But, most of all, I  am frustrated that doing my duty as a  U.S. Senator could be considered anything less than keeping a sacred trust  with our men and women in uniform.  In April of 2003, just a little over 2  years ago, Congress, at the President’s  request,  provided  approximately  $78  billion to meet the challenge in Iraq.  Six months later, in October of 2003,  the administration came back to us  and requested another $87 billion in the  form of a supplemental appropriation  to fund continuing operations in Iraq.  In early June of 2004, the Senate  voted for another $25 billion to keep  operations going through the end of  that year. Now we are faced with yet  another emergency  supplemental  request of more than $80 billion.  I agree that there is a need to adequately fund our troops. We must do  everything we can to protect our men  and women who are  in harms’ way.  What I don’t understand, quite frankly,  is this President’s inability or unwillingness to make this request a part of  the normal budget and appropriation  process that we go through every year.  As you recall, in April of 2003, the  President requested $78 billion in emergency military funding. We were at the  beginning of a war. Although it was a  war of our choosing, I understood the  uncertainty that war brings. Furthermore, I understood the value of not allowing our enemies to get a read on our  intent by peering into our budget process over the course of a year. I supported the President’s request.  A mere 6 months  later, President  Bush returned to this body to request  another $87 billion for ongoing military  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. At  that time, our troops were facing the  imminent and ever-present danger of  guerilla attacks.  Also, many of our troops were expressing concerns that they were not  adequately trained for the specialized  demands of peacekeeping and policing  that the reconstruction effort required.  Moreover, the dangers and difficulties that our troops faced went far beyond the threat posed by attacks from  insurgents and guerillas.  I grew  increasingly concerned about the conditions under which many of our troops  were being forced to serve in the Middle East.  I was  consistently  hearing  about  shortages of quality food and water. I  was hearing that our troops were not  properly equipped with the tools of  warfare. I was hearing of parents sending their children bullet-proof vests because the military could not or would  not provide them.  Although  the  administration  had  completely misjudged  the nature of  this conflict,  I understood that our  troops must not suffer because others  had let them down. I understood that  whatever this administration’s shortcomings were in terms of planning, our  troops’  safety and well being came  first. I supported the President’s request.  Once again, in June of 2004, this administration asked for another $25 billion supplemental for the ongoing efforts in Iraq. At that time, we were  spending money in Iraq at an unexpectedly high rate, the promised money  from Iraqi oil receipts was becoming an  urban legend, and we were still dealing  with a pervasive insurgency.  By June of 2004, we knew or should  have known that Iraq was going to be  a part of this Nation’s financial responsibility for some time to come. But I  understood that the situation was still  uncertain. We had only been in Iraq little more than a year and I was sure  that the President’s 2006 Defense budget proposal would more accurately reflect the costs of the war. I understood  that we could not drop the ball on the  welfare of our troops. I supported the  President’s request.  Now the President is requesting an  additional $80 billion to support ongoing military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It seems as if we have been here  before. I have to ask myself, when does  an ‘‘emergency’’ supplemental request  become  sufficiently  routine  that  it  should be considered as part of our normal budget process?  Over the last 2 years we have been  subjected  to  this  ‘‘emergency’’  four  times. We have had two budgets come  to Capitol Hill from this administration  in that time. Neither of those  budgets requested one thin dime  in  support of our troops in Iraq or Afghanistan.  The present way in which we fund  these  conflicts  is  irresponsible  and  unsustainable. This administration, by  not properly submitting this request  through the normal budget and appropriations process, has effectively cut  off our oversight role.  We now only have a scant few weeks  to consider one of the most important  pieces of  funding  legislation we will  consider  this year. Furthermore, as  this supplemental becomes more and  more routine, we run the risk of hiding  the true costs of the war  from the  American people.  The American  people  have  every  right to know, in as clear and straightforward a manner as possible, what the  financial costs of the war are. By excluding those costs from the normal  budget process we obscure the true effect of this conflict on our national  debt, our budget and our economy. I  believe that the American people deserve more transparency from us.  We are now at the point where poor  budget planning is no longer acceptable. We can no longer accept the argument  that  unexpected  events  have  changed our outlook therefore we must  have a supplemental. We know that  Iraq is unpredictable. We know that  unforseen events occur. Our planning  must be flexible enough to accommodate this reality.  We see very clearly the effects of  poor planning. We have seen it in the  way our troops have been inadequately  equipped early on in this conflict. We  have seen it in the way this administration has failed to properly budget  and has been forced to run to Congress  for emergency funds every 6 months.  In spite of the haphazard way that  this administration has planned for the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:14 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S21AP5.REC S21AP5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005
410,136,2005-04-21,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President,  combating violent crime, especially gun  crime, requires that our law enforcement agencies are adequately staffed  and equipped. I have been a strong supporter of the Community Oriented Policing Services, COPS, program. The  COPS Program has been critical to our  Nation’s law enforcement community  since  its creation  in 1994, and I am  pleased to join Senator BIDENas a cosponsor of the COPS Reauthorization  Act.  The COPS Program was designed to  assist State and local law enforcement  agencies in hiring additional police officers to reduce crime through the use  of community policing.  In Michigan  alone, 514 local and State law enforcement agencies have received more than  $220 million  in grants  through  the  COPS  Program  since  its  creation.  These grants have improved the safety  of communities by putting more than  3,300  law  enforcement  officers  on  Michigan  streets and by  supporting  other important programs. Nationwide,  the COPS Program has awarded more  than $11 billion in grants, resulting in  the hiring of 118,000 additional police  officers.  In my home State, the Detroit Police  Department, DPD, used a COPS grant  to hire additional officers that were  needed to implement a 5-year community policing plan. Prior to the COPS  grant award, the DPD lacked sufficient  personnel  to  effectively  cover high  crime areas. The community policing  plan placed teams of officers in neighborhoods to combat rising crime rates  and work with residents to develop  crime reduction strategies. The plan  resulted in a drop in the number of reported violent crimes as well as improved  police-community  relations.  The success of the Detroit Police Department  illustrates  the  important  role that COPS grants play in the safety of communities around the country.  Unfortunately, authorization for the  COPS Program was permitted to expire  at the end of fiscal year 2000. Although  the program has survived through the  annual appropriations process, it has  received significant  funding cuts.  In  fact, the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act  included only  $606  million  for the COPS Program, $142  million below the amount appropriated  in 2004. In addition, President Bush’s  fiscal year  2006 budget would  completely  eliminate  the COPS  hiring  grants. Despite the important positive  impact of the COPS Program in Detroit and across the country, the President justified his cuts by calling the  program ‘‘nonperforming’’ and not having  ‘‘a  record of demonstrating  results.’’ Our State and local law enforcement agencies know better and we  should listen to them.  The  COPS  Reauthorization  Act  would continue the COPS Program for  another 6 years at a funding level of  $1.15 billion per year. This  funding  would allow State and  local governments to hire an additional 50,000 police officers over the next 6 years. In  addition, the bill would modernize the  COPS Program by authorizing $350 million  in  law enforcement  technology  grants to assist police departments in  acquiring  new  technologies  for  the  analysis of crime data and the examination of DNA evidence, among other  uses. The COPS Reauthorization Act  would also build upon the accomplishments of the original COPS Program  by authorizing $200 million in community prosecutor grants. These grants  would be used to hire community prosecutors trained to work at the local  and  neighborhood  level  to  prevent  crime and improve relations with residents.  At a time when we are asking more  of our police departments than ever before, I believe we should be devoting  more resources to the COPS Program,  not less.

411,143,2005-04-21,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to pay tribute to a good friend  who recently retired after three decades on the radio. John Ed Willoughby,  who has  been  a  familiar  voice  on  WAPI-AM  1070s morning  talk-radio  show, ‘‘The Breakfast Club,’’ signed off  on April 15, 2005. John Ed’s last day on  the air was the 30th anniversary of his  first day on the air: April 15, 1975. Over  the years, I had many opportunities to  join John Ed on the air, and I always  appreciated his candid, honest, and humorous demeanor.  John Ed was born February 3, 1935, in  Birmingham, AL. He attended West  End High School, where he excelled on  the athletic field as quarterback of the  football team, and captain of the baseball and basketball teams.  He attended the University of Alabama  in Tuscaloosa, which  is where  our friendship began. We met as students at the University of Alabama,  and it was there that we both served as  members of the Delta Chi fraternity.  His radio career began  in 1975 on  WSGN  radio  with  cohost  Tommy  Charles. The duo was an instant success  and  became Birmingham’s  top  rated radio morning show for 81⁄2years.  John Ed and Tommy then moved to  WVOK-AM/WQUS-FM for a short time  before going to WERC radio in 1985.  They were a talk radio  force to be  reckoned with, remaining No. 1 in Birmingham, until Tommy’s passing  in  1996. Following Tommy’s death, Doug  Layton joined John Ed and they stayed  on the air until February of 1998. In  June of 1998, John Ed joined his son, J  Willoughby and Scott Michaels for a  morning show devoted to talk radio on  WAPI-AM  called  ‘‘The  Breakfast  Club.’’ He would finish out his career  at WAPI.  I have had  the pleasure of being  interviewed  by  John Ed  numerous  times over the years. Whether it was  in-studio  in Birmingham,  in Washington during one of his visits, or over  the phone, John Ed has been informative and fair. His listeners could count  on  a  funny  and  enlightening  show  every morning.  John Ed is blessed with a wonderful  family.  I suspect that his newfound  free time will give him the opportunity  to enjoy more time with his wife Jean,  son J, daughter-in-law Kim and granddaughter Samantha Jean. Incidentally,  J Willoughby has assumed the reins  from his father, and is on the air with  Richard Dixon.  John Ed has been a great friend to  me and a familiar and loyal voice to so  many in Alabama. He will be greatly  missed by his devoted listeners, but I  am certain they join me in wishing him  the very best as he embarks on many  new endeavors.∑  f  IN RECOGNITION OF DR. PAUL W.  DOERRER  ∑",2005
412,143,2005-04-21,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President,  it  is a  privilege today to bring to the attention of my colleagues the accomplishments of Dr. Paul W. Doerrer, the 2005  recipient of the Missouri Association of  School  Administrators’  Robert  L.  Pearce Award. The Pearce Award is the  most prestigious honor that can be bestowed on a school superintendent in  the State of Missouri, particularly so  because the honoree is selected by a  committee of peers.  The Ritenour School District in St.  Louis County has been  fortunate to  have  the  leadership  skills  of Dr.  Doerrer for the past 35 years. The Missouri Legislature and State board of  education were in the forefront and enacted standards-based education  long  before the passage of No Child Left Behind. In fact, the standards set in Missouri are among the highest in the Nation. Under the able instructional leadership of Dr. Doerrer,  the Ritenour  School District has not only met but in  many cases has exceeded the rigorous  goals our State has set  for student  achievement  of  adequate  yearly  progress.  In  addition,  under  Dr.  Doerrer’s able leadership, the Ritenour  School District was recently named as  one of the ‘‘Best Places to Work’’ by  the St. Louis Business Journal.  Dr. Doerrer has truly exemplified instructional  leadership  in our State.  Whether  it  is staff development,  instructional  technology,  human  resources,  or  data  driven  decisionmaking, Dr. Doerrer has provided the  vision and energy that has brought distinction to the Ritenour School District.  It  is with admiration  that  I  honor Dr. Doerrer today and congratulate him as the 19th recipient of the  Robert L. Pearce Award.∑  f  ATTACHE´SHOW CHOIR  ∑",2005

414,150,2005-04-21,Mr.  SANTORUM.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing ‘‘The America  Saving  for Personal Investment, Retirement, and Education (ASPIRE) Act  of 2005’’ along with Senator CORZINE,  Senator SCHUMERand Senator DEMINT.  A bipartisan group of members is introducing companion  legislation  in the  House of Representatives. The bill creates a Kids Investment and Development Savings (KIDS) Account for every  child at birth and creates a new opportunity for the children of low-income  Americans to build assets and wealth.  This  country has  seen a growing  number of Americans investing in the  stock market and has witnessed an historic boom in homeownership, which  has  increased to record high  levels.  However, this growth in assets has not  reached every American. While many  middle-  and  upper-income  families  have increased their assets in the past  decade, many low-income families have  not had the same financial success. A  recent study conducted by the Federal  Reserve  found  that  the median net  worth of families in the bottom 20 percent of the nation’s income level was a  mere $7,900—an amount that is far too  low to ensure a comfortable economic  future for their family. This challenge  needs to be addressed to ensure that  lower income families have a significant opportunity to accrue wealth and  expand opportunities for their families.  Under  this  legislation, KIDS Accounts would be created after a child is  born and a Social Security number  issued. A one-time $500 deposit would  automatically be placed into a KIDS  account.  Children  from  households  below  the  national median  income  would receive an additional deposit of  $500 at birth and would be eligible to  receive  dollar-for-dollar  matching  funds up to $500 per year for voluntary  contributions to the account, which  cannot exceed $1,000 per year. All funds  grow tax-free. Access to the account  prior to age 18 would not be permitted,  but kids—in conjunction with  their  parents—would participate  in  investment decisions and watch their money  grow. When the young person turns 18,  he or she can use the accrued money  for asset building purposes such as education, homeownership, and retirement  planning. Accrued funds could also be  rolled over into a Roth IRA or 529 post-  secondary education account to expand  investment options.  I would like to highlight what I view  as the two major benefits of this legislation. The first, and most apparent, is  that this bill will help give younger individuals, especially low-income Americans, a sound financial start to begin  their adult life. For example, a typical  low-income family making modest but  steady contributions can create a KIDS  Account worth over $20,000 in 18 years.  Second, and perhaps more important,  is that KIDS Accounts create opportunities  for all Americans  to become  more financially literate. The account  holders and their guardians will choose  from a list of possible investment funds  and will be able to watch their investment grow over time. All Americans  will have the opportunity to see firsthand that a smart investment now can  grow  over  time  into  considerable  wealth.  I believe that this bill could be a significant and strategic step forward in  the effort to expand asset opportunities  to all Americans, and  lower-income  Americans in particular. I encourage  my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort.  ",2005
415,150,2005-04-21,Mr. CORZINE.," Mr. President, I am  pleased  to  join  with  Senators  Santorum, Schumer, and DeMint in introducing  the ASPIRE Act of  2005,  which would expand opportunities for  young adults, encourage savings, and  promote financial literacy, by establishing investment accounts, known as  KIDS Accounts,  for  every  child  in  America.  ASPIRE is based largely on a similar  initiative in the United Kingdom developed by Prime Minister Tony Blair.  Yet despite its British roots, the proposal  is based on the most basic of  American  values.  By  giving  every  young person resources with which to  get a start in life, ASPIRE will help realize the American ideal of equal opportunity. And by making every young  person an investor, the proposal would  encourage self reliance, promote savings, and give every family a personal  stake in America’s economy.  Under ASPIRE, an  investment account would be established for every  American child upon receiving a Social  Security number. Each account would  be  funded  initially with $500. Those  with  incomes  less than the national  median would  receive an additional  contribution of up to $500, and would  receive  a  one-for-one  government  match  for their  first $500 of private  contributions each year. Up to $1000 of  after-tax private contributions would  be allowed annually from any source.  Funds would accumulate tax-free and  could not be withdrawn for purposes  other than higher education until the  child reaches the age of 18. At that  point, funds could be withdrawn, according to Roth IRA guidelines, either  for higher education or for the purchase of a home. Funds left unspent  would be saved for retirement under  rules similar to those that apply to  Roth IRAs or rolled over to a 529 plan  for educational expenses. Once the account holder reaches the age of 30, the  initial  $500 government contribution  would have to be repaid, though exceptions could be made to avoid undue  hardship.  Accounts initially would be held by a  government entity that would be based  on the successful Thrift Savings Plan,  or TSP, which now manages retirement  accounts for Federal employees with  relatively low administrative costs. As  with the TSP, investors would have a  range of investment options, such as a  Government securities fund, a fixed income investment fund, and a common  stock fund. However, once an account  holder reaches the age of 18,  funds  could be rolled over to a KIDS Account  held at a private institution.  It is difficult to understate the potential impact of giving every American child a funded investment account  of their own. For the first time, every  child will have a meaningful incentive  to  learn the basics of  investing, because they will have real resources to  invest. For the first time, even families  with modest incomes will have a significant incentive to save, to earn the  government match. And, perhaps most  fundamentally, for the first time, every  American child will grow up knowing  that when they reach adulthood, they  will have the ability to invest in themselves and in their own education. In  short, every child will have hope for a  real future.  Considering  its potentially  significant social and individual benefits, the  ASPIRE Act requires an  investment  that is relatively modest.

416,171,2005-04-21,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to offer a bill with my colleagues  Senators  SNOWE,  CORZINE,  LEAHY, CANTWELL, COLLINS, DURBIN,  SCHUMER and JEFFORDS to close the  SUV loophole.  This bill would  increase Corporate  Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards  for SUVs and other  light duty  trucks. It would close the ‘‘SUV Loophole’’ and require that SUVs meet the  same fuel efficiency standards as passenger cars by 2011.  Crude oil prices remain above $50/barrel. On April 1, 2005, crude oil prices hit  a record high of $57.70/barrel. Prices at  the gas pump continue to soar as well.  Today, the average price for regular  gasoline was $2.24 per gallon. In California,  the average price  is almost  $2.60.  This is not a problem we can drill our  way out of. Global oil demand is rising.  China imports more than 40 percent of  its record 6.4 million-barrel-per-day oil  demand and its consumption is growing  by 7.5 percent per year, seven times  faster than the U.S.  India imports approximately 70 percent of its oil, which is projected to  rise to more than 90 percent by 2020.  Their rapidly growing economies are  fueling their growing dependence on  oil—which makes  continued  higher  prices inevitable.  The most effective step we can take  to reduce gas prices is to reduce demand. We must use our finite fuel supplies more wisely.  This legislation is an important first  step to limit our nation’s dependence  on oil and better protect our environment.  If  implemented,  closing  the SUV  Loophole would: save the U.S. 1 million  barrels of oil a day and reduce our dependence on oil imports by 10 percent.  Prevent about 240 million tons of carbon dioxide—the top greenhouse gas  and  biggest  single  cause  of  global  warming from entering the atmosphere  each year.  Save SUV and light duty truck owners hundreds of dollars each year in  gasoline costs.  CAFE Standards were  first established  in  1975. At  that  time,  light  trucks made up only a small percentage of the vehicles on the road, they  were used mostly for agriculture and  commerce, not as passenger cars.  Today, our  roads  look much different, SUVs and  light duty  trucks  comprise more than half of the new car  sales in the United States. As a result,  the overall fuel economy of our Nation’s fleet is the lowest it has been in  two  decades,  because  fuel  economy  standards  for  these vehicles are  so  much lower than they are for other  passenger vehicles.  The bill we are  introducing today  would change that. SUVs and other  light duty trucks would have to meet  the same fuel economy requirements  by 2011 that passenger cars meet today.  The National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration, NHTSA, has proposed  phasing in an increase in fuel economy  standards for SUVs and light trucks  under the following schedule: by 2005,  SUVs and light trucks would have to  average 21.0 miles per gallon; by 2006,  SUVs and light trucks would have to  average 21.6 miles per gallon; and by  2007, SUVs and light trucks would have  to average 22.2 miles per gallon.  In  2002,  the National Academy of  Sciences, NAS, released a report stating that adequate lead time can bring  about  substantive  increases  in  fuel  economy standards. Automakers can  meet higher CAFE standards if existing  technologies are utilized and included  in new models  of SUVs  and  light  trucks.  In 2003, the head of the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration  said he favored an increase in vehicle  fuel economy standards beyond the 1.5-  mile-per-gallon hike slated to go into  effect by 2007. ‘‘We can do better,’’ said  Jeffrey Runge  in an  interview with  Congressional  Green  Sheets.  ‘‘The  overriding goal here is better fuel economy to decrease our reliance on foreign  oil without compromising  safety or  American jobs,’’ he said.  With this in mind, we have developed  the following phase-in schedule which  would follow up on what NHTSA has  proposed for the short term and remain  consistent with what the NAS report  said is technologically feasible over the  next decade or so: by model year 2008,  SUVs and  light duty vehicles would  have to average 23.5 miles per gallon;  by model year 2009, SUVs and  light  duty vehicles would have to average  24.8 miles per gallon; by model year  2010, SUVs and  light duty vehicles  would have to average 26.1 miles per  gallon, by model year 2011, SUVs and  light duty vehicles would have to average 27.5 miles per gallon.  This legislation would do two other  things: it would mandate that by 2008  the average fuel economy of the new  vehicles comprising the Federal fleet  must be 3 miles per gallon higher than  the baseline average fuel economy for  that class. And by 2011, the average  fuel economy of the new federal vehicles must be 6 miles per gallon higher  than the baseline average fuel economy  for that class.  The bill also  increases the weight  limit within which vehicles are bound  by CAFE standards to make it harder  for automotive manufacturers to build  SUVs large enough to become exempted  from  CAFE  standards.  Because  SUVs are becoming larger and larger,  some may become so large that they  will no longer qualify as even SUVs  anymore.  We are introducing this legislation  because we believe  that  the United  States needs to take a leadership role  in the fight against global warming.  We have already seen the potential  destruction that global warming can  cause in the United States.  Snowpacks in the Sierra Nevada are  shrinking and will almost entirely disappear by the end of the century, devof  the  source  California’s  astating  water.  Eskimos are being forced inland in  Alaska as their native homes on the  coastline are melting into the sea.  Glaciers are disappearing in Glacier  National Park  in Montana.  In  100  years, the park has gone from having  150 glaciers to fewer than 30. And the 30  that  remain  are  two-thirds  smaller  than they once were.  Beyond our borders, scientists are  predicting how the  impact of global  warming will be felt around the globe.  It has been estimated that two-thirds  of the glaciers in western China will  melt by 2050, seriously diminishing the  water supply for the region’s 300 million inhabitants. Additionally, the disappearance of glaciers in the Andes in  Peru is projected to leave the population without an adequate water supply during the summer.  The United States is the largest energy consumer in the world, with 4 percent of the world’s population using 25  percent of the planet’s energy.  And much of this energy is used in  cars and light trucks: 43 percent of the  oil we use goes into our vehicles and  one-third of all carbon dioxide emissions come  from our  transportation  sector.  The U.S. is falling behind the rest of  the world in the development of more  fuel efficient automobiles. Quarterly  auto sales reflect that consumers are  buying smaller more fuel efficient cars  and sales of the big, luxury vehicles  that are the preferred vehicle of the  American  automakers have  dropped  significantly.  Even SUV sales have slowed. First  quarter 2005 deliveries of these vehicles  are down compared to the same period  last year—for example, sales of the  Ford Excursion is down by 29.5 percent,  the Cadillac Escalade by 19.9 percent,  and the Toyota Sequoia by 12.6 percent.  On the other hand, the Toyota Prius  hybrid had record sales in March with  a 160.9 percent increase over the previous year.  The struggling U.S. auto market cannot afford to fall behind in the development of fuel efficient vehicles. Our bill  sets out a reasonable time frame for  car manufacturers to design vehicles  that are more fuel efficient and that  will meet the growing demand for more  fuel efficient vehicles.  We can do this, and we can do this  today. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 889  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Automobile  Fuel Economy Act of 2005’’.

417,178,2005-04-21,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  speak on the importance and effectiveness of  defibrillators. Heart disease kills more  than  250,000 Americans each year and many of  these deaths result  from sudden cardiac arrest, SCA. The most effective  treatment  for  SCA is immediate defibrillation, in which thousands of  lives are saved. Recognizing  this  years ago, I had the honor of working with the  American Heart Association, AHA,  in developing  legislation addressing SCA. This cooperation  led  to  the Cardiac Arrest Survival  Act. Now, I am pleased to see that the AHA  is  donating,  to  Alachua County,  Florida,  defibrillators  to  be  placed  in  each  public  school in Alachua County. The move comes in  light of two incidents earlier this school year,  in which area high school students collapsed.  In Florida, nearly 12,800 people suffer a cardiac arrest each year, and 95 percent of them  die. AHA’s goal is to increase the survival rate  from 5 to 20 percent and I support and stand  behind them in reaching this end.  f  TRIBUTE TO POPE BENEDICT XVI  HON.

418,178,2005-04-21,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute  to a man who embodies the values of strength  and wisdom. Seventeen days after Pope John  Paul II sadly succumbed to illnesses related to  Parkinson’s disease,  the Catholic community  and the world witnessed the ascension of a  new leader, former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger,  to the papacy.  Today, I join millions of Catholics around the  world  in  celebrating  the election of Pope  Benedict XVI and know that His Holiness will  continue to lead our church with the integrity  and compassion exhibited by  the dearly departed Pope John Paul II.  Since 1981, Pope Benedict XVI has led the  Congregation  for  the Doctrine of  the Faith  where his deep-seated religious beliefs played  an enormous role  in stabilizing  the Catholic  Church and community. He was a close confidant of Pope John Paul II and is known to all  as a  respected scholar and  teacher of  the  Catholic faith.  For over 54 years, Pope Benedict XVI has  dedicated himself to his God and his creed.  He  studied  at St. Michael’s  seminary  in  Traunstein, Germany  in  the 1940s and believes intimately in church doctrine and the orthodoxy of Catholicism. As  the  first German  pope since the 11th century, he will continue  the legacy of advocating for peace, social justice, and the dignity of the human spirit.  Pope Benedict is a steadfast believer in religious freedom and respect among all people  of  this world. He has a vision of how  the  Catholic Church will shape our world and future and will teach with humility and lead with  grace.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Church for their  decision  to elect Pope Benedict XVI  to  this  special and divine position.  I am happy  to  have him as my spiritual leader and guide and  hope that others will celebrate the new pope  of the Catholic Church.  f  RECOGNIZING TRAVIS R.

Vogel, a very special  young man who has exemplified  the  finest  qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 633, and in earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Travis received  his Eagle Award on March 5, 2005 at an  Eagle Court of Honor in Platte Woods, Missouri.  Travis has been very active with his troop,  participating in many Scout activities. Over the  many years Travis has been  involved with  Scouting, he has not only earned numerous  merit badges, but  the respect of his  family,  peers, and community. He is truly an exemplary Scout.  For his Eagle project, Travis remodeled the  walls of the VFW basement. Travis installed  new window well  frames, and  installed new  siding—which he also painted—on  the exterior. His work on  the  interior  included new  drywall,  patching  existing  wall  surfaces,  texturing and painting the walls, and adding a  chair rail. The project provided the VFW with  a nicer looking space, and the window framing  in particular will help the VFW save on energy  costs.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  commending Travis R. Vogel for his accomplishments with  the Boy Scouts of America  and for his efforts put forth in achieving the  highest distinction of Eagle Scout.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF MR. STEPHEN  ADUBATO, SR.

The Adubatos, as well  as the former Governor, the very Honorable  Thomas Kean, Sr. and his distinguished son,  New Jersey State Senator Thomas Kean, Jr.,  have been chosen to receive this prestigious  honor for compiling such exemplary records of  public service. Past recipients have included  such outstanding public servants as United  States Senator JONCORZINE, Representative  BILLPASCRELL, two former Governors of the  State of New Jersey, and corporate  leaders  Ted Turner and Donald Trump.  Mr. Adubato, Sr., is the founder and Executive Director of the North Ward Center, Newark Business Training  Institute, The Robert  Treat Academy Charter School and Casa  Israel. His life’s work has demonstrated to the  people of his native city, Newark, and the entire state of New Jersey, just what one dedicated, brilliant, and courageous man can accomplish  to  improve his community’s educational, civic, and cultural life. Mr. Adubato,  Sr., has also served as a teacher, supervisor,  and counselor for the Newark Board of Education, an instructor and consultant at Rutgers  University, a consultant to New Jersey’s Chancellor of Higher Education, and Director of External Affairs at the University of Medicine and  Dentistry of New Jersey.  Like his  father, Dr. Stephen Adubato, Jr.,  has also compiled a distinguished career as a  four-time Emmy Award-winning broadcaster,  best-selling author and motivational speaker.  In the mid–1980s, at the age of 26, he served  as New Jersey’s youngest state  legislator.

421,185,2005-04-21,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I  join my  fellow  Texans—and many around the Southwest and  the nation in paying special tribute to Laura  Canales, a very special artistic pioneer, and a  talented  South  Texan, who  accomplished  great  things  throughout her  lifetime of performing.  Before  there was  the  phenomenon  of  Tejano  giant  Selena,  there  was  Laura  Canales, who paved the way for a number of  Tejano artists  in  the  late 20th Century. She  contributed much  to our culture and  to  the  music  industry, and became known as  the  ‘‘Barbara Streisand of Tejano music’’ and as  ‘‘Reina de  la Onda Tejana,’’  (queen of  the  Tejano wave).  Tejano is a popular type of music in Texas  and the Southwest that has become a huge  industry with its own category in the Grammy  Awards. Tejano is a combination of rock-n-roll  and German Conjunto music. Some of the cultural  influences  on Tejano music  include:  Anglo, African, German, and Italian.  Tejano was originally dominated by male  performers and  it was nearly  impossible  for  women to break through in this genre. Laura  Canales, with her unique voice and  love of  performing, became the first woman to enjoy  real success in the world of Tejano, and was  honored as the first woman to be inducted into  the Tejano ROOTS Hall of Fame  in Alice,  Texas. This museum is the only one that is  entirely dedicated  in honoring great Tejano  music figures.  Laura’s influence on Tejano music became  readily apparent during the 1970’s and 1980’s.  With her distinctive voice and popularity, she  released various albums that became hits, including her debut album, Si Vivi Contigo. Her  numerous accomplishments  include a dozen  Tejano music awards, including Female Vocalist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, and  Female  Entertainer  of  the  Year.  This  Kingsville, Texas, native also understood the  value of education, earning a bachelor’s degree in clinical psychology from Texas A&M  University and pursuing a master’s degree.  Laura Canales proved that a woman could  be successful  in  the Tejano music  industry  . . . she broke  the gender barriers  that existed at the dawn of the emergence of popular  Tejano . . . and she and paved the way for  future, female Tejano performers.  This Tejano legend and daughter of South  Texas will truly be missed, although she will  live on in her music, to be enjoyed by many  future connoisseurs of Tejano. I ask my colleagues to join me in keeping her family—and  her many fans—in our thoughts and prayers at  this difficult time.  f  IN HONOR OF THE CITY OF  HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY  HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 20, 2005  ",2005
422,185,2005-04-21,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the city of Hoboken, New Jersey, on  its sesquicentennial celebration. The people of  Hoboken will be commemorating  this event  with a series of activities throughout the spring  and summer. Last weekend,  the community  held its 150th Anniversary Parade on April 16,  2005.  Located on the shore of the Hudson River,  Hoboken  is known  for  its  lively atmosphere  and rich history. The area was developed almost single-handedly by Colonel John Stevens, who bought  the  land  for $90,000  in  1784. On March 28, 1855, it was incorporated  as a city. The late nineteenth century brought  a sharp increase in immigration due to Hoboken’s proximity to Ellis Island and, by 1890,  over 40 percent of the population was foreign-  born. Hoboken developed and grew as a manufacturing hub with shipbuilding as the primary  industry. The 20th century also brought  the  development of public transportation and the  railroads,  ferries, and Port Authority Trans-  Hudson, PATH, Tube that transformed Hoboken into a bustling transportation center. The  city piers soon became a focal point for trans-  Atlantic commerce. More  than  three million  Americans passed through Hoboken on their  way to or from World War I. In the past few  decades the shipyards have closed as Hoboken has transformed from an industrial area  into an affluent neighborhood  full of young  professionals and known for its variety of restaurants and vibrant nightlife.  The birthplace of Frank Sinatra, Hoboken  also claims such famous citizens as photographer Dorothea Lange and painter Willem de  Kooning. Additionally, it boasts many notable  firsts, including the first ice cream cone, the  first steamboat, the first locomotive, and the  first brewery. Many also believe that the first  organized baseball game was played on Hoboken’s Elysian Fields in 1846.  In order  to commemorate  its momentous  sesquicentennial  birthday,  Hoboken  has  planned a wide variety of celebrations that will  serve to honor the progress and development  of the past 150 years. Some of these activities  include  the creation of a  time capsule,  the  painting of a historical mural, an anniversary  gala and  fundraiser, an evening concert series, and a spaghetti dinner block party. Hoboken will also host a vintage baseball festival  and an arts and music festival.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring the city of Hoboken on its 150th anniversary. This momentous occasion allows us  to reflect on the city’s colorful past and look  towards its promising future with hope and enthusiasm. I am proud to be a resident of this  community, and I congratulate the people of  Hoboken on making this city a wonderful place  to call home.  EQUAL PAY DAY  HON. BETTY McCOLLUM  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 20, 2005  ",2005
423,185,2005-04-21,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in  recognition of working  women across America and in support of the  Paycheck Fairness Act.  Every April, supporters of equal pay mark  our progress on this issue by noting the time  of year in which women’s wages ‘‘catch up’’ to  the wages paid to men from the previous year.  Although we have made great strides in women’s equality, women still earn $.76 for each  dollar that men earn. In my home state of Minnesota, that number is $.72. In real terms, this  means  that women and  their  families are  being shortchanged  thousands of dollars a  year.  Minnesota women have  the highest  labor  force participation  in  the nation and educational attainment continues  to grow. With  this remarkable increase in women’s participation in the economy, more and more families  are  reliant on women’s paychecks  to make  ends meet. If we are serious about ensuring  fairness for all, about leaving no child behind,  and about helping  families achieve  financial  stability now and in the future, then Congress  must act to address this significant wage gap.  For this reason, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act. This bill will  take concrete steps to eliminate gender-based  wage discrimination.  It will provide  for enhanced outreach and  training programs  for  employers, allow employees  to share salary  information, and give women the opportunity  to sue for punitive damages under the Equal  Pay Act. It is my hope that the Administration  and the Republican leadership will make a serious effort to address this discrimination this  Congress.  Along with wage disparity, we must continue  to focus on issues of work place safety, equal  treatment, and  career advancement. As a  woman, a mother, and a Member of Congress,  I will continue  to  fight  for equal pay,  quality health care, safe work environments,  and  education  opportunities  for  girls  and  women  to ensure  that  they can pursue  the  American dream.  f  RECOGNIZING EDWARD A.

425,192,2005-04-21,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, I join Chairman YOUNG in introducing, by request, the Administration’s Amtrak ‘‘reform’’ legislation. It is  a common practice  for  the Chairman and  Ranking Member of a Committee to jointly introduce an Administration’s bill, regardless of  which political party controls the White House  or Congress or the specifics of proposed legislation, and I do this as a courtesy to the Administration. However, introducing a bill ‘‘by request’’ should not be interpreted to imply endorsement.  In  fact,  in  this  instance,  I am  strongly opposed to the Administration’s legislative proposal  for Amtrak and  the direction  this Administration has chosen  for  intercity  passenger rail service in our Nation.  The Administration’s  proposal  is  nothing  new. It is the same flawed bill that the Administration sent to Congress in 2003. The bill establishes two private for-profit corporations to  separately manage and maintain infrastructure  and operations, eliminates our Nation’s intercity passenger rail network and shifts the cost  burden of continuing rail service to the States,  separates the Northeast Corridor from the rest  of the rail network, divides Amtrak into three  separate entities, and eliminates Federal operating support for all intercity passenger trains  over a four-year period. As a practical matter,  within three years, all long-distance train service is likely to be eliminated. Soon thereafter,  the United States entire  intercity passenger  system could consist of skeletal service along  the East and West coasts.  The Administration’s  trust  in  the magic of  privatization and decentralization to solve Amtrak’s problems  is astonishing.  It shows  this  Administration’s  ignorance of  the disastrous  consequences of privatization and under-investment  in  rail. Great Britain’s experience  with privatization  is a perfect example.  In  1994, government-owned British Rail was dissolved and the British government separated  intercity passenger rail infrastructure from operations. A private corporation called Railtrack  took over ownership of all track, signaling, and  stations. Passenger train operators competed  with each other  to provide service. Unfortunately,  the new approach assumed  that private sector  innovation and discipline would  drive down  the  railway’s public  funding  requirement and drive up quality of service,  overcoming recent trends of falling demand. It  didn’t work, and it led to tragic consequences.  The safety of operations and the quality of  service declined steadily. More than 30 people  were killed in an accident at Ladbroke Grove  in 1999 and four more were killed in an accident at Hatfield in 2000. In 2001, another fatal  accident occurred at Potters, just north of London. These accidents were directly traceable  to privatization and Britain’s  long history of  under-investment in rail.  Today,  the British government  is  reeling  from  the  legacy  left behind by privatization.  The government has almost doubled funding  for rail, and has taken steps to improve performance and  tackle  the backlog of maintenance and renewal needs that exploded under  privatization. British government officials have  described their rail privatization as ‘‘an absolute disaster’’.  Despite the British experience, the Bush Administration’s blind faith in the ideology of privatization leads it down the same wrong path.  Let us not repeat Britain’s mistake. The solution to Amtrak’s problems is not privatization.  Amtrak’s  problems  have  one  root  cause:  money. Lack of adequate investment and the  annual threat of elimination have conditioned  Amtrak to focus on survival.  Amtrak’s opponents are quick to point fingers at Amtrak management, and claim that  private  corporations  could  dramatically  improve  intercity passenger  rail  service. The  truth is that a succession of hardworking and  dedicated management teams at Amtrak could  not do  the  impossible—that  is, operate our  Nation’s intercity rail passenger service without a substantial level of investment from the  Federal Government. Railroads throughout the  world  receive some government support  to  supplement the revenues paid by passengers.  But the Administration continues to insist on  the impossible.  Yet despite Amtrak’s starvation budget, Amtrak has had  its  successes. Under David  Gunn’s leadership, Amtrak has improved operations and increased ridership to more than 25  million passengers in 2004: an increase of one  million passengers from 2003 and an Amtrak  record. In Southern California, Amtrak’s Pacific  Surfliner has had a 26.3 percent increase in  ridership  in  the past year.  In Southern California, Amtrak’s Pacific Surfliner has had a  26.3 percent increase in ridership in the past  year. Similarly, several Midwest  trains,  the  Pere Marquette (up 22.1 percent), the State  House (up 13 percent) and the Illini (up 11.4  percent),  experienced  the  next  largest  increases in passengers. In the East, regional  trains carried more passengers than any other  Amtrak service in the country, increasing from  5,760,499 last year to 5,974,806—an increase  of 3.7 percent.  Amtrak has also made significant progress  in  rebuilding  infrastructure and  rolling stock  after years of deferred maintenance. In fiscal  years 2003 and 2004, 256,000 concrete ties  were  laid; 2,755 bridge  ties were  replaced;  266 miles of continuous welded rail were installed; 34 miles of signal cable were  replaced; and 19 stations and 37 substations  were improved.  Amtrak’s mechanical department plowed full  steam ahead. In 2004, it remanufactured 180  passenger cars, rebuilt 51 wrecked cars and  locomotives, and made seven Superliner baggage modifications in passenger cars.  Amtrak sold excess equipment, eliminated  unprofitable services, lowered fares on long-  distance routes to increase ridership, and, in  partnership  with  the  State  of  California,  opened a $71 million maintenance facility.  In short, Amtrak is making great progress.  All of this progress will halt under the Administration’s radical Amtrak reform plan.  Therefore, while I join in introducing this bill  as a traditional courtesy to the Administration,  I want to be clear that I do not support its initiatives. Together with Chairman YOUNG, Subcommittee  Chairman  Subcommittee Ranking Member BROWN, and the  other Members of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure,  I strongly support  both H.R. 1630,  the Amtrak Reauthorization  Act of 2005, and H.R. 1631,  the Rail  Infrastructure Development and Expansion Act for  the 21st Century (RIDE 21). In the 108th Congress,  the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure reported similar bills with near  unanimous bipartisan support. I am very hopeful that the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure will again soon consider this bipartisan  legislation and begin  to provide  the  necessary investment for our Nation’s intercity  passenger  rail system—that  is  the  ‘‘reform’’  that Amtrak so direly needs.

429,2,2005-05-03,Mr. CHABOT.," Mr. Speaker, for several years now, President Bush’s judicial nominees have been filibustered,  including those who would fill four vacancies in the Sixth Circuit Court of  Appeals located in my district in Cincinnati, Ohio. This is unprecedented.  Some would have us believe blocking  judicial nominations is a long and revered tradition. Nothing could be further from the truth. Never before have  judicial nominees with clear majority  support been denied the courtesy of an  up-or-down vote. Not once.  The filibuster is not part of the Constitution. It is not even part of the old  Senate rules. While it is a useful tool  when  considering  legislation,  and  should remain as such, we cannot allow  filibustering of  judicial nominations.  Each time a nominee is denied an up-  or-down vote, the impact is vast. Not  only is our Federal judiciary weakened,  but our Constitution becomes more  vulnerable; and as chairman of  the  Subcommittee on the Constitution, let  me emphasize that these actions are  unprecedented and should be abhorrent  to those of us who are bound by oath to  uphold our country’s most sacred document, the United States Constitution.  ASTHMA AWARENESS DAY  ",2005
430,2,2005-05-03,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Pursuant to the order of the House of January 4, 2005, the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. STEARNS)  is  recognized  during  morning hour debates for 5 minutes.  ",2005
431,2,2005-05-03,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Asthma Awareness Day. I rise to  celebrate  the October  2003  enacted  Asthmatic Students Treatment  and  Health Management Act, ASTHMA. It  is now Public Law 108–377 and was H.R.  2023 in the House and the Senate bill  was S. 2815. I introduced this with the  gentleman  from Rhode  Island  (Mr.  KENNEDY), and Senator ENZIand Senator KENNEDYcarried the mantle there.  Mr. Speaker, this law provides incentives for States to pass favorable laws  that guarantee that students can carry  and use prescribed medicine and anaphylaxis medications while in school.  It is not a mandate, and incurs no new  spending. The  idea has been germinating since the early 1990s and has  been building momentum since.  On Asthma Awareness Day, May 7,  2003, there were only 20 asthma-friendly States in our United States. Even  more limiting, of these 20, only nine  extended that protection even further  to anaphylaxis medication  like epinephrine auto-injectors. Today, according to the Allergy and Asthma Network, Mothers of Asthmatics, we have  a strong number of 41 States protecting  for asthma, 26 for asthma plus anaphylaxis, and four have legislation pending  for both conditions. Four that have  asthma laws have legislation pending  for anaphylaxis, and there is one State  just getting started and has legislation  that  is pending  for asthma anaphylaxis-carrying students.  Mr. Speaker, this is a dramatic upswing for our children. I am especially  proud to report what is going on in  Florida. Florida has been an inhaler-  friendly State for years, but now there  is legislation pending to include epinephrine auto-injectors.  My friend and constituent, Dr. Karl  Altenberger,  an  allergist  in Ocala,  Florida, has been active in advancing  this  for his patients  in the Florida  State  legislature. He  is to be commended. This bill passed last week and  is ready for the Governor’s signature.  Just yesterday, the Orlando Sentinel  reported ‘‘Girl fights for allergy law as  lives depend on it.’’ In Celebration, a  central Florida town, lives 9-year-old  Kelsey Ryan. ‘‘Severely allergic to peanuts, she has never known life without  her EpiPen. The dose of adrenaline inside could save her life and is with her  at all times: in classrooms, on field  trips, and during school activities. Now  Kelsey has been urging Tallahassee  lawmakers to pass a bill that would  allow  the  estimated  100,000 Florida  school children with  life-threatening  allergies  the  same  access  to  this  EpiPen.  Kelsey has testified before four Tallahassee committees since February,  meeting  lawmakers and passing out  practice injectors urging them to pass  the bill. We might call Kelsey a true  respiration  inspiration. She shares a  quote,  ‘‘My mom  told me  in  some  schools, there are children like myself  who need the EpiPen with them, but it  is locked far away in the clinic.’’ She  told the committee that  if someone  needed their EpiPen, it might not get  to them in time.  Kelsey’s charisma and dedication led  legislators  in Tallahassee to rename  H.B. 279 the Kelsey Ryan Act. More  than 60 State legislators cosponsored  the bill which the House passed earlier  this month 114 to 0. The Senate passed  it last week, and it is on the desk of  Governor Jeb Bush.  Brenda Olson, director of governmental affairs for the American Lung  Association of Florida points out that  ‘‘most schools in Florida do not allow  students to carry the EpiPen.’’ As we  have been saying for years, ‘‘Moments  count when these reactions start.’’  Kelsey’s mother, Blair Ryan, emphasized another point we made in our bill,  H.R. 2023, that this is a team effort between the student, the parents, the  physician, and the school. If a parent  and physician believe that a student is  mature and competent to treat him or  herself, a school should not impede this  medical regimen, but help it work for  the student.  Currently,  school  districts  across  Florida have different policies on this  matter, and some may well not serve a  student who  just  accidentally  got  stung by a bee or ate a cookie with an  unknown walnut. Officials in Volusia  and Orange counties said the majority  of EpiPen are kept locked in school  clinics. This is disastrous for the student’s health and potentially a lawsuit  on the school.  In conclusion, I am pleased with the  strong progress on this issue here in  our Nation’s Capitol and in the State  houses. I invite everyone to join us in  the Cannon Caucus Room tomorrow at  11:30 a.m. for a congressional briefing  followed by free asthma screenings and  asthma  health  clinics  and  exhibits  from 1 to 3:30 p.m. This year, Asthma  Awareness Day  is truly a breath of  fresh air.  Mr. Speaker,  tomorrow,  is Asthma Awareness Day and I rise to celebrate the October  2003-enacted Asthmatic Students Treatment  and Health Management Act (ASTHMA). What  is now P.l. 108–377, and was H.R. 2023 in the  House and S. 2815 in the Senate, I had introduced on 2003’s Asthma Awareness Day with  my  friend Representative PATRICK from Rhode  Island.

Mr. Speaker, charter schools are one  of the most innovative developments in  the history of public education in our  country, and they came from the bottom up. They have not developed out of  State governments or the like. They  have come from searches within jurisdictions  for  all  alternative  public  schools, and this is what they are.  In the District of Columbia, we think  of the charter schools as an alternative  public school system because there are  so many of them. We have 43 charter  schools in this one city alone, and that  is  the  largest  number  of  charter  schools per capita in the United States.  Why  are  there  so many  charter  schools? We feel strongly in the District of Columbia that public money  must go to public schools, and it is understood that here and throughout the  United States  public  schools which  have to take every child are often overcrowded and underfunded, have had a  very tough time making up for what  particularly  the most disadvantaged  children do not bring to school. As a  result, public schools in many jurisdictions show low scores for children in  those schools.  What is a parent to do? What parents  increasingly do is look for a public alternative to their public schools. They  want better schools, but the public is  very clear that it wants public money  for public schools. If we have any doubt  about that, remember that even this  House has never voted a voucher bill  for, nor has the Senate, anywhere except for the District of Columbia where  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:02 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H03MY5.REC H03MY5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005

(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to revise and  extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam  Speaker, I thank the ranking member  very much for yielding me this time  and the sponsor of this legislation and  my colleagues, because I believe that  we come unanimous to the floor to acknowledge the 30th anniversary of the  fall of the Republic of Vietnam to, unfortunately, the Communist forces, but  to stand tall with the resolved in Vietnam that  fought steadfastly against  those forces and to applaud the Vietnamese community which I have the  opportunity of interacting with and, of  course, working with in my own community of Houston.  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and to have supported the recent event this past weekend commemorating the contributions  and, of course, the commitment of the  Vietnamese  people  and  their  longstanding  commitment  to  Vietnam.  Truly, the Vietnam War has had a lasting impact on our Nation and, indeed,  the world in the 30 years since it has  ended. The nation of Vietnam today is  showing  signs  of  economic  revival.  Much like China, Vietnam is realizing  that market reforms that are more  open and free can yield a greater fiscal  growth and development.  However, again like China, Vietnam  must also take the same approach in  respecting opposition and, of course,  freedom and civil  liberties. Unfortunately, the citizens of Vietnam must  still endure arbitrary arrests, detentions without trial and the censorship  of peaceful expressions of political and  religious beliefs. These practices are  not uncommon because they are written into the national constitution. Specifically, article 4 of the constitution  of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam  ensures  the  supremacy of  the Vietnamese Community Party as the only  political party in the country. At the  same time, the government continues  to enforce an extra-legal administrative decree to detain or place under  house arrest any dissidents or civilians  for up to 2 years, without trial, under  the pretext of endangering national security.  That is why, Madam Speaker, I have  been  concerned  about  establishing  trade relations that has not answered  the question of the freedom of people in  parts of Vietnam and particularly in  the Communist areas. I also believe it  is important to stand up to demand  that those who have been incarcerated  and detained are released and to say to  those who are here, the Vietnamese  community, that we stand with them  in order to ensure the reuniting of  their family members, many of them  separated now for decades.  b1530  But that has not stopped the Vietnamese  community  in Houston,  in  Texas, and around the Nation  from  being strong advocates and supporters  of their individual communities. They  are business persons, they are artists,  they are teachers, they are community  leaders.  I want to thank the community in  Houston for raising over $100,000 and  coming to the aid of the victims of the  tsunami by working with Houston’s  Solution for Tsunami Relief. I would  like to acknowledge their artistic activities by  saluting  the Vietnamese  Dance Company, saluting the first Vietnamese who was elected to the State  legislature in the last election, and of  course to salute those individuals who  befriend and take care of their senior  citizens. They have one of the best citizens programs for many of these elderly Vietnamese  citizens who do not  speak the language because they came  to this country way after the prime of  their life, but there is no more group  that loves freedom as much as the Vietnamese community. And my senior  citizens, who may not be able to speak  English very well, I can assure Members that freedom is in their hearts,  that they love this Nation, that they  realize that they are in a country that  is free and respects them.  So  I  am  proud  to  recognize  the  achievements  of Vietnamese Americans in 3 decades since the end of the  Vietnam War. And I am proud to say  that the city of Houston is home to  about 160,000 Vietnamese who maintain  an  active  and  vibrant  community.  They  live at Bellaire. They have a  Vietnam town there. One can find Vietnamese shops and restaurants, places  of worship, but I will say they are very  welcoming. 900 AM is Radio Saigon in  Houston. They believe in being part of  this Nation.  On April 30, 1975, the Republic of  Vietnam fell to the Communist forces;  but now we are standing to say that  even as it fell, it yielded 3 million refugees, at least 500,000 individuals who  died at sea trying to escape from danger, but  they  came  to  the United  States and they stand together as free  and united.  I congratulate the community, and I  thank the distinguished ranking member for his leadership also.  I rise today as a cosponsor of H. Res. 228,  which observes the 30th anniversary of the fall  of the Republic of Vietnam to the Communist  forces of North Vietnam. In addition, this resolution honors the contributions of Vietnamese  Americans to American Society over the past  three decades. Truly,  the Vietnam War has  had a lasting impact on our Nation and indeed  the world in the 30 years since it ended.  The nation of Vietnam  today  is showing  signs of economic revival. Much  like China,  Vietnam is realizing that market reforms that  are more open and free can yield greater fiscal growth and development. However, much  like China, Vietnam must also take the same  approach of open opposition and freedom for  its civil liberties. Unfortunately, the citizens of  Vietnam must still endure arbitrary arrests, detentions without  trial, and  the censorship of  peaceful expressions of political and religious  beliefs. these practices are not uncommon because they are written into the nation Constitution. Specifically, Article 4 of the Constitution  of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam ensures  the supremacy of the Vietnamese Communist  Party as the only political party in the country.  At the same time the government continues to  enforce an extra-legal administrative decree to  detain or place under house arrest any dissidents or civilians for up to 2 years, without  trail, under  the pretext of  ‘‘endangering national security.’’ As a Member of Congress I  have always stood for human rights and these  practices go against all tenants of good governance. Truly, any nation  in  this era  that  hopes  to have  its place  in  the  international  community must maintain proper standards in  human rights.  I am proud to recognize the achievements  of Vietnamese Americans  in  the 3 decades  since the end of the Vietnam War. I am proud  to say  that  the City of Houston  is home  to  about 160,000 Vietnamese, who have maintained an active and vibrant community. In the  Southwest Houston Area at Bellaire Street,  there is an area the community refers to as  Vietnam Town, where you can find many of  the  Vietnamese  shops,  restaurants,  and  places of worship. In addition, the Vietnamese  community  in Houston has established  their  own  radio stations  including 900 AM Radio  Saigon Houston.  On April 30, 1975, the Republic of Vietnam  fell to the Communist forces of North Vietnam,  resulting  in a world  refuge crisis of historic  proportions,  and  yielding  approximately  3,000,000 refugees around the world and at  least 500,000 individuals who died at sea trying  to escape  from danger.

435,23,2005-05-03,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) and the gentleman from California (Mr. LANTOS)  each will control 20 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH).  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  H. Res. 233, Madam Speaker, as the  Clerk just pointed out, is a resolution  that recognizes the 60th anniversary of  victory in Europe during World War II.  This resolution, Madam Speaker, reiterates a simple but powerful message  that our Nation honors and deeply appreciates  the men and women who  served in the European Theatre during  World War II and that we especially remember  and  pay  tribute  to  those  Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.  Madam Speaker,  60 years ago, at  General Eisenhower’s headquarters in  Reims, France, a representative of the  German high command unconditionally surrendered all land, air, and sea  forces to the allies ending the war in  Europe.  General Eisenhower, in his order of  the day to the troops on May 8, 1945, V–  E Day, declared, and I quote him in  part: ‘‘The crusade on which we embarked  in early summer of 1944 has  reached its glorious conclusion. It is  my special privilege, in the name of all  nations represented in this theatre of  war, to commend each of you for the  valiant performance of duty. Though  these words are feeble,’’ General Eisenhower went on to say, ‘‘they come from  the bottom of a heart overflowing with  pride in our loyal service and admiration for you as warriors. Your accomplishments at sea, in the air and on the  ground, and in the field of supply, have  astonished the world. Even before the  final week of the conflict, you had put  5 million of the enemy permanently  out of the war. You have taken  in  stride military tasks so difficult as to  be classified by many doubters as impossible.  ‘‘You have confused and defeated and  destroyed your savagely fighting foe.  On the road to victory you have endured every discomfort and privation  and have surmounted every obstacle,  ingenuity and desperation could throw  in your path. Full victory in Europe  has been attained,’’ he concluded.  President Truman  in his radio address to the Nation that same day declared: ‘‘Much remains to be done. The  victory won in the West must now be  won in the East. The whole world must  be cleansed of the evil from which half  the world has been freed.  General Truman went on to say: ‘‘For  the  triumph of  spirit and of arms,  which we have won, and for the promise of the peoples everywhere to join us  in the love of freedom, it is fitting that  we as a Nation give thanks to Almighty God, who has strengthened us  and given us the victory.’’  He then went on to say that May 13,  1945, would be a day of prayer. And he  called upon the people of the United  States, whatever their faith, to unite,  offering joyful thanks to God for the  victory that we have won and to pray,  to quote him again: ‘‘That He will support us to the end of our present struggle and guide us  into  the way of  peace.’’  How fitting, Madam Speaker, that we  continue to commemorate a national  day of prayer this Thursday, May 5, as  we bring before God our thanks for the  many blessings He has bestowed upon  this great Nation and petition for help  in the ongoing challenges we face.  H. Res. 233, Madam Speaker, recognizes  the enormous  sacrifice of  the  young men and women who fought in  the European theatre. During World  War II, more than 4 million members of  the United States Armed Forces fought  in Europe. This is the largest military  force ever committed by the United  States in any theatre of operation.  And almost 200,000 American troops  were killed in the European theater. In  addition, H. Res. 233 recognizes the sacrifice of the millions of members of the  armed forces of allied nations in defeating Nazi Germany, liberating Europe, and putting to an end an unspeakable  crime  and  crimes  perpetrated by the Nazi regime.  H. Res. 233 was approved by the European Emerging Threats Subcommittee,  and I hope that every Member of the  House will  support  its passage  this  afternoon.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2005
436,23,2005-05-03,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I welcome this resolution marking  the 60th anniversary of the allied victory in Europe at the end of World War  II, which was introduced by the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee, the  gentleman  from  California  (Mr.  GALLEGLY).  I also want to thank our chairman,  my good friend, the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. HYDE),  for moving  it so  quickly through the committee and to  the consideration by this House.  In just a few days, Mr. Speaker, the  President will mark  this  important  historic anniversary by visiting Holland and Russia for special events commemorating  the end of  the Second  World War in Europe.  I remember well the events that we  are commemorating. I was a teenager  in Budapest, Hungary. And as a 16-  year-old, I witnessed the military occupation of Hungary by Nazi troops in  March 1944.  For part of that year, Mr. Speaker, I  was  in and out of Hungarian  labor  camps forced to repair a rail bridge on  the main railroad line between Budapest and Vienna, across one of the tributaries  of  the Danube River. We  cheered  as American  aircraft  from  bases in Italy bombed the bridge, although we knew that as soon as those  planes were gone we would be forced rebuild it.  But we cheered because we knew that  American participation in the war, and  the heroic deeds of the American military, would ultimately bring about the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:02 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H03MY5.REC H03MY5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005
437,30,2005-05-03,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 10 seconds. I want my friend, a  member of the Committee on the Judiciary, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  FEENEY) to understand it is not about  anything in the debate that took place  to which we were objecting. It is about  the entitlement of  the amendments  which were totally misconstrued.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. ZOE  LOFGREN), a member of the committee.  ",2005
438,30,2005-05-03,Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise to defend the integrity  of the House this evening. The established practice of the House regarding  committee reports is to accurately and  objectively  describe  the  proceedings  when a bill is considered in committee.  These reports are historical products  that are used to understand and determine the intent of a bill, opposition to  a bill, and to provide any additional information to understand the context of  a bill reported by committees of the  House.  In committee we argue and we disagree and we offer amendments and we  vote. We may vote and disagree in committee, but when the report is issued it  is supposed to be objective. This institution must uphold  this established  practice  of  describing  a  committee  mark-up in an accurate and objective  manner so that history is accurately  documented and reported for generations to come. Unfortunately, that is  not what happened last week when the  Committee on the Judiciary reported  H.R. 748 to the House floor with the  committee report, House Report 109–51.  Republicans  that  ruled  the Committee  on  the  Judiciary  mischaracterized  five  Democratic  amendments  in an extremely disparaging and distorting manner. When  alerted to the misleading and  inaccurate description of the amendment in  the committee report, they refused to  correct the mischaracterization.  Here  is something  I can say that  would be true about H.R. 748. The bill  could permit a father who raped his  daughter to profit in a lawsuit against  his minister. That is a true thing about  that bill. It is an argument against the  bill. But no one expects that argument  against the bill to substitute for the  name of the bill in the committee report.  In  prior  Congresses,  Democratic  amendments like these were described  in neutral terms. The vote last week  was about H.R. 748. The vote this week  is about arrogance and abuse of power  and ignoring the rules.  The Republicans changed the ethics  rules when they were afraid they might  not work for them at the beginning of  this Congress, and we are all watching  the other body looking about changing  the rules relative to filibuster because  it suits their purpose and now this.  We, including the chairman of the  committee, each have a duty to uphold  the  integrity of this  institution. We  must not play politics with the records  of history. The majority should live by  the rules and precedents of the House.  The House cannot function if the majority uses its raw power to corrupt the  record of the proceedings.  ",2005

441,30,2005-05-03,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr.  CONYERS) for yielding me time.  I see the logic of the majority. If  they were commenting on the Bill of  Rights, the  fourth amendment  is an  amendment designed to quash evidence  coming from an unlawful search and  seizure that could allow the conviction  of sexual predators. The fifth amendment gives sexual predators the right  to  protect  themselves  from  self-incrimination. The sixth amendment allows wily and cunning lawyers to use  cross examination and technical rules  to keep sexual predators from getting  convicted.  This is how the majority chooses to  interpret, in this particular case, the  substance and the intent of a series of  amendments made to the bill we voted  on last week.  I have great respect for the chairman  of the committee. He is a fair and honest man, and he has worked hard to defend the jurisdiction of the committee.  And what has been done here with this  majority report in that context is a  tremendous disappointment to me. It  essentially left us with no recourse but  to bring a motion like this to the floor  of the House.  To create the absurd situation and  then characterize the result of a particular amendment by that absurd situation does not do any justice or any  service to this process, to this institution, or to our committee.  We depend, we in the minority depend on a process that relies on honesty and good faith and the duties and  those  duties,  I  truly  believe, were  breached in the case of this report.  The minority has regarded to file its  dissenting views without the benefit of  having to have seen the report which  they are dissenting. That is inherently  an illogical system, but we have gone  along with it, but when something like  this happens,  it raises serious questions about the legitimacy of that particular process.  I think a great wrong has been done  to several Members of this body by virtue of the way the majority has characterized  this  amendment.  I  think  those characterizations should be withdrawn. I think an apology should be  made to them, and I urge the passage  of this motion.  ",2005

443,30,2005-05-03,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the chairman  for yielding me  time on this important issue.  The stated purpose of the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act is to  protect the health and safety of young  girls by allowing parental involvement  when their home States have thought  it appropriate to require such involvement.  As a general rule, no one has a young  girl’s best interest at heart more than  her parents. Where this rule is not the  case, the law allows for judicial bypass  of the parental  involvement requirements. Therefore, the amendments introduced by the Democrats in the Committee on the Judiciary are unnecessary. Moreover, these amendments are  dangerous.  As my distinguished Committee on  the  Judiciary  colleagues  have  explained, the health and safety of these  young girls is not protected by providing a blank exemption for those who  may have sexually abused them.

444,37,2005-05-03,Mr. BLUNT.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  join my colleague and good friend, our  conference chairman, the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. PRYCE), in recognizing  Kathryn Lehman as  she  leaves her  work here after 15 years.  We are dramatically benefited by the  people who help us do these jobs, and  no one has been more involved in more  places over those 15 years than Kathryn has, working, as has already been  said,  in the Speaker’s office,  in the  Conference office, in the whip’s office.  During the 4 years that I was the chief  deputy whip, it was never quite clear  to me whether Kathryn was working  for me or I was working for her, but I  always knew that we were all working  to get our job done.  She is leaving now to go to Holland.  We recently lost a great former Member of the Congress, our good friend  Tiller Fowler,  and Tillie would  be  pleased, I think, that Kathryn is filling  some of the gap that is left there by  Tillie’s passing.  I am sure that our conference chairman will miss Kathryn. I know that  our conference will miss Kathryn on a  daily basis. I really do deeply and truly  know that we will miss Kathryn’s wise  counsel, her good judgment and, maybe  most  of  all,  her  reliable  sense  of  humor. When things are the toughest  and the challenges are the greatest,  Kathryn always had an understanding  of how fortunate we all really were to  be  involved  in that challenging moment, to be making those decisions on  the House Floor, to be part of this  great process in the greatest country  in the world.  Kathryn, we will miss you.  f  IRAQ IS ANOTHER VIETNAM  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, as we acknowledge the 30th  anniversary of the conflict in Vietnam,  it is important to be reminded of the  crisis in Iraq: 12,000 wounded soldiers,  1,500 dead, 143 Iraqis and others killed  over this past weekend; no stated policy from this administration, and the  continuous flow of injured and fallen  soldiers coming home to loved ones.  Iraq  is another Vietnam.  Iraq deserves the attention of this Congress  and of this administration. It is time  now to address the fact that there were  no  weapons  of mass  destruction.  Whether or not we are liberators, no  one seems to care. This government is  in conflict. The Shiite government is  refusing to seek Sunnis. The insurgents  will continue, the bloodshed will continue, the hostages will continue.  We must, we must have a solution to  this terrible tragedy in Iraq. We are  not creating freedom; we are creating  terrorists.  REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR  AMERICA  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2005
445,37,2005-05-03,Mrs.  BLACKBURN.," Mr.  Speaker,  America is on a really great economic  track right now. Since 2000, Congress  and this great Nation both have had to  contend with a  recession, with  terrorism, but we have dealt with this by  enacting tax relief and working to decrease regulatory burdens on America’s  workers. What we are seeing is real  growth.  Now, the first quarter of this year we  have seen a 3.1 percent growth in the  GDP. It is good and solid. To put it all  in perspective, going back to October  and December of 2004, the fourth quarter of last year, look at what we had  going on here. Germany, 1.5 percent  growth, Italy and Japan both at eight-  tenths of one percent growth. During  that  time, America had  3.9 percent  GDP growth. Do we know why? It is because we have fought to lower taxes  and reduce burdensome regulation both  together, while  other  nations  have  kept raising their taxes and imposing  more regulation.  What does this show? It tells us that  if we want more of something, we tax  it less, we regulate it less.  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO KATHRYN  LEHMAN  (Mr. GOODLATTE asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2005
446,37,2005-05-03,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker, it is  my pleasure to join the House Republican Conference chairman, the whip,  and shortly the chief deputy whip and  the vice chairman of our conference in  congratulating Kathryn Lehman on an  outstanding career here  in the Congress and to wish her Godspeed as she  leaves this great institution and goes  out into the wide world to seek other  challenges and opportunities.  Kathryn has served the House of Representatives longer than the vast majority of the Members who serve here  today. She has an incisive legal mind,  and I came to know that many years  ago when I was first elected to serve  here and had the privilege of being appointed to serve on the House Committee on the Judiciary, where Kathryn was serving as a counsel for the  then senior member of the committee,  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HYDE)  and shortly thereafter became chairman of the committee.  Kathryn was the staff director and  chief counsel for the Subcommittee on  the Constitution. She advised the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman HYDE)  and  subsequently Speaker Gingrich,  with regard to the procedures that the  House needed to follow with regard to  the very somber process of impeachment of a President of  the United  States. Since then, she has gone on to  serve in our leadership. A number of  Members who we can see here today  recognize that she has not only the  great sense of humor that has been recognized already, but a great ability to  step back and see the big picture at a  time when many of us get tied up in  the heat of the moment. That is something that is a valuable, valuable asset  for this Congress and this Republican  Conference.  Kathryn, we thank you, and we wish  you the very best.  f  FAREWELL TO KATHRYN LEHMAN  (Mr. CANTOR asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2005
447,37,2005-05-03,Mr. CANTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I, too,  rise this evening to bid farewell to an  individual that I have come to know  over the last 4 years since I first started serving in this House. She is not  only a friend, she is a neighbor. She is  an individual that I look to as a colleague and counsel.  As has been mentioned before, Kathryn Lehman has been a critical asset to  this institution over the length of her  career here. She has worked for the  majority leader when he was majority  whip. That is where I came to know  her, and it is then that I began to see  the incredible addition she was to the  leadership team of this House.  She has provided tremendous insight  into not only the history of this institution, but also to the intricacies of  the legislative process, and her ability  to really grasp how to get things done  in  this  town, and certainly  in  this  building.  So  it  is with much  sentiment,  I  think, that I say goodbye. I know it  will not be a permanent goodbye. Kathryn is one who is a true believer, and I  could tell that when I first met her,  that she has the common sense and  conservative  values  that  are  really  what make this country great.  I guess we could claim her as an  adopted Virginian. She lives in the legacy of those great public servants of  the 18th century that founded this Nation and that left us such a legacy to  contribute to our democracy, to stand  up for the principles that we believe in.  So Kathryn, I want to thank you for  all of your wise counsel. I will continue  to seek that counsel. We will miss you  here in the House, but we wish you all  the best, and Godspeed.  f  KATHRYN LEHMAN: A BEHIND-  THE-SCENES PROFESSIONAL  (Mr. KINGSTON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

450,44,2005-05-03,Mr. WU.," Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise  to express my deepest concern about a  proposed Indian gambling casino in the  Columbia River Gorge National Scenic  Area in Oregon.  On April 6, 2005, Oregon Governor,  Ted Kulongoski and the Confederated  Tribes of the Warm Springs signed a  Tribal-State  compact. The  compact  would allow a off-reservation  Indian  gambling casino in the Columbia River  Gorge National Scenic Area. The Columbia River Gorge is the crown jewel  of Oregon’s many natural wonders, a  spectacular and unique sea-level cut  through the Cascade Mountain Range.  It is 80 miles long and up to 4,000 feet  deep. The Columbia River  flows between the Gorge’s north walls in Washington State and its south walls in Oregon. It is a natural wonder and a National Scenic Area.  The proposed 500,000 square foot gambling casino would dramatically alter  the Columbia River Gorge and have a  significant negative effect on the environment by increasing traffic, congestion, and air pollution. Specifically,  the proposed casino would draw an estimated 3 million visitors per year for  non-Gorge related reasons, resulting in  perhaps a million additional vehicle  trips per year. This increased traffic  would exacerbate existing air pollution  problems in the Columbia River Gorge.  State and Federal agencies have already determined that air quality in  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:02 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H03MY5.REC H03MY5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005
451,51,2005-05-03,Mr. WU.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman from California for his leadership in organizing this Special Order  tonight  and  for  his  leadership  in  chairing the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor  and pleasure that I join with my fellow  members of the Asian Pacific American Caucus in celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. This  month marks the 27th time America  has  recognized  and  celebrated  the  many contributions and achievements  of Asian Pacific Americans.  Our country was founded as a Nation  of immigrants. America has reached its  greatness in part by the accumulation  of ideas from those with varied heritage and backgrounds.  In particular,  Asian Pacific Americans have made  profound  contributions  to American  life,  including  the  arts,  education,  science, technology, politics, and athletics. Asian Pacific Americans were  here to help build the transcontinental  railroad, to serve in the Civil War, and  most recently to develop the latest in  Internet  technology.  Asian  Pacific  Americans have played an active and  crucial role in the development of this  country from knitting it together, as I  mentioned, with the transcontinental  railroad, to bringing us closer to the  rest of the world through the technologies of the Worldwide Web.  The Asian Pacific American community remains and always will be an integral and vibrant part of American society. As we take part in celebration of  Asian  Pacific  American  Heritage  Month, I urge everyone to participate  more deeply in the civic life of our Nation. Asian Pacific American civic participation and engagement will help  define our collective future. By working together, we can bridge and build  upon our great Nation’s diverse communities and move forward with determination and unity.  I encourage Congress and the American people to spend part of May absorbing  the  legacy,  culture,  and  achievements  of  the Asian Pacific  American community.  ",2005
452,51,2005-05-03,Mr. HONDA.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for his comments.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to touch on  a couple more subjects, if I may.  As Americans, we need to ensure that  our children  receive a quality education by providing adequate teacher  training, funds for after-school and extracurricular activities, and ensuring  that college is affordable for every student that desires to receive a higher  education.  According to the U.S. census, 50 percent of Asians age 25 or over have a  bachelor’s degree or higher  level of  education. However, I would  like to  emphasize that when we disaggregate  the data for AAPI subgroups, we find  that the ‘‘model minority’’ stereotype  is, in fact, a myth.  Only 9.1 percent of Cambodian Americans, 7.4 percent Hmong Americans,  7.6 percent Lao Americans, and 19.5  percent Vietnamese Americans and 16  percent of native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders who are 25 years and  older have a bachelor’s degree.  These numbers show that we must do  a better job of disaggregating data and  information about our communities to  assess the needs of those hard-working  Americans who still falter behind.  To address the disparities between  subgroups of the larger AAPI community, we need Congress to pass the  Asian American and Pacific Islander  Serving  Institutions bill, which  the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WU) will  be introducing later this month. This  legislation will provide Federal grants  to colleges and universities that have  an enrollment of undergraduate students that is at least 10 percent AAPI  and at least 50 percent of its degree-  seeking students receive financial assistance.  As a caucus, we will work to increase  the  availability  of  loan  assistance,  scholarships, and programs to allow  AAPI students to attend a higher education institution; to ensure full funding  for  teachers and bilingual education programs under the No Child  Left Behind Act; to support English  language learners; and to support full  funding of minority outreach programs  for access to higher education such as  the TRIO programs to expand services  to serve AAPI students.  In health, Mr. Speaker, a common  misperception of AAPIs is that as a  group we face fewer health problems  than other racial and ethnic groups. In  fact, AAPIs as a group and specific populations within this group do experience disparities in health and health  care. For example, AAPIs have  the  highest hepatitis B rates of any racial  group in the U.S.  Last week, I, along with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURPHY), introduced a resolution to support the goals and ideals of National  Hepatitis B Awareness Week.  AAPIs are also five times more likely  to develop cervical and  liver cancer  than any other ethnic and racial group.  According to the Census Bureau, 18  percent of AAPIs went without insurance for the entire year in 2000. This  means that the uninsured are not only  more likely to go without care for serious medical conditions; they are also  more likely to go without routine care,  less likely to have a regular source of  care,  less  likely to use preventative  services, and have fewer visits per year.  At the same time, without appropriate language translation services or  properly translated materials, limited  English-proficient  immigrants cannot  receive adequate care, as well as State  and Federal benefits  for which they  may be eligible. In the AAPI community, 76 percent of Hmong Americans,  61 percent of Vietnamese Americans, 52  percent of Korean Americans, and 39  percent  of  Tongans  speak  limited  English. Therefore, eliminating health  care disparities in the AAPI community must include data collection, linguistically appropriate and culturally  competent  services,  and  access  to  health insurance.  CAPAC has been working with both  the Congressional Hispanic and Black  Caucuses on the Healthcare Equality  and Accountability Act to eliminate  ethnic and racial health disparities for  all of our community. I will be introducing  the Healthcare Equality and  Accountability Act, which will address  expanding the health care safety net,  diversifying the health care workforce,  combating diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities, emphasizing prevention and behavioral health; and promoting the collection and dissemination of data and  enhance medical research, provide interpreters and translation services in  the delivery of health care.  Mr. Speaker, in California a Hmong  man was going to the hospital to have  his right  leg amputated  in surgery.  And the doctor, in order to confirm  whether he had the right leg pointed  out, spoke to the gentleman before surgery and asked him if this is the correct leg, and the gentleman did not understand. He  just nodded. When he  came to from anesthesia after the surgery, he found that his good leg was  amputated. And because of  lack of  translations and lack of linguistic services, this man became more disabled  than he should have been.  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. INSLEE),  a great friend and advocate.  ",2005
453,51,2005-05-03,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed listening to this story of the tapestry of the Asian American Pacific Islander  community  in America; and  that tapestry, of course, consists of  quite a number of threads. I would like  to add one thread to this great story of  this important part of the American  tapestry.  And that story began on March 30,  1942, on Bainbridge Island, Washington,  actually the island where I live. On  that day, a young 21⁄2-year-old named  Frank became one of the first Americans of Japanese descent to be rounded  up by our military and forced to leave  his home. We have a picture here. Actually, it is a pretty historic picture.  These were the first Japanese Americans to be interned during World War  II. They left the dock on Bainbridge Island en masse,  surrounded back up  here, though we do not see them in the  picture, of soldiers with bayonets; and  they were marched down into a boat  and taken to Seattle and eventually to  Manzanar.  b2145  Obviously, at that time, after the  Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, our  Nation was really living under a cloud  of uncertainty when, along with Frank,  226 other men and women, families left  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:02 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H03MY5.REC H03MY5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005
454,58,2005-05-03,Mr. CONAWAY.,"  I  appreciate  and  thank  the  gentleman  from Georgia  (Mr. GINGREY) for coming over tonight  and spending his time with us to point  out to us, Mr. Speaker, that some of  the great things that we have, in fact,  accomplished during this first 100 days,  as I mentioned, if it is a fact, it is not  over-reaching, it is not puffing, it is  not exaggerating. And these are facts  that we lay on the record, facts that  most often have wide Democratic support for the initiatives that have been  brought  forward  on  the Republican  side.  For that I am thankful for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  who have looked at the issues, looked  at what is best for America, looked at  the solutions that are being presented  and voted their conscience as opposed  to being obstructionist or just simply  taking the party line on issues that are  of importance to our great country.  b2215  Mr. Speaker, I have also been joined  tonight by another colleague, the gentleman  from Georgia  (Mr. KINGSTON)  and I yield to the gentleman.  ",2005
455,58,2005-05-03,Mr.  KINGSTON.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  CONAWAY) and I would like to make a  few remarks on Social Security. Before  doing so I wanted to thank the gentleman  from Georgia  (Mr. GINGREY),  the doctor, I should say, for the good  work he is doing on health care reform,  making health care more affordable  and accessible to the American people  and working through the private sector  rather than going through a Canadian  or English style of government-sponsored health care. We do have a great  health care system but also one that  needs improvement.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Members of Congress who are working on  immigration reform. We have 8 million  illegal aliens in the United States of  America. That is about the size of the  State of Georgia which is about 8 million people. A big issue.  I am very pleased that the gentleman  from Wisconsin’s (Mr. SENSENBRENNER)  language will be in the supplemental  appropriations bill which we will vote  on on Thursday. It is a major victory  for those of us who are pushing for immigration reform.  Mr. Speaker, I will speak on Social  Security reform as well. The last time  Social Security was taken up by this  Congress was in 1983. At that time, the  Members  of Congress  thought  that  they had fixed Social Security for another 75 years, but unfortunately that  is not the case.  In less than a decade, Social Security  will begin to spend out more money  than it brings in. Insolvency is not the  only issue, although it is a major one.  We know that in the year 2018, when  the baby boomers start to retire, more  money will go out than is coming in.  And we know by 2041, if we do not cut  benefits by 27 percent, Social Security  will be bankrupt. The math is simple  to follow.  In 1937, when Social Security was  started, we had 60 workers for every  one retiree. And by 1950,  it was 16  workers to every retiree, and today it  is 3.3 to 1. And during that period-of-  time life span, life expectancy has increased. In 1937 folks lived to be 59 year  old. Today they live to be 77 years old.  The math is even easy for a Democrat  to follow, Mr. Speaker. You can see  why we are having solvency problems.  There is also an issue of generational  fairness. As my friends know, if you retired in the year 1980, you got all your  money out of Social Security in 12.8  years. But if you retire in 2003, it will  take you 17 years to get your money  out. Most Americans do not mind.  They do not need to have every dime  accounted for, every penny accounted  for, but generally people expect to get  at least the money they put into the  system out of it. But that is not going  to be the case for today’s 20- and 30-  year-olds who, in addition to having to  live longer, past the retirement to get  their money back, they are also going  to have this great benefit cut. So we  have a great challenge. And to the Republican party, the choice is simple.  We need to do it together. We need  Democrats and Republicans to come to  the House Chamber with the best of  their ideas, put them on the table and  let us cobble out something that does  not focus on the next election, but on  the next generation. Something that is  fair at the kitchen table where mom  and dad and the kids and the grandparents can sit down and agree on it.  Because if we can get the agreement  square on the kitchen table, it will not  be any problem to get it passed in the  House Chamber.  Last week under the gentleman from  Texas’  (Mr. CONAWAY)  leadership  a  number  of House Republicans  and  Democrats sat down together with Bill  Novelli, the chairman and CEO of the  AARP which is the largest older Americans advocacy group  in the United  States of America. We sat down, Democrats and Republicans, together with  the AARP, to talk about core principles, talk about what could be a solution and what could not. And we knew  at the time we were not going to walk  out of the room with hands held and all  kinds of bipartisan unity. We knew  that this was just the first step.  I have got to say that I have a lot of  appreciation  for those Members who  showed up from the Democrat side. But  unfortunately,  the Democrat  leader,  the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  PELOSI) decided that this meeting for  some reason was off limits, for some  reason it is a bad thing for Democrats  to sit down with Republicans. And yet  publicly she calls  for bipartisanship,  but here in the House Chamber when  the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  CONAWAY) tried to get this meeting together, of the five original Members  only  two actually came. The other  three were  intimidated by Democrat  leadership. Do not come because we  can talk publicly about bipartisanship  but behind lines, behind the scene we  really do not want this.  It is further revealed this week, the  gentlewoman  from  California  (Ms.  PELOSI), the Democrat leader was on  the ABC  ‘‘This Week’’  show with  George Stephanopoulus, actually one  of her fellow Democrats, a former Clinton advisor. And yet in this role he was  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:02 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H03MY5.REC H03MY5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005
456,65,2005-05-03,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Mr. Speaker, we all know someone who is living without health insurance. The perception is  that the uninsured don’t work. Over 80 percent  of the uninsured have jobs. Most work in retail  and service  industries, but many are small  business owners and employees. They are the  individuals who care  for our children, check  our groceries, or  run  the  local pharmacy.  Americans who work hard for a living, should  have health insurance.  Often times, the uninsured ignore their medical problems and delaying doctors visits. Children go without vaccines because visiting the  doctor is just too expensive. They are gambling that they won’t get seriously ill. But those  who lose face staggering medical bills. Millions  of dollars and many lives can be saved with  timely medical attention.  Almost one quarter of Texans are uninsured. This is the highest rate of uninsured in  the United States. In Dallas, 25 percent of the  population is uninsured.  Despite the number of Texans who are uninsured, medical assistance programs  continue to be cut. In 2003, the Texas Health and  Human Services Commission  implemented  budget cuts to the Children’s Health Insurance  Program. CHIP was designed to help families  who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but  not enough  to afford private medical  insurance. These budget cuts made it more difficult  for families to qualify for CHIP. It also imposed  higher premiums and co-payments.  In addition, there is now a 90 day waiting period before coverage begins. There is no longer any  coverage  for dental care, vision, or mental  health. And families are now required to reapply for CHIP every 6 months.  Since the budget cuts, over 175 thousand  children have been dropped from CHIP. Less  than half of those children were able to find  another form of medical insurance.  For weeks now this Congress has dealt with  legislation that harms some of our most vulnerable citizens. Many of whom are dealing  with serious medical difficulties.  Staggering medical bills and considerable  debt is a problem for many uninsured Americans. Many of these individuals are forced to  file bankruptcy. Last month the House passed  the  Bankruptcy  Reform  Bill. With  these  changes,  those with moderate or higher  incomes are now required to pay back most, if  not all, of their debt.  For example, under these reforms an uninsured  family who has a child  to cancer will  now be saddled with those medical bills indefinitely.  Mr. Speaker,  last month  the House also  passed the Energy Bill. This was NOT a positive bill for Americans whose health depends  on clean air and clean water.  Under  the Clean Air Act, areas  that have  unhealthy air were required to reduce ozone-  forming pollution by strict deadlines. The Energy Bill extends these deadlines allowing polluters more  time  to continue polluting. This  means more asthma attacks, hospital visits,  and premature deaths for residents in highly  polluted areas.  Today, 45 million American are uninsured.  Even those families that do have health insurance today, fear they may not have coverage  tomorrow. The truth is that no American family  is more than one job change, one corporate  cost cut, or one serious  illness or accident  away from being uninsured.  This country faces an uphill battle in solving  this health crisis. Now is the time for this Congress to address this problem with innovative  ideas and actions.  f  b2320  PEAK OIL  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  DENT). Under the Speaker’s announced  policy of January  4,  2005,  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BARTLETT)  is recognized until midnight.  ",2005
457,65,2005-05-03,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," Mr.  Speaker, several weeks ago I read a  treatise written by Matt Savinar, and I  was galvanized by his introduction. Let  me read it.  ‘‘Dear reader,’’ he begins, ‘‘civilization as we know it is coming to an end  soon. This is not the whacky proclamation of a doomsday cult, apocalypse  Bible prophesy sect, or conspiracy theory society. Rather, it is the scientific  conclusion of the best-paid, most widely respected geologists, physicists, and  investment bankers in the world. These  are rational, professional, conservative  individuals who are absolutely terrified  by a phenomenon known as global peak  oil.’’  Mr. Speaker,  in the weeks since I  read this, I have checked with a large  number of experts in this area across  the country and  indeed around  the  world. He could be right. He will be  right unless we appropriately address  this  big  challenge which  faces  the  world and particularly faces the United  States, and that is what we will be  talking about in our Special Order this  evening.  I have been joined by the gentleman  from the eastern shore of Maryland  (Mr. GILCHREST), one of my colleagues  who shares a concern in this area of energy, and I yield to the gentleman.  ",2005
458,65,2005-05-03,Mr. GILCHREST.," Mr. Speaker, I am  only going to speak for just a couple of  minutes because the gentleman from  Maryland  (Mr. BARTLETT) has a  fascinating story to tell, one that richly  deserves everybody’s attention.  But, just briefly, I want to thank the  gentleman for yielding to me.  The gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  BARTLETT) will talk about energy, peak  oil. As  the demand  increases  enormously, the supply of the fossil fuel  that we are using continues to decrease. We know that energy is power,  and energy is what drives the Nation’s  economy. And we have assumed for a  long time, for decades anyway, that energy supplies have a bottomless well.  And that is correct. The energy source  at the bottom of the well is bottomless.  It is endless. But what is at the bottom  of that well is not oil. It is not even  natural gas. It is not coal. What lies at  the bottom of the bottomless well is  our intellect, our logic, our knowledge,  our know-how.  We used to the light our homes with  whale oil. They did not stop lighting  homes because we ran out of whales,  thank goodness; but we transitioned to  a number of other things. We used to  use just wood all over the world, and  thank goodness we transitioned from  wood to coal because we were tearing  our forests down, and there are a lot  better uses for wood than to burn that  wood.  We  transitioned  for our  transportation needs and many other needs  from coal to oil, and oil is a lot cleaner  and it is a lot more efficient. Then we  went from oil and we found that natural gas is cleaner yet and more efficient than oil. We also began to realize  that  coal has more hydrogen  than  wood. Oil has more hydrogen in its content than coal. Natural gas has more  hydrogen  than  oil.  The  transition  through our energy sources has not  come about because we ran out of those  energy sources. It has come about because we got a little smarter. Our intellect, our quest for knowledge, our  curiosity about something that is better overtook the status quo.  And when the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BARTLETT) talks about peak  oil, not only do we need to move away  from the status quo when we hear his  words about fossil fuel; it is essential.  There is a sense of urgency to move  away. In all our measurements of oil or  natural gas, whenever one looks at a  heater  in their home, whether  it  is  their oil furnace, a Carison heater or  whatever it is, it is measured in Btus.  I want to show a number. This is a 1  with 15 zeros. That is 1 quadrillion. In  1910 we used 7 quadrillion Btus in the  United States. In 1954 we used 35 quadrillion Btus, energy demand increase.  Right now we use 100 quadrillion Btus,  and that is not slowing down.  What we need in this country is logic  and intellect to move us away from an  energy source that has now lost its usefulness for a number of reasons. It is  putting carbon dioxide into our atmosphere faster than we have seen that infusion of carbon dioxide  in the  last  400,000 years, and our supply is diminishing quickly as our demand  is  increasing even faster.  There  are  a  number  of  energy  sources. The gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. BARTLETT) will talk about some of  them. We will have these on a number  of occasions. We are  looking at nuclear. We are looking at solar. We are  looking at wind. We are looking at hydrogen. We are looking at a number of  alternatives. But before we have the  technology to move into those alternatives  for  energy  security, which  means energy independence, the transition has got to be vastly improved efficiency for oil, for natural gas, to move  into biofuels, and I am not talking  about ethanol, which is corn which will  feed the world. I am not talking about  biodiesel, which is soy beans, which is  used to feed the world. What I am talking about are other sources like certain  grass or poplar trees, which farmers  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:02 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H03MY5.REC H03MY5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005
459,142,2005-05-03,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  honor the contributions made by Asian Pacific  Americans. May  is Asian Pacific American  Heritage Month and a time when every American should acknowledge the important role of  Asian Pacific Americans in building our great  nation.  The 7th Congressional District  in Washington State, which  I represent,  is home  to  more than 78,000 Asian Americans, the largest minority group  in  the district comprising  over 13% of the population. Today, Seattle is  home to a rich and ethnically diverse cultural  weave of Japanese, Asian  Indian, Korean,  Chinese,  Filipino,  Cambodian,  Laotian,  Hmong, Vietnamese, Pacific  Islanders and  other Asian Americans.  The 1880 U.S. Census records the first resident of Japanese descent  in  the state of  Washington. Over the next 150 years, Asian  Americans contributed to our state and nation  in many ways. In 1963, Wing Luke became  the first Chinese American elected to the Seattle City Council, and  today a museum  is  named  in his honor. There were other  triumphs: Ruby Chow was  the  first Chinese  American woman elected  locally and Gary  Locke was the first Chinese American elected  Governor. Many Asian Americans serve today  in  the Washington State Legislature, other  local elected offices, key  leadership roles  in  civic organizations, business and industry.  Asian American role models come from all  walks of  life. Like other ethnic populations,  Asian Americans had  to persevere against  prejudice,  racial  injustice and discrimination.  When  they  immigrated,  they worked  in  the  mines and Alaskan canneries, logged the forests, were the first non-Native fishermen, and  farmed the land. Up until World War II, Japanese Americans supplied nearly three-quarters  of western Washington’s fruits and vegetables.  The war marked a turning point. Internment  camps,  including one near Seattle, were a  stain on America’s conscience and it took four  decades before we acknowledged  the mistake, and the suffering inflicted on thousands  of innocent Asian Americans. We learned a lot  during World War II, about the courage and  patriotism of Asian Americans, and about our  own shortcomings in letting fear overtake reason at a time of world conflict. In a small but  important way, naming a federal courthouse in  Seattle after William Nakamura, a Japanese  American Medal of Honor winner, was a statement about America being stronger because  of Asian Americans.  In Seattle, we proudly celebrate Asian Pacific American culture and heritage, from the  Vietnamese Tet  in Seattle Lunar New Year  celebration to other local cultural festivals. We  also honor Asian Pacific Americans by preserving  the ethnic heritage of our citizens.  Places like the Wing Luke Asian Museum, the  Seattle Asian Art Museum, the Filipino American National Historical Society, and Densho:  The Japanese American Legacy Project keep  us in touch with the roots of our neighbors.  These wonderful resources proudly recall the  past and proudly inspire the future.  By celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, we honor the spirit of America as  a nation of immigrants. By honoring Asian Pacific Americans, we honor Americans  from  every ethnic background. This celebration reminds us that America is a melting pot where  we retain our ethnic heritage even as we assimilate  the American experience.  It  is what  makes America  strong.  It  is what makes  America  the destination  for people willing  to  risk their lives floating in rafts in the ocean to  reach this great land. Celebrate Asian Pacific  American Heritage Month.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE GREAT  EDUCATOR, HUMANITARIAN, AND  CIVIL  RIGHTS  ACTIVIST,  DR.  KENNETH B. CLARK  HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2005  ",2005
460,142,2005-05-03,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor an outstanding American whose tireless  work helped end segregation, raised the educational expectations of generations of New  Yorkers, and advanced the idea of a truly integrated society. My dear friend, Dr. Kenneth B.  Clark died on May 1, 2005 and he will be  missed by all who knew him. I extend my condolences to his family and I know I am joined  by  thousands of New Yorkers, as well as  those  throughout  the Nation, who benefited  from his work to end the injustice of legally imposed racial segregation and to create a society where all could have an equal opportunity  to succeed.  Kenneth B. Clark was a brilliant scholar and  teacher who influenced a generation of social  scientists by his work and his example as a  teacher at the City College of New York. He  was also, and at heart perhaps he was even  moreso, an activist who sought to bring about  the social change required to attain equality of  opportunity for African-Americans in our society. He inspired the vision of Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr. and  those who  led  the great Civil  Rights Movement  toward a society  in which  people would be judged, as Dr. King put it ‘‘by  the content of their character and not the color  of their skin.’’  Dr. Clark was committed to the achievement  of an integrated society in America that would  remove  the barriers  to  full participation by  blacks, but would also make whites more  aware of the benefits to be derived from participation by all based upon talent.  Dr. Clark had an impressive career of working for civil rights and education. His research  in  the 1950s established  the  inherent problems of segregated system and alerted  the  Supreme Court and the Nation to the negative  effects of  segregation on African-American  youth. As a member of the New York State  Board of Regents for twenty years, he continually advised elected officials on ways  to  transform and improve their school systems.  He was a passionate advocate  for children  and did not spare those who failed them.  Dr. Clark was an exemplary American who  worked  to  improve  the  life of all persons  in  America. I knew him as an exceptional individual and a trusted friend. The attached obituary from the New York Times (May 2, 2005)  highlights the life story and accomplishments  of Dr. Clark.  KENNETHCLARK, WHOHELPEDEND  SEGREGATION, DIES  NEWYORK, NY—Kenneth B.

His passing marks a great  loss for his family and friends, and also for the  people  of  Slavic  Village  and  Newburgh  Heights.  Throughout his entire life, Mr. Priebe’s caring heart and concern  for others  reflected  along Fleet Avenue. He was born  in Cleveland, grew up in Newburgh Heights, and graduated  from St. Stanislaus High School. Although he was of Polish heritage, Mr. Priebe  became  an  honorary  son  of Cleveland’s  Czech community. His forty year involvement  with  the heart and soul of Fleet Avenue,  Ceska Sin Karlin Hall, served to uplift every  aspect of  this significant cultural organization—an organization that bridges modern life  and antiquity, and connects  the people of  America to their traditions and customs of their  Eastern European origins.  Mr. Priebe maintained an unwavering focus  on family, community and country. During the  Korean War, he served with honor and courage as an  infantryman  in  the United States  Army. Following his discharge, he remained  an active member of the VFW From the military to his professional career, Mr. Priebe reflected an unwavering  level of  integrity and  diligence. He worked as an auditor with the  state’s auditor’s office, until he retired 10 years  ago. Throughout his retirement, he remained  an active and vital part of our community. At  Karlin Hall, Mr. Priebe took on any task that  needed  tackling,  including  bartender,  floor  sweeper, and President.  Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me  in honor and  remembrance of Mr. Norbert  ‘Whitey’ Priebe. His caring nature, quick wit,  and concern  for others,  framed his  life and  served to light the lives of countless individuals and families along Fleet Avenue and beyond.

The legacy of his life, lived with joy  and energy, will live forever within the hearts  of all who knew and loved him well.  f  HONORING THE MEMORY OF  CORKY GONZALES  HON. MARK UDALL  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2005  ",2005
462,149,2005-05-03,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to Rodolfo  ‘‘Corky’’  Gonzales, one of Colorado’s most  influential  civil rights leaders who passed away on April  12, 2005. While I did not have the pleasure of  getting to know this remarkable man in person, it is impossible not to know of his extraordinary political career in Denver, Colorado.  Raised during the Great Depression, Corky  Gonzales rose from poverty to become one of  the  founding  leaders of  the Chicano Civil  Rights Movement in the 1960s and in doing so  he gave voice to the aspirations of millions of  people, particularly in the Latino communities  of the southwestern United States.  Corky Gonzales first rose to prominence as  champion boxer during  the  late 1940’s and  early 1950’s. His  fearlessness  in  the  ring  served him well when he decided to use his  voice and not his fists to champion the cause  of equality.  Growing up poor  in Denver shaped his  sense of  justice—and  instilled a very deep  commitment to improve the lives of so many  in the so-called ‘‘Mexican-American’’ community of the times, and he was one of the first  of his generation to call public attention to the  civil rights struggle of Latino people after decades of indifference, benign neglect and outright discrimination.  Gonzales also was an accomplished poet  and lover of art and literature often extolling  the virtues of education and urging his  followers to use their minds as a means of fighting  injustice. Anita, his oldest daughter, has  said  that  the  standard bill of  fare  in  the  Gonzales household was not the latest fad or  fashion, but discussions on art, literature, politics and philosophy. In this regard, Corky was  a  true  ‘‘Renaissance man’’—although  I suspect he would flinch at that description.  In 1965 he founded the ‘‘Crusade for Justice’’ which became a Mecca for likeminded individuals committed  to  the cause of  justice  and equality for those on the margins of society. While the nation’s television news covered  the marches  in Selma and  the civil  rights  struggle of African-Americans  throughout  the  South, young Corky was  raising a similar  voice for equality in the West.  In 1967 he wrote a celebrated epic poem ‘‘I  am Joaquin’’ which many describe as  the  greatest poem  to come out of  the Chicano  Civil Rights Movement. The poem, an odyssey  of self discovery and affirmation of ethnic pride  quickly became a blueprint  for social action  and a clarion call to an entire generation of  Americans young and old alike.  He was not without his detractors, but anyone who attempts to achieve anything of lasting importance seldom is, and for people of  my generation, he was a much needed voice  for change. To his followers and to those who  loved and respected him he was ‘‘the hurricane that rose from the barrios of Denver to  lift his people into the 21st century.’’  This fearless warrior left an indelible imprint  on our society and future generations of leaders. But for his early journey, paving the way  for others, Colorado might never have witnessed Federico Pena as Mayor of Denver or  Ken Salazar as a United States Senator.  Corky launched the idea of Chicano Pride long  before it became fashionable to celebrate Hispanic identity.  Had he been born a few decades later perhaps, the young boxer might have exchanged  his gloves  for a seat  in  this House, but his  contributions to our country and to the communities of color that are so deeply a part of  the mosaic of the Southwestern United States  remain a testament to his memory.  In the Chicano and Mexican-American communities in my part of the country there is a  deep sense of pride in being called to service.  Corky Gonzales was like all great heroes, a  human being who contributed to the great tradition of being involved in something greater  than his own self-interest. In that great tradition it is my pleasure to declare . ‘‘Corky’’ Gonzales, Presente!  . . Rodolfo  f  IN SUPPORT OF A BILL FOR THE  FURTHER STUDY OF DYSTONIA  HON. DANNY K. DAVIS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2005  ",2005
463,149,2005-05-03,Mr. DAVIS of  Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of a bill I introduced expressing  the need  for  further study of  the neurological disorder dystonia. Dystonia is characterized  by  powerful  and  painful muscle  spasms that cause the body to pull into distorted postures. It is the third most common  movement disorder after Parkinson’s disease  and Tremor. Dystonia affects more people  than better known and more  thoroughly  researched diseases such as Huntington’s disease, muscular dystrophy and Lou Gehrig’s  disease. Three hundred thousand Americans  suffer  from dystonia, and  it affects all ages,  genders and ethnic backgrounds.  Currently  there  is no  cure  for dystonia,  which means only the symptoms can be treated. Led by  the National  Institutes of Health  which recently announced a program entitled  ‘‘Studies into the Causes and Mechanisms of  Dystonia’’, I ask that Congress act to support  increased funding and research for this debilitating disease.  To personalize the importance of research  pertaining to dystonia, let me tell a short story  about Art Kessler, a man from the 7th District  of Illinois, who was diagnosed at age 12 with  early-onset dystonia. He and his wife, Wendy,  decided to remain childless to prevent another  life from being burdened with dystonia. However, due  to  recent  technological advances  and  a  ground  breaking  procedure  called  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), Mr.  Kessler and his wife are the proud parents of  a dystonia-free child. Benjamin is the first child  ever to be born using PGD.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to bring increased public awareness about  dystonia and to encourage future research into  the causes and possible cures. The efforts put  forth by agencies such as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and  the National Institute on Deafness and Other  Communication Disorders have been very valuable, but more needs  to be done. Let us  strive to make success stories like that of Mr.  Kessler everyday occurrences. This  is  the  path we hope to take by supporting and eventually passing this resolution.  f  HONORING  THE  TOWN  OF  SUMMERDALE,  ALABAMA,  ON  THE OCCASION OF ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.

468,8,2005-05-13,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, during  World War I and II, Native Americans  heard the call of their Country and enlisted  in  the United States Armed  Services  in unprecedented numbers.  Many of these brave men performed the  role of code talkers, using a code language derived from a variety of American Indian languages to ensure secure  and rapid communication of information on the battlefield. Through three  wars and  five decades, enemy  forces  were never able to break the United  States code  language thanks to the  service and ingenuity of Native American Code Talkers. These patriots provided  an  invaluable  service  to  the  United States and our allies and deserve recognition for their bravery.  Until 1968, information related to the  code  talker’s activities during both  World Wars remained classified by the  Department of Defense. The postponement in learning about the essential  role of Native American Code Talkers  has resulted in delayed recognition of  these war heroes. The first step in recognizing these men came in 2000 when  President Bush signed into law legislation authorizing Congress  to award  gold medals to the twenty-nine Navajo  Code Talkers as well as a silver medal  to each man who later qualified as a  Navajo Code Talker. While this legislation was a step in the right direction,  it failed to recognize a number of Native Americans who also served as code  talkers but were not members of the  Navajo Nation.  During the first World War, Choctaw  code talkers served with distinction in  France. By transmitting in their native tongue a variety of open voice  messages relating to unit movements,  United States  forces completely surprised the enemy during battle. Following the success of the Choctaw code  talkers,  soldiers  from  the Navajo,  Sioux, Comanche and Meskwaki tribes,  along with members of 14 other tribes,  served as code talkers in some of the  most dangerous operations in both theaters of World War II.  Today I introduce the Code Talkers  Recognition Act to honor those who  were  overlooked when medals were  awarded to the Navajo Code Talkers in  2001. This bill authorizes the presentation of commemorative medals on  behalf of Congress to Native Americans  who served as Code Talkers during any  foreign conflict  in which the United  States was  involved during the 20th  Century. I ask my colleagues to help  honor the heroic contributions of these  gentlemen by cosponsoring this bill.  f  AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO  MEET  COMMITTEEONARMEDSERVICES  ",2005

470,15,2005-05-13,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to the  Academy of Lifelong Learning on  their 25th  Anniversary. This continuing education program at  the University of Delaware allows  people over 50 to continue to pursue a wide  variety of academic offerings. Recent classes  have  included Sports History, Yoga Philosophy, and Computer Management. For 25  years, the Academy’s membership has been  involved in every facet of the educational process. Members also plan, organize, and even  teach many of these courses.  To mark its 25th anniversary, the Academy  has planned the Hi Ho Silver Jubilee at the  University of Delaware. The event will be highlighted by a performance of  the 50-piece  Academy Band and the 75-member Academy  Chorus. From its original 83 members and 18  courses,  the Academy has grown  to over  2,000 members who can choose  from over  200 courses. This remarkable growth can be  directly attributed to the dedication and hard  work of the Academy’s original membership.  As stated in the 1998 mission statement of  the council, the Academy of Lifelong Learning  seeks to, ‘‘be a premier educational program  composed of a diverse membership of people  50 and older who come together and are intellectually, culturally, and socially stimulated in  an academic atmosphere. Through  its programs, the Academy enhances, enriches, and  extends  the quality of  life of  its members.’’  After 25 years of outstanding work, the Academy of Lifelong Learning continues to achieve  its goal.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the  Academy and look forward to celebrating their  future accomplishments.  PRESIDENT’S COMMENTS ON  YALTA—AMNESIA OR DISTORTION?  HON. MARK UDALL  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 12, 2005  ",2005
471,15,2005-05-13,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, these  days of early May mark the 60th anniversary  of the defeat of Nazi Germany.  Last week, as we observed the days of remembrance for those who perished in the Holocaust, I noted that we need to remember history because looking back can help us to understand the world around us and to interpret  events that may lie ahead.  This  is  important  for our country and  the  world because our fate, and the fate of humanity, depends on our remembering and our  understanding.  President Bush has been in Europe to mark  the victory over Hitler. I am glad that he went,  and I especially applaud him for visiting Latvia  and Georgia. This was the right thing to do to  demonstrate  that America has not  forgotten  that  the end of  the war  in Europe did not  mean  the end of oppression  for millions of  people who found themselves behind the Iron  Curtain.  But learning from history depends on getting  history right. And that’s why I share the concerns of the Rocky Mountain News about part  of the president’s comments.  Speaking in Riga, Latvia, the president correctly noted  that  ‘‘For much of Eastern and  Central Europe, victory brought the iron rule of  another empire. V-E Day marked the end of  fascism, but it did not end oppression.’’ That  was accurate, well put, and needed to be said.  However, regrettably, the president went on  to say ‘‘The agreement at Yalta followed in the  unjust tradition of Munich and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Once again, when powerful governments negotiated, the freedom of small nations was  somehow expendable’’—a  statement  that at best  is erroneous and  that at  worse reflects an intentional distortion of history.  As an editorial  in  today’s Rocky Mountain  News notes, ‘‘Yalta did not leave the continent  divided. The continent was already divided because Soviet armies were encamped in much  of Eastern Europe and were not about  to  budge.’’ In other words, the division of Europe  was a fact before the Yalta conference began.  That  is  reality. But  to  somehow equate  Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill  with Molotov and Ribbentrop is something else  entirely—either the product of a ‘‘delusion,’’ as  the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. has suggested, or the revival of an intentional distortion that once was a political weapon for opponents  of  some  of  the  president’s  predecessors.  As the historian David Greenberg, writing in  Slate has noted,  ‘‘Along with  the myth of  FDR’s treachery in leading America into war,  the  ‘stab  in  the back’  interpretation of Yalta  became a cudgel with which the old right and  their McCarthyite heirs  tried  to discredit a  president they had long despised. Renouncing  Yalta even became a plank in the 1952 Republican platform, although Eisenhower did  not support it. In time, however, these hoary  myths  receded  into  the shadows, dimly  remembered except as a historical curiosity,  where, alas, they should have remained undisturbed.’’  VerDate Aug 04 2004  01:54 May 14, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A12MY8.050 E13PT1 ",2005
472,22,2005-05-13,Mr.  ISRAEL.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to honor  the leadership and service of Rabbi Leonard  Troupp, who is retiring after 18 years as the  spiritual  leader  of Temple Beth David  in  Commack, New York.  All of us in Congress rely on many religious  leaders in our communities for guidance and  inspiration. But Rabbi Troupp transcends that  role. For me, he has been and will continue to  be a dear friend. I have turned to him as a  Member of Congress, and  I have  turned  to  him as a member of his congregation. I have  solicited his advice on the profound public policy challenges that confront our government,  and I have listened to his words on the personal decisions and choices we make every  day in our private lives.  Rabbi Leonard B. Troupp was ordained by  the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of  Religion in 1973. He is a Past President of the  Long  Island Association of Reform Rabbis,  and has also served on the Board of the New  York Association of Reform Rabbis.  Rabbi Troupp’s many passions have forever  enriched the lives of his congregants and others. As a result of his motivation, Temple Beth  David collects over 15,000 pounds of food for  the hungry each year. Through his impossible  dream, 1997 saw the reunion of a Holocaust  Torah with a survivor, Petr Herrmann, whose  father read from that very same Torah scroll.  Rabbi Troupp has been an outspoken and  passionate advocate for human rights and civil  rights; for a strong Israel; for a fair and just  America. He mobilized his congregation in a  letter writing campaign to decry the rising Anti-  Semitism in Europe. Through his hard work,  he and his wife, Michelle, eventually hand-delivered thousands of letters to a Presidential  Representative in the West Wing.  His sermons, candid and sometimes controversial, have been spoken  from his heart  and have  touched  the hearts of  those who  have heard his words.  Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Troupp dedicated his  career to making our community stronger, better and fairer for people of all faiths and backgrounds. He is not simply my Rabbi; he is a  teacher  to a  joyously diverse community  in  New York’s Second Congressional District. His  teachings, his strength and his commitment  will continue to guide my constituents and me.  In that sense, he has made an indelible imprint on the fabric of Long Island, New York,  and our nation.  HONORING VFW 5119  HON.

473,22,2005-05-13,Mr. FERGUSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5119 in Glen Gardner, New  Jersey. Members of VFW Post 5119, which includes Hunterdon and Warren counties, are  traveling to Washington this week to view the  memorials along the National Mall, throughout  the capital and  in Virginia  that represent so  much of our nation’s history.  These memorials are at once simple and  compelling, powerful enough that in an instant  an old man  is  transported back decades  to  when he was young and walked on the field  of battle. The memorials are our own living reminder that generations of Americans fought,  struggled and died to defend our Nation and  its enduring principles of freedom and liberty.  The Vietnam Veterans Memorial along the  National Mall is the most visited of all landmarks in Washington. The Marine Corps Memorial, also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial,  honors Marines who have given their lives in  defense of our country since 1775. Along  Pennsylvania Avenue, between  this Capitol  and the White House, the Navy Memorial at  the plaza honors  the men and women who  served in the Navy. The Korean War Memorial  opened only 10 years ago, and the National  World War II Memorial opened only last year.  Across the Potomac River in Virginia, Arlington National Cemetery houses the most of sacred of our Nation’s memorials—the Tomb of  the Unknown Soldiers.  There are a lot of memorials for the members of VFW Post 5119 to see, and for the  rest of us, there’s a lot for which we are grateful. The members of VFW Post 5119 honor  each of us with their presence in our Nation’s  capital.  f  CELEBRATING ASIAN PACIFIC  AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH  HON.

474,22,2005-05-13,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker,  the month of May marks Asian Pacific  American Heritage Month, and I am pleased  to recognize the more than 172,000 Asian Pacific Americans living in Minnesota. My state is  home  to a vibrant and diverse community,  which includes prominent elected officials as  well as business and civic leaders.  The fourth congressional district is home to  nearly 47,000 Asian Pacific Americans and  one of the largest Hmong populations in the  United States. The many thriving businesses  on University Avenue in St. Paul are a great  example of the positive changes and contributions of Asian Pacific Americans. Today, the  avenue is a vibrant commercial corridor largely  due to the investment of Hmong, Lao, Cambodian and Vietnamese Americans who came  as refugees and now own businesses.  Although the Asian Pacific American community has made great strides, obstacles  to  success remain. I am committed to removing  barriers by  improving access  to education,  creating jobs and eliminating health disparities.  By working together to increase opportunities  for all, we work toward this year’s theme, ‘‘Liberty and Freedom for All.’’  As we celebrate Asian Pacific American  Heritage Month, we salute the pioneers who  paved the way and renew our commitment to  those who follow in their footsteps. I am very  proud of the vibrant Asian American and Pacific  Islander  communities  in my  district,  throughout the state of Minnesota and across  the country.  f  WAIVING  POINTS  OF  ORDER  AGAINST CONFERENCE REPORT  ON H.R.  1268, EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT FOR DEFENSE, THE GLOBAL  WAR ON TERROR, AND TSUNAMI  RELIEF ACT, 2005  SPEECHOF  HON.

475,22,2005-05-13,Mr. MCCAUL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of  the conference agreement  for  the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. I wish  to commend  the conferees  for  their work  in  bringing this important legislation to the House  floor. The funding provided by this bill not only  helps insure that our military will have the resources and capabilities necessary to prevail  in the global war on terror, but it also supports  the Pentagon’s important R&D programs.  I recently noted concerns published by two  former defense officials over possible reductions  in  future defense advanced  technology  development. While  I am confident  that  this  Administration and the Congress will continue  to provide ample funding for the military’s R&D  programs,  it  is  important  to underscore how  these programs help  incubate  technologies  with important military applications being developed by small companies.  My Congressional district has a number of  small companies with  innovative new  technologies  that promise significant benefits  to  the military. Three of these companies have  developed technologies that offer good examples of private initiatives ready to be advanced  for military use in partnership with the Defense  Department. The funding in this bill will make  this partnership possible.  One company, Zebra  Imaging, has developed a 3–D hologram  technology  that now  produces three-dimensional imagery of battlefield information imagery for military planning  and  reconnaissance purposes. The  first of  these imaging systems is now being deployed  by  the Army  for use  in  Iraq, with a second  system planned. Several defense R&D programs are assessing advanced applications of  this technology for the future warfighter.  A second company, Teravicta Technologies,  has  engineered  advanced  radio  frequency  microelectro-mechanical (RF MEMS) switches  and  relays  that provide much greater efficiency and performance in military electronics  and communications systems, such as radar  and satellite communications, as well as cell  phones and other mobile wireless devices.

476,29,2005-05-13,Mr. MOORE of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker, we  join today to pay tribute to William T. Reed,  the President and CEO of KCPT, Kansas  City’s public broadcasting station, who has announced his  retirement effective  June 30,  2005. He steps down after 13 years as head  of Kansas City Public Television.  Bill Reed joined KCPT in 1992 and emphasized education, local programming and outreach. The station received numerous awards  from PBS,  the National Educational Telecommunication Association, NETA, and community organizations for its local programming  and  services,  including 21  regional Emmy  awards and one national Emmy for the documentary, ‘‘Be Good Smile Pretty’’. Four of the  station’s signature program series, ‘‘Ruckus’’,  ‘‘Rare Visions’’,  ‘‘Roadside Revelations’’ and  ‘‘Kansas City Week in Review’’, began under  Reed’s leadership. He also introduced viewers  to the beautiful writings of Kansas City Star  columnist Charles Gusewelle, who this spring  will produce his fourth documentary for KCPT,  called ‘‘Stories Under the Stone’’. Reed’s collaboration  with  Gusewelle  also  launched  KCPT’s home video library venture. Later this  year, children and their parents also will benefit  from  the development of an  interactive  reading program called ‘‘Bark Park Place’’.  Bill Reed made partnerships and collaborations an important part of the station’s business plan. In 2003, KCPT was named Best  Place to Work for Community Partnerships by  the Kansas City Business Journal. Many of  those partnerships, like Chalkwaves, a digital  instructional media service for elementary and  secondary schools now used across the country, changed  the education  landscape. Additionally,  the Kansas City Regional Access  Consortium  for  Higher  Education,  KC  REACHE,  a  distance  education  effort  partnering KCPT with nine area colleges and  universities, began under Reed’s stewardship  long before distance  learning was commonplace. Other successful partnerships  include  Network KC, an  in-depth news partnership  with the Kansas City Star, KCUR–FM, KPRS–  FM and UMKC’s Back Channel, a student production for the web; and Speaking of Women’s Health, a partnership with Shawnee Mission Medical Center to conduct a yearly health  symposium for 1,700 women. The TV Dinner  and the KCPT Holiday Auction were also created, and a partnership developed with  the  Gamma Phi Beta Sorority  for  the Antiques,  Garden and Home Design Show to raise additional funds for the station.  From 1997 to 2001, KCPT successfully conducted a capital campaign that raised $10 million to renovate its facilities on 31st Street and  to purchase digital television equipment. The  station was among the first stations to go on  the air with digital television and was cited by  PBS as one of seven Digital Pioneers in public  television.  Reed began his public broadcasting career  in 1967 as General Manager of KIXE, the public television station in Redding, California. He  joined the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)  in Washington, D.C., in 1974, where he was  promoted  to Senior Vice President  in 1978  and worked until 1991. While at PBS, Reed  led the planning and implementation of PBS  Home Video and  the PBS Adult Learning  Service and the development of PBS VIDEO  (a service  for educational  institutions). After  leaving PBS, he also served as a consultant  to  the Corporation  for Public Broadcasting  (CPB). Reed served on the boards of a number of  local and national organizations:  the  Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Board of  Directors from 1972 to 1974; the Association  of  America’s  Public  Television  Stations’  (APTS) Board of Trustees from 1995 to 2001;  and American Public Television (APT) Board  of Directors from 1997 to 2003. He was elected as the National Educational Telecommunications Association’s (NETA) first chairman in  1997. Reed served as President of the Jackson County Historical Society  from 1996–  1998, President of the Public Television Association of Missouri  (PTAM)  from 1994–1998  and 2002  to present, and Chairman of  the  Kansas Public Broadcasting Council (KPBC)  from 1997–1998.

477,3,2005-05-26,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to mourn the  loss of a great  American, Todd Venette, whose  life  was cut short by a terrorist attack in  Iraq.  Todd, a former Marine, was helping  Iraq’s young democracy as a government contractor when he was killed by  a terrorist car bomb in Baghdad. As his  friends and family would tell you, Todd  was a selfless person who volunteered  to reenlist shortly after the war in Iraq  started. When he completed his tour,  his dedication to the mission led him  to return to Iraq as a government contractor.  A giving person, a mentor, and a  servant are among the words that have  been used to describe Todd. As a firefighter in Russellville, Arkansas. Todd  helped  protect  the  community. His  service to the people of Russellville did  not end there. Todd was instrumental  in establishing a wrestling program for  kids at the local Boys and Girls Club,  putting his talents to work as a mentor  to shape the lives of young people of  Russellville in a positive way.  Mr. Speaker, Todd  touched many  people in his short life. I ask my colleagues  to keep Todd’s  family and  friends in their thoughts and prayers  during these very difficult times.  f  RECOGNIZING JIM LONGWORTH  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2005
478,3,2005-05-26,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to recognize and congratulate Triad  Today for being awarded the Spectrum  of Democracy Award for Responsible  Election Coverage by the North Carolina Center For Voter Education. The  program is aired in the Fifth Congressional District on Sinclair Broadcasting’s WXLV/WUPN  station  covering  the  Winston-Salem/Greensboro/High  Point metropolitan area.  Triad Today was created October 2003  by veteran television broadcaster, author, and columnist Jim Longworth. It  is the Piedmont Triad’s only local television talk show. Its guests have included  Senators  and  Congressmen,  mayors  and  sports  celebrities  like  Richard Petty. But most of the time it  serves  the  community  by  disseminating  information about the  issues  that matter the most to the community, like health care, public safety,  and government.  But  it was another kind of public  service for which Triad Today was recently recognized. During the 2004 election cycle, Jim Longworth distributed  free blocks of air time on his show to  scores  of  congressional  and  gubernatorial candidates. His action helped  raise citizen awareness of candidates  and issues and encouraged more people  to participate in the political process.  For  this, Mr. Longworth and Triad  Today were awarded the Spectrum of  Democracy Award.  Mr. Speaker, the press has a responsibility to fulfill its role as the fourth  estate, that is, to serve as a guardian  of democracy and defender of the public interest. I am pleased to congratulate Triad Today for its outstanding  commitment to keeping the community informed.  f  REPUBLICANS RETURN CONTROL  TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, Ronald Reagan once said that  the government’s view of the economy  could be summed up in a few short  phrases: if it moves, tax it. If it keeps  moving, regulate  it; and  if  it stops  moving, subsidize it.  I believe the American people, not  the government, have a better view of  our economy. By working to remove  the economic barriers of taxation, litigation and regulation, House Republicans are  returning  control of  the  economy to the American people. The  109th Congress has passed legislation  this year which will permanently repeal the death tax, decrease the deficit,  strengthen American borders, prevent  frivolous lawsuits, improve our highways, and provide our country with a  comprehensive energy policy.  In my home State of South Carolina,  the unemployment rate continues to  decrease and over 1,300 new jobs have  been created since March. This great  news is positive proof that the Republican leaders are creating more jobs,  growing the economy, and returning  control to the American people.  In conclusion, God bless our troops  and we will never forget September 11. THE HISTORY OF MEMORIAL DAY  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2005
479,3,2005-05-26,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, as we  prepare to celebrate Memorial Day, let  me give a brief history lesson. We know  that Southern families decorated the  graves of their fallen friends after the  Civil War on what was known as Decoration Day.  However, it was a former Member of  Congress,  a Democrat-turned-Republican, an individual who got elected to  the Senate, General John A. Logan,  who gets credit for memorializing Memorial Day as he established the Grand  Army of the Republic and issued General Order 31 which  formerly established Memorial Day.  General Logan was from Illinois in  the deep southern part of the State. He  was a congressman, a U.S. Senator and  a vice presidential candidate. He is memorialized with a statue here in Washington, DC and a statue in Raleigh,  North Carolina, where he kept Union  soldiers from burning down the city.  He  also  has  a  community  college  named after him in the southern part  of the State of Illinois.  As we remember the men and women  who have fallen in combat, let us also  remember our soldiers from all wars  and the folks that made it possible for  us  to have and celebrate Memorial  Day, and one of those individuals is  General John A. Logan.  f  HONORING OUR VETERANS  (Mrs. MILLER of Michigan asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend her remarks.)  ",2005
480,3,2005-05-26,Mrs. MILLER  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, shortly after the conclusion  of the Civil War, a group of veterans  began a tradition known as Decoration  Day. The day was set aside to decorate  the graves of the men who had perished  during battle, and it was believed Decoration Day was  always  during  the  month of May because flowers needed  for the occasion were finally blooming.  Two centuries later, Decoration Day is  now Memorial Day, but two core traditions remain: we honor those who died  protecting our Nation, and we still do  so in May when the flowers are blooming.  Today, as our Nation spends it third  consecutive Memorial Day at war, we  remember the men and women who  made the ultimate sacrifice defending  the precious gift of liberty. We honor  the people who have left behind husband, wives, children and parents, as  well as the riches and celebrations of  life, to fight for the freedoms of all  Americans; and we should remain always remindful of that symbolic tradition of Decoration Day, that flowers  will bloom, a beautiful America will  bloom from the sacrifices made by our  fallen veterans.

487,17,2005-05-26,Mr. GIBBONS.," Madam Chairman, I  rise today in support of H.R. 2528, a bill  which will provide the essential funding that our Nation’s heroes, our veterans, need. I applaud the gentleman  from California  (Mr. LEWIS) and the  gentleman  from the 25th District of  New York (Mr. WALSH) for their vision  and leadership on this important issue,  and I also thank them for allowing me  the time to speak on a bill that is so  important to our country.  This bill increases overall veterans’  benefits to $21 billion which is nearly  $1.6 billion more than last year’s funding level for our veterans.  Madam Chairman, over the  last 2  years  alone,  this Congress has  increased funding for veterans’ medical  care by 18 percent. In addition, H.R.  2528 doubles veterans’ mental health  research funding and requires a comprehensive  study  on  post-traumatic  stress disorder. As a veteran of our  Armed Forces, I understand that this is  an issue that our future veterans, who  are currently fighting in the war on  terror, will most  certainly  struggle  with. I applaud the efforts that this bill  makes to ensure America’s veterans  will receive the mental health care  they need when they return home as  our heroes.  Madam Chairman, I also support this  bill because of the assistance it will  provide to the veterans in my home  State of Nevada. H.R. 2528 provides $199  million for a new veterans hospital in  Las Vegas. Las Vegas is the fastestgrowing metropolitan area in our Nation. Nevada’s veteran population  is  simply exploding. This new hospital  will ensure that those who have bravely served our country have access to all  their health care needs. This is great  news for Nevada’s veterans.  The committee’s report that accompanies H.R. 2528 also ensures that the  vital per diem payments that the VA  provides to our State veterans home in  Boulder City will not be cut. This report language also requests Secretary  Nicholson to engage in a dialogue with  our State-operated veterans homes to  come up with a solution to increasing  the costs of providing quality health  care to our veterans.  Madam Chairman,  I urge my colleagues to support this bill because it  provides our Nation’s veterans with the  benefits that they have earned by protecting our great Nation.  ",2005

489,17,2005-05-26,Mr. ROTHMAN.,"  I  thank  the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, as a member of the  Committee on Appropriations, I rise in  support of the Military Quality of Life  and Veterans Affairs Appropriations  bill. I want to thank the gentleman  from New York (Mr. WALSH) and the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. EDWARDS)  for their very hard work in drafting  this well-balanced bill.  I also want to acknowledge the majority and minority staff for the diligence and dedication that they have  demonstrated throughout this process.  I can appreciate the tough choices that  both the gentleman  from New York  and the gentleman from Texas had to  make with this tight allocation. Admittedly, if there were a different majority in the House, there would have  been more money allocated to these  programs, but within the budget constraints imposed upon the gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS), the gentleman from New York (Mr. WALSH)  and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. EDWARDS), I believe they have done a fine  job, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support the bill.  ",2005
490,17,2005-05-26,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. KIRK).  ",2005
491,17,2005-05-26,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Chairman, as a member of the subcommittee, I want to  commend both our chairman and ranking minority member for producing a  bill which will dramatically improve  the life and the experience of men and  women joining the United States Navy  and going for basic training and other  schools in my district at Great Lakes  Naval Training Center.  This bill funds two new barracks for  the Great Lakes Naval Training Center  and an infrastructure upgrade. It continues a $1 billion capitalization program which has  transformed Great  Lakes into the birthplace of the United  States Navy.  But this bill does something even  more important. Throughout the country, we know that we have several hospital facilities funded by the Department of Defense close to VA facilities  also funded by the taxpayer in caring  for our veterans. What this bill does is  it accelerates plans to build a new joint  VA-Navy hospital in North Chicago, Illinois. This new facility, with two reports required by the administration to  accelerate  the progress, will be  the  first ever Navy-VA joint facility. We  are very proud that that will be located  in North Chicago, Illinois. This $100  million facility will ensure veterans’  health care  in northern Illinois and  provide cutting-edge, quality care for  the recruits who are joining the United  States Navy.  For these reasons and others, I really  commend the chairman and the staff  for what they have done to accelerate  this, better health care for veterans,  better health care for naval recruits  and at lower cost to the taxpayer. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to  the  gentleman  from  Oregon  (Mr.  BLUMENAUER). ",2005
492,17,2005-05-26,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," I appreciate the  gentleman’s courtesy  in yielding me  this time.  Mr. Chairman, I, too, am pleased that  we have the creation of a Military  Quality of Life committee. It is hard to  imagine more capable leadership than  that that will be offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. WALSH)  and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. EDWARDS) and there is tremendous potential to look holistically at the problems and opportunities dealing with  military quality of life.  I am particularly pleased because it  will give for the first time a true focus  to look at what is a serious, hidden  issue of military quality of life, and  that is military cleanup. For too long,  this Congress has been missing in action. It has never given priority to the  vast stretches of the United States in  every State of the Union, an area the  size of the States of Maryland and Massachusetts combined, to deal with the  cleanup of past military activities.  It impacts our troops and their families on the bases, their neighbors past  and present, and it has significant financial impacts, although if we do this  job right, we have the opportunity to  dramatically reduce the cost. I am impressed over the last 7 years working  on this  issue that the military, the  men and women in the ranks, want to  do this job right. They have sensitivity  to the environment and they know that  they are in trouble if they are exposed  unnecessarily  to  pollution  and  unexploded ordnance.  Cleanup gives the military many advantages. There are  less hazards to  fighting men and women. There will be  more area to train. There are better relationships with the surrounding area.  Most important, it will develop tools  and techniques that will save American  lives. It will give the military longterm security with these new techniques and technologies.  Every day people die unnecessarily  from land mines and UXO around the  world. I am going to offer some amendments because, frankly, as much respect  as  I have  for  the new  subcommittee and the fact it is new, they  are looking at a whole new range of  areas.  We are looking at allocating over $1.5  billion to the 2005 base closure rounds,  and we have not yet cleaned up after  the very first round of military closures. That is unacceptable. It is time  for Congress to no longer be missing in  action. We need to step up, provide the  guidance, and clean up these areas.

493,24,2005-05-26,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter  into a colloquy with the chairman of  the Subcommittee on Military Quality  of Life and Veterans Affairs of the  Committee on Appropriations.  First of all, I want to take a moment  to commend the gentleman from New  York (Mr. WALSH) and the committee  for bringing  this  important pending  bill  to  the  floor and providing  resources to our military and those who  serve in our military. I thank him for  his  leadership  in  the United States  House of Representatives and for his  service to our Nation.  I had intended to offer an amendment  to add $1.3 million to the Army National Guard construction account in  order to complete the design of a joint  National Guard Reserve Center in Daytona  Beach,  Florida.  Last  year,  through the good work of this appropriations  subcommittee,  the  Subcommittee on Military Construction  appropriated $789,000 in fiscal year 2005  funding to begin the design, and that  funding is now being depleted.  Mr. Chairman,  this project  is  the  Florida National Guard’s number one  priority in the 2012 to 2013, 5-year plan  and will be included in the President’s  budget for the 2007 budget.  I am concerned that possibly cutting  the funding or not providing the funding for this project now may negatively  impact on the Florida National Guard’s  ability to move forward with this important project that is now some nearly 8 years behind schedule.  I would ask the gentleman from New  York whether he can commit to working with me during the conference on  this bill to ensure that funding or adequate attention and language is in the  final bill.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter  into a colloquy to discuss a funding  matter  concerning  the  Assembled  Chemical Weapons Alternatives program.  I rise today, Mr. Chairman, to bring  attention to a significant funding problem that, if it is not solved, could halt  the destruction of dangerous chemical  weapons stockpiles in Richmond, Kentucky and Pueblo, Colorado.  Within the last 2 months, there have  been significant changes in the status  of what is known as the ACWA program which manages the Blue Grass  Ammunition Demilitarization Facility  at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky and at  the Pueblo Chemical  Depot in Pueblo, Colorado.

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, I wanted to take this opportunity  to  thank America’s veterans  and to offer my sympathy to those  families that will experience for the  first time and for many, many times  the difficulty of Memorial Day,  for  they are the families that are now suffering the loss of a loved one who has  fallen in battle or in the service of his  or her country.  Today, we had the honor of traveling  to Arlington Cemetery, as I said earlier, to place the wreath of honor in  honor of women who have fallen in battle. The good news about America is  that in times of conflict, however we  may disagree on the policy, we are  united behind the men and women who  leave their homes and leave their families and leave all that they love to be  able to serve this country.  My sadness, however, is that there  are so many that are coming back in  caskets  covered and draped by  the  American flag. And so I think it is extremely important that on this Memorial Day, we are united in our honoring  and our admiration and our affection  for those who have lost their lives in  Iraq and Afghanistan.  May God bless them, God bless their  families, and God bless  the United  States of America.  f  COMMUNICATION  FROM  INSPECTOR GENERAL, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  of New York)  laid before the  House  the  following  communication  from Steven A.

Subject: Notification of Resignation and Retirement.  Please accept my offer of resignation, as  the Inspector General for the U.S. House of  Representatives, effective May 30, 2005. This  date will also be my effective date of retirement from Federal Service.  It has been an honor to serve the House as  the Inspector General for the last five years.  My goal, and that of my staff, has been to  help the House achieve the best use of all the  dollars it spends, increase efficiencies, and  ensure the health, safety, and security of  Members, staff, and visitors. Through the  combined support of the House Leadership,  the Committee on House Administration,  and the hard work of my staff, I believe we  have helped the House accomplish its administrative goals.  Now, after slightly more than 35 years of  Federal Service, I look forward to a new  chapter in my life; the pursuit of a hobby  and business venture as a kayak instructor  and kayaking guide.  Once again, it has been a great honor to  serve the House of the Inspector General for  the last five years. It has been a fulfilling  and rewarding experience!  f  SPECIAL ORDERS  ",2005

508,45,2005-05-26,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker, along with  the gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr. COBLE), chairman of the Judiciary  Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security, I  am pleased to introduce the Reducing  Crime and Terrorism at America’s Seaports Act of 2005.  There are 361 seaports in the United  States that serve essential national interests by facilitating the flow of trade  and the movement of cruise passengers,  as well as supporting the effective and  safe deployment of U.S. Armed Forces.  These seaport facilities and other marine  areas  cover  some  3.5 million  square miles of ocean area and 95,000  miles of coastline.  Millions of shipping containers pass  through our ports every month. A single container has room for as much as  60,000 pounds of explosives, 10 to 15  times the amount in the Ryder truck  used to blow up the Murrah Federal  Building in Oklahoma City. When you  consider that a single ship can carry as  many as 8,000 containers at one time,  the vulnerability of our  seaports  is  alarming.  Each year, more  than  141 million  ferry and cruise ship passengers, more  than 2 billion tons of domestic and  international freight and 3 billion tons  of oil move through U.S. seaports. Millions of truck-size cargo containers are  off-loaded onto U.S. docks. Many seaports are still protected by little more  than a chain link fence and, in far too  many instances, have no adequate safeguards to ensure that only authorized  personnel can access sensitive areas of  the port. If we allow this system to  continue unchecked, it is only a matter  of time until terrorists attempt to deliver a weapon of mass destruction to  our doorstep via ship, truck or cargo  container.  New reports by the Government Accountability Office, Congress’  investigative arm, fault both the CustomsTrade Partnership Against Terrorism  and the Container Security Initiative.  C-TPAT allows international shippers  to get quicker clearance through Customs in exchange for voluntary security measures. But the GAO said that  the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s vetting process was not thorough  enough. It found that only 10 percent of  the certified members had been validated through an actual physical inspection by the Agency. The rest had  been certified by paperwork applications.  As part of the recently passed Homeland Security authorization bill, the  House took some important steps to  improve the screening of cargo by expanding the Container Security Initiative and refocusing it, based on risk.  But the truth is that not every container can be inspected, and we need to  use other tools at our disposal to deter  those who would use our seaports as a  point of attack until we can inspect or  somehow  verify  each  container.  Strengthening criminal penalties, as  Chairman COBLE and I are proposing  with this bill, is one way we make our  Nation’s ports less vulnerable.  The Reducing Crime and Terrorism  at America’s Seaports Act of 2005 will  fill a gaping hole in our defense against  terrorism and make American ports,  passengers and cargo safer. Our bill is  substantially  similar  to  bipartisan  Senate  legislation  introduced earlier  this year by Senators BIDENand SPECTERand supported by other key members of the Judiciary Committee, including Senators DIANNEFEINSTEINand  ORRINHATCH. The Senate version of  this legislation has been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee and is awaiting action by the  full Senate.  Our  bill  makes  common-sense  changes to our criminal laws and will  help to close security gaps confronting  our ports. The amendment will make it  a crime to use a vessel to smuggle terrorists or dangerous materials, including nuclear material, into the U.S., impose stiff criminal penalties for providing false information to a Federal  law enforcement officer at a port or on  a vessel, and double the sentence of  anyone who fraudulently gains access  to a seaport.  Our bill would also directly access  several immediate threats by increasing penalties for smugglers who misrepresent illicit cargo. It would also  bridge specific gaps in current Federal  law by making it a crime for a vessel  operator to fail to stop when ordered to  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:56 May 27, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K26MY7.102 H26PT1 ",2005

I am talking about things like juvenile type I diabetes. I am talking about spinal cord  injuries, Alzheimer’s, leukemia.  That was the one bill. And, of course,  also  in  that bill would expand  the  banking ability of bone marrow where  adult stem cells are plentiful.

511,80,2005-05-26,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, I wish to  join my colleague from Oklahoma and  other colleagues who have risen today  to  support  the nomination of John  Bolton to be our U.N. ambassador.  The United Nations is a unique institution, obviously. It is an institution  which has gone through its good times  and some bad times. Many of us, on our  side of the aisle especially, have been  critical of the United Nations over the  years for different activities, whether  they have been policy driven or,  in  some cases, just the operations aspects  of the United Nations. But I think, at  least for my part, I agree that it is an  extremely important institution, that  it represents an attempt by the community of nations across the world to  find a forum where they can interact  and,  hopefully,  reach  conclusions  which are  constructive  to mankind  generally and especially address issues  which cannot and should not be addressed by nation states individually,  such as issues involving large expansions of disease, issues involving the  treatment  of  children  around  the  world, issues involving the questions of  war.  It  is  important we have a  forum  where nations can come together and  try to work together and, if they disagree, at least have the disagreements  be more transparent and, therefore, the  ability,  hopefully,  to  reach  agreements, and at least have the capacity  to temper those disagreements, which  is more probable of occurring as a result of transparency.

513,94,2005-05-26,Mr. REED.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak in opposition to the nomination  of John Bolton to be ambassador to the  United Nations.  There are two issues at stake. First  is an issue of whether this Senate will  receive critical information so that we  can  deliberate  carefully  and  thoroughly about Mr. Bolton’s nomination.  So far, the State Department, as my  colleagues, Senators DODDand BIDEN,  pointed out, failed to provide information under the theory that they get to  decide what we should know when we  are casting a vote as important as ambassador to the United Nations. It is a  novel theory, but it holds no water. If  we allow this to go on, it will make the  Senate  irrelevant when  it comes to  major decisions about nominations and  major decisions about the future policy  of the country.  The second issue is the qualifications  of Mr. Bolton to be ambassador to the  United Nations. For me, this is not a  particularly hard vote. I opposed Mr.  Bolton’s nomination to be Assistant  Secretary for Arms Control. That was  based upon my review of his record, his  statements, and his commitment  to  arms control and counterproliferation.  Frankly, I think over the last several  years—the record is mixed, but in large  part it suggests that his duties there  certainly don’t warrant a promotion to  be ambassador to the U.N.  He was instrumental in establishing  the Proliferation Security Initiative,  which  is a potentially useful  framework, but as CRS pointed out:  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:24 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S26MY5.REC S26MY5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005

515,101,2005-05-26,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President, I  take a few minutes to speak about natural gas prices, the prices at the pump,  blue-collar  workers,  farmers,  and  homeowners.  The reason I do that is because the  Senate  Energy  Committee  earlier  today did a good piece of work that I  hope the American people understand.  By a virtually unanimous vote, 21 to  1, the committee, after 5 months of  work, reported to this body what I hope  will be called the Clean Energy Act of  2005.  I suppose people outside of the Senate get tired of hearing Senators compliment one another, but  I do that  today because this would not have happened had it not been for the leadership  of Chairman PETEDOMENICI, the Republican chairman of the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources  Committee,  and  the  ranking Democrat,  JEFFBINGAMAN.  We tried to do this in the last session  of Congress in the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee. We were not  able to pass an energy bill to give this  country a comprehensive energy policy. Senator DOMENICIdeliberately set  out to do things different in this session of Congress. He sat down with  Senator BINGAMANand the Democratic  staff and pledged to work with them, to  share everything with them. Senator  DOMENICIvisited every member of the  committee, Republican and Democrat.  We worked together on a variety of  major hearings and roundtables. The  coal roundtable lasted 3 or 4 hours; one  on natural gas lasted 3 or 4 hours. He  encouraged  a  variety  of  committee  members to become involved.  On  the Subcommittee on Energy,  which I chair, he encouraged me to go  ahead and, working with Senator TIM  JOHNSONof South Dakota from across  the aisle, we came up with a Natural  Gas Price Reduction Act of 2005 into  which we put ideas to bring down the $7  natural gas price we have today, which  is the highest natural gas price in the  world. Senator DOMENICI and Senator  did their best to come up  with aggressive ideas.  Sometimes when Members set out to  compromise and work together, we end  up with nothing because the easiest  way to compromise is to do nothing.  We can all agree on doing nothing and  BINGAMAN then we will not have a bold bill. But  we are almost fortunate this did not  pass last year because this is a more  urgent time. The natural gas prices are  $7, the highest in the industrial world.  We have gone from the lowest in the  industrial world to the highest in the  industrial world. Prices at the pump  are high. We have a million blue-collar  manufacturing jobs in the chemical industry alone that will go overseas if we  do not find some way to deal with this.  September 11 was a big surprise to  our country. Our next big surprise is  going to be to our pocketbooks if we do  not figure out how to deal with the  price of energy. We must figure out  how to have a low-cost, adequate, reliable supply of clean energy that is increasingly  produced  in  the United  States of America and not overseas.  That is our goal.  What is exceptional about this bill,  in my view, is that it attacks the problem  in a much more comprehensive  way than other versions of the bill  have. It begins with aggressive conservation. For example, the appliance  efficiency standards, which are in this  year’s bill, are about double the effectiveness of  those  that were  in  last  year’s bill. What does that mean? It  simply means that by some estimates  these standards could save at peak demand the equivalent of 45 500-megawatt powerplants. If we save building  45 gas powerplants, we decrease the  building of natural gas and we tend to  lower the price.  There are a good many other examples of aggressive conservation. The  second thing the bill does is to begin to  change the way we produce electricity.  This country produces about 25 percent  of all the energy in the world. We use  it here. We have 5 to 6 percent of the  American people and we produce 25 percent of the energy. Where does that  electricity come from? It comes primarily from what we call nonrenewables. It comes from, first, coal; natural gas, second; and nuclear, third.  That is 91 percent of it. Now, another 7  percent comes from dams from hydropower and about 2 percent comes from  renewable power, which is windmills,  solar, biomass, and geothermal.  If we are in competition with China  and India for jobs, and an important  part of every  farm, every manufacturing plant, every home, is the provision of reliable, low-cost, adequate supply of energy, as a practical matter for  the next 20 years, most of that will  have to come from nuclear power, from  coal, and from gas and conservation.  That is where it has to come.  Of course, we want to do more with  other kinds of energy. For example, I  hope the tax committee, when it reports its part of this bill, does something about solar power. We have a renewable tax credit in the law today  that does not do much for solar. It encourages  powerplants  that  produce  electricity from sun. We almost don’t  have any of those. What we use solar  for is, we put shingles on roofs. We  need to give incentives to individual  owners to do more of that. That’s why  I proposed an investment tax credit so  individual owners can take advantage  of it.  We can do more research and development in biomass and more research  and development in geothermal. Even  if we do all that we can do for the so-  called renewable energies, in the next  20 years—and there is some disagreement about this—in my view, we will  still be producing about 95 percent of  our power—certainly not less than 90  percent of our power—from nuclear  power, from coal, from gas, and hydro.  Now, how many more dams are going  to be built in the United States? It is  limited. In fact, this bill addresses relicensing of hydro dams. There are a  good number of those in Oregon where  the Presiding Officer comes from. By  the year 2018, according to the National Hydropower Association, there  will be 30,000 MW of hydropower plants  that need to be relicensed. That’s half  of  the  hydropower  in  the United  States.  This  landmark,  bipartisan  agreement on hydro relicensing is both  urgent and meaningful.  So if one puts all of that aside, if we  want to compete for our jobs with people from around the world and if the  price of energy is a big part of it, what  do we have to do? Nuclear, coal and  gas.  Over the last 10 years, almost all of  the new powerplants in America that  make electricity have been built from  natural gas. Now, how wise is that?  Here we are with $7 a unit natural gas,  the highest price in the industrialized  world, our chemical companies, our  blue-collar companies using this, some  of them as a raw material—Dow Chemical estimates that 40 percent of the  cost of its production is energy. Now, if  in other parts of the world natural gas  is significantly lower, we will have a  problem. We will have  jobs moving  from here to there.  We do not want to make all of our  power from natural gas. We do it because we know how to do it and because it is clean. That leaves us with  two sources of what we call base load  energy, the two things that we must  find a way to use and use in a clean  way if we want to have a low-cost supply of American-produced energy. One  of those is nuclear, and one of those is  coal.  Nuclear power is a technology that  we invented in the United States, the  peaceful uses of the atom. We figured  out how to do that in the 1950s. One of  the remarkable technological stories in  the United States is our Navy and its  nuclear-powered vessels. I suppose it is  a classified matter exactly how many  we have, but we have dozens of them.  Some of  them have  small  reactors.  Some of them have a couple of big reactors on them.  Since the 1950s, there has never been  one single nuclear reactor accident in  the U.S. Navy, not one. They are underwater.

525,108,2005-05-26,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I appreciate Senator VOINOVICH allowing  me to speak a moment or two on the  John Bolton nomination.  No. 1, when it comes to how and why  Members vote, every Senator has to  make a decision they feel comfortable  with, that is good for the Nation, good  for the Senate, good  for the White  House, good for the American people.  One thing I am confident of: Senator  VOINOVICH, of all the people I know in  the Senate, is right at the top of the  list of those who make decisions based  on conscience and principle. Whatever  problems he has with  this nominee  have come from soul searching, thinking, and  looking. He will articulate  why he feels the way he does and vote  his conscience. That is exactly what he  should do. I am all for that because  that is what makes the Senate great.  That is what makes America great.  In terms of myself, I would like a moment or two to express why I have  come to the conclusion that I think  John Bolton will make an outstanding  ambassador to the United Nations. We  have heard a lot about his disposition,  about his temper, about his working  relations. Everyone will make a judgment about where they come down on  that. I made a judgment that, obviously, some of the things about his  working relationships can be troubling.  The idea that he has been confirmed  four times, has served his country for  well over 20 years in a variety of posts  and done an outstanding job, is what I  will base my vote on—not a conversation here or there but 20-plus years of  serving the United States at the highest level of Government, with a great  academic background.  But why him and why now? Are there  other people who can be United States  ambassador  to  the United Nations?  There are a  lot of good people out  there. What drove  the President  to  pick him now? The honest truth is, I  haven’t talked to the President about  why he picked John Bolton, but I have  a pretty good idea what was on his  mind. The President sees very clearly  the need for the United Nations. This  world is in tremendous conflict. We are  splitting along religious lines. We are  having all kinds of problems getting  along with each other and trying to  find out how to fight the war on terrorism. The United Nations provides a  hope for the world, a place where we  can come together and have good people stand up to bad people. Sometimes  it is hard to determine who is good and  who is bad, but many times it is not,  and it should be a place where people of  good will can deal with problems for  bad people such as Saddam Hussein and  others, the Osama bin Ladens of the  world, a place where they can be controlled and checked.  The President sees from the American conservative perspective that the  United Nations has lost its way. From  a conservative point of view, being a  conservative Republican, I hear continuously of problems with the United  Nations  from people I represent and  people I know. The worst thing we can  do  is to allow the good will of the  American people to slip away from the  United Nations and reject that body.  What will it take to repair the damage done  from the Oil-for-Food Program, the corruption at the United Nations, the, at the least, inconsistent approach to regulating dictators such as  Saddam Hussein? How can we get the  United States and the United Nations  back together where we can work as  one team? It will take a person Americans have faith in. And that is a big  problem with the United Nations right  now.  American conservatives need to feel  better. John Bolton will provide that  assurance from a conservative point of  view that the United Nations would be  pushed to reform itself. From a moderate and liberal point of view, I can  assure members that the policies John  Bolton will fight for will be those policies directed by President Bush, who  won the last election. And some may  not agree with the policies, but that is  where he will get his marching orders.  He  sees  the United Nations as a  value-added product to the world. He  sees clearly where it has gone astray.  He has the credibility with the American public, particularly among conservatives, to be a force for change.  The worst thing that could happen is  for the United Nations to slip away, in  the eyes of Americans, as an effective  body. It surely has gone that route.  The best thing that can happen from  this nomination is that John Bolton  goes to the U.N. with an attitude of: I  will work with you, but you have to be  better—and  to  effectively articulate  President Bush’s policies. I think that  can happen. I think it must happen.  Not only am I enthusiastic about his  nomination, he clearly—given the dynamic our country has with the United  Nations—is  the  right person at  the  right time and can do things no other  person could do; namely, repair the  image of the U.N. with a large percentage of the American people, who believe it has lost its way. That is why I  will support this nominee with enthusiasm.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I yield the floor.  ",2005

527,108,2005-05-26,Mr. VOINOVICH.," Mr. President, first,  I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his kind remarks about this  Senator early today and this afternoon.  What we are doing here today is what  the Senate should be doing; that is, to  have a robust debate about a nominee  by the President of the United States  to the United Nations.  I have deep concerns about the nomination of John Bolton. We face an important decision today. We are at a  crossroads in foreign policy, at a time  when there has been a drastic shift in  the attitude of our friends and allies. If  we do have a vote today, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to let their consciences and their commitment to our  Nation’s best interests guide them.  I would plead with them to consider  the decision and its consequences carefully, to read the pertinent information, and to ask themselves several important questions:  Is John Bolton the best person to  serve as  the  lead diplomat  to  the  United Nations?  Will he be able to pursue the needed  reforms at the U.N. despite his damaged credibility?  Will he share information with the  right individuals, and will he solicit information from the right individuals,  including his subordinates, so he can  make the most informed decisions?  Is he capable of advancing the President’s and the Secretary of State’s efforts to advance our public diplomacy?  Does he have the character, leadership,  interpersonal  skills,  self-discipline, common decency, and understanding of the chain of command to  lead a team to victory?  Will he recognize and seize opportunities to repair and strengthen relationships, promote peace, and uphold  democracy with our fellow nations?  I also came to the floor today to respond to some of the statements that  have been made regarding the nomination of Mr. Bolton.  It has been argued by my colleagues  that Mr. Bolton is the right man for  the job because he has ‘‘sharp elbows,’’  can give a dose of needed ‘‘strong medicine,’’ and because he will not be an  ‘‘appeaser’’ to the horrors that have  been committed by  the U.N. peacekeepers.  The question is not whether we want  to achieve U.N. reforms. We will support U.N. reforms. And I particularly  want U.N. reforms. We need to pursue  its transformation aggressively, sending a strong message that corruption  will not be tolerated.

528,115,2005-05-26,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I have  been privileged to have served under  both President Clinton and President  George W. Bush as one of the two Senate delegates to the United Nations,  and there is no doubt that the United  States Permanent Representative  to  the U.N. is one of the most important  diplomatic posts in the U.S. government.  The Permanent Representative is the  public  face, voice, and vote of  the  United States at the world’s only body  charged  with  maintaining  international peace and security. Therefore,  it is essential that this individual be  someone with  indisputable  integrity  and extraordinary diplomatic abilities.  After listening to John Bolton’s confirmation hearings before the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee,  I  feel  confident in saying that John Bolton is  not that person.  Most troubling to me are allegations  from senior U.S. intelligence officials—  including a senior Bush administration  appointee—of Mr. Bolton trying to intimidate and even remove intelligence  analysts simply because they did not  share his political views. Mr. Bolton  even went so far as to get in his car and  go out to the CIA to seek the removal  of one intelligence officer. At any time,  but especially in the wake of the massive  intelligence  failures  associated  with the decision to invade Iraq, efforts  by administration officials to shape intelligence to conform to a particular  preconceived view is unacceptable. It is  essential that dissent be tolerated and  even encouraged  in  the  intelligence  community and not distorted to fit a  particular ideology or political agenda.  Second, I have strong concerns that  Mr. Bolton’s pattern of inflammatory  statements about the U.N. will make it  difficult for him to effectively advance  U.S. security  interests  in New York  and to build support for much-needed  reforms at the U.N. The last thing we  want  is  for countries  to make Mr.  Bolton an excuse for resisting reform.  Taking a tougher approach to the U.N.  through constructive criticism is one  thing; disregarding its value and belittling its very existence is another. We  need  someone  in New York who  is  unafraid to shake things up and challenge the status quo, but that person  must also have the credibility, temperament,  and  diplomatic  skills  to  work with other nations, form coalitions, and advance U.S. interests. The  only tool in Mr. Bolton’s toolbox appears to be a hammer.  Third, I am disturbed by some of the  contradictions in Mr. Bolton’s recent  testimony. For example, Mr. Bolton  pledged to the Foreign Relations Committee that he has not and will not  make statements that are not approved  by the administration. Yet his own testimony about Iran appeared to do just  that—using language rejected by the  administration more than a year ago.  There are other instances of this behavior during the hearings, where our  Ambassador to South Korea has disputed what Mr. Bolton said  Finally, there is a tone and temperament issue with Mr. Bolton’s nomination. According to respected officials  who have worked with him, Mr. Bolton  bullies, belittles and undermines those  who do not agree with him. We all lose  our cool from time to time. Disagreements are part of human discourse.  But, there is a pattern with Mr. Bolton  that goes beyond appropriate behavior—a  disturbing  trait  for  someone  seeking to become our chief diplomat  at a place where people come together  to resolve disagreements.  When Mr. Bolton was nominated to  be Under Secretary of State in 2001, I  strongly opposed and voted against his  nomination. At that time, I had serious  reservations about his experience, diplomatic  temperament, and his poor  track record on non-proliferation and  arms control. Over the last four years,  Mr. Bolton has proved me right. As the  top proliferation official at the State  Department, Mr. Bolton has been ineffective in his current responsibilities  and the world has become more dangerous under his watch. The Bush administration’s record on proliferation,  from Pakistan to Iran to North Korea,  has been poor, at best.  After much debate, the Foreign Relations Committee was not able to support Mr. Bolton’s  nomination  and,  rather, reported  it out without recommendation. Secretary Powell’s Chief  of Staff has said that Mr. Bolton would  be an  ‘‘abysmal’’ ambassador to the  U.N. I might not put it as strongly as  that, but I will be opposing the nomination of Mr. Bolton.  ",2005
529,115,2005-05-26,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to express my opposition to  the nomination of John Bolton to be  the next United States Ambassador to  the United Nations.  Simply put, he is the wrong man at  the wrong time for what is an important and critical position.  At a time when the reputation of the  United States is at an all time low in  many parts of the world and our military is stretched thin, we need a representative at the United Nations who  can engage and work with our friends  and allies to forge multilateral solutions on: the war on terror, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,  global  poverty,  the HIV/AIDS  pandemic, and global warming, just to  name a few.  Yet  throughout  his  career,  John  Bolton  has  demonstrated  an  unrestrained contempt for diplomacy and  international treaties.  In  a  letter  to  Senator RICHARD  LUGAR, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, 102 former American  diplomats  representing  both Democratic and Republican administrations  urged  the  committee  to  reject Mr.  Bolton’s nomination  because  of his  ‘‘exceptional record of opposition to efforts to enhance U.S. security through  arms control. The letter notes that Mr.  Bolton led the effort against ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban  Treaty; blocked a more robust international agreement to curb the proliferation of small arms; led the effort  to block the Ottawa Landmine Treaty;  led the effort to have the United States  withdraw from negotiations to formulate a verification system for the Biological Weapons Convention; and  led  the campaign to have the U.S. withdraw from the ABM Treaty.

533,122,2005-05-26,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, in 15 minutes or so, we will vote on the nomination of Under Secretary of State John  Bolton to be ambassador to the United  Nations.  I applaud President Bush for his selection. The President describes the  Under Secretary as ‘‘a blunt guy’’ who  ‘‘can get  the  job done’’ and  ‘‘isn’t  afraid to speak his mind’’—not even to  the President himself.  We need a  smart, principled, and  straightforward representative to articulate the President’s policies on the  world’s stage.  We need a person with Under Secretary Bolton’s proven track record of  determination  and  success  to  cut  through the thick and tangled bureaucracy that has mired the U.N. in scandal  and inefficiency.  A vote for John Bolton is a vote for  U.N. reform. A vote for John Bolton is  a vote for progress on the international  challenges of our day. A vote for John  Bolton is a vote for the United States.  It is no accident that polling shows  most Americans have a poor view of  the United Nations. In recent months,  we have seen a deluge of negative reports. We now know that Saddam Hussein  stole  an  estimated  $10  billion  through the Oil-for-Food Program. The  U.N. official who  ran  the operation  stands accused of taking kickbacks,  along with many other officials.  Just this week, the head of the Iraq  Survey Group told the Council on Foreign Relations that as a result of the  oil-for-food corruption, Saddam came  to believe he could divide the U.N. Security Council and bring an end to  sanctions. I commend Senator COLEMANfor his determined efforts to get to  the bottom of this global scandal.  We know the U.N. failed to stop the  genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s. The  U.N. is on the brink of repeating that  mistake in Darfur.  In the Congo, it is alleged that U.N.  peacekeepers have committed sexual  abuse against the innocent female civil  war victims they were sent to protect.  Meanwhile, the U.N.’s Human Rights  Commission, which  is  charged with  protecting our human rights, includes  such human rights abusers as Libya,  Cuba, Zimbabwe, and Sudan.  These failures are very real and very  discouraging. They can be measured in  lives lost and billions of dollars stolen.  And they can be measured in the sinking regard  for an organization that  should be held in high esteem.  America sends the U.N. $2 billion per  year. Our contribution makes up 22  percent of that budget. We provide an  even  larger  percentage  for  peacekeeping and other U.N. activities.  It is no surprise that Americans are  calling out for reform. John Bolton is  the President’s choice to lead that effort. He possesses deep and extensive  knowledge of the U.N. and has,  for  many years, been committed to its reform.  Back in 1991, Under Secretary Bolton  successfully  lobbied  to  repeal  the  U.N.’s shameful resolution 3379, which  equated Zionism with racism. Many in  the diplomatic community told him it  could not be done. But after waging an  aggressive  campaign, he moved  the  U.N. General Assembly to repeal the  resolution by a vote of 111 to 25.  As Under Secretary of State for Arms  Control  and  International Security,  John Bolton helped build a coalition of  60 countries to combat the spread of  weapons of mass destruction through  the President’s Proliferation Security  Initiative.  He was pivotal in our successful efforts to persuade Libya to give up its  pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.  He was also the chief negotiator of  the Treaty of Moscow, which calls upon  the U.S. and Russia to reduce their nuclear warheads by nearly two-thirds.  Under Secretary Bolton has the confidence of the President and the Secretary of State, and it is to them he  will report directly.  He has been confirmed by this body  four times, and I believe if we are given  the chance, he will be confirmed for a  fifth time today.  The vetting of his current nomination has been exhaustive. The Foreign  Relations Committee  interviewed  29  witnesses and reviewed more than 830  pages of documents from the State Department, from USAID, and the CIA.  Under Secretary Bolton fielded nearly  100 questions for the record and underwent multiple hearings.  As Senator LUGARhas pointed out,  Under Secretary Bolton has served 4  years  in a key position  that  technically outranks the post for which he  is now being considered.  This is a critical time for the United  States and for the world. Because of  the President’s vision and  commitment,  democracy  is  on  the march  around the globe.  In January, Iraq held its first truly  free elections. Revolution has swept  the Ukraine, Georgia, and Lebanon.

536,129,2005-05-26,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, this Sunday the people of Lebanon will go to  the polls to vote in their first truly  free election in three decades. Since  1990, Lebanon has been occupied by  Syrian forces, but this spring the people of Lebanon made history. On March  8, hundreds of thousands of people descended upon Martyrs Square in Beirut, Lebanon’s  capital, and  inaugurated what has become known around  the world by people who viewed it as  the Cedar Revolution.  For 2 weeks the word spread from  city to city and to the countryside. It  was clear that  freedom was on the  march. On March 18, 10 days later, a  crowd of 1.5 million people, nearly half  of the Lebanese population, gathered in  that very square, Martyrs Square, to  demand, to insist upon, the withdrawal  of Syrian troops and its intelligence  apparatus from Lebanon.  These brave and proud citizens of all  ages, religions, and ethnicities stood  shoulder to shoulder waving their nation’s flag in solidarity. Together, with  the support of freedom-loving democracies everywhere, they brought an end  to Syrian occupation. In less than 2  months, 20,000 Syrian troops pulled out  of the country. It was an astonishing  wave of events broadcast on television  sets and computer screens around the  globe.  Lebanon now joins the list of fledgling democracies taking their first bold  steps into the future. All of this could  not have happened without tremendous  courage on the part of the Lebanese  people. The determination and vision  of one man, President Bush, made it  possible. His commitment to democracy and unwavering belief in the fundamental equality of all human beings  has wrought remarkable change indirectly, such as in Lebanon, and more  directly around the world. Democracy  is taking root in even the most inhospitable of lands.  By America’s words and our deeds,  we are emboldening those who seek  freedom and peace. It is an unprecedented moment in the history of the  Middle East.  I  realized  that  yesterday  as  the  President of the Palestinian Authority,  Mahmoud Abbas, was in our office in  this Nation’s Capitol. We discussed the  future and the hope and the opportunity. As noted scholar and Middle  East expert Fouad Ajami says:  The entrenched systems of control in the  Arab world are beginning to give way.  Indeed, it is the autumn of the dictators.  I mention Lebanon in part because it  has been on my mind the last 4 weeks.  It was about 4 weeks ago that I and a  delegation had  the opportunity,  the  privilege, of traveling to Lebanon during our April recess. While in Beirut, I  had the opportunity to walk through  that square, Martyrs Square.  I met  with leaders of the Cedar Revolution.  They represented a diversity of parties  and religious sects—Christian, Druze,  and Muslim. These leaders were well  versed in the requirements for a successfully  functioning  democracy.  In  particular, they discussed the needs to  restore  transparency  and  accountability, the rule of law, to secure an  independent judiciary and to build, to  construct, to reconstruct their economy so that the Lebanese people maintain a stake in the future. Their commitment to freedom, to the rule of law,  and democratic governance was truly  inspiring.  There are many challenges ahead. We  share the concern that Syrian intelligence officials have not fully withdrawn  from Lebanon. We also know  that  this election will not,  in any  shape or form, be perfect. Few elections in times of transition are. But  seeing firsthand the determination of  the Lebanese people was truly inspiring. I came away optimistic that this  moment will lead to a new age of freedom and democracy for the Lebanese  people.  In the words of Vaclav Havel, I urge  the people of the region:  to never forget these days full of solidarity,  hope and common quest  for  freedom and  truth.  To the Lebanese people:  It may be a long and difficult road, but  please have faith that the destination is well  worth the journey.  SENATOR AND ERMA BYRD’s 68TH  WEDDING ANNIVERSARY  ",2005
537,129,2005-05-26,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, on another issue, an issue that was discussed  by several of my colleagues, most notably Senator STEVENS, our distinguished  colleague from Alaska, the President  pro tempore, I rise to honor now a very  special day in the life of one of our  most  respected  and  venerable  colleagues.  On Sunday, the distinguished senior  Senator, ROBERTBYRD, celebrates his  68th wedding anniversary with his beloved wife and high school sweetheart  Erma Ora James.  The courtship is well known to our  colleagues. It is hard to do it full justice, but I will give it a try. The two  met in Raleigh County over 7 decades  ago, where Erma’s  father had been  transferred from Virginia to work in  the coal mines. Senator BYRD had a  friend who brought pocketfuls of gum  and candy to school, and each day the  young ROBERTBYRDwould wait at the  schoolhouse door and ask his friend for  a few pieces of candy. He put them in  his pocket and at the first opportunity  he would present the candies to Erma  as a love offering.  Senator BYRDhas said he wasn’t really sure if his Erma knew that she was  his  sweetheart, but  she must have  found out because  the  couple ultimately was married in 1937. The day  after their wedding, Senator BYRDgave  his new bride his wallet which contained  several hundred dollars  that,  over the days and weeks and months,  he had saved. He told her that she  would be the head of their family finances forever. To this day, Senator  BYRDdoesn’t carry a wallet.  He has said that Erma has been his  anchor all these years. They are truly  blessed to have one another, their family, and a lifetime of shared memories.  The Bible says:  A man will leave his father and mother,  and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.  For nearly 7 decades, Senator BYRD  and his lovely wife Erma have lived up  to the ideal of marriage. I commend  them. I admire them. And I wish them  both a very happy 68th anniversary.

Since it is such a valuable document,  it  is  important  that  this  letter be  printed in the RECORDso that all people have access to it. Mr. President, I  ask unanimous consent that the letter  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  Record, as follows:  FEBRUARY14, 2005.  Hon. CHARLESE. GRASSLEY,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEARSENATORGRASSLEY: Thank you for  distributing a copy of the letter from the Office of Legislative Affairs with the summary  sheet on the medical debt findings from the  U.S. Trustee Program. Because each of us  has devoted some years of scholarly research  to the questions about families in financial  trouble because of medical debts, we have  been asked to review this letter. We know  that you are deeply concerned about the  families who file for bankruptcy in the aftermath of a serious medical problem, and we  are glad to help in any way we can. We are  are  also very glad that you have encouraged the  U.S. Trustee Program to produce additional  data related to this issue. Like earlier studies that also used petition and schedule data  to explore the role of medical debt in bankruptcy, these data provide further evidence  of the large number of families that are facing  financial collapse  following a serious  medical problem. Because of limitations in  the data used, however, these findings also  significantly underreport both the breadth  and impact of medical bankruptcies.  The U.S. Trustee sample is limited only to  Chapter 7 cases. In part because of time lost  from work due to illness, accidents and layoffs, on average, these families have an annual median income of about $19,000. This  means that the average medical debt identified by the U.S. Trustee (average $5000 for  those with medical debt) is quite substantial  for many families trying to cope with medical problems. Earlier reports from the U.S.  Trustee’s Chapter 7 data and  independent  studies are consistent with the finding that  debts owed directly to medical providers appear in a significant portion of the sampled  cases and that the amounts can be quite substantial.  As helpful as these data may be, however,  we are reminded that they document only a  small portion of the financial difficulties facing families in the aftermath of serious medical problems. As early as 1991, researchers  recognized that they could not rely on petition and schedule listings to determine the  amount of medical debt families incurred.  Petition data, like the kind used by the Office of the U.S. Trustee, exclude:  Prescription  medications,  which  charged on credit cards  Doctors visits, rehabilitation treatments,  and other services charged on credit cards  Medical supplies, crutches; needles, and  the like that are charged on credit cards  Hospital bills that are charged on credit  cards  Second mortgages that people have put on  their homes to pay off hospital bills and  other medical expenses  Cash advances, bank overdrafts and payday  loans that people have incurred to pay for  medical services when they are delivered or  to pay off medical bills that are outstanding  Third party specialty lenders that some  hospitals now steer their patients toward  when those patients are unable to pay  In addition, in our extensive work with  court records we have observed that even  very sophisticated debtors do not always list  the original creditor on an account. Studies  are finding high rates of debt collector usage  among medical providers, and some collectors may have received assignment of the  debt. The petition data, however, necessarily  conceal:  Medical debts assigned to collectors that  may be listed under the collectors’ or the  collecting attorneys’ names, which may bear  no medical reference whatsoever.  Medical debts  for which the debtor has  been sued and an attorney is now attempting  to collect,  for which the debtor  lists the  name of the attorney  The petition data also exclude other expenses that bear down on the families, including:  Medical expenses that families struggled  to pay off, bankrupting themselves in the  process by getting behind in mortgage, car  payments, and other necessary expenses.  Direct but non-medical expenses of illness  or injury, suh as the labor and material costs  of building a ramp onto a home to make it  wheelchair accessible, or the travel costs associated with transporting a critically  ill  child to a specialty facility.  Debts owed to providers that patients and  their families omit from schedules (and thus  generally are not discharged) out of fear of  losing medical care.  Lost income of a sick person (or a caregiver), which may be a major factor in medical-related bankruptcy.  Debts for Chapter 13 filers, who were omitted from the U.S. Trustee report, but who  also have reported a high rate of medical-related bankruptcy.  The petition data also omit data about  some of  the most pressing questions  in  health care policy debates. Petition data do  not capture systematic information on insurance status, which is relevant to understanding the range of  families at risk of  health-related  financial disaster  including  but not limited to bankruptcy. Similarly, petition data have no information on the diagnoses of the ill or injured people and the  types of care and drugs they need, all of  which are relevant to recognizing the magnitude of the problem.  Because the petition data provide so little  information about medical bankruptcy, experienced empirical researchers in this field  have come to realize surveying the debtors  themselves  is crucial to getting accurate  data. The 2001 Consumer Bankruptcy Project  study is the most extensive study to date on  this issue. It used written questionnaires,  court filing data, and detailed follow-up telephone interviews, a combination that offers  a much richer understanding of how medical  problems affect family finances. The survey  instruments were designed to capture more  accurately the direct costs of care by asking  questions about medical debts within the  prior two years of  filing, or since  illness  onset, rather than being focused exclusively  on what bills are identifiable as of the date  of the bankruptcy petition.  When Mr. Moschella listed all the factors  considered in the study recently reported in  Health Affairs, describing it as using ‘‘very  broad definitions’’ to describe medical bankruptcies, he did not make it clear that we reported the range of results that reflected inclusion or exclusion of various factors. He  thus gave the impression we lumped them all  together as ‘‘medical bankruptcies.’’ In fact,  to accommodate the variety in the ways a  ‘‘medical bankruptcy’’ might be defined, the  recent Health Affairs paper reports a range  from 46.2% to 54.5%—for the estimated percentage of bankruptcy  filers affected by  medical problems based on the 2001 study.  The calculations of those numbers are explained in detail, and information is available to make other combinations. As the  data  from additional  rounds of  follow-up  telephone interviews are analyzed, we will be  able to offer an even more in-depth picture of  these families’ financial circumstances and  the role of illness or injury.  Again, we extend our thanks to you for encouraging  the  development  of  additional  data relevant to medical-related bankruptcy.  We are prepared to assist your office in any  way to evaluate these data or to consider  policy changes to help  families that currently are devastated financially by serious  acute or chronic medical problems in their  households.

Both men have been honored this  year for their unwavering dedication to  our country.  Eric, a Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic in  the South Dakota Army Guard’s 235th  Military Police Company from Custer,  has been named Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year.  Daniel, an Army Bandsman with the  South Dakota Army Guard’s  147th  Army Band from Mitchell, was named  Soldier of the year.  Eric and Daniel will be recognized in  Washington, DC  two  of  the  Outstanding Soldiers and Airmen of the  Year for the National Guard.

544,143,2005-05-26,Mr. BUNNING.," Mr. President, I pay  tribute and congratulate Mr. Matth  Toebben of Northern Kentucky, who  was recently honored with one of the  ‘‘Movers and Shakers’’ awards for the  Greater Cincinnati area. Mr. Toebben’s  life accomplishments and dedication to  Commonwealth  of  Kentucky  have  given me reason to be proud.  I believe Mr. Toebben to be the embodiment  of  the American Dream.  After immigrating to the United States  from Borger, Germany  in  1953 with  only $10 to his name, he used all of his  money to buy a train ticket to Cincinnati. Upon arrival in the area, Mr.  Toebben took up not only one job, but  two jobs as a carpenter for a Ft. Wright  home builder  in Northern Kentucky.  He worked both night and day saving  as much money as he  could. This  quickly paid off and by 1955, only 2  years after his arrival to the United  States, Mr. Toebben started his own  business, Toebben Builders and Developers.  The ‘‘Movers and Shakers’’ award of  Northern Kentucky is an annual award  presented to honor those within the  Greater Cincinnati region who stand as  an example for all. It is presented by  the Kentucky Enquirer, the Sales and  Marketing Council of Northern Kentucky, The Home Builders Association  of Northern Kentucky and The Kentucky Post.  As a Senator from Kentucky, I commend Mr. Toebben for his hard work  and dedication.  I hope that he will  serve as an inspiration to the citizens  of Kentucky.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  which were referred to the appropriate  committees.

545,157,2005-05-26,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to introduce the Pet Animal  Welfare Statute of 2005 (PAWS). The  introduction of this important animal  welfare  legislation demonstrates my  continued  interest  in humane treatment of animals. As the proud owner of  a German Shepherd, it is disturbing to  see the number of high volume breeders  who are careless and disregard their responsibilities to care properly for their  animals.  Across the United States, there are  more than 3,000 commercial dog-breeding facilities that are licensed to operate by the United States Department  of Agriculture (USDA). Owners of these  facilities are required to comply with  the rules and regulations of the Animal  Welfare Act (AWA), which sets forth  standards  for humane handling and  treatment. USDA inspections are also  required  to  ensure  compliance with  AWA standards.  Unfortunately, enforcement of AWA  has not effectively stopped the inhumane treatment of animals within the  pet industry. Because the AWA only  covers breeders and others who sell at  wholesale, many puppy mill owners  have  successfully  avoided AWA  requirements by selling directly to the  public. The ability to use the Internet  as a marketing tool for direct sales has  only made selling directly to the public  more prevalent and popular. Because  USDA can only regulate wholesalers  under the AWA, it has very limited authority to oversee the care and conditions of animals in these facilities.  PAWS addresses this growing problem. PAWS would  regulate breeders  who raise seven or more litters of dogs  or cats each year. This threshold test  would differentiate those breeders who  raise animals in mass numbers from  those who are hobby breeders.  In addition, this broad ranging legislation would cover importers and other  non-breeder dealers who sell more than  25 dogs or cats per year, strengthen  USDA’s enforcement authority, and assure USDA access to source records of  persons who acquire dogs for resale. Finally, PAWS expands the USDA’s authority to seek injunctions against unlicensed dog and cat dealers.  The term ‘‘puppy mill’’ is not new to  many people, be it pet owners, consumers, animal welfare advocates, inspectors  or  just  casual  observers.  Puppy mills are large breeding operations that mass-produce puppies for  commercial sale with little regard for  the humane handling and treatment of  the dogs. Breeding and raising dogs  without respect to the animal’s welfare  guarantees bad results for the unknowing owner, and for the health of the dog  and her puppies. For dogs, puppy mill  conditions  can  mean  overcrowded  cages, lack of protection from weather  conditions, and an overall lack of veterinary care.  The benefits of regulating commercial breeders and sellers are obvious.  PAWS addresses the commerce in pets  from many different angles, including  imports, large direct sellers, Internet  sellers, enforcement tools, and source  records. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and Chairman of  the Subcommittee on Research, Nutrition and General Legislation, the subcommittee with jurisdiction, I am prepared to work aggressively to advance  this legislation. I urge my colleagues  to join Senator DURBINand me in supporting this legislation.  ",2005
546,157,2005-05-26,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  introduce  the Pet Animal  Welfare Statute, PAWS, along with my  colleague, Senator SANTORUM.  For more than three decades, Congress has given the responsibility of ensuring minimum standards of humane  care and treatment of animals to the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture,  USDA, under the Animal Welfare Act,  AWA.  The current guidelines within  the  AWA do not go far enough to protect  puppies at  large breeding  facilities;  they merely ensure the provision of  water and food, and that is inadequate.  The AWA has been largely ineffective  because of weak enforcement procedures and limited resources. Another  severe limitation of the current AWA  is that it does not regulate overseas  breeders who submit their animals to  deplorable conditions before exporting  them  to  the United States,  leaving  many imported animals with diseases  and  behavioral  disorders.  PAWS  strengthens the AWA to better control  the practices of puppy breeding in large  facilities, addresses cruel puppy treatment and places stricter regulations on  overseas breeders.  In large breeding facilities, puppies  are often kept in cramped, dirty cages;  sometimes  stacked  on  top  of  each  other; exposed to the elements in extreme cold and heat; forced to breed  too  frequently; and deprived of adequate food, water, veterinary care, and  any semblance of  loving contact. In  fact, current law allows many of these  breeders to evade all federal oversight.  This inhumane treatment has a direct bearing on the physical and mental health of dogs in these facilities.  Often, after these puppies join a family,  they  turn out  to have  serious  health and behavioral problems that  cause them pain, cause their owners  great distress, and require expensive  medical care.  I believe PAWS will address these  problems by filling gaps in the current  law and encouraging stronger enforcement by USDA  to  crack down on  chronic violators. The bill also applies  to cats.  PAWS requires that any commercial  hreeder who sells seven or more litters  of dogs or cats directly to the public in  a year must be licensed by the USDA.  The statute also allows the USDA to  obtain the identity of breeders, a measure that would help the USDA to address inhumane treatment. PAWS extends the suspension period for facilities with AWA violations from 21 days  to 60 days and provides the USDA with  direct authority to apply for injunctions.  I’ve heard from many of my constituents  in Illinois who are deeply concerned about the puppy mill problem  and want  this  legislation  enacted.  PAWS is supported by national organizations, including the Humane Society  of the United States, the American  Kennel  Club,  Doris  Day  Animal  League, and the Animal Welfare Institute.  I am pleased that we have obtained  additional funds for USDA to improve  its enforcement of the AWA. This piece  of  legislation will complement those  ongoing  efforts  by  strengthening  USDA’s authority to crack down on the  bad actors.  PAWS will ensure that any commercial dog breeder licensed by the Federal Government is meeting basic humane standards of care. We owe at  least this much to the animals that  have  earned  the  title  ‘‘man’s  best  friend.’’ This safety net for dogs and  cats will protect pets and the consumers who care about them against  the poor treatment practices of the  worst dealers: the ones who provide no  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:24 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S26MY5.REC S26MY5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005
547,164,2005-05-26,Mr. SMITH.," Mr. President, as I have  done so many times before, I rise today  to speak about the need for hate crimes  legislation and to introduce the Local  Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of  2005. I first sponsored this bill with my  colleague, Senator KENNEDY,  in  1999  and again in 2001 and 2003.  In the Senate, this legislation passed  as an amendment to the Commerce,  Justice, State appropriations bill  in  1999 and the Defense Department authorization bill in 2000 and 2004, but removed in conference in each case. In  2003, it was introduced as an amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, but did not pass due to a  procedural vote. Clearly, hate crimes  legislation has strong support in the  Senate.  Senator KENNEDYand I are reintroducing this bill again today because  the need for Federal hate crimes legislation is greater than ever. The high  prevalence  of hate  crimes  is  staggering. Every day  there  is another  America that is attacked or even murdered in an act solely motivated by  hate.  Hate crimes tear at the very fabric of  our Nation  by  intimidating  entire  groups of Americans and creating fear  across communities. No one in America  should be victimized because of who  they are, how they look, or what religion they worship. And the Federal  Government should be able to come to  the aid of those who have been wronged  and protect victims.  Since 1969, Federal law has permitted  prosecution of hate crimes motivated  by race, religion, national origin, or  color, if the victim was engaging in one  of six ‘‘Federally protected’’ activities.  It has become clear that the statue  needs to be amended—and that is what  our  legislation does. Our  legislation  would expand on current laws to encompass sexual orientation, gender and  disability.  It would  enable Federal  prosecutors  to  pursue  hate  crimes  cases where  local  authorities  often  lack the resources or the ability to  prosecute such crimes.  Nobel laureate Eli Wiesel once said:  ‘‘To hate is to deny another person’s  humanity.’’ As a Nation that serves as  the beacon of justice, freedom and liberty everywhere, we simply cannot tolerate violence against our own citizens  based on their race, color, religion, or  national origin. No matter how far the  United  States  has  come  and  the  progress we have made in protecting  American’s civil rights, much work remains. We cannot fight terror abroad  and bow down to terror at home.  This legislation is a symbol that can  become substance. As I have often said,  the law is a teacher, and we should  teach our fellow Americans that bigotry will not be tolerated. Our government must have the ability to persuade,  to pursue, and  to prosecute  when hate is the motive of violence  against another American, no matter  their race, sexual orientation, religion,  disability, or gender. By changing the  law,  I  truly believe we can change  hearts and minds as well.  I urge my colleagues to help me to  change the hearts and minds and to  make it widely known that we live in a  society and a country that does not  tolerate those who impose on the civil  rights of others simply because they  are different.  This year, Congress needs to act. I  look forward to President Bush signing  this legislation into law.  By Mrs. BOXER:  S. 1146. A bill to require the Federal  Trade Commission to monitor and investigate gasoline prices under certain  circumstances; to the Committee on  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation.  ",2005
548,164,2005-05-26,Mrs.  BOXER.," Mr.  President,  in  March 2000, I introduced legislation to  deal with the high price of gasoline. At  the time, the price of gasoline had  reached a startlingly high $2.15 per gallon  in  California.  Today,  gasoline  prices on average in California are $2.43  per gallon, 13 percent higher. The problem is getting worse, not better, and so  today I am reintroducing my bill to  control the manipulation of gasoline  prices.  We have heard that higher gasoline  prices are due solely to higher crude oil  prices. I just do not buy it.  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, from January  17 through April 11, the cost of crude  oil rose 10.8 percent. During the same  time period, the average retail price of  gasoline in the United States rose 24.9  percent. Something is not right.  Look at the profits that are being  pocketed by  the big oil companies.  Compared to the same time last year,  oil companies’ first-quarter profits are  dramatically higher.  Look at the number of mergers and  acquisitions in the industry over the  past  several months. The continued  consolidation only reduces competition  and increases energy costs.

549,178,2005-05-26,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce the Acadia National  Park Improvement Act of 2005. This  legislation takes  important steps to  ensure the long-term health of one of  America’s most beloved national parks.  It would increase the land acquisition  ceiling at Acadia by $10 million; facilitate an off-site  intermodal transportation center for the Island Explorer  bus system; and extend the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission.  In 1986, Congress enacted legislation  designating the boundary of Acadia National Park. However, many private  lands were contained within the permanent  authorized  boundary. Congress  authorized the Park to spend $9.1 million to acquire those lands from willing  sellers only. While all of that money  has now been spent, rising land prices  have prevented the money from going  as far as Congress originally intended.  There are over 100 private tracts left  within  the  official  park  boundary.  Nearly 20 of these tracts are currently  available from willing sellers, but the  park does not have the funds to purchase them. My legislation would authorize an additional $10 million to  help acquire these lands. Since these  lands already fall within the congressionally authorized boundary, this effort would ‘‘fill in the holes’’ at Acadia,  rather than enlarging the park.  My legislation will also facilitate the  development of an  intermodal transportation center as part of the Island  Explorer bus system. The Island Explorer has been extremely successful  over its first 5 years. These low-emission  propane-powered  vehicles  have  carried more than 1.5 million riders  since 1999. In doing so, they removed  424,000 vehicles from the park and reduced pollution by 24 tons.  Unfortunately, the system  lacks a  central parking and bus boarding area.  As a result, day use visitors do not  have ready access to the Island Explorer. My legislation would authorize  the Secretary of the Interior to provide  assistance in the planning, construction, and operation of an intermodal  transportation center in Trenton, ME.  This center will  include parking  for  day users, a visitor orientation facility  highlighting park and regional points  of interest, a bus boarding area, and a  bus maintenance garage. This center,  which will be built in partnership with  the Federal Highway Administration,  U.S. Department  of Transportation,  Maine Department of Transportation,  and other partners, will reduce traffic  congestion,  preserve  park  resources  and the visitor experience, and ensure  a vibrant tourist economy.  Finally, my legislation would extend  the 16-member Acadia National Park  Advisory Commission for an additional  20-year period. This commission was  created by Congress in 1986 and is currently due to expire in 2006. That would  be a mistake. The commission consists  of three Federal representatives, three  State representatives, four representatives from local towns on Mount Desert  Island, three from adjacent mainland  communities, and three from adjacent  offshore islands. These representatives  have provided invaluable advice relating to the management and development of the Park. The commission has  proven its worth many times over and  deserves to be extended for an additional 20 years.  Acadia National Park is a true gem  of the Maine coastline. The park is one  of Maine’s most popular tourist destinations, with nearly 3 million visitors every year. While unsurpassed in  beauty, the park’s ecosystem is also  very fragile. Unless we are careful, we  risk substantial harm to the very place  that Mainers and Americans hold so  dear.  In 11 years, Acadia will be 100 years  old. Age has brought both increasing  popularity and greater pressures. By  providing an extra $10 million to protect  sensitive  lands,  expanding  the  highly  successful  Island  Explorer  transportation system, and extending  the Acadia National Park Advisory  Commission, this legislation will help  make the park stronger and healthier  than ever on the occasion of its centennial anniversary.

562,206,2005-05-26,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr.  HUNTER, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, for including my amendment  in the en bloc package.  It is the intent of Congress and in the interest of national security  that we maintain a  strong and healthy industrial base if we are to  remain  the strongest nation on Earth. Even  the founder of modern-day capitalism and free  trade, Adam Smith, recognized the need for a  nation to be able to depend upon its own industrial and agricultural base and not rely on  foreign sources  for  its defense needs. We  cannot maintain our role as global leader on a  pure services-based economy.  This amendment strengthens the Buy American Act, BAA, by restoring the original intent  that more than 50 percent of the components  in end products purchased by the Department  of Defense shall be mined, produced, or manufactured inside the United States.  The Buy American Act originally passed  Congress during  the Great Depression. The  intent of Congress was that to qualify under  the Buy American Act, a company had to have  substantially all of a product made, grown, or  mined in the United States. However, regulations implementing the Buy American Act have  subsequently  redefined  ‘‘substantially all’’  to  mean simply greater than 50 percent.  Yet even  that  regulation has been weakened even further over the years. The Pentagon has used the ‘‘public interest’’ exception  to waive  the Buy American Act  to  treat  the  purchase of some  foreign goods as  if  they  were made in America. The original intent of  the Buy American Act has been undermined  by procurement memoranda of understanding,  MOU, and other agreements with various foreign countries that permit the substitution of  foreign components  for components mined,  produced, or manufactured inside the United  States. These are not treaties or trade agreements approved by Congress—these were Executive Branch agreements not subject to review by Congress.  Thus, the Buy American laws are basically  worthless. There are so many holes in the law  that it means nothing when a company says  they comply with the Buy American Act. The  exception—and it’s a big one—is that the domestic content requirement doesn’t have to be  met if the items are procured from certain designated countries.  The Pentagon has MOUs with 21 developed  countries that waive the Buy American Act because  the Defense Department has determined that, for these countries, complying with  the BAA is ‘‘inconsistent with the public interest.’’ Basically, a company getting an award  from the Pentagon can claim compliance with  the Buy American Act without having to actually make anything here, as long as the components come from one of the 21 countries.  Too often, agencies claim  they need  the  best  for  the  least,  implying  that Americans  can’t make the best or compete on price and  quality. But ‘‘best value’’ is the standard, which  means price shouldn’t be the reigning factor.  The best value  for Americans  is  to have a  strong industrial base and we can’t do that if  DOD  forces U.S. companies  to compete on  price with foreign companies that are owned,  subsidized, or controlled by their governments.  It is important to remember that this amendment does not increase the share of the Buy  American content, but simply codifies the content percentage of what is in existing regulation.  f  HEROES EARNED RETIREMENT  OPPORTUNITIES ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 23, 2005  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would  like to express my support for H.R. 1499, the  Heroes Retirement Opportunities Act. This important  legislation allows military personnel  serving combat zones to deduct contributions  to their individual retirement plans.  The brave men and women of the United  States armed forces risk their lives to defend  our freedom and to continue the war on terror.  These outstanding individuals are called upon  to be stronger, braver, and tougher than they  ever thought possible.  It is our duty to reward the men and women  who risk their lives for our country, and the  Heroes Retirement Opportunities Act accomplishes that goal. This bill will protect as much  of their pay for the future as possible.  I know first hand the sacrifices our service  men and women make. My husband retired  1st Lieutenant Dexter Lehtinen, was wounded  in the Vietnam War by a grenade that almost  took his  life. Soon my stepson, Aviator 1st  Lieutenant Douglas Lehtinen, is preparing to  deploy to Iraq. I am certain that he will meet  individuals who,  like his  father, have paid a  tremendous price to uphold our ideals of freedom and democracy. By passing the Heroes  Retirement Opportunities Act, we can do our  part to assure a more certain future for those  who risk their lives to protect ours.  To all the brave men and women who have  served  and  now  serve  in  our  armed  forces . . .  Thank you, on behalf of a grateful Nation.  f  TOM WOOD: LABOR LEADER OF  THE YEAR!  HON. BOB FILNER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 26, 2005  ",2005
563,206,2005-05-26,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker, today I acknowledge a great  friend of  labor, Tom Wood—  named the ‘‘Labor Leader of the Year’’ by the  San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council,  AFL–CIO.  Tom began his career as a Distribution  Clerk with the United States Postal Service as  a member of  the American Postal Workers  Union (APWU—Local 197)  in January 1972.  Within six months, he became a Shop Steward  and  started  representing  employees’  rights. He noticed that other employees needed representation because they were too shy  to represent themselves; he then became involved in assuring that employees would be  treated fairly and justly.  In 1974, Tom was elected as Clerk Craft Director and subsequently has represented the  APWU in several capacities since: Secretary-  Treasurer, Executive Vice President and as  the President of his Local Union since 1990.  He has been the APWU chief negotiator for all  local contracts for San Diego represented employees, and has made it a point to see that  all postal managers treat employees with dignity and respect. Tom has established a reputation of vigorously  representing his members, while still being responsive to the needs  of  the employer and  their constant struggle  with the ‘‘budget.’’  Tom has served as a member of the Board  of Directors on the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council  for  the  last  fifteen years  and as President since 2004. Several years  ago, under his leadership, the APWU began  looking with other labor unions in town to buy  their own property, and became partners with  the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council, AFSCME, HERE, CWA and IATSE in Mission Valley’s United Labor Center.  Congratulations Tom Wood, on your  ognition as ‘‘Labor Leader of the Year’’!  recf  HONORING THE LIFE OF  SERGEANT JACOB SIMPSON  HON.

564,206,2005-05-26,Ms. HOOLEY.," Mr. Speaker, let us recognize  the life and praise the sacrifice of an American  Hero.  Just a few days ago, Sergeant Jacob Simpson was killed in action during a reconnaissance patrol in Iraq.  Jacob died as he lived—helping the people  of Tikrit in their efforts to secure a peace, and  realize their aspirations for a democratic society. Oregon mourns his passing. As a society  we have too few of his character; we will all  feel his loss for years to come.

565,213,2005-05-26,Mr. PAYNE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize and pay tribute to one of this country’s great civil rights  leaders, Rev. John H.  Scott. On May 7, I had the opportunity to attend a tribute to Rev. Scott, honoring the 25th  Anniversary Celebration of the John H. Scott  Memorial Fund in Tallulah, Louisiana. This living memorial was started at  the  request of  Rev. Scott at the end of his life, and now provides scholarships to young people, as well as  supporting other projects  that advance  the  aims and ideals of the Reverend’s life.  Rev. Scott was a minister and a civil rights  leader who was devoted  to  improving  the  quality of  life  for African-Americans  in  this  country. He was born in 1901, in a small, almost all-black parish in Louisiana, where black  schools, businesses, and neighborhoods were  thriving, but existed  in almost  total  isolation  from their white neighbors. He came to see  that this seeming independence was not commensurate with equality, and he dedicated his  life to the pursuit of that equality for all people,  of all color, in all places.  He was a farmer, as well as a pastor for  twenty-five  years,  president  of  the  local  NAACP for thirty-three years, and chairman of  the East Carroll Ministerial Alliance  for  five,  while still finding time to make regular visits to  hospitals, senior citizens’ homes, and prisons.  His  twenty-five year struggle  for  full voting  rights for African-Americans is an exemplar of  how individual people can indeed change the  world. Armed with a passion  for  justice and  ready  to  fight no matter what  the cost, his  local, grassroots efforts became a national  movement that ultimately convinced Attorney  General Robert Kennedy to join his crusade  for equality for all. Despite growing up under  the oppressive injustice of Jim Crow laws, and  knowing the risks it presented to his own life  and  the  lives of his  friends, neighbors, and  family members, he was unfaltering  in his  quest for progress.  His book, Witness to the Truth, which was  compiled by his daughter, Cleo Scott Brown,  is a collection of his writings and transcripts of  his interviews; and I recommend it to all who  wish to know more about the history of race  relations in this country. We must understand  the truth about our past struggles if we are ultimately to see success, because, in the words  of Rev. Scott, ‘‘So much of what we will become depends on how we start.’’ And Rev.  Scott helped us start well. His life is a testament  to  the  tenacity and courage  that daily  fortified our civil rights leaders and sustained  them in their struggle to ensure human rights  for every person, regardless of race, gender,  or economic circumstance.  We all owe a debt of gratitude to Rev. John  H. Scott, and I acknowledge my own indebtedness here today. He once wrote, ‘‘History is of  little value unless it inspires one to greater endeavors, or serves to guide against the mistakes of the past.’’ As the first African-American elected to this great body from my State,  I know that I have been inspired to greater endeavors by people like Rev. Scott, whose lives  paved the way for my accomplishments.  I’d also  like  to  thank Dr. Elsie Scott  for  bringing  this extraordinary Foundation  to my  attention and to commend the other Scott family members  including Jewel Scott, Johnita  Scott, and Louis G. Scott.  Mr. Speaker,  I wish  today  to honor  the  memory of Rev. John H. Scott, and  I know  that all of my colleagues here join me in paying tribute to this man of uncommon distinction  who history will remember as a great warrior  in the struggle for civil rights.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF MR. HUGH  FERGUSON  HON. JOE KNOLLENBERG  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 26, 2005  ",2005
566,213,2005-05-26,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Mr. Speaker, one of  our Nation’s greatest assets is our veterans.  When I look around this chamber and see the  reflection of our democracy, I can’t help but  think of those who fought to ensure our safety,  our strength, and our freedom.  I rise today to recognize an honored veteran  and an extraordinary American, Mr. Hugh Ferguson.  Those who study World War II are aware  that the United States was at war with Japan  for three months after Germany surrendered.  The end of the war with Japan came only after  President Harry S Truman made  the brave  and difficult decision to use the atomic bomb.  On August 9, 1945, Mr. Hugh Ferguson was  piloting the B–29 bomber plane that dropped  the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. This  mission required bravery, faith, and discipline  in order to see it through. Mr. Ferguson was  just a mere  twenty-two years old when his  country employed his piloting skills to end the  battle and forever change the make-up of the  world.  As Mr. Ferguson will tell you, he and his fellow pilots knew  their acts would end World  War  II and save hundreds of  thousands of  American lives. This knowledge made it clear  to Mr. Ferguson what his mission was and  that his success was necessary—even at its  great cost.  It takes a brave and faithful man to carry out  the missions of the United States military. It  takes an even braver man to test history with  the new technology that was the atomic bomb.  Yet, Mr. Ferguson’s bravery did not stop there.  Years later, he again answered the military’s  call of duty. Mr. Ferguson flew the only plane  on site when the United States detonated the  world’s first hydrogen bomb on Eniwetok Atoll.  Not knowing the consequences of this flight,  he and his  crew bravely documented  the  power of the hydrogen bomb for United States  officials.  This year marks Mr. Ferguson’s 82nd birthday. I wish to congratulate and honor him for  his service to this country in the face of war.  As a member of Congress, as a proud citizen  of the United States, and as a person who enjoys the freedom this great Nation offers, I officially recognize Mr. Hugh Ferguson.  IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF DR.  JEFFREY CHARLES KELLER ON  THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT  AFTER  THIRTY-THREE  YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE DUBLIN CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT  HON. PAUL E. GILLMOR  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 26, 2005  ",2005
567,213,2005-05-26,Mr. GILLMOR.," Mr. Speaker, it is my great  pleasure to pay special tribute to one of Ohio’s  finest educators. After  thirty-three years, Dr.  Jeffrey C. Keller is retiring from the Dublin City  School District. Dr. Keller, who for three decades has directed  the Dublin Coffman High  School instrumental music program, has been  a leader in education and an inspiration to the  community.  Raised in Prospect, Ohio, Dr. Keller began  his career at Dublin High School in 1972, after  earning his bachelor’s degree from The Ohio  State University. After three years, Dr. Keller  returned to The Ohio State University where  he earned his Masters and Doctoral degrees.  After his graduate education, Dr. Keller  returned  to Dublin as director of music education, a position he has held ever since.  For more than 30 years, bands under Dr.  Keller’s direction have enjoyed a superior reputation in the State of Ohio. He has shared  countless hours developing the talents and enjoyment of music in each of his students. For  his efforts, Dr. Keller was recognized with the  2002 Ohio Music Educators’ Association’s  Ohio Music Educator of  the Year Award.  In  addition, Dr. Keller has been recognized by  Capital University and Prescott High School in  Arizona  for his education and performance  clinics. Dr. Keller was also awarded The  School of Music Society of Alumni and Friends  Award by his alma mater, The Ohio State University, for excellence in teaching in the music  education division.  Beyond his deep commitment  to  the students of Dublin Coffman High School, Dr. Keller has also given greatly of himself  to  the  community. As a result of his efforts as a community leader, Dr. Keller has been a recipient  of  the Dublin A.M. Rotary Signature Award,  the Dublin Jaycees Golden Shamrock Award  and the ‘‘God and Country’’ Music Award from  the Greater Columbus Area Salvation Army.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in paying special tribute to Dr. Jeffrey C. Keller  in recognition of his superlative service to the  students, parents and  friends of  the Dublin  Coffman Music Education Program. On behalf  of the people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am  proud  to  recognize  his many  accomplishments. We wish Jeff, his wife Gail, and their  daughter Kristany, all the best as we salute  one of Ohio’s finest citizens.  f  HONORING  THE  130TH  ANNIVERSARY OF SUMNER HIGH SCHOOL  HON. WM.

As our country honors our military personnel, both past and  present, this Memorial Day, I want to take this  opportunity to remember those who have sacrificed their lives for our freedom and security.  Army Specialist Miller leaves behind a legacy of honor, service, and compassion to his  family and friends. He died protecting a polling  location which allowed Iraqis the opportunity to  decide their own future.  Army Specialist Miller served as a medic  with  the United States Army and aspired  to  enter  the medical profession and work with  trauma patients. He  is  remembered  for his  commitment to the well-being of his fellow soldiers and  for his sensitivity  to  the needs of  others. In addition, he is remembered for his  love of music, and he particularly enjoyed  playing  the drums and guitar. Based on his  reputation for compassion and commitment to  the men and women he medically treated, I  have no doubt he would have been effective  in the medical field.  Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I  pay my last respects to a young man who was  so full of life; to a young man who had a full  and bright future ahead of him. I pray Army  Specialist Miller’s family and friends find peace  in their hearts, knowing his country is grateful  and humbled by his sacrifice.  I  thank our  brave men and women  in uniform  for continuing with our mission in Iraq, which is the  ultimate tribute to our fallen soldiers, marines,  sailors, and airmen.  Jimmy, to you I offer my sincere gratitude  and my solemn commitment  to continue  to  support your  friends,  the members of your  unit, and the men and women in Iraq who are  continuing without you. Thank you for seeing  a vision greater  than yourself and  for  the  strength of your commitment to our country.  God bless you.  RECOGNITION OF MILITARY FAMILY  AND  SERVICE  ORGANIZATIONS ON MEMORIAL DAY  HON. MELISSA L. BEAN  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 26, 2005  ",2005
570,220,2005-05-26,Ms. BEAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to the military family organizations and  veterans  service  organizations  that  do  so  much to support and serve the brave men and  women of our Armed Forces.  This Memorial Day, Americans gather to remember the fallen, and acknowledge the contributions of our service personnel. Because of  the contributions and sacrifices of our fellow  Americans, we are able to enjoy the freedoms  and security of this great country that we do  today. We are so fortunate to live in America,  and to be able to call these people our own.  On this day, our thoughts also turn to those  who contribute to the needs of our men and  women who wear  the uniform of  the United  States Military.  Mr. Speaker, the family members of America’s men and women in uniform have always  been one of our nation’s greatest assets, and  often our unsung heroes. Perhaps now as  much as ever, the support of our military families on the Homefront is crucial to maintaining  the spirit of our warfighters.  Now, all across the country, groups of military  families and  their neighbors are continuing to work to support their loved ones stationed overseas. As more National Guard and  Reserve units are deployed abroad, far from  their homes, many of their families have organized to send much needed gifts, messages  from schools, basic supplies difficult to come  by in Iraq or Afghanistan, or elsewhere. These  families do so generously, in addition to the  extra burdens of taking care of a family while  a parent is away, either out of love of their  family or on the part of a serviceperson they  have never met.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize the  work of our veterans service organizations.  These patriots and committed veterans who  continue to serve long after their orders have  expired are  the  living embodiment—and  the  conscience—of the American spirit. And their  service extends beyond  the military. These  groups with household names like the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars are  friendly faces in our communities. Across Illinois’ Eighth District, like countless other communities, these organizations provide leadership and guidance, they are a role model for  our children, and they are a constant reminder  of the call to—and value of—public service  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing the contributions—and sacrifices—  of our military spouses and families, and the  continuing service of members of America’s  veterans service organizations. They provide  so much, so selflessly, to strengthen our military and the values we all hold so dear. America absolutely  is  stronger—and  richer—because of their service.

571,220,2005-05-26,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, I stand today to  honor the memory of a fellow Nevadan. Mr.  Glynn Dunlap passed away at  the age of  eighty-three after bringing smiles to the faces  of small children  for  the past  twenty years.  Glynn Dunlap became well known in the Las  Vegas valley and by children across the country through his artwork and devotion to young  children plagued with  terminal  cancer and  other terminal diseases. I know that he will be  missed.  Mr. Glynn Dunlap was born  in Herculean,  Missouri, in 1922. He later moved to California  as a commercial artist and retired to Boulder  City, Nevada. Upon his retirement, he and his  wife begun working with mentally-challenged  children. Mr. Dunlap noticed the determination  and hard work in these young kids and began  making certificates of achievement  to honor  their efforts.  After giving a certificate one day in 1985 a  child approached him  for a  cartoon;  thus  began a new passion. For  the next  twenty  years Mr. Dunlap drew cartoons for any child  who asked. Shortly after he began drawing for  children, Mr. Dunlap joined forces with such  organizations as the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the Candlelighters. His son, Don  Dunlap, said he dedicated so much  time  to  those kids because it brought joy to those who  were suffering; he did it ‘‘to see a kid smile.’’  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to extend  my gratitude for Mr. Dunlap’s many contributions and to honor the wonderful memory of  this excellent  role model.  I know  that Mr.  Glynn Dunlap will be missed, but not forgotten, especially by all  the  families he helped  cope during some of the most difficult times in  their lives.  f  MOURNING THE PASSING OF  JIMMY PETTYJOHN, JR.

As our  country honors our military personnel, both  past and present, this Memorial Day, I want to  take this opportunity to remember those who  have sacrificed their lives for our freedom and  security.  Lance Corporal Prazynski leaves behind a  legacy of honor, service, and inspiration to his  family, to his friends, and to men and women  who never had a chance  to know him. His  family and friends remember him as a jovial  and compassionate man who was committed  to bringing  freedom and democracy  to  the  Iraqi people and security to the American people.  Lance Corporal Prazynski also  leaves behind a  legacy of compassion  from his work  with his handicapped classmates while attending Fairfield High School. His interest in becoming a special education teacher illustrates  his strength of character, and based on his  reputation  for being hard-working and dedicated to accomplishing his goals, I have no  doubt he would have been an effective teacher and mentor.  Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I  pay my last respects to a young man who was  so full of life; to a young man who had a full  and bright future ahead of him. I pray Lance  Corporal Prazynski’s  family and  friends  find  peace in their hearts, knowing his country is  grateful and humbled by his sacrifice. I thank  our brave men and women in uniform for continuing with our mission in Iraq, which is the  ultimate tribute to our fallen soldiers, marines,  sailors, and airmen.  Taylor, to you I offer my sincere gratitude  and my solemn commitment  to continue  to  support your  friends,  the members of your  unit, and the men and women in Iraq who are  continuing without you.

FRED UPTON  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 26, 2005  ",2005
574,227,2005-05-26,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to Civil War Veteran Elisha Johns,  who  received  the Congressional Medal of  Honor for his courage and valor as a Corporal  during  the Battle of Vicksburg, Mississippi.  This Saturday, May 28th, the Porter Township  Board and  the  folks of Union, Michigan will  honor Mr. Johns during a ceremony at his  gravesite in Plum Grove Cemetery.  Elisha enlisted with the Union Army on August 9th, 1862, with whom he served until his  discharge on June 6, 1865. After his enlistment, his leadership and courage was recognized by his superiors as he was made Corporal and promoted to Sergeant soon thereafter. His true valor was demonstrated on May  22, 1863,  the date he earned  the Congressional Medal of Honor.  It was the beginning of the Battle of Vicksburg, Mississippi and there was a call for volunteers to bridge a dike that was essential for  a Union victory. Corporal Johns was one of  150 men that felt called to duty and valiantly  set out  to construct  the bridge. Before  they  succeeded in bridging the dike, two-thirds of  Elisha’s fellow soldiers were shot and unable  to go on. However, Corporal Johns and his  peers boldly continued, while under  intense  Confederate  fire, only  to  find his supporting  soldiers had retreated. As it was early in the  day, and military support lacking, Elisha was  forced to hide along the base of the dike until  darkness fell, when he was able to successfully get back to the Union lines. Forty years  after  his  brave  act, Corporal  Johns was  awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  As we come together as a Nation this Memorial Day, we honor the heroes of yesterday  like Elisha Johns, who gave so much to our  great Nation, and to honor those brave men  and women of our armed forces who are on  the front lines today, sacrificing so much in the  name of freedom.  I commend all the folks of Union, Michigan,  who are committed to preserving the history of  our veterans, such as Corporal Johns, so generations to come will remember the sacrifices  of their forefathers that played such a vital role  in making our great Nation.  f  THE TRAGIC PASSING OF NEALE  CHANEY SLATER  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 26, 2005  ",2005
575,227,2005-05-26,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, late last month—  on April 25, 2005—the family and friends of  Neale Chaney Slater, the community of Mechanicsville, and  the State of Maryland suffered a devastating loss when this caring and  accomplished young man was struck down  just as he was preparing to enter the prime of  his life.  WhIle driving out  to help a  local  farmer,  Neale, 20 years old, was killed in a tragic two-  vehicle accident on Route 5 in Hughesville.  Yet, in such a short period of time, Neale  gave so much to so many others.  At the age of 16, Neale joined the Mechanicsville Volunteer Fire Department, and had  held  the office of assistant  secretary and  treasurer.  Neale was a Firefighter  II and  certified  emergency medical technician, and was recognized by his peers with the Mechanicsville  Volunteer Fire Department as ‘‘Rookie of the  Year’’ in 2001. He also was awarded Fire Prevention Awards in 2001 and 2002.  ‘‘He told me he was following the family tradition,’’ said Willie Wilkerson, president of the  department, noting  that Neale’s grandfather  and uncle had also been members of the department. ‘‘For such a short life, he got a lot  accomplished.’’  That, in fact, is an understatement.  Neale was a 2003 honors graduate of the  Leonard  Hall  Junior  Naval  Academy  in  Leonardstown, where he achieved the rank of  Battalion Commander in his junior and senior  years.  He also was awarded Midshipman of  the  Year in 2001, 2002, and 2003, and was also  awarded the Military Excellence, Headmaster’s  and Loyalty Awards at graduation.  Clearly, Mr. Speaker,  this was an exceptional young man—a young man who envisioned a career in public service early on.  At  the  time of his passing, Neale was a  Cadet in the Maryland State Police, which he  joined in 2003. This coming fall, he was set to  join the State Police Academy.  Without question, Neale embodied the best  this country has to offer through his dedicated  public service, his educational achievements,  and the respect he had earned from all who  knew him.  Neale was held in high regards by the community he served, and  rightly so. Colonel  Thomas E. Hutchins, Secretary of the Department of State Police, said that Neale was ‘‘a  young man with a strong work ethic who was  committed to doing his best in every mission  he undertook.’’  Mr. Speaker, the passing of one’s child, particularly one with so much to contribute to his  community, his State and his Nation  is as  painful as it is incomprehensible.  Today, I want to extend my deepest sympathies  to Neale’s parents, Eleanor Fowler  Slater and Austin Joseph Slater, Sr., as well  as all of his family members and friends.  I realize that these words are small solace.  But I hope the Slaters, in time, find some comfort  in  the  fact  that  they raised a  truly  fine  young man who will be sorely missed and  never forgotten.  The Slaters have established  the Neale  Slater Memorial Fund  in his honor at  the  Leonard Hall Junior Naval Academy  for a  graduating senior  intending  to enter  law enforcement.  I know the recipients of this scholarship will  always be  inspired by  the example set by  Neale, and the extraordinarily positive impact  he had on his community will be felt for generations to come.  f  TRIBUTE TO HEROES OF THE OREGON MOUNTAIN RIVER CHAPTER OF THE RED CROSS  HON.

These men and women set  themselves apart through selfless acts of heroism  and kindness  toward others.

577,5,2005-06-08,Mr. BOREN.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of House Concurrent  Resolution 159, which proposes to designate the week of June 12, 2005, as National Military Families Week. I want  to commend the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. BOOZMAN) and the gentlewoman  from  South  Dakota  (Ms.  HERSETH), the bill’s sponsors, for bringing this matter to the House.  Today, over 280,000 of the 1.4 million  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines  are  currently  deployed  around  the  globe; and, of those currently deployed,  more than 200,000 are serving in the  CENTCOM area of operation in support  of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom  in Afghanistan. And I am especially proud of the  men and women in uniform from my  home State of Oklahoma.  However, times have changed since  we drafted young, single service members. Compared to those earlier years,  many of today’s professional volunteer  forces are married and have families.  Today, there are approximately 700,000  spouses and more than 1.2 million dependent children between the ages of  birth and 18 years, and those numbers  continue to climb after each deployment.  A National Military Families Week  will provide an opportunity to allow  the Nation to recognize the sacrifices  not only of those who serve in uniform  but of the sacrifices that the families  make as well. Military families left behind often face a myriad of challenges  when a loved one is deployed. Fear, disappointment,  depression,  anger,  respect, admiration, joy, and pride are  just a few of the feelings that military  families face during those months of  separation. Many children will be born  while a parent is deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. Tragically, some of them  will  never know  their  parent who  served in uniform.  More so than ever, military families  are facing birthdays, they are facing  proms, graduations, holidays, and weddings and other family events without  their service member. So it is fitting  that our Nation recognizes the sacrifices being made by military families  and appreciate their contributions during a National Military Families Week  with appropriate observance and celebration.  I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.  JONES  of  North  Carolina.  Madam Speaker, I yield such time as  he may consume  to  the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. BOOZMAN), who introduced this resolution.  ",2005
578,5,2005-06-08,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to support H. Con. Res. 159  to recognize the sacrifices being made  by the family members of the Armed  Forces and to support the designation  of the week of June 12 as National Military Families Week. I want to thank  the gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr. JONES) and the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. BOREN) for their leadership on this issue.  Over the last several years I have  traveled around  the world and met  many young men and women serving  our country. They have dedicated their  lives to defending this Nation and the  principles on which  it was  founded.  They have dedicated their lives to protecting each of us and our families.  We have seen an increased awareness  of the sacrifices these men and women  have been making. Yet there are many  more people that are being overlooked.  There are husbands and wives who remain here in the United States while  their spouses are making an enormous  sacrifice. They are here working and  caring for children and other family  members  left behind. These  families  face  unique  challenges while  their  loved ones are deployed. Yet they remain resilient because of the wonderful  support  system  they have here  at  home.  As we designate a week to recognize  and celebrate these families, I urge our  citizens to come  forward to support  these families. We must get involved in  our local communities. Several foundations, like the Armed Forces Foundation, the Wounded Warrior Foundation,  and the Love Gift Fund, are busy assisting these families and need our help  to carry on.  I also want  to  thank  the gentlewoman  from  South  Dakota  (Ms.  HERSETH), who is a cosponsor of this  bill who is unable to be here this morning.  Recently, I was in Landstuhl in Germany. This is the base that, when the  soldiers are injured, they immediately  come to out of Iraq. I was there, and we  were in the intensive care unit.  A young man that had been wounded  on night patrol, I was there  in the  afternoon, and he had been wounded at  four o’clock the previous evening, had  lost both his legs below the waist. He  wanted to tell his story to us. They literally pulled out the breathing apparatus. He apologized that he could not  speak very well and was telling his  story, related what had happened. But  the first thing he wanted to know was  how his wife was doing and was there  any way that we could get them paired  up, and we reassured him that he would  be with her the next day.  But, truly, we have situations like  this occurring. We have situations like  that. We have got just the day-to-day  situation of the separation, the anxiety  and things that are going on. So we  have a great opportunity. And I want  to thank the leadership and I want to  thank their staff for giving me the opportunity to bring this resolution to  the floor and encourage Members to  vote for it and then again just encourage our community and country to  take  the  opportunity  to  remember  these  people,  not  only  in  their  thoughts and prayers but by deeds and  action. ",2005
579,5,2005-06-08,Mr. BOREN.," Madam Speaker, I yield  back the balance of my time.  Mr.  JONES  of  North  Carolina.  Madam Speaker, I yield such time as  he may consume  to  the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON).  Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina.  Madam Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentleman  from  North  Carolina  (Mr.  JONES) for yielding me this time.  It is a great honor for me to be here  today to speak on behalf of House Current Resolution 159, and I want to congratulate the authors, the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. BOOZMAN) for his  leadership  in recognizing the  importance of military families and designating June 12 as National Military  Families Week.  As I stand before this Chamber, I am  very grateful to let the Members know  that my appreciation of military families is because we are one, and I am  very grateful that our family has multiple generations of recognition of how  extraordinary it is and what a great  honor it is to represent the people of  the United States in uniform.  As I think about the multiple generations, I was inspired by my dad, who  served  in  the Flying Tigers during  World War II, the 14th Air Force; and I  had the extraordinary opportunity 2  years ago to visit with President Jiang  Zemin of China, who told me of how  the American military  is revered  in  China for the liberation of their country during World War II.  Additionally, I am inspired because  of my late father-in-law, who served in  the U.S. Marines during World War II.  He had been advised that it was impossible for the American Marines to capture the Japanese headquarters at Okinawa, Shuri Castle. It had been fortified and refortified for 400 years, and  of course the U.S. Marines took that as  a challenge, and they did capture Shuri  Castle, and I am very grateful that my  late  father-in-law was  awarded  the  Navy Cross. But he understood sacrifice. He,  following the conflict on  Okinawa, was shot in the back by a  sniper, and he spent the rest of his life  in a wheelchair. But he never regretted  his service to the American people.  And the inspiration was to me. I had  the privilege of serving 31 years in the  Army National Guard, and the reason I  stayed in so long is because the people  that we meet in the military are dedicated, they are competent, they are patriotic. They are people that inspire  people to want to be associated with  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:00 Jun 09, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K08JN7.008 H08PT1 ",2005
580,12,2005-06-08,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. PUTNAM)  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, passage of this rule will  allow the House to consider the Agricultural, Rural Development, Food and  Drug  Administration,  and  Related  Agencies Appropriations Bill for Fiscal  Year 2006.  I want to express my appreciation to  the gentleman from Texas (Chairman  BONILLA) and the subcommittee’s new  ranking member,  the  gentlewoman  from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), for  working so well together on this bill  which clearly deserves the support of  all the membership of this House.  This  important  bill  provides  the  funding for our domestic nutrition and  anti-hunger  programs,  international  food aid, the Food and Drug Administration, and food inspection. Although  traditionally the bill is not controversial, it is an important appropriations  bill because of the vitally important  programs that are supported here.  I want to express my strong support  for the Department of Agriculture programs that fight to end hunger here at  home and around the world. Mr. Speaker, hunger is a political problem, one  that can be solved if only we have the  political will to do so. Regrettably, the  Bush administration and the leadership  in this House and the Senate have not  made the necessary commitments to  reduce poverty and end hunger in our  country. Indeed, hunger and poverty  are once again on the rise in the United  States. More children are going to bed  hungry at night  right here  in  the  United States of America, the richest  and most blessed country in the world.  Every year six million children in our  world die of hunger-related causes. We  cannot and should not stand by and  watch these tragedies unfold.  Mr. Speaker, it is time we raise the  bar and pledge to end hunger once and  for all. It is time to really tackle the  issue of poverty.  In  the meantime,  until we make that commitment and  back it up with real action and greater  resources, we must at least maintain  funding  for the domestic and  international nutrition and anti-hunger programs in this bill. That is why it is so  important that this bill increases funding for mandatory programs like food  stamps and other child nutrition programs like the school lunch program.  I am also pleased that discretionary  programs  like WIC also  receive  increases. These programs are among the  most successful of our Federal antihunger programs, and they help millions of Americans get the food they  could not otherwise afford to buy.  Unfortunately,  important programs  like the summer food service program  are not fully funded. This important  program provides meals to low-income  children during the summer when they  can not receive a school lunch because  the schools are closed for summer vacation. There is no reason why a child  who receives a lunch at school during  the school year should be denied a  lunch during the summer merely because school is out of session.  Another  important  program  that  needs to be expanded  is the school  breakfast program. Too many of our  children begin their school days hungry. They cannot concentrate as well  as children who have something to eat  before class. Those children who are  fortunate enough to receive a school  breakfast usually have to get to school  earlier than the other kids. There is a  stigma  that gets attached  to  these  children because it is plain for all the  students to see who cannot afford to  eat breakfast at home.  We need to expand the school breakfast program so that it is a truly universal program, and we must provide  school breakfast at the start of the  school day and not before. These two  simple actions will ensure that a nutritious meal is provided to hungry children without attaching any social stigma. The consequences of such basic  changes will be measurable increases  in learning and test scores, as well as  improvements in health.  A third program that needs to be  fully funded is the effort to end the reduced price meal. Currently,  low-income children are eligible for either a  free school lunch or a reduced price  lunch. The reduced price lunch costs 40  cents per meal. While that may not  seem like a lot to you or me, it can put  a real strain on the finances of many  low-income families who are struggling  to make ends meet. Too often, school  lunch  administrators  report  seeing  children who are able to buy lunch at  the beginning of the month stop eating  as the month goes on, merely because  their families cannot afford to pay for  that reduced price lunch as money gets  tighter and tighter towards the end of  the paycheck.  The Child Nutrition Reauthorization  Bill, a truly bipartisan bill that was  signed into law last year, phases out  the  reduced price meal. Last year,  thousands  of  anti-hunger  activists  roamed the halls of Capitol Hill with  their blue and white ERP buttons on,  and Congress responded. Now it is time  to back up that promise and fully fund  the effort to end the reduced price  meal.  Mr. Speaker, the fiscal year 2006 bill  also provides  funding  for the  International Food Aid Programs administered by the USDA. These programs  provide emergency food aid to regions  of the world that need help today. I am  pleased that President Bush pledged to  release $674 million for humanitarian  relief on the Horn of Africa. However,  while it is important that the United  States provide the funding for humanitarian  relief around  the world,  the  Committee on Appropriations must ensure that these funds are replenished  for the following year.

581,33,2005-06-08,Mr. NUSSLE.," Madam Chairman,  I rise  to  speak on  the measure before us, providing  budget authority for programming by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture and others. It provides  for about 20 percent of  total USDA  budget authority. As Chairman of the Budget  Committee, I am pleased to note that this bill  is consistent with the levels established in H.  Con. Res. 95, the House concurrent resolution  on  the budget  for  fiscal year 2006. Overall  spending in the bill is $29 million more than  the 2005 enacted level and $22 million above  the President’s request.  DEPARTMENTOFAGRICULTURE  In most areas within USDA, appropriators  ended up somewhere between the President’s  request and the 2005 enacted level. None of  the President’s initiatives to collect $178 million in new or increased user fees was taken  up, making up the difference through spending  reductions  in  some discretionary programs  and through $1.4 billion in reductions in some  mandatory programs authorized  for  the  first  time in the 2002 farm bill.  The bill makes changes in various mandatory programs that reduce net budget authority  by $1.4 billion. Specifically, it reduces budget  authority by about 25 percent for a number of  mandatory conservation programs and eliminates funding for a subset of agricultural research  and  rural  development  programs.  While the use of one-year savers in mandatory programs to stay within the Subcommittee’s 302(b) allocation has become  routine,  the Agriculture Committee could change some  of  these same mandatory programs  themselves in order to comply with the reconciliation  instructions  in  the Fiscal Year 2006  budget resolution.  FOODANDDRUGADMINISTRATION  H.R. 2744 provides $1.8 billion for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration [FDA], an increase of $55.3 million, or 3.1 percent, above the 2005 enacted  level and a decrease of $17.7 million below  the President’s request. Of  the appropriated  funds, $357 million is financed from on-going  drug, device and animal drug user fees. Under  provisions of the Prescription Drug User Fee  Act, the FDA will collect $305 million as user  fees to offset part of the costs of prescription  drug approval. This bill provides an increase  of $12.4 million for food safety and counterterrorism activities  to ensure consumers are  protected against  intentional and accidental  risks that threaten our food supply.  H.R. 2744 does not contain any emergencydesignated BA, which is exempt from budget  limits. The bill does rescind $32 million in the  unobligated balances of  the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,  and Children.  IOWACONCERNS  I am particularly pleased that this legislation  contains critical funding for ag and food safety  programs in my home state of Iowa. Specifically, I would like to commend the committee  for  funding  the completion of  the National  Centers  for Animal Health  in Ames,  Iowa,  where vital research to keep our nation’s food  supply safe is being done everyday. In addition,  this bill continues  funding  for  the Agriculture-Based Industrial Lubricants (ABIL) program at the University of Northern Iowa in my  Congressional district. The ABIL program continues  to promote value-added and environmentally safe agriculture products.  As we continue the appropriations season, I  commend Chairman LEWISand our colleagues  on the Appropriations Committee for meeting  the needs of the American public within the  framework established by the budget resolution. In conclusion, I express my support for  H.R. 2744. ",2005

585,33,2005-06-08,Mr. BONILLA.," Madam Chairman, I  would  like  to  briefly  explain  the  amendment and  the purpose of  the  amendment.  First of all, the amendment cuts $40  million from the Common Computing  Environment account and increases the  value-added  market  development  grants by $40 million. The amendment  also  reduces  the Conservation Operations account by $20 million, and it  increases the Watershed Rehabilitation  account by the same amount.  I understand that Members may have  some concern with these transactions  that we are involved with here, but the  reason that we are doing this today is  to accommodate some legitimate concerns raised by the authorizing committee about some of the mandatory  limitations in this bill. I have worked  closely with the gentleman from Virginia (Chairman GOODLATTE) over the  years, and I intend to work with him  closely in the future, especially as he  prepares  to write a new  farm bill.  While I would have preferred to keep  the CCE account funded at the highest  level possible,  I am  confident  that  when we get to the conference with the  Senate that we will be able to restore  funding to this account.

The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any  Member wish to be heard on the point  of order? If not, the Chair will rule.  The Chair finds that this provision  includes  language conferring authority. The  provision,  therefore,  constitutes  legislation  in  violation  of  clause 2 of rule XXI. The point of order  is  sustained,  and  the  provision  is  stricken from the bill.

Mr. BONILLA (during the reading).  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered  as read and printed in the RECORD.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Texas?  There was no objection.  ",2005
589,47,2005-06-08,Mr. BONILLA.," Mr. Chairman, I am  offering this amendment as part of the  agreement that I referred to earlier  with the chairman of the Committee  on Agriculture.  I am offering the amendment under  the agreement that we would add $40  million back  to  the Environmental  Quality  Incentives program account.  That is what the amendment does, and  it is paid for by increasing the limitations on  the Conservation Security  program, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives  program,  and  the Farm  and  Ranchlands Protection program. The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by  the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  BONILLA).  The amendment was agreed to.  AMENDMENTOFFEREDBYMS. DELAURO  ",2005
590,47,2005-06-08,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Chairman, I offer  an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Ms. DELAURO: In section 757, strike  ‘‘and the Western  Cotton Research Center, Phoenix, Arizona,  and credit the net proceeds of such sales’’  and insert ‘‘and credit the net proceeds of  such sale’’. ",2005
591,47,2005-06-08,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  suppor  of Mrs. DELAURO’s  amendment  to  strike part of Section 757 of Title VII of the Agriculture Appropriations bill  for Fiscal Year  2006.  In 1966, the Arizona Cotton Growers Association and the Arizona Cotton Planting Seed  Distributors deeded a piece of property  located at 4135 East Broadway Road in Phoenix To USDA for $1.00 to help with the construction of  the Western Cotton Research  Center. With the construction of a new facility  for  the  research center at  the University of  Arizona’a Maricopa Agricultural Center, the research and its staff will move within the next  two years, leaving this property behind.  I  think  it  is appropriate  that  this property,  which abuts the headquarters of the Arizona  Cotton Growers Association,  revert back  to  that group, since they deeded this property to  USDA originally for only $1.00.  I fully support removing the language allowing  the Secretary of Agriculture  to sell  the  Wester Cotton Research Center, Phoenix, Arizona and crediting  the net proceeds of  that  sale as offsetting collections to the ARS Buildings and Facilities account.

598,54,2005-06-08,Mr. BONILLA.," Mr. Chairman, I make  a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation  in an appropriation bill and therefore  violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The rule  states in pertinent part: ‘‘An amendment to a general appropriations bill  shall not be in order if changing existing law.’’  This amendment directly amends existing law.  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.  The CHAIRMAN. Does any Member  wish to be heard on the point of order?  ",2005
599,54,2005-06-08,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, I would  like to be heard on the point of order.  Mr. Chairman, it is hard for me to believe that the rules of this House do  not help ensure that the people we represent can trust their government. It is  hard for me to believe that the rules of  the House would mean that this House  can busy itself telling other people how  they should deal with end-of-life issues  for  dear  ones,  telling  independent  courts that they should not be quite so  independent, and yet would not allow  the  supposedly  greatest  legislative  body in the world to deal with a direct  obligation of government, which is to  ensure the public safety of the American people.  This amendment would be in order if  no Member objects to  it. The Committee on Rules, as I understand, when  they passed out the rule from the Committee on Rules, they did not protect  this amendment under the rule. That  does not mean that it cannot be considered by the House. The House can only  avoid dealing with this issue if a Member chooses to block the House from  acting on it.  Mr. Chairman, I would urge the gentleman  from Texas to withdraw his  point of order so that we can vote on  this most crucial issue. But if the gentleman does not withdraw his motion,  then I would, reluctantly, as I am sure  would the sponsor of the amendment,  have to concede the point of order.  The CHAIRMAN. Does  any  other  Member wish to be heard?  ",2005
600,54,2005-06-08,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Chairman, I wish  to speak on the point of order.  Mr. Chairman, I want to echo my colleagues’ comments, because  I  think  that we have an obligation.  In my  opening comments, I said that I believed that this bill is about what the  House of Representatives and Members  who are part of this effort have been  asked to do, and we have been asked to  protect the public interest on a whole  variety of measures, and, in this case,  we are talking about life and death.  The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman  must confine her remarks to the point  of order.  ",2005
601,54,2005-06-08,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Chairman,  it  would seem to me that the regular  order of the House would be to allow  legislation that in fact meets the definition or the goal of the mission that  we have been entrusted with. I wish  that the Committee on Rules would  have made this amendment in order because it is so critical to public safety.  I concur with my colleague when he  says if it is not made in order, then we  have to concede the point of order. But  what we are conceding is the life and  death of American people, and that is  not the regular order. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is prepared to rule.  The Chair finds that this amendment  proposes directly to change existing  law. The amendment  therefore constitutes  legislation  in  violation  of  clause 2 of rule XXI.  The point of order is sustained and  the amendment is not in order. AMENDMENTNO. 9OFFEREDBYMR. SCHWARZof  MICHIGAN  ",2005
602,54,2005-06-08,Mr.  SCHWARZ  of Michigan.," Mr.  Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows: Amendment No. 9 offered by Mr. SCHWARZ  of Michigan: Add at the end (before the short title) the  following new section: SEC. 7ll. It is the sense of Congress that  the Secretary of Agriculture should use the  transfer authority provided by section 442 of  the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7772) to  implement the strategic plan developed by  the Animal and Plant Health  Inspection  Service for the eradication of Emerald Ash  Borer in the States of Michigan, Ohio, and  Indiana. ",2005
603,54,2005-06-08,Mr.  SCHWARZ  of Michigan.," Mr.  Chairman, CCC  funds are  transferred  to  APHIS because of foreign Animals, Pests &  Diseases  that have  come  into  the United  States  and  are  destroying  agriculture  resources and products. Since  this  is a  tight  budget year and the dollars appropriated will  not fully take care of the emergency situation  of the spread of EAB and the millions of ash  trees in need of more attention from the CCC  and OMB. Therefore,  this amendment  is a sense of  Congress  to support  the  requests of USDA  and APHIS to fund the eradication program of  EAB within Michigan before it spreads to other  states.  Michigan has natural barriers which are the  great lakes that provide a natural containment  with this emergency eradication plan.  This is an emergency situation for our agriculture community and as with any  invasive  species, we continue to run in to the obstacle  of  funding  from OMB. With  this amendment  we want the OMB to reconsider the severity of  the EAB situation. This amendment is meant  to  suggest,  in  strong  terms,  that  it  is  Congress’s  intent  that  the mechanism within  this statute is to be used to meet the foreign  pest emergency needs of Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland & Michigan.

607,54,2005-06-08,Mr.  SCHWARZ  of Michigan.," Mr.  Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank  the chairman and am delighted that he  has decided to accept the amendment,  and we will move on. ",2005
608,54,2005-06-08,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Schwarz amendment emphasizing  the intent of Congress that full funding for the  control of Emerald Ash Borer must be provided. I had intended to offer an amendment  emphasizing the need for emergency funding  and thank Chairman BONILLA for his work with  us on this issue, and with respect and appreciation knowing we still have much to work on  will not extend floor debate today.  It is vital that we take action as quickly as  possible to deal with control and containment  this year. USDA, at the order of the Office of  Management and Budget, has not been able  to fully respond to the requests for funds from  Ohio and Michigan. Ohio recently requested  an additional $10.1 million that is needed immediately.  The Emerald Ash Borer was  identified  in  Michigan in July, 2002. It has been in Michigan  for perhaps  five years, having come  in  packing material from Asia.  Since then, several counties in southeastern  Michigan and now counties  in northwestern  Ohio have been infected with this creature. Literally billions of ash trees are at risk unless  this creature is stopped. Regrettably, there is  no known way to eradicate the insect without  starving  it  from new wood sources. So as  trees by the thousands are being cut down in  our region.  As  I said,  the State of Ohio has recently  asked the Department of Agriculture for an additional $10.1 million in emergency funding to  VerDate jul 14 2003  04:10 Jun 09, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K08JN7.092 H08PT1 ",2005

Before I recognize my final speaker  to close, Mr. Chairman,  let me  just  point out if it is about the bottom line,  it is about making sure USDA inspectors inspect the American food chain  and not foreign food chains.  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of  the time to the gentleman from West  Virginia (Mr. RAHALL).  ",2005
611,61,2005-06-08,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman  from New York  for  yielding me time, and I appreciate his  leadership, as well as the gentleman  from Kentucky  (Mr. WHITFIELD) and  the gentleman  from South Carolina  (Mr. SPRATT).  I want to remind my colleagues that  this particular amendment, which is a  funding  limitation, however,  is  still  very similar to an amendment that the  House voted on shortly before we broke  before the Memorial Day district work  period. That  particular  amendment  passed in an overwhelming fashion and  in a bipartisan fashion. So this is truly  bipartisan when  it comes  to  recognizing how valuable the horse is to this  country and what a symbol it is of our  freedom and how important it is to recognize this truly American icon.  When Americans think of the horse, I  do not believe they think of it in terms  of foreign cuisine on the tables of countries around the European area.  This amendment has invoked a lot of  emotion and misinformation. The opposition has said that this will increase  the abuse of horses and horses running  wild out West. Such statements are not  true.  Here are the facts. Each year some  65,000 horses are slaughtered  in this  country for human consumption in Europe and Asia where they are sold in  restaurants  as  a  delicacy. Another  30,000 are trucked to Canada and Mexico for slaughter. This amendment will  end that slaughter of American horses  for human consumption overseas.  Slaughter is not the same as humane  euthanasia administered by a veterinarian  in a very controlled environment. Euthanasia of horses is administered  by  legal  injection,  whereas  slaughtered  is  administered  by unskilled, untrained workers using the  captive bolt. Many times this is administered  improperly, causing unnecessary pain and suffering before death.  Passage of this amendment will not  cause  an  overpopulation  of  horses.  Each year 690,000 horses die in the U.S.  many of which are euthanized by a licensed  veterinarian.  Slaughtered  horses  represent  only  1  percent  of  horses that die each year. This would  not  result  in  an  overpopulation  of  horses as some suggest.  There  are  alternatives  available.  Americans do not profit from slaughtering horses. This is an export-driven  market. Foreigners eat our horses and  foreign companies make money, and  we should stop looking at it in that  perspective and start looking at it in  the American perspective. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by  the gentleman from New York (Mr. SWEENEY).  The question was  taken; and  the  Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.  ",2005

618,68,2005-06-08,Mr. BONILLA.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman,  it  is  interesting to  hear the term ‘‘corporate welfare’’ that  was brought before the public to a  large degree in the previous administration to try to attack a lot of private  sector  investment opportunities that  helped create jobs. This does not fall  into that category.  This is a situation where individual  companies that receive assistance from  the MAP program have to match 50  percent of any funds received. In addition, participants are required to certify that Federal funds used under the  program are to supplement and not replace private sector funds.  Farmers, ranchers, and rural business owners  from all regions of the  country benefit  from  the program’s  employment and economic effects from  expanded agricultural export markets.  More than 1 million Americans have  jobs that depend on exports. This program helps to ensure that American  agricultural products have export markets.  MAP is an effective program and deserves everyone’s  support.  I urge a  ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  Virginia  (Chairman GOODLATTE), also  in opposition to this amendment.  ",2005
619,68,2005-06-08,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Chairman, I  also rise in opposition to the amendment. This is not the time for unilateral disarmament when you are talking  about the trade competition that we  face in the world.  The gentleman mentions it is a $140  million program. The European Union  alone spends $2 billion each year on export subsidies. So the opportunity for  us to promote exports by giving companies an incentive to buy American agricultural products when  they  then  provide sales and services overseas is  well worth it, if indeed you are facing  that kind of competition.  The European Union has a trade surplus  in agriculture with the United  States. One of the reasons they do is  because they provide far more of this  type of support than we do. So to take  away what little we have while we are  in the midst of  intense negotiations  with the World Trade Organization is,  to me, unilateral disarmament.  What this program does is promote  the export of American agricultural  products. It is estimated that for every  $1 billion of U.S. agricultural exports,  we create 15,000 jobs in this country.  Last year we exported over $60 billion  worth of agricultural products, creating nearly  1 million  jobs. Taking  away this program  is going to take  away some of those jobs. It is not a  good idea. I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.  ",2005

621,68,2005-06-08,Mr. CHABOT.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  the balance of my time to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BROWN).  ",2005
622,68,2005-06-08,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank my friend from Ohio for his commonsense amendment. If this Congress  were not a captive of special interests,  the Chabot/Brown amendment would  pass unanimously.  We in this body, we preach balanced  budgets; yet we  spent, as  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) said, $1  billion on this program, on this welfare  program. We preach in this body prudent spending, yet we are suggesting  spending $125 million  for  fiscal year  2006 on this program. We preach free  enterprise in this body day after day  after day, yet we are using government  dollars to advertise on behalf of private  interests.  The Market Access Program, as the  gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr. CHABOT)  said, gives away $100 million annually  to groups  like the Catfish Institute,  the Popcorn  Institute,  the Ginseng  Board to market their products overseas. We  encourage  these  organizations, these private for-profit or notfor-profit, it does not matter, we encourage them to advertise overseas if  that helps their bottom line. But they  should do it on their dime, not on the  taxpayer’s dime.  It simply does not  make sense.  I know what budget cuts mean to my  district  in Cleveland when we have  seen the cuts that happened to NASA  and the kinds of job loss in my community. We have seen what Medicaid cuts  cost in terms of quality health care.  Yet we are going to spend $125 million  on a program that clearly shows no  real benefit to those organizations. If  they did show benefit, they would be  spending their own money.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  to support the Chabot amendment, to  join National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, Taxpayers For Common Sense, U.S. PIRG,  and a whole host of other groups in  passing this amendment. The CHAIRMAN. All time having expired, the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. CHABOT).

627,68,2005-06-08,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Mr. Chairman, I  appreciate the gentleman yielding on  this important subject matter. It is an  issue that I know the gentleman has  done due diligence on and paid attention to.  I rise today to address the issue of an  amendment that I had prepared to offer  that I will not be offering that would  require the Secretary of Agriculture to  report  to Congress on  the National  Animal Identification System, including the effectiveness of the pilot programs funded in the FY 2005 budget  year. Analysis of the economic impact  of the proposed system on the livestock  industry and the expected costs of the  implementation of the system need to  be part of a report.  USDA has been working diligently to  establish a National Animal Identification System since December of 2003.  That is when they discovered bovine  spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, in a  Canadian cow in Washington State. On  May 5, 2005, USDA announced their  Draft Strategic Plan and Draft Program Standards. The Department plans  on making this a mandatory system by  2009, which would identify animals for  disease surveillance.  It is not a new concept, Mr. Chairman. In fact, in the 90s we had implemented a plan to address and identify  cattle vaccinated for brucellosis, which  is a bacterial disease that affects cattle, hogs, and other livestock. This program has been successful and is scheduled to be phased out. This is not a new  thing for the USDA.  I have been saying since before the  discovery of BSE that we need an animal identification system that is up  and running. It would be an insurance  policy for livestock owners in the case  of a disease outbreak. It would also be  a system that is beneficial for foreign  trade.  It would be creative, and  it  would be invaluable for our marketing  opportunities and for our breeding information.  Overall, the need for this system is  immediate.

Again in a bipartisan way, this subcommittee works very hard to put a  bill together each year with the majority-passed budget constraints that we  have to live under. The gentleman from  Colorado is a good Member who comes  to the table year in and year out, and  sometimes week in and week out, with  an effort to cut the bill even further.  However, again, with all due respect to  his efforts, the bills that we put together on appropriations are done as a  part of a team effort.

633,75,2005-06-08,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman,  I am offering  this  amendment today to begin a discussion  in this House which is aimed at ensuring the livelihood of commercial fishermen and protecting our oceans, lakes,  and streams. This amendment is a reasonable and moderate safeguard. It will  delay FDA approval of genetically engineered fish for a year. This amendment is necessary because commercial  fishermen and environmentalists have  raised concerns that GE fish may pose  ecological risks. Scientists from Purdue University and the University of  Minnesota have raised a number of serious questions about the ecological  impacts of GE fish. These risks include  GE fish escape from ocean pens into  the environment, which could impact  wild populations of fish.  In this first chart, Mr. Chairman, GE  fish are being engineered to grow faster  and bigger. However, several fish ecologists from the University of Minnesota  and Purdue University have expressed  concerns with these salmon, as their  accidental release may create environmentally disastrous extinctions of natural wild salmon species.  In the second chart, the bottom fish  is the same age as the two smaller fish  on top. b1830  But, of course, what we have here is  a genetically engineered  fish on the  bottom.  The third chart, scientists have determined that a larger fish has an advantage  in mating. Thus,  larger GE  fish, which are more aggressive and  consume more  food,  attract more  mates than wild fish. In essence, one  could call this one the  ‘‘handsomely  big GE fish’’ is more successful than  the ‘‘lonely natural fish.’’  Scientists have also determined that  these GE fish may survive for only a  limited number of generations in the  wild. Their offspring will be less fit and  less likely to survive. So we are talking about the survival of species here.  On the fourth chart, mutant fish are  created as GE fish escape into the wild  and mate with natural fish. The mutant’s fish larger size gives an advantage  in mating,  forcing new genetic  traits to be integrated into the wild.  But these mutant fish may only survive for a limited number of generations in the wild. The implications are  serious. After several generations, natural fish may go extinct because larger  GE fish are more successful than natural fish in mating. Mutant fish also go  extinct because their mutant genes decrease the survivability of the species.  As a result of GE fish producing unfit  offspring that are more successful in  mating, the Purdue scientists predict  that if 60 genetically engineered fish  were introduced into a population of  60,000 wild fish, the species would become extinct within only 40 fish generations.  Scientists call this outcome the Trojan Gene Effect. The end result is a  possible extinction of important commercial fish species like salmon. The  National Academy of Sciences has examined this issue in their report ‘‘Animal Biotechnology: Science Based Concerns, 2002,’’ and found  ‘‘considerable  risk’’ and a need for more research.  ‘‘Transgenic Atlantic salmon pose a  near-term regulatory issue. A brief review of the hazards they pose provides  a useful  illustration of the environmental hazards posed by GE aquatic  species more generally.  ‘‘The  committee’s  review,’’  continuing on of the quote, ‘‘of ecologic  principles and empirical data suggests  a considerable risk of ecologic hazards  being realized should transgenic fish or  shellfish enter the natural ecosystems.  In particular, greater empirical knowledge is needed to predict the outcome  should transgenes become introgressed  into natural populations of aquatic organisms.’’  The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, the science  society of experts on fish, amphibians,  and reptiles, has joined the call for a 1year moratorium. This amendment is  strongly supported by commercial fishermen because their struggling industry cannot afford a negative ecological  impact on the wild fish species that  they depend on for their livelihood.  Several States have passed legislation regulating GE fish, including prohibitions,  labeling requirements, and  permit requirements. The States  include Alaska, California, Maryland, Oregon, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin,  and Washington.  Mr. Chairman, I brought this discussion to this House for the purposes of  alerting the Members of Congress that  we need to have a deep debate about  this, that we need to do more research,  we need to get into this; and for that  reason I would have the debate continue. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. TERRY).  Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Ohio?  There was no objection.

636,89,2005-06-08,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I  think the gentlewoman has raised a  number of people who wrote her from  Illinois, the retirees and employees of  United raised this point, that it was actually the President that said what is  good for the crew is good for the captain.  What we see here clearly is what so  many of  these employees  recognize,  and what we have watched now is company after company that terminates  these employee pension plans, that go  into bankruptcy, at the end of the day  the company goes on, less these liabilities, and the very people who administered  the  company  into  the  bankruptcy, their pensions in many cases  were guaranteed, they were moved outside of bankruptcy, they were put into  trusts, or as the company is reorganized, they then go back to  issuing  stock options for themselves, issuing  bonuses, as if nothing happened.  Yet what we see here is tens of thousands of United employees who are left  in the dust bin. Many of these people  cannot go back to work. They cannot  go back and accumulate a retirement  nest egg again, and I think it is something we see run through all of our letters. I want to thank the gentlewoman  for raising that point.  ",2005
637,89,2005-06-08,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker, if  the gentleman will yield further, let  me say one thing about that. It is not  as if they are saying we want things to  be exactly as we were promised when  we came  in. These employees have  given up about $3 billion in benefits already.  ",2005
638,89,2005-06-08,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Reclaiming my time, time and again  these employees have given back on retirement, have given back on wages,  have given back on hours to keep this  airline flying; and yet at the end of the  day, the executives walk out to the  new company and the employees are  stuck without their retirement, without their health care benefit.  I now recognize my colleague, the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  (Mr.  TIERNEY), who was part of our e-hearing, the first-ever Congress e-hearing  to provide this kind of access to ordinary Americans who are suffering the  disaster, the personal disaster of the  larger disaster of the United Airlines  decision to go into bankruptcy and get  rid of these pensions and health care  plans.  ",2005
639,89,2005-06-08,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank the ranking member, the gentleman  from California  (Mr. GEORGE  MILLER), and thank the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY) as well  for your leadership on this issue, and  for convening this e-hearing and also  taking this time on the floor tonight.  I think it is imperative to read as  many of these e-mails as possible into  the RECORDand express the voice of so  many people that earned their pensions,  that worked  their  long work  lives and took as a form of deferred  compensation the rights to these pension  benefits.  They  sacrificed  pay  raises and sacrificed other benefits in  exchange for what they thought was a  promise from the company that they  were going to get this pension when  they retired.  One UAL person wrote in and said, ‘‘I  joined UAL with stars in my eyes believing the promise of opportunity, a  secure benefit package and the enthusiasm  of  being  part  of  something  great.’’  Well, it really has not been something great for them. As the gentleman  mentioned, in every way the employees  tried to work it out with the company.  I am so used, as the gentleman is, from  hearing executives tell us, oh, the employees will not cooperate, the employees and their high costs are driving  this company down.  Well, it was the employees at UAL  that actually went into an ESOP program, an employee stock option program,  that  turned  out  to  be near  worthless  for them  in the  long run.  Some  lost hundreds of thousands of  dollars trying to help the company out.  They underwent  cuts  in  pay,  they  forewent benefits, and all of this to  find  the  company  surreptitiously  sneaks into bankruptcy for 21⁄2years  and  then  slides  their  benefits  into  bankruptcy and they end up going into  the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and getting about 30 to 40 percent of the benefits, if they are lucky.  These letters, these e-mails, are written about feelings of betrayal, absolute  feelings of betrayal. They say it is a  sign of what they think is happening to  the moral fiber of this country. They  wonder on a philosophical level how  this is going to impact the values that  they have been brought up with and  they have been instilling in their children.  Jacob Acker said not too long ago  that in 1938 FDR talked about the last  great unconquered frontier of America  was the frontier of uncertainty and insecurity. And then as a country we set  out  to do  something about  it. We  worked with corporations, with employee groups, we worked with private  groups and our government and we put  in Social Security, we put in pensions,  we put in health care benefits, the minimum wage, the GI Bill. We put  in  structures and security so people  in  this country would no longer feel that  they were confronting that frontier of  insecurity and uncertainty.  But here we are in 2005, we find out  executives and management of a company can turn it around and take their  promises and turn them into dust and  take their employees and put them  into sheer desperation, so that again in  2005 we are again facing a frontier of  uncertainty and insecurity. And it is  incumbent on this Congress to finally  act.  I say to the gentleman from California (Mr. GEORGEMILLER), as ranking member of this Committee on Education and Workforce, and the members on the minority side who have  been banging away for some time now  saying this is an impending problem  that has to be addressed, where is Congress on this matter? Where  is the  White House on this matter? They are  dealing with issues the American public does not even care about. You look  at what has happened so far this year  on the agenda of this Congress and the  White House. It is not about jobs, it is  not about health care, it is not about  education for people’s children, and it  is not about pension protection and retirement.  The closest the President comes is  trying  to privatize Social Security,  which would put these people in further jeopardy. And that is what I hear  often from the people at United.

640,96,2005-06-08,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to explicate the nature of the regime of  which he speaks. This Congress and our  Presidents  of  both  parties  did not  choose the terrorists label lightly.  This is a regime which has its antecedent roots in the holding of American diplomats hostage for 444 days, an  image which we will not soon forget. It  is a regime where people are imprisoned and tortured for dancing at wedding celebrations.  It  is a regime  in  which women who express their points  of view are brutalized, assaulted and  tortured in Iranian prisons. And perhaps the most striking piece of evidence as to the real nature of this regime is found in the run-up to the elections which are going to be held in Iran  on the 17th of June, in 9 days.  1,014 people registered to be part of  that election, to be on the ballot for  this election, and the ruling council  that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  KIRK) made reference to under the Iranian system has the right to chose who  goes on the ballot and who does not.  I say this again. If you want to run  for office, you file your nominating petitions, and then a ruling council decides whether or not you are worthy to  be on the ballot. Of the 1,014 persons  who filed to be on the ballot on the  June 17 election in Iran, six of them  were permitted to be on the ballot by  the ruling council, six people out of  1,014 people. b2145  This is not a regime that can have a  nuclear weapon. We have to start this  discussion from the proposition that it  is unacceptable for a regime of this  dark nature to have a nuclear weapon.  ",2005
641,96,2005-06-08,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  agree. Iran had grand ambitions under  the Shah who planned to build 29 nuclear reactors. His plans and those of  his successors are ironic given Iran’s  location atop one of the  largest reserves of oil that emerged  from the  ground at less than a cost of $2 a barrel. With the fall of the Shah, Iran’s  nuclear ambitions were cut back but  then revived with the help of Russia.  Based at Bushehr, the Russian nuclear  reactor project gives Iran a clear path  to the production of plutonium despite  Russia’s assertions otherwise.  Until 2002, we had strong suspicions  about Iran, but no clear allegations  that she had violated her solemn commitment to the United Nations under  the non-proliferation treaty; but then  an exile group, the National Council  For Resistance of Iran, exposed clear,  undeclared  nuclear  activities,  indithese  cating uranium  enrichment at  that  task; and the Arak heavy water production facility gives Iran a clear path  towards  the  refinement of products  which would become the center of a nuclear weapon.  This was just not according to the  exile group. After 2 years of extensive  inspections  by  the United Nations  International Atomic Energy Agency,  they reported that Iran had undeclared  centrifuge atomic vapor, a laser isotope separation, a molecular laser isotope separation and plutonium separation activities, all in direct violation of  Iran’s formal obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the  safeguards agreement.  I yield  to my colleague on  points.  ",2005
642,96,2005-06-08,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I again  thank my friend. It is important to  note that we have nearly a quarter century of active deception from the Iranian regime on this point.  As recently as 4 years ago, 3 years  ago, in international forums, the representatives of this government were  actively denying that they were in pursuit of a nuclear weapon. For nearly a  quarter century, we were told by the  Iranian regime that activities which  appear to be nuclear in nature were for  a domestic energy program.  Now, one must find it curious that a  nation that is sitting on one of the  largest supplies of crude oil  in the  world,  that  is  an  exporter  to  the  States, whose main export  is crude,  would find the need for a nuclear energy program. That alone is a rather  curious proposition; but putting that  aside, we had a quarter century of deception until, as the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. KIRK) says, in 2002 resistance leaders blew the whistle about the  facilities at Arak and Natanz.  I want to be very clear, Mr. Speaker,  that there has been controversy in this  Chamber about the existence of weapons of mass destruction and ideological  views coloring that discussion. There is  no ideological dispute here. There is  factual understanding by the French,  by the Germans, by the British, by the  EU, by the U.N., by every objective  party in this case. It is not in factual  dispute that there is a nuclear program  going on in Iran.  Since  the disclosures  that became  public in December of 2002, as the gentleman  from Illinois  (Mr. KIRK)  just  said, we had a 2-year process of inspections under  the  jurisdiction of  the  IAEA of the United Nations, and they  confirmed the existence of plutonium,  or rather of uranium, enrichment facilities. They confirmed the equipment  and  the  infrastructure necessary  to  make the other parts of a reactor, including a centrifuge, that would lead  up to the construction of a nuclear  weapon.  So we want to be very clear tonight  that what is in controversy is what will  happen next with respect to development of this Iranian program. What is  in controversy is what we ought to do  about it. What is not in controversy is  that the Iranians actively pursued a  nuclear weapons  program  and  that  they actively deceived the rest of the  world about that pursuit for a quarter  of a century.  ",2005
643,96,2005-06-08,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my  friend and  I want to emphasize his  point that the violations we are talking about were not based on faulty intelligence  from the U.S. CIA. These  violations that we are talking about  are documented in formal, open reports  by the United Nations  international  staff under Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei of  the IAEA. Inspections through June of  2003 showed many reporting failures by  Iran; and by mid-year, Iran admitted to  enriching uranium,  purification,  reprocessing and later admitted to the  United Nations of losing nuclear material that had been covered by her U.N.  safeguards agreement.  Iran built a centrifuge enrichment  plant at Natanz with 1,000 rotors and  started construction at another facility  with  50,000  rotors.  Iran  first  claimed that it had not enriched uranium at all, and the IAEA reported  then that it had found contaminations  of enriched uranium at  the Kalaye  Electric Company, at one place, of 36  percent enriched uranium; at another,  54 percent on  imported components;  and at another, 70 percent enriched  uranium  inside  its workshop. Until  these discoveries by the U.N., Iran had  only admitted to enriching uranium  once to a level of 7 percent.  After the A.Q. Khan network was exposed in Libya, Iran also admitted to  using advanced rotors of Pakistani design to enrich uranium. It also admitted in May 2004 that it had separated  plutonium  in much  larger amounts  than previously reported.  All of these actions point to a continuing effort by Iran to develop nuclear materials beyond an enrichment  level ever needed for civilian power,  giving us and the United Nations clear  and convincing evidence that it is dedicated to the production of a nuclear  weapon in violation of its commitment  under the non-proliferation treaty at  the U.N.  Now, Iran also has backed up its public  statements with policy and announced just last month enacting legislation requiring the Iranian Government to develop nuclear technology,  including enrichment of uranium, but  this is not just the only part of the  threat. Iran not only has a nuclear program;  it also has an aggressive missile development program, based on a North Korean missile, the No Dong, which the  Iranians call the Shahab 3.  Iran’s missile program brings many  key U.S.  facilities and  friends  into  range, especially Israel. This is a picture of the latest Shahab 3 missile, almost  98 percent North Korean; and  when you look at the range of these  systems, you see that U.S. facilities  like the Fifth Fleet, or our allies in  Israel, come clearly into range.

644,117,2005-06-08,Mr. SESSIONS.," If the Senator will  yield, I will follow up on that.  I remember President Clinton nominated  quite  a  number  of  justices,  judges, who were active members—  some lawyers—for the American Civil  Liberties Union. If you  look at the  American Civil Liberties Union Web  site, they favor and believe the Constitution  allows  the  legalization  of  drugs;  that  there  cannot be a  law  against legalization of drugs.  They oppose all pornography laws—  even child pornography laws—on their  Web site.  We confirmed Marsha Berzon  from  California. She was chairman of the  litigation  committee  of  the ACLU.  There were quite a number of other  members of the ACLU. We gave them a  fair hearing. We asked  their views.  Some were answered satisfactorily to  my view and  some were not. Fundamentally, the question was, will you  follow the law of the Supreme Court?  Will you be faithful to those laws? Do  you have a good  reputation among  your colleagues? Have you a record of  integrity and achievement?  Most of those judges, virtually all of  them, were confirmed.  ",2005
645,117,2005-06-08,Mr. MCCONNELL.," The Senator from  Alabama  is correct, and Berzon and  Paez were the poster children for nominees out of the mainstream to the left,  yet the Senator from Alabama and others, and myself, joined in making sure  these two nominees—dramatically out  of the mainstream, to the left—got an  up-or-down vote in the Senate.

651,117,2005-06-08,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. President, may I  take a few minutes to go over some of  the concerns  that have been  raised  about Justice Janice Rogers Brown’s  rulings on some cases?  As the Senator from Kentucky and I  discussed, some of her statements have  been taken out of context. It is not  fair. We ought to be fair to nominees.  We ought to be sure their reasoning,  their thought processes, the context of  what they are doing, is brought to the  attention of the American public before we start twisting it to make them  look like someone who is not in the  mainstream.  I will talk about a couple of things;  there are many we could talk about. I  will mention a few cases specifically  that have been referred to by the attack groups that are attempting to put  down these nominees, and by Senators  who have picked up on it—maybe they  are not lawyers, maybe they are—but  perhaps have not fully comprehended  what the case is about or have been  careless with the facts.  One of the charges some have heard,  I think made again today, is that Janice Rogers Brown opposes all zoning  laws. That is not true. That is absolutely not true. One Senator, I believe  Senator DORGAN, said she believes that  zoning laws are the equivalent of theft  and are unconstitutional. That is not  true. That is not a fair characterization of her record.  This is what the San Remo case was  about. First, she never said the zoning  laws were unconstitutional. But the  San Remo case in California came before her. It involved a Draconian, overreaching zoning law that forced hotel  owners—I know the Presiding Officer  has had some association with real estate—forced hotel owners who wanted  to convert low-income residential units  to hotel units to pay a large fee or replace the residential units that would  be lost. It was a takings case. It was a  question of whether this zoning  law  had taken away the ability of private  property owners to use their property  to the highest and best use.  That is a big deal in America today.  Even  the  liberal Supreme Court of  California was troubled by it. It was a  4-to-3 vote. Justice Brown was one of  the three, but she was not the only one  who dissented from this rule. Her dissent was consistent with U.S. Supreme  Court precedent on property.  The classic case, not too far from the  State of Georgia, was North or South  Carolina. The person bought a lot on  the beach, paid a lot of money for this,  was going to build a dream home on  the beach. They came along and said:  We are going to rezone this and you  cannot build a house on the beach.  He put all of this money in a lot that  he was going to build his dream house  on and they said: You can keep the  sands, Mr. Property Owner, but you  cannot build a house on it. The Supreme Court of the United States of  America said—and the same principle I  believe applies in California—that this  was an effective taking of the value of  that property.  If the Government wanted to take it  and make  it a wildlife refuge, they  ought to take the property and pay  them the fair market value for it. But  what the zoning guys wanted to do, you  see, is just say: You cannot use it. You  cannot do anything with it. You have  to do with it what we want you to do  with it, but we are not going to pay  you a dime for the ability to have that  property set aside for what we want it  to be set aside for.  That  is why people who are concerned about property rights in America are upset about the abuse of zoning.  But normal zoning goes on every day.  And there is not one shred of evidence  that Janice Rogers Brown opposes all  zoning. In fact, she, as I said, had two  other judges join with her in that important case. Justice Brown,  in the  case, complimented the State of California for having a laudable regulation  to try to provide more housing opportunities  for  low-income  individuals.  She said that in her dissent, but noted  that the California takings clause precluded the Government from achieving  that goal by police power regulation.  Another case that still bothers me—  I mentioned  it yesterday; and  it  is  worth  talking  about  again—is  the  Aguilar  case. Senator BOXER and  I  think maybe others on the floor have  said that Justice Brown, an African  American,  the daughter of a  sharecropper from rural Alabama—she grew  up not too far from where I grew up—  had said, in her opinion, that it was OK  for Latinos to have racial slurs uttered  against them in the workplace, that  that was the position of Justice Janice  Rogers Brown.  Now, this was the case of Aguilar v.  Avis Rent A Car System. It involved a  court injunction that barred a manager  of the company from using various racial  epithets  in  the  future,  raising  grave first amendment concerns as a  prior restraint. Justice Brown, in her  dissent, stated: ‘‘Discrimination on the  basis of race is illegal, immoral, unconstitutional, inherently wrong, and destructive of democratic society.’’ As to  the  specific  slurs,  she called  them:  ‘‘disgusting, offensive, and abhorrent.’’  In her dissent, however, she relied on  the precedent of the Supreme Court of  the United States, in expressing her  concern  about  an  injunction  that  placed an absolute prohibition, a prior  restraint, on speech. Again, the court  in this case was divided, 4 to 3. One of  the dissenters who joined with her was  the  liberal  icon,  Justice  Stanley  Mosk—her colleague on the bench who  is recognized as one of the great, most  prominent liberal judges in America—  because speech is important.  I offered into the RECORDMonday an  article by Nat Hentoff  in which he  dealt with this particular case. He is a  great civil libertarian lawyer. He has  committed his life to American civil  liberties. He believes in free speech. He  said the majority opinion in Aguilar  was an outrage, that  it was totally  wrong, that she was exactly correct,  that this was a prior restraint of free  speech that could not be done under  these circumstances. So saying that  Justice Brown believes  it  is OK  for  Latinos to have racial slurs uttered  against them in the workplace is not a  fair thing to be saying about her.

658,152,2005-06-08,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, in the last  hour or so we made huge progress on an  issue that has been very difficult for  this body over the last 3 to 4 weeks, in  fact I would say difficult for the last  21⁄2years. The progress we have made is  that for these nominees who had not  received a fair up-or-down vote for 2  years, 3 years, 4 years, we are finally  back in gear and getting up-or-down  votes, fulfilling our constitutional responsibility of advice and consent.  I am very pleased and I am very  proud of this body. People who have  been blocked for partisan reasons in  the past, who have been obstructed,  have  been  prevented  from  getting  votes, have been allowed to get votes  through regular order by going through  the Judiciary Committee. Although it  took way too long—2 years, 3 years, 4  years—finally they have been allowed  to get an up-or-down vote. I hope it  sets the tone, and I believe it will set  the tone, as we proceed over the coming weeks and months and address circuit court nominees and, of course, Supreme Court nominees who may or  may not occur in the very near future.  Justice Janice Rogers Brown will  now serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the D.C. Circuit. The vote was 56 to  43, a bipartisan vote, which shows that  once these up-or-down votes are allowed and the body can express itself  the will of the Senate will work and  that this highly qualified nominee, as I  mentioned a bit ago, who  is kind,  smart, thoughtful, and qualified, who  has had to endure a lot of protracted  and often bitter nomination discussions, is now going to be on the D.C.  Circuit. The will of the Senate expressed itself. The bipartisan vote was  56 to 43.  This last vote on William Pryor, the  fact that in the past he had been obstructed through a partisan leadership-  led effort in the past, once we sort of  broke  through  that  impasse, he  received 67 votes on cloture. The vote  was 67 to 32, overwhelming bipartisan  support, which now will guarantee him  what has been denied in the past, and  that is a fair up-or-down vote. Again,  the body will be able to speak.  Everybody who sits at these desks,  the people who are  in the Chamber  now, will be able to express themselves  with a vote. That is how we give advice  and consent. The vote was 67 to 32. Tomorrow at 4, he, too, will get an up-or-  down vote, confirm or reject, on whether Members believe he is a qualified  nominee. Members can vote their conscience, vote  their  judgment of his  qualifications.  The  candidate,  the  nominee, will receive the up-or-down  vote he deserves.  We should treat these nominees with  respect and in a reasonable period of  time when they come to the floor, or  they make it to this Executive Calendar, so that they receive that up-or-  down vote.  I am very pleased where we are. It is  huge progress. Both sides of the aisle  are working together on this very important judicial nominee process. We  will continue that process tomorrow in  which case by the end of tomorrow we  should have  three more up-or-down  votes at 4, again tremendous progress.  Two of the Michigan  judges will be  voted on sometime late afternoon or  early evening. They will be given up-  or-down votes, and I expect all three  will be confirmed.  I believe we have broken the impasse,  as I have said, and we are making real  progress. The early part of next week  we will be having one more up-or-down  vote. That will be on Tom Griffith, and  then we will go to the Energy bill. We  want to spend plenty of time to give  everybody the opportunity to debate  and amend. I expect we would spend  that whole first week and likely into  that second week which would give everybody the opportunity to come forward and express themselves on a bill  that  I  believe will  lower  gasoline  prices—I cannot  say  that with certainty, but I believe this bill will—and  will lower natural gas prices. For people who are thinking about driving on  vacations,  driving  to work,  driving  their truck, or worried about heating  in the future, the American people will  know we are doing the Nation’s business, that we are doing our very best to  lower those prices for them as individuals.  I am pleased where we are today. We  are making real progress. I know there  will be some other comments made tonight before we close.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2005

666,152,2005-06-08,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. President, I rise today  to pay a special tribute to Ange1 Campbell. She is my counsel and director of  my Special Projects Office. This outstanding staffer will be leaving my office after 8 years of exceptional service  to spend more time with her growing  family.  Angel is the epitome of a dedicated,  hard-working public servant. She has  been remarkably gifted at advocating  for Mississippi, the place we both call  home,  to Federal executives  in  the  many government departments and to  fellow congressional staffers. I know  that many constituents from the State  of Mississippi will also  feel her absence. There are many staffers working  in Congress who will miss her detailed,  knowledgeable explanations of the infrastructure features that are unique  to our home State to help them while  drafting  legislative  initiatives. And  that is why I want to take a moment  with my colleagues to recognize and to  thank Angel for her many genuine contributions to my office and to the citizens of Mississippi.  Angel is a native of Southaven, MS.  She  received  her  bachelor’s  degree  from the University of Mississippi and  later  earned  her  law  degree  from  Samford University. She and her husband, Terry, have three wonderful and  energetic children; Taylor, Trey, and  Jackson. Even as her family grew while  on my staff, she continued to balance  her priorities and served both her family and Mississippi well.

693,180,2005-06-08,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  bring  the  following article  to  the attention of  my colleagues. The article details the reasons  that the U.S. pays excessively high prices for  prescription drugs. The Free Market Drug Act  gets at  the heart of  the problem outlined  below.  [From the Center for Economic and Policy  Research, Sept. 21, 2004.  FINANCINGDRUGRESEARCH: WHATARETHE  ISSUES?  (By Dean Baker)  EXECUTIVESUMMARY  Rising drug prices are placing an ever larger burden on family budgets and the economy. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid  Services estimates 2004 expenditures at $207  billion  (more  than  $700 per person), and  projects that annual spending will grow to  more than $500 billion by 2013 (more than  $1,600 per person). The immediate cause of  high drug prices is government granted patent monopolies, which allow drug companies  to charge prices that are often 400 percent,  or more, above competitive market prices.  Patent monopolies are one possible mechanism  for  financing prescription drug  research. Rapidly increasing drug costs, and  the economic distortions they imply, have  led researchers to consider alternative mechanisms  for  financing drug  research. This  paper outlines some of the key issues in evaluating patents and other mechanisms for financing prescription drug research. It then  assesses how four proposed alternatives to  the patent system perform by these criteria.  The most obvious problem stemming from  patent protection for prescription drugs is  the huge gap it creates between the cost of  producing drugs and the price. In addition,  to making drugs unaffordable in many cases,  high drug prices also lead to enormous economic inefficiency.  Patent monopolies cause economic distortions in the same way that trade tariffs or  quotas lead to economic distortions, but the  size of the distortions are far greater. While  trade barriers rarely increase prices by more  than 10 to 20 percent, drug patents increase  prices by an average of 300–400 percent above  the competitive market price, and in some  cases the increase is more than 1000 percent.  Simple calculations suggest that the deadweight efficiency losses from patent protection are roughly comparable in size to the  amount of research currently supported by  the patent system—approximately $25 billion  in 2004. Projections of rapidly rising research  costs, and therefore a growing gap between  price and marginal cost,  imply  that  the  deadweight loss due to drug patents will exceed $100 billion a year by 2013.  As economic theory predicts, government  granted patent monopolies lead not only to  deadweight efficiency losses due to the gap  between the patent protected price and the  competitive market price, but also to a variety of other distortions. Among these distortions are:  (1) Excessive marketing expenses, as firms  seek to pursue the monopoly profits associated with patent protection—data from the  industry suggests that marketing costs are  currently  comparable  to  the  amount  of  money spent on research; (2) wasted research  spending  into duplicative drugs—industry  data indicates that roughly two thirds of research spending goes to developing duplicative drugs rather than drugs that represent  qualitative  breakthroughs  over  existing  drugs; (3) the neglect of research that is not  likely to lead to patentable drugs; (4) concealing research findings in ways that impede the progress of research, and prevent  the medical profession and the public from  becoming aware of evidence that some drugs  may not be effective, or could even be harmful.  In addition, the patent system for financing prescription drug research poses large  and growing problems in an international  context. Disputes over patent rules have increasingly  dominated  trade  negotiations.  Furthermore, problems of enforcement have  persisted even after agreements have been  reached. These problems are likely to worsen  through time, as the pharmaceutical industry seeks to increase the amount of money it  extracts from other countries through patent rents.  This paper examines four alternatives to  the patent system:  (1) A proposal by Tim Hubbard and James  Love  for a mandatory employer-based research fee to be distributed through intermediaries to researchers (Love 2003); (2) A  proposal by Aidan Hollis for zero-cost compulsory licensing patents, in which the patent holder is compensated based on the rated  quality of life improvement generated by the  drug, and the extent of its use (Hollis 2004);  (3) A proposal by Michael Kremer for an auction system in which the government purchases most drug patents and places them in  the public domain (Kremer 1998); and (4) A  proposal by Representative Dennis Kucinich  to finance pharmaceutical research through  a set of competing publicly supported research centers (Kucinich 2004).  All  four of these proposals  finance prescription drugs  in ways that allow most  drugs to be sold in a competitive market,  without patent monopolies. These proposals  also would eliminate many of the economic  distortions created by the patent system.  These proposals, along with other plausible  alternatives to the patent system, deserve  serious consideration. Current projections  for drug spending  imply that patent supported prescription drug research will lead to  ever  larger distortions through time. For  this reason, it is important to consciously  select the best system for financing prescription drug research, not to just accept the  patent system due to inertia.  HONORING ANN LOWRY MURPHEY  HON. JIM DAVIS  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 8, 2005  ",2005
694,180,2005-06-08,Mr. DAVIS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  honor of Ann Lowry Murphey, a tireless public  servant who lost her struggle with cancer last  month.  Ann truly left no stone unturned in her quest  to  improve  the Tampa Bay community. She  energetically led a host of charitable and community organizations, and  in attempting  to  highlight Ann’s causes, any tribute will inevitably fail to recognize all of her contributions.  A faithful servant of God, Ann was a long-  time parishioner and member of the vestry of  St. John’s Episcopal Church. A supporter of  the arts, Ann was active with The Tampa Philharmonic and The Museum Society at the University of Tampa. As a successful businesswoman, she served on the board of First Citizens Bank and Barnett Bank of Tampa and as  Vice  President  of Murphey Capital.  Ann  worked on  the Judicial Nominating Commission for the 13th Circuit and was on the board  of governors of the Greater Tampa Chamber  of Commerce. And Ann never just participated  in any activities—she was a supreme doer  and always a leader.  Throughout her years, she was president  and Sustainer of  the Year of The  Junior  League of Tampa, president of  the Lowry  Family Foundation and served on the board of  directors for The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center  & Research Institute. And in 1992, for all her  hard work, the Tampa Civitan Club gave her  the Citizen of the Year Award.  But above all these contributions, Ann will  be best remembered for her work on behalf of  children—in particular, her efforts to transform  The Children’s Home. Whether she was serving as  the organization’s president of  the  board of directors, chairwoman of the board of  trustees, associate director or director of development, Ann was constantly working not  only to improve the quality of care that The  Children’s Home provides, but also to spend  as much time as she could with the children  who depend on these services. For all her efforts,  it was  fitting  that  last year Voices  for  Children chose Ann as the first recipient of its  Guardian Angel Award.  Through  all  her  work,  Ann  was  an  unstoppable,  passionate  force  for  change.  There were no bounds to her compassion and  generosity. She was  truly a blessing  to  the  whole community.  On behalf of all of those who benefited so  greatly from her tireless efforts, I would like to  extend my deepest sympathies to Ann’s loved  ones. Ann shared so much with us. We can  only try to follow in her footsteps and do our  best to live up to her very high standards.  f  HONORING MS. BETTY B.  MICHALIGA  HON. JAMES P.

696,187,2005-06-08,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in recognizing the outstanding achievements of Mike Pfankuch, the outgoing president of the Carlsbad Hi-Noon Rotary Club. In  this 2004–2005 service, Mike has contributed  enormously  and made  a  tremendous  difference to the Rotary Club and the citizens of  Carlsbad.  Mike’s accomplishments are many and varied. Under his guidance, the Rotary Club has  completed and dedicated its three-year Centennial Project, the Carlsbad Hosp Grove Picnic Area. The project  included a cleanup of  the grove, the planting of 1,000 trees and the  donation of picnic tables and benches, a very  welcome amenity to the city.  In addition, the Second Annual Hi-Noon Rotary golf tournament fundraiser was successfully completed and  the  funds dedicated  to  providing scholarships to local high school students, a Rotaract Club has been established,  and the Annual Oktoberfest fundraiser sponsored  in  conjunction  with  the  Carlsbad  Evening Rotary Club completed a record year.  The 26,000 of proceeds was donated to the  Women’s Resource Center,  the Boys and  Girls Club of Carlsbad and Community Youth  Services. The Oktoberfest was a project originally initiated by the Hi-Noon Rotary Club.  Mike’s  leadership  is also making a difference to people in need of a helping hand.  He initiated a program to provide financial aid  to the Store Front, a San Diego organization  dedicated to helping homeless children get a  fresh start in life. During Mike’s tenure a number of other projects were completed which  enhanced public safety, provided volunteers  and supplies  to do maintenance and  repair  work for the elderly and needy in the community,  to distribute  food, clothing and  toys  to  needy families in conjunction with he Carlsbad  Christmas Bureau, and sponsored a Christmas party and dinner  for elementary school  children of very low income families.  During Mike’s tenure, in an effort to promote  literacy, a Dictionary Distribution program was  initiated and the Carlsbad Hi-Noon Rotarians  distributed English and Spanish dictionaries to  needy elementary school children.  On  the  international  front, Mike also provided extraordinary leadership by establishing  a Model UN Program, exposing high school  students to world affairs, led the way to provide sponsors for exchange students from foreign countries, initiated and obtained an AIDS  Education Program grant, initiated an aid program for the victims of the tsunami in Southeast Asia, and provided  the  leadership necessary to provide financial assistance for dental care and a dental clinic for the needy children of Honduras. In addition, during his tenure a partnership project was established with  a Rotary Club in Ensenada, Mexico to provide  water, electricity, plumbing and painting, a  project  that will benefit approximately 1,000  people.  Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join me in recognizing the many fine achievements of Mike  Pfankuch. Without question, his  leadership  and the fine work of the Carlsbad Hi-Noon Rotary Club are worthy of  recognition by  the  House today.  HONORING THE VOLUNTEERS OF  THE BATTLESHIP NEW JERSEY  HON.

697,187,2005-06-08,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the volunteers of the USS New Jersey,  which is located in my district in Camden, New  Jersey. The ship has been open to the public  since 2000 and is our Nation’s most decorated  battleship, having heroically served  in  three  major conflicts: World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.  The volunteers of the USS New Jersey are  responsible for many things on the ship, including  restoration and maintenance, giving  tours, clerical work, and educating the community about the ship and its history. Volunteers  work 7 days a week, rain or shine, and have  logged over 300,000 hours of volunteer time.  In  2000,  they won  the Governor’s  Volunteerism Award for their extraordinary work.

698,194,2005-06-08,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor John I. Southerland for his loyal service  to the community.  John  I. Southerland was born  in Sanford,  N.C.  to  the  late Annie Bell Southerland. He  graduated  from W.B. Wicker High School  in  1959, then relocated to New Jersey and later  to Brooklyn, N.Y. He is married to Eva Thomas Southerland and they are the proud parents  of  Jonathan  Southerland,  Stephanie  Southerland-Raimer and Nydia Southerland.  In 1968, Mr. Southerland  joined  the New  York City Police Department. During his 27  years with the department, he earned numerous commendations and certificates. He  received the Certificate of Merit for 27 years of  service and a Certificate of Attendance, which  is given to staff members who had not been  late or absent for five more years. After retiring  from  the Police Department  in 1995, he  pursued his interest in fire safety. He then received a certificate and worked as a fire safety  officer  in  the World Trade Center until September  11.  Also  during  the  1990’s, Mr.  Southerland was installed as a Deacon, by the  late Rev. Dr. Paul C. Hayes, at Mercy Seat  Baptist Church of Brooklyn.  In 2001, Mr. Southerland turned his attention to community advocacy. He is a member  of the Executive Board of the Community Action Project (CAP), a community organization  located in East Flatbush. As a board member,  he has met with  local politicians  to  lobby  against  fraudulent  immigration services and  rampant illegal truck traffic. Currently, he and  the board strive  to sustain  the area’s economic growth  through better coordination of  city services, specifically sanitation and police.  He is also attending Queens College to broaden his understanding of political activism  to  better serve his community.  Mr. Southerland  is an active member of  local DC 37. He was chosen as a delegate to  go to Albany to meet with state representative  to discuss issues pertaining to the union and  its members.  He continues  to show commitment  to  the  community by visiting  the sick and helping  senior citizens. He is always willing to share a  smile and words of encouragement with everyone he meets. As a result, Mr. Speaker, today  we acknowledge John I. Southerland, an asset  to the community.  f  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  NATIONAL  CHAMPION  KELLER  HIGH  SCHOOL GIRL’S SOFTBALL TEAM  HON.

",2005
703,2,2005-06-20,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  every year more than 3 million Americans have their identities stolen. That  is one every 10 seconds. These incredible statistics show that identity theft  both online and offline is not slowing  down. Just this past week we learned  of another incident where up to 40 million identities were compromised.  The  last Congress overwhelmingly  approved  legislation known  as  the  FACT Act, and President Bush signed  it into law. It helps you to protect your  identity by providing a free credit report every year,  requiring creditors  who  lent money  in your name to a  thief to help you clear your name, and  creating a single place where a fraud  alert can be put on your credit history  and honored all across America.  Congress has taken steps to strengthen identity theft laws, but the bad guys  are still out there, and commonsense  precautions are the key to help Americans from becoming victims.  Mr. Speaker, people do not give the  keys to their house to complete strangers, and that same lesson applies to  identity theft. I urge all Americans to  guard the keys to their identity as we  in Congress continue to find aggressive  solutions.  f  THE WAR IN IRAQ  (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2005
704,2,2005-06-20,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, depending on whom you listen to, the insurgents in Iraq are either in their last  throes or they are growing in size and  strength. But both the administration  and critics seem to agree that the U.S.  military will be deployed to Iraq for a  long time to come. It is our quagmire.  Every day our forces wake up in Iraq,  more die and are wounded, and more  families on the home front are strained  and  suffer  losses. At  some  terrible  point in the future, the Nation’s leaders will say, Enough is enough. Whether the number of casualties at that  point will be 5,000 or 10,000 or 50,000, I  do not know. Whether the cost at that  point will be $250 billion, $350 billion,  or $500 billion, I do not know. At some  point, the terrible arithmetic of the  war will add up to overwhelm everybody.  But this war can end another way. It  can end if enough Members of Congress  consider and cosponsor House Joint  Resolution 55, a bipartisan bill introduced last week to require the President to initiate troop withdrawal no  later than October 1, 2006. Thank the  troops, and bring them home. f  JUNETEENTH  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, there are many times that  this Nation has celebrated its freedom.  One that comes to mind is the celebration after the Revolutionary War, then  the celebration after Abraham Lincoln  pronounced the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. But today I rise to celebrate Juneteenth, a holiday that  is  now celebrated across the Nation, but  Texans and Louisianans know it well,  for because the Union soldiers were too  busy, the slaves in Texas, some 200,000,  did not know of emancipation until  1865.  When General Granger landed in Galveston, he read the words, ‘‘The people  of Texas are informed that in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the United States, all slaves  are free.’’ And so this weekend on June  19, across the State of Texas and Louisiana and around the Nation, we celebrated  freedom. We  sang, we  spoke  about freedom and the preciousness of  it. We thanked America for its values  and belief in freedom.  I would  like to thank State Representative Al Edwards, a Texan and a  constituent of my congressional district, who is known as the Father of  Juneteenth. It is important to honor  freedom wherever it is found. f  PRICE APPOINTMENT  OF  MEMBER  TO  BOARD OF VISITORS TO UNITED  STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  of Georgia).

707,9,2005-06-20,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes to pay  tribute to a longtime staffer of this defense subcommittee. This is the first  time that I have had the opportunity  to bring a defense appropriations bill  to  the  floor without having Kevin  Roper sitting here beside me and providing the staff assistance that he has  provided so eloquently.  He  served  this  committee  for  20  years, first as the aide to the thenranking member,  Congressman  Joe  McDade. Prior to the 20 years that he  served this committee in the minority  status and  the majority  status, he  served 10 years in the United States  Air Force. Kevin Roper is just a very,  very special patriot. His knowledge of  the defense establishment, his knowledge of the defense appropriations bill  is extremely unique. I am just really  proud to call him a friend. I am very,  very heavyhearted to announce that he  is leaving the committee to move on to  spending more time with his family,  his wife, and his children.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to recognize the  fact that this Kevin Roper  that I am speaking about, everyone on  the floor should recognize him. He has  been here so long. Kevin Roper, God  bless you for the good work you have  done. Thank you very much. We appreciate you. Mr. Chairman,  this  is  the  first  time  that  I  have brought a Defense Appropriations Bill to  the floor that I haven’t had Kevin Roper by my  side as the Staff Director of the Subcommittee  and as he leaves the Committee staff to pursue other interests, I wanted to let the record  show how much we all have valued his counsel over the years.  Kevin served the Appropriations Committee  for more than 20 years, and he had a distinguished career in the Air Force for 10 years  before that. He came to the committee in August of 1984 when he served as Congressman  and Ranking Minority member  Joe  McDade’s associate staff for Defense matters.  Joe appointed him to be the Minority staff director in 1988 when our dear friend George  Allen, his predecessor, passed away during an  official mission overseas.  When the Republicans became the majority  party in 1995, Kevin became the Majority staff  director serving both me and Chairman JERRY  LEWIS for the past 10 years in that capacity.  During that period of time he assisted me and  Chairman LEWIS in the preparation, passage,  and conference of 10 annual Defense Appropriation bills and more than 21 Supplemental  and wrap up bills which contained Defense  Chapters.  Kevin to this day loves his work and worked  tirelessly to assist us in providing our men and  women in uniform the tools they need to carry  out their mission. He joined us when we were  at the height of the cold war and assisted us  in bringing that era to a successful conclusion.

708,9,2005-06-20,Mr. NUSSLE.," Mr. Chairman, this measure— the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year  2006, H.R. 2863—is the most significant component of our wartime budget for America. It  funds the bulk of the national defense commitment, particularly the global war against terrorism. As Chairman of  the Budget Committee,  I am also pleased  to report  that  the  measure  is consistent with  the  levels established by  the conference  report  to H. Con.  Res. 95,  the concurrent  resolution on  the  budget for fiscal year 2006.  The budget resolution called for $441.6 billion  in discretionary budget authority  for  the  national defense function in 2006, and an additional $50 billion under a special Exemption  of Overseas Contingency Operations  that  would not count against  the Defense subcommittee’s 302(b) allocation. In this way the  budget  resolution anticipated costs  for continuing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. A  portion of the budget resolution’s total national  defense  funding went  toward  the  recently  passed military quality of life and energy and  water bills.  This bill provides the balance of $363.4 billion in new discretionary budget authority towards  funding  the President’s February defense budget request. It includes $45.3 billion  that has been designated pursuant to section  401(a) of the budget resolution for Overseas  Contingency Operations which are thereby exempt from the 302(b) allocations. These funds  will, however, be counted against the discretionary totals identified in the budget resolution.  Excluding the emergency portion, the bill’s  funding shows a 3.5-percent increase from the  previous year, and it builds on a 5-year average annual growth rate of 10.5 percent for defense appropriations. The base amount  is  equal  to  the 302(b) allocation  to  the House  Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.  I  should note that the bill includes rescissions of  prior year funds in the amount of $634 million  which enable it to meet this allocation.  Accordingly,  the bill complies with section  302(f) of the Budget Act, which prohibits consideration of bills in excess of an appropriations  subcommittee’s  302(b)  allocation  of  budget authority and outlays established in the  budget resolution.  One factor I wish to note is that the bill reduces funding for operations and maintenance  considerably from the President’s February request. Although there is a widespread belief  that any potential operations and maintenance  shortfall can simply be made up for with supplemental spending, Congress should avoid  making a regular practice of budgeting by supplemental for predictable events. There is also  a risk that cutting Defense spending may lead  to a commensurate increase in discretionary  non-defense spending. This would be inconsistent with the President’s request to put the  Nation’s security first by reducing non-defense  non-homeland security domestic discretionary  growth to less than 1 percent.  With that, I wish to reiterate my support for  H.R. 2863. ",2005
709,9,2005-06-20,Mr. KING of  Iowa.," Mr. Chairman,  terrorist  events have brought  this point  to  light, dramatically  illustrating how  the security of  the  United States is dependent upon its strength  in the area of foreign language competency. If  the United States is truly committed to continuing as the leader in the global economic  community, as well as  in  the on-going  fight  against terrorism dictated by the global war on  terrorism, some very serious commitments will  have to be made in support of language study.  Our history, and particularly our recent history,  has repeatedly illustrated the consequences of  not having adequate foreign language expertise available in times of crisis.  In 1988  the satellite communications  language training activities (SCOLA) became the  first broad-scale provider of authentic foreign  television and  today provides  this  resource  from 75 countries. From  the beginning  the  Federal Government has recognized  the  importance of authentic foreign programming as  a  tool  to help  teach  foreign  languages. By  watching and  listening, students are able  to  actually experience the foreign culture and develop their language skills in the native reallife environment. This programming is also a  vital intelligence resource since it provides significant insight into the internal happenings of  the various countries.  Throughout  its  long-time  relationship with  the Defense Language Institute (DLI), National  Security Agency  (NSA), Central  Intelligence  Agency (CIA), State Department, military and  other government sectors, SCOLA has been  particularly  responsive  to  requests  for programming  from specific areas of  the world,  with a major portion of  its current programming schedule developed as a direct result of  specific requests. In addition SCOLA offered  this resource  from regions of  the world  that  never really had a significant presence in the  United States before. SCOLA is a unique satellite-based language  training activity  that provides  television programming  in a  variety of  languages  from  around the world. Language students and seasoned linguists have found this augmentation  of  their normal  language  training  to be very  helpful. SCOLA also has an  Internet-based  streaming  video  capability  that  greatly  increases the availability of this training medium  to military and civilian linguists, virtually anywhere they can obtain an Internet connection.  In addition, SCOLA is developing a digital archive that will allow users anywhere to review  and sort language training information on demand. The development of these capabilities  will make SCOLA  training assistance much  more widely available, but requires additional  investment. The committee is concerned that  even after three years of encouragement from  the Congress, and in an operational environment where the value of language training is  of great importance to the nation, the Department of Defense has not fully funded the innovative  language  training concepts  that can  help sustain and significantly improve the skills  of military and civilian linguists in the Department.

713,37,2005-06-20,Mr. TIAHRT.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  support of Chairman HUNTER’s amendment  upholding  religious  freedom at  the United  States Air Force Academy. Protecting the religious freedom of our military cadets and service members is critically important to me, and  should be critically important to this Congress.  During  full committee consideration of  the  Defense Appropriations bill, Ranking Member  OBEY inserted a provision condemning the Air  Force, the Air Force Academy and its Cadets.  The allegations on which  this provision  is  based have not been substantiated by any  credible source. They are simply rumors advanced by a very few disgruntled individuals.  Nonetheless, the Air Force has taken these  allegations  very  seriously  since  they were  made in late April. First, the Academy established a new mandatory course to encourage  respect for all religions. Second, the Air Force  launched several investigations. These investigations are still ongoing and a report is expected shortly. The  task  force charged with  looking  into  these allegations has been directed to assess:  (1) Air Force and USAFA policy and guidance on the subject of religious respect and  tolerance.  (2) The appropriateness of relevant training,  for the cadet wing, faculty, and staff.  (3) The  religious climate and assessment  tools used at USAFA.  (4) The effectiveness of USAFA mechanisms to address complaints on this subject,  to include the chain of command, the Academy’s  Inspector General  and  the Military  Equal Opportunity office. (5) The practices of the chain of command,  faculty, staff or cadet wing that either enhance  or detract  from a climate  that respects both  the ‘‘free exercise of religion’’ and the ‘‘establishment’’ clauses of the First Amendment.  (6) The relevance of the religious climate at  the USAFA to the entire Air Force.  Additionally, the Task Force’s final assessment will include an Air Force Inspector General report on the removal of Air Force Captain Melinda Morton from her position at the  Academy.  The Air Force has made progress to ensure  that no one  feels pressure  from  religious  groups, and is continuing these efforts. This  final report should be released in the next couple of weeks. I have full confidence that this  report will provide a  thorough and complete  report as to the truth of these rumors.  Congress must reserve judgment until all of  the facts are revealed. The Air Force has yet  to tell its side of the story. Until they do, we  do not know what actually happened in Colorado Springs. For this House to condemn the  Air Force and the Academy at this time, before all the information is available, is wrong.  This provision simply has no place in an otherwise tremendous bill.  The Obey provision  is all  the more disappointing because men and women  in our  Nation’s Air Force have sacrificed  immeasurable blood and treasure to protect the principles of freedom and liberty. Today, we are  engaged in a global war on terrorism—aimed  directly at our Nation’s democracy and core  values. Our young men and women are fighting and dying for these freedoms. It is wrong  for Congress to chip away at the very freedoms  these heroes are shedding  their own  blood to protect. When a young man or woman stands up to  fight for this country, he or she does not surrender his or her Constitutional  rights. The  men and women of our military have the right  to freely practice their religion, and Congress  has a solemn duty  to  fight  to protect  their  rights.  I would ask my colleagues  to  join me  in  support of Chairman HUNTER’s amendment.  The Obey provision is wrong. It is bad policy,  and  it  is misguided, and  it  is  inappropriate.  Congress should wait to act until we have all  the facts. Please stand up for the Air Force,  the Academy,  the Cadets,  and  the First  Amendment  that guarantees every American  the  freedom of  religion. Vote  to  the Hunter  Amendment.

714,37,2005-06-20,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, I offer an  amendment to the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows: to the  Amendment offered by Mr. OBEY amendment offered by Mr. HUNTER: In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the following:  ‘‘Sec. 9012. Sense of Congress and Report  Concerning  Inappropriate Proselytizing of  United States Air Force Academy Cadets.  (a) SENSEOFCONGRESS.—It is the sense of  Congress that—  (1)  the expression of personal  religious  faith is welcome in the United States military, but coercive and abusive religious proselytizing at the United States Air Force  Academy by officers assigned to duty at the  Academy and others  in the chain-of-command at the Academy, as has been reported,  is inconsistent with the professionalism and  standards required of those who serve at the  Academy;  (2) the military must be a place of tolerance for all faiths and backgrounds; and  (3) the Secretary of the Air Force and  other appropriate civilian authorities, and  the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and other  appropriate military authorities, must continue to undertake corrective action, as appropriate, to address and remedy any inappropriate proselytizing of cadets at the Air  Force Academy that may have occurred.  (b) REPORTONPLAN.— (1) PLAN.—The Secretary of the Air Force  shall develop a plan to ensure that the Air  Force Academy maintains a climate  free  from coercive religious intimidation and inappropriate proselytizing by Air Force officials and others in the chain-of-command at  the Air Force Academy. The Secretary shall  work with experts and other recognized notable persons in the area of pastoral care and  religious tolerance to develop the plan.  (2) REPORT.—Not later than 60 days after  the date of the enactment of this Act, the  Secretary shall submit to the congressional  defense committees a report providing the  plan developed pursuant to paragraph  (1).  The Secretary shall include in the report information on the circumstances surrounding  the removal of Air Force Captain Melinda  Morton from her position at the Air Force  Academy on May 4, 2005.’’  ",2005
715,37,2005-06-20,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, what this  perfecting amendment does  is to restore with some minor changes the  basic  thrust of  the committee  language. Let me explain why I do this.  Two weeks ago, I appointed a young  man to the Air Force Academy. One  week later, he was killed by a drunken  driver. Now,  if that young man had  been fortunate enough to live so that  he could have gone to the Academy, I  would want his parents, his family and  his community, to know that the Academy that he was going to is one which  will allow him to practice whatever religion he believed, without any kind of  coercion, either from other cadets or  from anyone in the chain of command  at the Academy. I do not think that is  too much to expect.  I understand  the  gentleman  from  California is unhappy because he considers this to be an authorizing issue.  Well, the fact is the authorizing committee had an opportunity to deal with  similar  language, not  identical  but  similar language, when they considered  the authorization bill, and they declined to do so. That means that each  and every one of us as individual members of this place has jurisdiction on  this matter because we all appoint cadets to the Academy, and we have an  obligation to those cadets to tell them,  whether they are Catholic or Lutheran  or any kind of Protestant denomination or Jewish or Muslim or even if  they are of no religion, we have an obligation to assure them that they are  going to be going to an Academy that  is free from any kind of coercion, free  from any kind of ridicule.  That is what this language does. This  language in the committee bill which  would be modified only slightly by the  amendment I have  just offered, this  language maintains  the  integrity of  the thrust of the language of the original committee action. b1530  The purpose of this language is not  to accuse any individual person. We do  not in any way prejudge any individual  action. All we do is to say that the activities which have already been described and admitted by the academy  as having occurred, all we are saying is  that conduct is inappropriate to the  military. That conduct  is not something that the Congress of the United  States will stand for.  If Members believe in religious freedom, they have an obligation to stand  foursquare for sending a message that  we want  this problem corrected.  If  Members turn down this language and  adopt the Hunter language, you are removing  the  language which makes  VerDate jul 14 2003  23:58 Jun 21, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K20JN7.046 H20PT1 ",2005
716,44,2005-06-20,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order against  the amendment. ",2005
717,44,2005-06-20,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Chairman, I regret  that a point of order was raised, but I  do want to commend the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. YOUNG) for his outstanding  leadership  to  protect  our  country. He is a champion for national  security, a champion for our troops. I  respect him enormously. I wish he had  not raised this point of order.  I want to commend the chairman of  the  full  committee,  the  gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS), who is in  the Chamber right now, for his distinguished leadership on behalf of America’s troops and on behalf of our national security. They have worked in a  bipartisan manner with  our  distinguished ranking member, former chair  of the subcommittee, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA). By  working together with the gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS) in the last  session of Congress and on an ongoing  basis with the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. YOUNG), they have really tried  very hard to provide our troops with  what they need to do their job and to  come home safely and soon.  I also want to recognize the outstanding leadership of the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY), the ranking member of  the  full committee,  former chair of the committee. I think  these four gentleman have worked very  closely together, removed the doubt in  anyone’s minds that we understand our  obligation under the Constitution to  provide for the common defense and  they help us honor that commitment. I  thank them all.  The legislation that we are considering today contains in it another $45  billion for the war in Iraq that has already  consumed nearly  $200 billion,  ended the  lives of over 1,700 of our  troops, and thousands more Iraqis, and  changed  forever the  lives of tens of  thousands more who have been wounded in that war.  They were sent into the war without  the intelligence about where they were  going, what they were going to confront, without adequate equipment to  protect them and without a plan for  what would happen after the  fall of  Baghdad.  As  I  referenced  earlier,  the  gentleman  from California  (Mr. LEWIS),  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  MURTHA), the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. YOUNG), and the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY) have fought hard,  especially  the gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS) and the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA) last  year in the defense Committee on Appropriations to correct the inadequacy  of the equipment they had.  Many of us have visited with soldiers  in Iraq. Some of them are on their second tour of duty. I conveyed to these  brave soldiers, as I have to soldiers in  hospitals here and abroad, how grateful  the American people are to them for  their valor,  for their patriotism,  for  the sacrifices they are willing to make  for our country. They have performed  their duties with great courage and  skill, and we are deeply in their debt.  Disagreement with the policies that  sent our troops to Iraq and which keep  them in danger today in no way diminishes the respect and admiration that  we have for our troops. Sadly, the level  of their sacrifice has not been met by a  level of language by the administration, and now  the American people  agree that this war is not making us  safer.  Republican Senator Robert Taft of  Ohio, who in time became the Republican leader in the United States Senate, had this to say about our duty in  time of war as Members of Congress.  He said, ‘‘Criticism in time of war is essential to the maintenance of a governing democracy.’’  He was a Republican. This was World  War II. He was a Republican in the  Senate. He said that, and he was right.  It is in that spirit that I disagree  with those Republicans who continue  the course of action that we are on  now. When we went into this war, it  was a war of choice. President Bush  sent us into a war of choice, a preemptive war. When you have a war, you  have to go in with the preparation that  you have. But when  it  is a war of  choice, you have an increased responsibility to be prepared and to have a plan  for what happens after the fall of, in  this case Baghdad, but we have not. b1700  Vice President CHENEY at the time  said that our troops would be met with  rose petals.  Instead, they were met  with rocket-propelled grenades.  Under Secretary Wolfowitz said that  this is a country that can easily afford  its own reconstruction and soon, and  the U.S. taxpayer is still paying the  tab.  This is a war that each passing day  confirms what I have said before and I  will say again, that this war in Iraq is  a grotesque mistake. It is not making  America safer and the American people  know it.  Early on, the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. MURTHA)  said what a  Democratic, what a bipartisan proposal  should be as far as going into Iraq, that  with the fall of Baghdad, we should  move quickly to Iraqtize, to turn the  security of Iraq over to the Iraqis. We  should internationalize, that we should  form the diplomatic alliances in the region for the Iraqi government so that  our troops could accomplish their goals  militarily with the help of diplomacy.  It simply cannot be done alone.  The gentleman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr. MURTHA),  in  leading our House  Democrats on this issue, said that we  should energize, we must turn on the  light, we must have reconstruction in  Iraq, and because of some of the poor  planning or lack of planning, the reconstruction has taken much longer, is  much more costly, and again, the security is making it almost impossible.  You cannot go forward with the social services and the rest unless you  have a secure Iraq. You cannot have it  be secure and bring our troops home  unless you turn over that security responsibility to the Iraqis.  So we go to a place where we should  expect the least Congress should do is  to insist that the President provide the  details on how it will be determined  when the responsibility for Iraq’s security can be turned over to the Iraqis  and how Iraq’s economic and political  stability will be assessed. That is what  my  amendment  would  have  done,  would do, if it were made in order.  The failure by the President and his  administration to plan adequately for  the conduct of war to date has made it  all the more imperative that Congress  ensure  the  planning  be  done  competently for bringing our troops home.  If our troops are to leave when the mission has succeeded, we need to know  how success will be defined.  Despite the manner in which the administration has chosen to  fund the  war, relying totally on supplemental  appropriations up until now, as though  it was a surprise that keeping hundreds  of thousands of military personnel in  and near Iraq would have a cost, our  commitment in Iraq cannot be openended. Congress should have insisted  long ago that the limits on that commitment be publicly shared and well  understood.  The Iraq money in this bill is described as a bridge fund. Congress and  the American people have a right to  ask: A bridge to what? A bridge to  where? The  report  required by my  amendment would have built on the report request in the recently enacted  supplemental appropriations bill and  help answer that question, and that request was agreed to  in a bipartisan  way. This is really an endorsement of  that, taking it from report language,  putting it into law and raising its profile so the administration knows that  it must answer those questions in the  supplemental.  Republicans  apparently  prefer  to  keep their heads in the sand and continue to provide money for the Iraq  War with no questions asked.  Congress did not discharge  its responsibility to oversee these policies at  the start of the war, and it has not  done so since. The American people deserve better. More  importantly, Mr.  Chairman, our  troops who  serve  in  harm’s way deserve better. They are  owed more by those who sent them  there than lack of planning.  We must do everything in our power  to honor our obligation to our troops.  Only then will we be fulfilling our responsibility.

718,51,2005-06-20,Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia.," Mr.  Chairman, reclaiming my time, this  does not add a percentage. This does  not add a nickel to the small business  set-aside program. It does not add a  percentage. It just shifts the burden.  And the argument ought to be going  into the particular designated industry  groups  where  the  gentlewoman  is  claiming  small  businesses  used  to  dominate and are losing out, and let us  look at those and let us try to be fair  in that way.  But for heaven’s sake, in areas like  lawn care, in some of these services  levels that are low tech, let us not set  aside small businesses set-asides there  where  small businesses dominate  in  full and open competition. Let us put  them in areas where we can improve it.  Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",2005
719,51,2005-06-20,Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia.," I yield  to the gentlewoman from New York.  Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, the  Department of Defense is saying that  immediately small businesses will get  $4.4 billion if this is fixed.  ",2005
720,51,2005-06-20,Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia.," Mr.  Chairman, reclaiming my time, they  may get it here, but they will take it  away from set-asides in other areas because the overall set-aside percentages  in  these participating agencies does  not change at all. So the problem with  that is that we are shifting it and we  are moving  the  small business  setasides into areas that small businesses  also dominate.  I will refer the gentlewoman, frankly, to the statute in the areas that are  the designated industry groups under  the statute, and I think  it  is clear  looking at this that many of these  areas, siding contractors, roofing, masonry, framing contractors, these are  areas that are traditionally dominated  by small business and will continue to  be.  But I will be happy to work with the  gentlewoman on designated  industry  groups and changing that around if she  can make the case.  ",2005
721,51,2005-06-20,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, this Velazquez amendment  is an effort to kill the Small  Business  Comp Demonstration  program. The issue is more appropriately  settled in the authorizing committee  and not on an appropriations bill.  First of all, the Comp Demonstration  program does not cost the taxpayers  one dime. There is no money appropriated for it. The Small Business Competitive Demonstration program began  in 1988 with three purposes: first, to  help emerging small businesses; second,  to expand  the participation of  small businesses and  industries that  were traditionally dominated by large  businesses; and, third, to test the competitiveness of small businesses in industries in which small businesses are  well represented. The Comp Demo program was renewed in 1992, made permanent in 1997, and slightly expanded in  2004 as a part of larger bills that passed  by wide margins or unanimous consent.  Prior to the adoption of the Comp  Demonstration program,  small businesses were  relegated  to  industries  dominated by small businesses. Federal  agencies could say they met their overall small business goals while not doing  much  to provide more contracts  to  small businesses in more higher-end,  higher-paying  industries. The Comp  Demo program ended this practice all  while showing that small businesses  are still competitive in the industries  where they have been historically well  represented. These  industries  include  construction, garbage collection, architectural  engineering,  surveying  and  mapping, non nuclear shipbuilding and  ship repair, landscaping, and pest control. The Comp Demo program requires  that small businesses receive a  ‘‘fair  proportion’’ of government contracts  in each industry rather than just a few.  The principles upon which the program were established are still valid.  Emerging small businesses still need  help. Small businesses need to participate in industries in which they have  traditionally not had a chance to obtain a Federal contract.  I would urge my colleagues to vote  ‘‘no’’ on the Vela´zquez amendment. ",2005
722,51,2005-06-20,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Chairman,  I move to strike the requisite number  of words.  (Mr. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was  given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2005
723,51,2005-06-20,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Chairman,  not very often will Members hear me  contradict the ranking member of the  Committee on Small Business. But I  rise in opposition to this amendment  and will include my entire statement  in the RECORD.  I rise in opposition to this amendment, even though I have the utmost  respect for its author and have long appreciated her work and her leadership  on so many issues which have come before this House.  But the amendment before the House  today attempts to effectively repeal  the Small Business Competitiveness  Demonstration Program Act of 1988,  better known as the  ‘‘Comp Demo’’  law, by prohibiting the use of funds to  carry out its implementing provisions.  Comp Demo has not been an effective  tool for over 17 years in helping assure  that small businesses across a wide  array of industries gain Federal contracts. Equally important, Comp Demo  does not affect contracts which are setaside for minority-owned, socially disadvantaged, and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.  From its inception, the Comp Demo  law has sought to address the tendency  of agencies to disproportionately rely  upon a small number of NAICS codes to  meet  their  small business  set-aside  goals rather than  finding and developing a broad array of codes  from  which to meet these goals, a practice  which, if unremedied, would have the  practical  effect of precluding  small  businesses outside those disproportionately used  industries  from assessing  the benefits of the small business setaside program.  And that is why I oppose this amendment. The Comp Demo law has proven  its effectiveness during its 17-year history. It is fair to small businesses interested  in Federal contracting and  assures that Federal agencies meet the  spirit and the letter of the law regarding small business set-asides.  I agree with those who would suggest  that this program, as well as practically all, need to undergo changes  and need to be shaped in a better way  to help make absolutely certain that  small  businesses  have  the  greatest  amount of opportunity to procure business from the Federal Government.  However, I also believe that small  businesses that have reached a certain  level of their being also need the opportunity to continue to grow and to develop, that small businesses that might  be part of franchises but are nevertheless small businesses need the opportunity to participate.  And for those reasons, I would be in  disagreement with this amendment. I  urge that it be not approved and would  look forward to working with all of  those who would want to work to try  to reshape the law in such a manner  that it would be more fair and more equitable to small businesses. Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in opposition  to  the  amendment by the gentlelady from New York,  Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ, and I ask unanimous consent  that my entire statement be  included  in  the  RECORD.  I rise in opposition to this amendment even  though I have the utmost respect for its author  and I have long appreciated her good work on  so many other issues which have come before  this House.

Jake  passed away at the age of 91, peacefully, on Saturday. He had a long career here in Washington, having served  as a night watchman over in the Cannon Building, a job he told me he never  did very well, but he sure worked night  and day in the 31 years that he served  here in the House of Representatives,  working with colleagues on both sides  of the aisle, bringing not only his legislative talents but his tremendous good  humor.  He has more stories than anyone can  remember, many  of  them  collected  with his daughter Peggy in a book. We  have got an elementary school, a research center and a Federal building  named after him, but I think he lives  on  in the hearts of the many who  worked with him here in Washington  and certainly in the lives of the thousands of people he helped in central  Texas, most of whom have a squeaky  green pickle  to  remember him by,  along with his many good deeds.  Services will be at  4 o’clock on  Wednesday in Austin.

730,65,2005-06-20,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, I have listened to my colleagues  with great interest tonight.  Three  issues  seem  to  have  been  raised. One is on CAFTA, which I will  address tonight, and then we talked  about Guantanamo, which I am going  to try to address later this week. Then  we will talk about Iraq because there  are parallels between what we are seeing in Iraq right now and what happened in World War I and World War II,  but I cannot cover all those tonight. So  I will debate my colleagues on some of  those other issues later this week.  Let me talk about CAFTA right now  because the gentlewoman  from Ohio  (Ms. KAPTUR), my  good  friend,  for  whom I have the highest regard, was  just talking about some of the problems that occur with women in Central  and South America and the living conditions and  the working conditions,  and I agree with her.  Because of that, and a number of  other reasons, I voted against NAFTA  and worked with my colleague on that,  and I voted against the WTO and the  General Agreement  on Tariffs  and  Trade. So you probably ask, well, why  in the world, Danny, would you be in  favor of CAFTA  if you opposed all  those others? So I want to tell my colleagues tonight why I support CAFTA.  First of all, we have what is known  as the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and  the Caribbean Basin Initiative is kind  of a one-way street right now. We allow  the Caribbean countries and Central  American countries to export into the  United States without tariffs while at  the same time, when we send stuff into  those countries, we do have to pay tariffs in many cases. So the bottom line  is it is a one-way street.  The Caribbean Basin Initiative will  go by the wayside if we pass CAFTA,  and we will have a  two-way  street  where there will be minimal tariffs or  no tariffs whatsoever, and so our producers will benefit the same as the producers in Central America and the Caribbean. I think that is one reason why  I think CAFTA is a better deal than  what we see with the Caribbean Basin  Initiative.  The second thing is that we need to  see  stability  in Central and South  America. President Reagan, when he  was President, worked very hard to  create democracy in our hemisphere,  and as a result of the Reagan doctrine,  all of the countries  in Central and  South America became  fledgling democracies over the past few decades  with the exception of Cuba. We are  starting to see cracks in those democracies because of  the poverty down  there and because of some leftist leaders. We see problems in four or five, six  countries in Central and South America right now, and one of the things  that we need to do is to address the  issue of poverty down there.  One way to do that is to try to see  some foreign investment going in there  from places besides China and Europe  into Central and South America  so  that we see a reduction in the poverty  rate and a reduction in the pressure  that is being brought about on the existing democracies down there to move  toward leftist governments.  If we have a change, a sea change in  those countries in Central and South  America, then what is going to happen  is  the  illegal  immigration problems  MENENDEZ)  that we see right now will be magnified. They will grow because people  want to flee tyranny. They want to flee  conflict, and if you start seeing revolutionary activity take place, like that  which we saw in El Salvador in the  1980s, and in Nicaragua in the 1980s and  elsewhere, then you are going to see  people saying, I am getting the heck  out of here; I am going north; I am  going to the United States. Our border  is very porous. We have a terrible time  controlling it right now. We have millions of people that have come across  that border that are now in the United  States that cost our taxpayers money  and cause a lot of hardship and problems.  So stabilizing those governments in  Central and South America I think is  extremely  important.  I am now the  chairman of the Subcommittee on the  Western Hemisphere on the Committee  on International Relations, and I have  had a chance, along with my colleague  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  to  start  looking at  this  issue. We may not agree on this, but I  think it is important that we go down  there and look at these countries and  find out how we can make sure there  are stable governments in place and  that we do not see democracies start to  deteriorate and go by the wayside.  So I feel it is very important that we  look at this from more than just one  point of view. Trade is important. Job  loss by Americans is very important. I  am  concerned  about  both  of  those  things. A two-way street in trade with  no tariffs I think is also very important, but also one of the major issues  as far as I am concerned is the stabilization of democracy in our hemisphere. If we do not, as a leader of  democratic institutions in this hemisphere and around the world, take the  initiative to stabilize those countries,  who in the heck will?  So I still believe  in  free and  fair  trade. I would not vote  for NAFTA  today.  I would not vote  for GATT  today. I would not vote for the WTO  today, but  I am going  to vote  for  CAFTA, and the reason I am voting for  CAFTA is for the reason I just said. I  think it is extremely important to not  only worry about trade and balance but  also about national security and immigration, and I hope my colleagues at  least understand where I stand on this  issue because I love you guys. f  ",2005

733,72,2005-06-20,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the extraordinary life and service to our  country of former Congressman Peter Rodino,  one of the nation’s finest public servants. I am  honored to have served with such a remarkable American, and am humbled  to have  called him my colleague and friend.  From the streets of his beloved Newark, to  North Africa and Italy during World War II, to  our Nation’s capital, Peter Rodino spent his  life selflessly striving  to help, protect, and  serve others, all the while doing so with the utmost dignity and humility.  During his  twenty  terms  in  the House of  Representatives from 1949 to 1989, Peter Rodino championed his convictions on civil rights  and equal opportunity, no matter what  the  cost, and was a key sponsor of the landmark  Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Mr. Speaker, it was his tenure as Chairman  of  the House Judiciary Committee presiding  over  the Watergate  Impeachment hearings  that thrust Peter Rodino into the limelight. During this contentious time in which political tensions  ran high, his  restraint and sensibility  quelled unchecked passions on both sides as  he served as model of decorum  for all. His  profound words on  the subject, uttered  in  1974, still ring true today, and contain the type  of  foresight  that only  true  leaders posses:  ‘‘Whatever  the  result, whatever we  learn or  conclude, let us now proceed with such care  and decency and thoroughness and honor that  the vast majority of American people, and their  children after them, will say: That was the right  course. There was no other way.’’  One of my fondest memories of Peter, Mr.  Speaker, was  the evening my wife Annette  and  I spent with him at one of  the annual  Gymnasium Dinners during  the  time  that he  was still serving as a Member of Congress. It  was an evening that we will never forget as he  reminisced about his extraordinary political career and his personal recollections of Watergate.  Mr. Speaker, as public servants let us always remember his words as the highest example of leadership and integrity. ",2005
734,72,2005-06-20,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker,  this Nation  and the great State of New Jersey has lost  one of its foremost public servants. Congressman Peter Rodino was a man who truly honored the law, and when the country called on  him in time of crisis, Mr. Rodino rose to greatness. I will always remember Peter Rodino for  faithfully honoring the values that brought him  to prominence in our Nation’s history: honesty,  humility, patience, and service.  Peter Rodino represented the district of New  Jersey in which he lived his whole life. Born in  Newark,  he worked  his way  through  law  school and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941.  He was awarded  the Bronze Star  for valor  during World War II. He continued to serve his  country in the House, elected to the 81st Congress in 1949. He served for 40 years, retiring  in 1989, and  turning his seat over  to my  friend, the Honorable DONALDPAYNE.  Most of us will remember Peter Rodino for  his superb leadership of the House Judiciary  Committee  during  the Nixon  Impeachment  Hearings. His patient and deliberative style  gave  the  proceedings  real  credibility,  and  helped to hold the country together at a time  of great upheaval. His reverence to the Constitution ensured that the painful and difficult  hearings proceeded as our forefathers had envisioned. Peter Rodino was called upon by his  country in time of crisis, and he rose to the  challenge.  Peter Rodino will be sorely missed. In an  age of bitter partisanship, Mr. Rodino was a  calming voice. He guided the country through  one of  its darkest periods  in recent history,  and did so with grace and humility. Mr. Rodino’s legacy of service to his country and his  fellow man will surely be  remembered  for  years to come.  ",2005
735,72,2005-06-20,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor to pay tribute to former judiciary chairman Peter Rodino, he was a champion of civil  rights and a beacon of justice during his 40  year tenure in Congress and his 16 years as  a Seton Hall Professor of Law.  Mr. Rodino was most famous for his handling of the Watergate crisis. All sides—including Democrats, Republicans, and even the national press—hailed Rodino  for  the  fair and  just hand he used to guide the impeachment  hearings. During this period of crisis, his courage and wisdom provided  the  foundation of  strong leadership that gave Members the confidence to do what was right, even if it meant  crossing party lines. The issue became one of  preserving the sanctity of the system, rather  than preserving the reputation of an individual.  Throughout the process, Rodino’s commitment  to the system never wavered.  The son of Italian immigrants, Peter Rodino  came of age  in Newark, New Jersey. After  leaving high school, Congressman Rodino endured 10 years of menial jobs while studying  late into the night for a law degree at New Jersey Law School.  In 1938 his patience and  dedication was  rewarded when he  joined a  local law firm. He put his newly found career  on hiatus when he chose to defend his Nation  against injustice in World War II. Mr. Rodino’s  strong  character and determination earned  him not only a Bronze star, but also a Knight  of Order of Crown from Italy—a token of national gratitude  for a  soldier’s accomplishments. Upon return he decided to run for Congress. Although his first attempt failed, his perseverance and strong work ethic served him  well, and he was elected to Congress in 1948.  A strong advocate of racial equality, he was  a driving force behind the Civil Rights Act of  1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Another accomplishment  in  the  long  list of Mr.  Rodino’s  notable  achievements was  sponsoring the bill that made Columbus Day a national holiday to commemorate the contribution  of  Italian Americans  in  the  founding of our  great Nation. Mr. Rodino also contributed to  the legislation that made Martin Luther King’s  birthday a national holiday.  Though Mr. Rodino will be remembered for  so much more  than  the Watergate crisis,  it  was undoubtedly his greatest moment. Rodino  allowed a moderate central group of both  Democrats and Republicans  to develop  the  case for impeachment, preventing it from turning it into any type of political ploy. Just last  year, Mr. Rodino gave an interview stating that  there are lessons to be learned from Watergate, namely  the extent of Government corruption. Mr. Rodino understood that it was the  duty of Congress to rein in any administration  or individual that was not adhering to the principles of justice.  It is with great respect and admiration that  I offer my condolences to Mr. Rodino’s wife,  Joy, and their family. Mr. Rodino is survived  by two children, Margaret Stanziale and Peter  W. Rodino  III,  three  grandchildren, Carla  Prunty, Maria Stanziale and Talia Rodino, and  twin great-grandchildren, Annabel and Charlotte Prunty. When asked about her husband,  Joy says, ‘‘He was so ahead of his time. He  lived civil rights. He lived equality. In his life,  he didn’t see color, he didn’t see sex. He just  went for the equality of the person.’’ Former  Representative Rodino was a man that I was  proud to have worked with and honored to call  friend.

After all, Peter Rodino was the child  of immigrants, living and growing up  in poverty in New Jersey and, as was  said before, his ascension to chairman  of the Committee on the Judiciary was  not something that people might have  guessed would happen when he was  born in Newark.

749,93,2005-06-20,Mr. LUGAR.," He has negotiated in good  faith on this issue. Unfortunately, time  after time some on the other side keep  moving the goalpost. I know they do  not  like that term, but every time  there  is  something answered,  every  time this gets ready for a vote, there is  always a new allegation, a new request,  something else to delay a vote on this  nomination. Obstruction in this case,  as in many others, has gone on for too  long.  It  is  time  to  vote  on John  Bolton’s nomination. The  continued  delaying tactics can only be viewed as  obstructionism for petty partisan reasons.  This nomination has received inordinate scrutiny and review. Yet opponents of voting up or down continue to  demand even more information. This  position has been vacant for 5 months,  we need  to have a conclusion. Mr.  Bolton has an exemplary career in public  service. The  extensive oversight  that the Senate has undertaken in considering this nomination means that  Senators ought to have the guts to get  out of these cushy seats and vote yes or  vote no. Anyone who votes to continue  to obstruct  this nomination can be  fairly characterized as delaying and obstructing the much needed, reforms in  the United Nations. And it is also contrary to the will of the American people.  I yield the floor.  ",2005
750,93,2005-06-20,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, I will  cast my vote today in opposition to  ending the debate on the nomination of  John Bolton to be the U.S. Ambassador  to the United Nations.  I am distressed the administration  has not provided the Congress with the  documents it has requested that are essential for judging the quality of Mr.  Bolton’s performance in his past positions. When the President sends the  Congress a request for approval of a  nominee for a top position, the President must be prepared to assist Congress in a thorough inspection of that  individual’s prior Government service.  Withholding  information  needed  by  Congress, even classified  information  that can be handled in a secure fashion,  is detrimental to the successful functioning of our Government. The administration’s full cooperation with Congress is not optional, but essential.  If Mr. Bolton’s nomination comes to  the full Senate for a vote, I plan to  vote no. I do not oppose him because of  his skeptical view of the UN. I do not  oppose him because he believes the UN  should be reformed. If the President  wants to change U.S. policy toward the  UN, he has the right to choose an ambassador who will attempt to do so.  The Congress  should  evaluate  that  nominee on his or her ability to do the  job for which the individual has been  selected.  I am opposing Mr. Bolton because his  past record leads me to believe he does  not have the skills to do the job of Ambassador to the UN.

751,107,2005-06-20,Mr. SALAZAR.," Mr. President, I rise  today to remember one of Colorado’s  fallen heroes, Marine LCpl Chad Bryant Maynard who was killed last week  in Ar Ramadi, Iraq. He was only 19  years old.  Lance Corporal Maynard hailed from  Montrose, CO, on the Western Slope.  Growing up, it was his dream to serve  his country. Chad Maynard’s deep patriotism was a family tradition—his father served  in the Marines, and his  brother Jacob returned from his second  tour in Iraq a few months ago.  As a high school student, Chad had  secretly contacted recruiters when he  was 16 about his wish to join the Marines.  His  parents  remember  him  sneaking recruiting brochures into the  house. The recruiters had to ask him to  stop contacting them until he was 18.  But Lance Corporal Maynard was determined  to  serve his  country. He  joined the junior ROTC at Montrose  High School. One of his friends once  quipped,  ‘‘God rested on the seventh  day and on the eighth day made Maynard for the Marines. . . .’’ He worked  hard at his classes so he could graduate  early to go to boot camp. At his 2004  graduation from Montrose High, Chad  Maynard stood proudly in his Marine  Corps dress uniform.  Lance Corporal Maynard’s  friends  and  instructors remember him as a  young man who took his commitment  to his country very seriously. On September 11, Lance Corporal Maynard organized a prayer around the flagpole at  school. He sought out the Marines because he wanted to be on the front  lines, making a difference for his country.  Today in Montrose is the funeral for  Lance Corporal Maynard. Just 1 year  and 6 days after he picked up his diploma, Chad Maynard was taken from  us, a  life of  extraordinary promise  snuffed out all too soon. He served his  Nation with honor and distinction.  LCpl Chad Maynard set an example  for all those around him to follow and  left a positive mark on every life he  touched. Chad’s brave and selfless actions have made the world a better and  safer place for all of us and we owe him  a debt of gratitude which we will never  be able to pay. To his wife Becky and  their soon-to-be-born child, I send my  humble thanks for Chad’s sacrifice on  our behalf. Your family will remain in  my thoughts and prayers.  f  LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT  ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005  ",2005
752,107,2005-06-20,Mr. SMITH.," Mr. President, I speak  about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator KENNEDY  and I introduce hate crimes legislation  that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal  that violence of any kind is unacceptable  in our  society. Likewise, each  Congress I have come to the floor to  highlight a separate hate crime that  has occurred in our country.  A 17-year-old transgender woman and  her 18-year-old friend were shot in the  head while sitting in a SUV, which was  set on fire. The SUV was found in an  isolated parking lot after the two had  been missing for a day. Their bodies  were burned beyond recognition. The  perpetrator allegedly killed the two  victims when he discovered that one of  them was a crossdresser.  The Government’s first duty is to defend  its  citizens,  to  defend  them  against the harms that come out of  hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can  become substance. I believe that by  passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and  minds as well.  f  CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN  DARFUR  ",2005
753,107,2005-06-20,Mr. CORZINE.," Mr. President, Senator BROWNBACKand I have submitted  a resolution to designate July 15–17,  2005 as a National Weekend of Prayer  and Reflection to draw attention to the  genocide and Crimes Against Humanity  occurring in Darfur, Sudan, and to find  a solution to this great moral challenge. The resolution calls upon the  people of the United States to pray and  reflect.  Churches,  synagogues,  mosques, other communities of faith,  and all individuals of compassion will  join together to acknowledge, observe,  and reflect upon the crimes against humanity  that  continue  to  occur  in  Darfur, so that we can together end the  genocide and bring about lasting peace  to Sudan.  The  Congress  and  administration  have already defined the atrocities in  Darfur as genocide. Estimates of the  death toll range from 180,000 to 400,000.  More  than  two million people have  been displaced from their homes, including over 200,000 refugees in Chad.  Recent accounts of these atrocities, as  reported by Doctors without Borders,  include documented rapes by soldiers  and government-backed militia.  Many  religious and human  rights  leaders, communities, and institutions  throughout the world have already spoken out, and called for an end to the  genocide. In my own state, thousands  participated in a Darfur Sabbath Weekend on May 14–15, 2005, when clergy and  congregations throughout New Jersey  addressed this crisis during their worship services. With my friend and colleague Representative DONALDPAYNE, I  was privileged to visit a mosque, a synagogue, a Catholic rectory, an African  American Baptist Church and a United  Methodist Church during  those  two  days.  Whatever  the  denomination,  we  spoke to each other in the same language, and committed ourselves to the  same determination to act according to  our words and the dictates of our universal conscience. That profound experience impels me to this broader outreach. I want to take this opportunity  to urge my fellow members of Congress  to join me in saying, ‘‘never again.’’  Never again, will we accept the slaughter  of  fellow human  beings. Never  again, will we stand by as systematic  crimes are inflicted upon humanity. I  ask  that  you  join  me,  Senator  BROWNBACK and people all across the  globe in supporting this unified movement to tell the world that humanity  will never again allow genocide  to  occur.  f  NATIONAL HISTORY DAY  ",2005
754,107,2005-06-20,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President, I  salute today the students who participated in the National History Day national contest that was held last week  at the University of Maryland. More  than  700,000  students  in  grades  6  through 12 from all over the country  chose topics, researched, and presented  their projects at State and local competitions this year. I am proud that 52  students  from Tennessee made  it to  Washington. I especially want to recognize two of those students, Daniel Jordan and Tyler Sexton, eighth graders  at St. John Neumann School in Knoxville.  Their National History Day project is  a documentary on Sequoyah’s Syllabary, which  they  presented  at  the  Smithsonian American Art Museum.  Sequoyah was a Cherokee warrior who  was born in east Tennessee and created  a syllabary, which is often called the  Cherokee alphabet. He was born in 1776  in the village of Tuskeegee, which was  very  near Vonore, TN, where  the  Sequoyah Birthplace Museum  is  located.  Daniel and Tyler say the seed  for  their documentary was planted during  a visit to the Sequoyah Birthplace Museum. The two boys got tired and decided to sit on several bales of hay in  the center of a field.

Cam has inspired a generation of ice  hockey fans in Boston and New England, and throughout the Nation with  his extraordinary skill and brilliant accomplishments. He  is  truly  one  of  hockey’s immortals, and he eminently  deserves this high honor.  In addition, he is also well-known to  all of us in Boston for his good citizenship and impressive participation in inspiring our community.  I am submitting a resolution today  to honor Cam Neely for his on-ice accomplishments and also  for his continuing  commitment  to  charitable  causes in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  S. RES. 176  Whereas on June 8, 2005, Cam Neely was  elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Canada, and will be formally inducted  into the Hall of Fame on November 7, 2005;  Whereas as a member of the Boston Bruins,  Cam Neely became one of ice hockey’s greatest players, defining the position of ‘‘power  forward’’;  Whereas although his career was cut short  when he retired at the age of 31 due to injury, Cam Neely scored 395 goals and had 299  assists in 726 games in his brilliant career;  Whereas Cam Neely led the Boston Bruins  in goals for 7 seasons, led the team in scoring  for 2 seasons, and was the team’s all-time  leader in goals during playoffs;  Whereas Cam Neely had three 50-goal seasons for the Boston Bruins, including back-  to-back 50-goal seasons in 1989–1990 and 1991–  1992;  Whereas Cam Neely, returning to the Boston Bruins after an injury in 1993–1994, scored  50 goals and was awarded the National Hockey League’s Bill Masterton Trophy as the  ‘‘player who best exemplifies the qualities of  perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication  to hockey’’;  Whereas Cam Neely, number 8, became the  tenth Boston Bruin to be honored by having  his uniform number retired;  Whereas Cam Neely continues to provide  invaluable assistance to charitable causes in  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the establishment of the Neely House  and the Neely Foundation, which comfort,  support, and offer hope to cancer patients  and their families: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate—  (1) honors the extraordinary achievements  of Cam Neely during his brilliant career in  ice hockey with the Boston Bruins;  (2) commends Cam Neely for his recent and  eminently well-deserved induction into the  Hockey Hall of Fame; and  (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to  transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution  to:  (A) Cam Neely;  (B) Jeremy Jacobs, owner of the Boston  Bruins;  (C) Harry Sinden, president of the Boston  Bruins; and  (D) Mike Sullivan, head coach of the Boston Bruins.  f  SENATE RESOLUTION 177—ENCOURAGING THE PROTECTION OF THE  RIGHTS OF REFUGEES  Mr. KENNEDY  (for  himself, Mr.  BROWNBACK, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. DEWINE,  Mr. LIEBERMAN, Ms. SNOWE, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. COLEMAN, and Mr. LAUTENBERG) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:  S. RES. 177  Whereas the Convention Relating to the  Status of Refugees dated July 28, 1951 (189  UST  150)  (hereinafter  referred  to as  the  ‘‘Convention’’) and the Protocol Relating to  the Status of Refugees done at New York  January 31, 1967 (19 UST 6223) (hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘Protocol’’) provide that individuals who flee a country to avoid persecution deserve international protection;  Whereas such protection includes freedom  from forcible return and the basic rights necessary for a refugee to live a free, dignified,  self-reliant life, even while in exile;  Whereas such rights, as recognized in the  Convention, include the right to earn a livelihood, to engage  in wage-employment or  self-employment, to practice a profession, to  own property, to freedom of movement and  residence, and to receive travel documents;  Whereas such rights are applicable to a refugee independent of whether a solution is  available that would permit the refugee to  return to the country that the refugee fled;  Whereas such rights are part of the core  protection mandate of the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees;  Whereas warehoused refugees have been  confined to a camp or segregated settlement  or otherwise deprived of their basic rights;  Whereas more than 50 percent of the refugees in the world are effectively warehoused  in a situation that has existed for at least 10  years;  Whereas donor countries,  including  the  United States, have typically offered less developed countries hosting refugees assistance  if they keep refugees warehoused  in  camps or segregated settlements but have  not provided adequate assistance to host  countries that permit refugees to live and  work among the local population; and  Whereas warehousing  refugees not only  violates the rights of the refugees but also  debilitates their humanity, often reducing  the refugees to enforced  idleness, dependency, disempowerment, and despair: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved, That the United States Senate—  (1) expresses deep appreciation and gratitude for those States which have and continue to host refugees and offer refugee resettlement;  (2) denounces the practice of warehousing  refugees, which is the confinement of refugees to a camp or segregated settlement or  other  deprivation  of  the  refugees’  basic  rights in a protracted situation, as a denial  of basic human rights and a squandering of  human potential;  (3) urges the Secretary of State to actively  pursue models of refugee assistance that permit refugees to enjoy all the rights recognized in the Convention and the Protocol;  (4) urges the Secretary of State to encourage other donor nations and other members  of the Executive Committee of the United  Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees’  Programme to shift the incentive structure  of refugee assistance and to build mechanisms into relief and development assistance  to encourage the greater enjoyment by refugees of their rights under the Convention;  (5) encourages the international community, including donor countries, host countries, and members of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ Programme, to denounce  resolutely the practice of warehousing refugees in favor of allowing refugees to exercise  their rights under the Convention;  (6) calls upon the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees to monitor refugee situations more effectively for the realization of all the rights of refugees under the  Convention, including those related to freedom of movement and the right to earn a  livelihood;  (7) encourages those countries that have  not yet ratified the Convention or the Protocol to do so;  (8) encourages those countries that have  ratified the Convention or the Protocol, but  have done so with reservations on key articles pertaining to the right to work and freedom of movement, to remove such reservations; and  (9) encourages all countries to enact legislation or promulgate policies to provide for  the legal enjoyment of the basic rights of  refugees as outlined in the Convention.

These  ‘‘warehoused’’ refugees are denied basic  rights under the Convention, such as  the right to work, to move freely, and  to receive a basic education.

In Tanzania, nearly 400,000 refugees  from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo are confined  in  13  camps along the western border. Some  of these camps have existed for more  than a decade. Many refugees confined  in these camps find it extremely difficult to find employment, let alone obtain other basic necessities of  life.

758,170,2005-06-20,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker, beginning in Fiscal Year 2001 Congress began providing funds for a vessel time charter for the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to use in addressing the critical  hydrographic survey backlog. The vessel time  charter added a third method of acquiring the  data needed to update and improve the hydrographic  charts  of  our  nation’s waterways.  These charts are essential for our national security, defense and economy. NOAA now uses  (1)  its own hydrographic survey vessels, (2)  data—contracts under the Brooks Act, and (3)  a long-term, multi-year, vessel lease/charter of  a private sector vessel with contract hydrographers.  The long-term vessel lease/charter, is now  completing  its  first year of operation.  I  rise  today to urge NOAA to reprogram funds to extend  the current charter  through  the end of  this calendar year. This extension will allow  enough data  to be gathered  to determine  whether the continued use of the time charter  is cost effective, and competitive with other  methods of acquiring hydrographic data. It will  also keep the contract going long enough to  determine if fiscal year 2006 funds are available for continued long term vessel charters.  To emphasize  the bipartisan  importance of  this issue, I ask that the May 31, 2005, letter  to the NOAA Administrator that my good friend  and colleague, NORMDICKS signed with me,  be entered into the RECORD.  CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  Washington, DC, May 31, 2005.  Vice Admiral CONRADC. LAUTENBACHER, Jr.,  Undersecretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, National Oceanic and Atmospheric, Administration, Herbert Clark Hoover Building,  Washington DC.  DEARADMIRALLAUTENBACHER: As you are  aware, the Nation faces a huge backlog of  critical hydrographic survey work. To reduce  this backlog, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had developed a three-pronged approach. NOAA is  using 1) its own hydrographic survey vessels  and personnel; 2) data acquisition contracts;  and 3) a leased vessel staffed by contract hydrographers.  In fiscal years 2002 through 2005, Congress  provided funding and specific direction to  NOAA  to enter  into a multi-year vessel  lease. After a lengthy bid process, the Military Sealift Command entered into a lease  on NOAA’s behalf that included a base year,  and 4 one-year options. The first year of that  lease will soon end, and unless it is extended  this portion of the hydrographic surveying  initiative will end. The bidders, including  the winning bidder, based their bids on a 5-  year lease period. Therefore, it was very disappointing to learn that NOAA does not intend to exercise even its first annual lease  option, especially since NOAA appears to be  satisfied with the work that has been done  by the leased vessel.  We have requested that the Appropriations  Committee include funding to continue the  vessel lease program in fiscal year 2006. This  will allow NOAA time to acquire and examine cost data on the lease to determine if  vessel leasing is a cost effective method of  acquiring hydrographic data. While this request is pending, we urge you to extend the  vessel lease with the roughly $1.6 million remaining  of  the  amounts  already  appropriated for that purpose. This will hold open  the door to allow NOAA to exercise the first  annual contract option if Congress appropriates vessel lease funds in Fiscal Year 2006.  Both Congress and NOAA deliberated long  and hard before establishing the longterm  vessel lease program as an additional method  to reduce the survey backlog. Given the time  and effort it has taken to get that program  under way, it would be very inefficient for  NOAA to kill the program this year, and  then go through another multi-year contract  bidding process starting next year. Therefore, we urge you to use the remaining funds  to extend the vessel contract.  Thank you for your expeditious consideration of this request. We look forward to  your prompt response.  Sincerely,  DONYOUNG,  Congressman  Alaska.  for All  NORMAND. DICKS,  Member of Congress.  f  CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF GARY JOB CORPS  IN  SAN MARCOS, TEXAS  HON.

Located on a campus of 1,000 acres at the  former Gary Army Air Field, Gary Job Corps is  the largest of 118 Job Corps campuses nation  wide, enrolling nearly 2,000 young men and  women. It represents the fulfillment of President Johnson’s 1964 promise to develop a national job training program for youth, a promise he made while visiting the former Southwest Texas State University.

DONALD M. PAYNE  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2005  ",2005
760,170,2005-06-20,Mr. PAYNE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on  World Refugee Day, to pay tribute to the indomitable spirit and courage of the world’s refugees  and  internally  displaced  persons  (IDP’s), as well as the brave people who help  them rebuild their lives. I recognize the generosity of the United States and its assistance  to refugees. However, the next year promises  to be a unique opportunity for the return of refugees, and in order to seize this opportunity,  we must increase our investment in long-term  development to make refugee returns durable.  I also urge  the Bush Administration government to do more to protect current refugees,  resolve  the conflicts  that produce  refugees,  and prevent future refugee crises.  Among the most vulnerable groups of people in the world are those who are displaced,  whether as a result of conflict, persecution or  other human rights violations. Often losing everything but hope,  refugees and  IDP’s are  among the great survivors of our time. Initially,  the fear that refugees and IDP’s must overcome may be the immediate one of trying to  escape  the horrors of war and persecution,  the pain of losing homes and loved ones, and  the ordeal of flight. Refugees and IDP’s deserve our respect—not  just  for enduring  the  dangers and violence of the crises that made  them refugees—but also for the courage they  show in rebuilding their lives and contributing  to  society  in  difficult  or,  unfamiliar  circumstances. Albert Einstein, Victor Hugo,  Congressman TOM LANTOS, Thabo Mbeki,  Marlene Dietrich, and Paul Rusesabagina (of  Hotel Rwanda fame) were all refugees whose  phenomenal achievements earned the world’s  respect. Today’s refugees are also heroes and  deserve no less than our respect.  But giving our  respect  to  refugees and  IDP’s—truly honoring their courage—requires  much more than flattering rhetoric and pledges  of solidarity. It requires us to look back at what  the world has done well to assist refugees and  IDP’s. It also requires us to deepen our understanding of the perils and fears they continue  to face. In addition, if we truly want to celebrate their courage, it means we must focus  our attention on what still needs to be done to  help them.  People have fled persecution from the moment in history when they began forming communities. The  tradition  of  offering  asylum  began at almost the same time. And when nations began to develop an international conscience  in  the early 20th century, efforts  to  help refugees also spread across the globe. In  1921, Fridtjof Nansen was appointed as  the  first refugee High Commissioner of the League  of Nations, the forerunner of the United Nations. The United Nations High Commission  for Refugees (UNHCR) began as a small organization, with a three-year mandate to help  resettle millions of European  refugees who  were still homeless  in  the aftermath of  the  Second World War. Since that time, the organization has continually expanded to meet the  growing needs of  refugees and other displaced people. In more than five decades, the  agency has helped an estimated 50 million  people  restart  their  lives. Today, a staff of  more  than 6,000 people  in more  than 100  countries continues  to help some 17 million  persons in every corner of the world. Today I  commend the outstanding, tireless work of the  UNHCR. However, as a former high commissioner said, the fact that the world still finds a  need for the UNHCR should serve as a sobering reminder of the international community’s  continuing failure to prevent prejudice, persecution, poverty and other root causes of conflict and displacement.

761,177,2005-06-20,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Speaker, last month, I  had the honor and privilege of attending the  annual Memorial Day Vietnam Wall observance,  in which one of my constituents and  friends, the late Army PFC John Harold Berg  of Rockford, Illinois, was honored for his service to our country. John was gravely injured in  Vietnam, but he passed up his 100 percent  disability status when he returned because he  wanted to help others. Despite a host of serious medical  issues, John served as a veterans representative for 25 years at the Illinois  Department of Employment Security before he  died in 2003 from cancer caused by shrapnel  lodged in his brain from his Vietnam injury. On  Memorial Day, I sat with John’s widow, Lynn,  and several of John’s friends as his name was  one of just four this year officially added to the  Vietnam Wall. It was a remarkable day for a  remarkable man. I have attached a newspaper  article written by Judy Emerson of the Rockford Register Star that describes John’s contributions and his character perfectly:  ADDINGSOLDIERSTOTHEWALL  One hundred years from now, someone will  read the name ‘‘John H. Berg’’ cut into black  granite on The Wall in Washington, D.C., and  they will assume he died in Vietnam in the  spring of 1968. Berg was  fatally wounded  April 7, 1968, in combat near Khe Sahn, but  it took him 371⁄2years to die. When he did, on  Oct. 10, 2003, it was in his rural Rockford  home surrounded by family. But the Vietnam War took his life, just as surely as if he  had died that spring day long ago as he lay  in the dirt with blood streaming from the  hole in his skull. Medics postponed his death  that day. Military doctors patched him up as  well as they could and sent him home to  Rockford with a plate covering the hole in  his skull and shrapnel still embedded in his  brain.  He dragged his left leg, and his left hand  was useless. He slurred his words. Back in  Rockford, he couldn’t find a job. A talented  musician, he was bitterly disappointed that  he couldn’t play piano, organ, violin and guitar, as he once did. But he went to college.  He re-learned how to play his instruments  with only his right hand and arm. He sought  the company of other Vietnam veterans who  understood the struggle. He found a job that  gave him purpose. For 25 years, he was a veterans representative at the Illinois Department of Employment Security. Over  the  years, he helped thousands of veterans find  jobs and get benefits to which they were entitled. Many were disabled, as he was.  In 2002, doctors found the tumor growing  under the plate in Berg’s head. His widow,  Lynn Berg, said doctors found shrapnel when  they tried to carve away the tumor and buy  her husband a little more time. Even fighting the relentless growth of a malignant  tumor, Berg continued to work. He  lived  longer than anybody expected.  When he died, his buddies at VietNow,  which he’d helped to start, began the process  to have his name added to The Wall, the  Vietnam Memorial in Washington. The Department of Defense concluded that Berg’s  fatal wound was incurred in Vietnam in 1968  and that he qualified to have his name listed  on the memorial. And so, Berg’s name was  carved on The Wall earlier this month. A  small diamond after the name signifies a  confirmed  combat  death. His name was  placed as close as possible to those of other  soldiers who suffered their fatal injuries on  the same day. The thinking  is that they  should be together. His father, 86-year-old  Harold John Berg, said that the memorial  was waiting for his son, despite the 371⁄2-year  reprieve from death. ‘‘We saw the wall once,’’  the elder Berg said. ‘‘And now we go the rest  of the way. He’s on it.’’ John H. Berg of  Rockford was fatally wounded in Vietnam  April 7, 1968. He died Oct. 10, 2003. What he  did in between is the story.  TALENTEDBOY  Harold Berg was a machinist and inspector  who retired  from Camcar years ago. His  health is poor but his memory and spirits are  good. His wife, 80-year-old Vergene, has Alzheimer’s disease. They spend their days in  side-by-side hospital beds in the Cherry Valley home of their daughter Hilary Belcher,  who cares for them. Her husband, Nick, and  9-year-old daughter, Chenoa, help.  Young John Berg wanted to be a musician.  His mother was a  long-time organist  for  their church, and her  firstborn  son also  played the organ, as well as piano, violin and  guitar. A 1965 graduate of East High School,  John took some classes at Rock Valley College until he was drafted in the summer of  1967. ‘‘We tried to talk him into going into  the Air Force, but he thought he’d get this  over with in two years,’’ his dad said. By  January 1968, 20-year-old John was in Vietnam. His early letters home to his parents,  three younger sisters and a brother revealed  a diminishing innocence as reality and the  futility of the mission sank in. ‘‘I only hope  this year goes fast and I come back in one  piece,’’ he wrote two weeks before his injury.  His wife, Lynn, said John could remember  what happened during the firefight on April  7, 1968, up until he was wounded. He was feeding an ammunition belt into a machine gun  being  fired  by  another  soldier when he  turned to dive for cover from incoming mortar. It’s still unclear whether he was shot in  the head or hit by shrapnel or both. He was  unconscious or semiconscious for weeks. The  Western Union telegram arrived early one  weekday morning as Harold Berg was getting  ready for work. ‘‘Deep regret . . . very seriously  ill  list  . . .  penetrating  fragment  wound to the head.’’ Vergene couldn’t stop  crying. Hilary Belcher, who’s 15 years younger than John, doesn’t remember too much  about the time, except that her parents were  distraught.  The telegrams kept coming with updates  on her brother’s condition, and after John  was transferred to a hospital  in Denver,  Colo., the family drove out there to see him.  ‘‘I remember walking down a long hallway  and doorway after doorway, there were all  these men with holes in their heads, just like  John,’’ Belcher said. ‘‘We took him out for a  while. You could hardly understand him  when he talked.’’ Months  later, when he  came home, she said, ‘‘I ran out to him saying  ‘John’s  home!  John’s  home!’  He  screamed. He thought I was going to knock  him down. ‘‘I used to run to him and he’d  throw me up in the air.’’ There was plenty of  trauma to go around.  ‘‘Those  first  eight years, he was very  angry,’’ Belcher said. ‘‘When you get a head  injury, it changes your whole personality.’’  John was bitter that he couldn’t play his instruments. His disability was obvious, and  nobody would hire him. ‘‘It took him years  to find a job. He even applied to a gas station  to pump gas, but they told him, ‘You only  have one hand, ’’’ Belcher said. He decided to  go back to Rock Valley College. There, he  met Reuben Johnson, dean of community  services and the producer and  founder of  Starlight Theatre.  Johnson  helped Berg  learn to play the piano, organ, guitar and  violin with one hand.  It was a turning point, as was the job Berg  landed in July 1977 as a veterans representative at the Illinois Department of Employment Security. He was good at it, said Jack  VerDate Aug 04 2004  06:30 Jun 21, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A20JN8.048 E20PT1 ",2005
762,3,2005-06-27,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  too just returned from a bipartisan delegation to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in  order to review the procedures that are  used in handling and questioning the  enemy combatants we have detained  there.  After hearing months of criticism  from the left and hearing our military  men and women compared to Nazis and  Guantanamo described as a gulag, I  was glad for the opportunity to see the  facility myself.  Do my colleagues know what I found?  I found Guantanamo to be a well-run,  secure facility that is essential in our  fight in protecting America from terrorism.  For weeks and months, we have been  told that the place was violating virtually every standard of decency in the  free world. Well, these detainees do get  3 meals a day. They are allowed to worship. They are receiving health care.  I hope that the Democrats who know  that to be true, who were with us, who  viewed all the work at Guantanamo,  will take a stand and tell the truth  about Guantanamo and the wonderful  men and women in our military who  are  serving  there, working  to keep  America safe.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2005

764,3,2005-06-27,Mr. NEY.," Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 312) recognizing National  Homeownership Month and the importance of homeownership in the United  States.  The Clerk read as follows:  H. RES. 312  Whereas the President of the United States  has issued a proclamation designating the  month of June 2005 as National Homeownership Month;  Whereas the national homeownership rate  in the United States has reached a record  high of 69.1 percent and more than half of all  minority families are homeowners;  Whereas the people of the United States  are one of the best-housed populations in the  world;  Whereas owning a home is a fundamental  part of the American dream and is the largest personal investment many families will  ever make;  Whereas  homeownership  provides  economic security  for homeowners by aiding  them  in building wealth over  time and  strengthens communities through a greater  stake among homeowners in local schools,  civic organizations, and churches;  Whereas improving homeownership opportunities requires the commitment and cooperation of the private, public, and nonprofit sectors, including the Federal Government and State and local governments; and  Whereas the current laws of the United  States, such as the American Dream Downpayment Act, encourage homeownership and  should continue to do so in the future: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) fully supports the goals and ideals of  National Homeownership Month; and  (2)  recognizes  the  importance of homeownership  in building strong communities  and families.

766,3,2005-06-27,Mr. NEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H. Res. 312 which recognizes National Homeownership Month and the  importance of homeownership  in the  United States. It is offered by the gentleman from California (",2005
767,3,2005-06-27,Mr. GARYG.,"  MILLER), my colleague and friend, who  could not be here this moment to carry  it. He has done a lot of great work on  it.  It has very good sponsors, also the  gentleman  from  Ohio  (Chairman  OXLEY); the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. FRANK), our ranking member; of course myself and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. WATERS);  the gentlewoman  from Florida  (Ms.  HARRIS) and other supporters. This resolution is a testament to the benefits  of a strong and robust housing market  in this country.  A home is more than just the symbol  of the American dream. It is the backbone of our American way of life.  Over the past 3 years, the housing  market has driven the national economy as Americans bought and refinanced homes in record numbers. Many  regions were spared the worst of the recent recession due to the strength of  some local housing markets.  Today, the housing sector directly  accounts for about 14 percent of the  country’s total gross domestic product.  Building a home involves multiple segments of our economy, including builders, bankers, mortgage  lenders, realtors and numerous other people that  are involved in this whole process.  June  is  National  Homeownership  Month, and so many of our partners  celebrate  this  because  in America,  every citizen, regardless of race, creed,  color or place of birth, has the opportunity and should have the opportunity  to own a home of their own.  Homeownership creates community  stakeholders who tend to be active in  charities, churches, and neighborhood  activities.  Homeownership  inspires  civic responsibility, and homeowners  are more likely to vote and get involved with local issues. Families owning a home offer children a stable living environment, and in many cases it  influences their personal development  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:18 Jun 28, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K27JN7.004 H27PT1 ",2005
768,17,2005-06-27,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Speaker, I yield such  time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  JINDAL), the author of H.R. 2346.  ",2005
769,17,2005-06-27,Mr. JINDAL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise both with a grateful and also a heavy heart. I rise with  a grateful heart and I want to thank  my colleagues for their speedy consideration of this resolution. I rise with a  heavy heart because of the untimely  passing of not only a colleague, but a  friend.  I first met John Hainkel well over a  decade ago, and at that point he had already been involved in elected politics  for well over three decades. Senator  Hainkel, as you already heard, accomplished many significant things in his  public career. Indeed, he was the only  person  in Louisiana’s history  to be  elected both speaker of the house and  president of our senate.  His broad-based appeal, however, extended beyond party  lines. He was  elected as speaker of the house, serving  as a Democrat, with the active support  of Louisiana’s  first Republican Governor elected in modern times. He then  went on to serve, when I first met him,  as chairman of the senate budget committee as a Republican, even though  two-thirds of the senate at that time  was comprised of Democrats. Indeed,  when he served as president of the senate as a Republican, two-thirds of the  senate in Louisiana at the time was  comprised of Democratic members. I  think that fact alone shows his bipartisan  support, his  broad  appeal  to  many senators and representatives.  The reason he commanded such respect was the fact that he brought integrity, the  fact he brought humor,  wit, the fact that he brought fashion to  the daily legislative tasks.  But John was more than just a senator, he was more than just a legislator.  Indeed, he was  very  accomplished  in  those  arenas.  Senator  Hainkel not only worked with Pat Taylor to bring about Louisiana’s TOPS  bill, which provides access for students  to higher  education, but he  championed many budget reforms, helping  to turn deficits into surpluses, helping  to reform our State’s health care system and helping to revive our State’s  economy.  But his accomplishments outside the  legislature were almost as noteworthy  as his accomplishments inside the legislature. John was also not only a dedicated senator, a dedicated representative, he was also a dedicated Tulane  fan.  I know  that he watched  from  above as his Green Wave served him  well in Omaha and went on to do so  well  in the College World Series.  I  know that he will still be watching  them season after season,  just with  slightly better seats than he had before.  Indeed, Senator Hainkel was known  for his friendship and was known for  reaching out to new members of the  bodies in which he served, to new members of the administration. He truly  brought a passion and an attitude of  public  servant  leadership  that  too  often is missing from our elected halls.  He brought a spirit of bipartisanship, a  spirit of love for his home State of  Louisiana.  Several things have been said about  Senator Hainkel and the years of service he offered my State. I also want to  note that he is survived by his son,  John J. Hainkel, III, his daughter, Juliet Hainkel Holton, his other daughter, Alida Hainkel Furr, and by five  grandchildren.  I  know  his  family  brought him much joy. I know they,  like I, am very saddened by his untimely and his early departure.  It is hard, it would be really impossible, to overstate the amount of affection and respect that Senator Hainkel  engendered not only in his home district, but the home State of Louisiana.  Whether you were with him or against  him on a particular legislation, and I  was in both places, whether you were  with him or against him in a particular  election, and I was in both places, he  was always a worthy friend and a worthy opponent.  I can certainly think of nothing that  would be more appropriate than naming, at least as a small tribute to him,  this post office  in Hammond, Louisiana, that was within the district he  represented in the senate. Indeed, there  is a spirited election to replace him  now. Two very distinguished women  are seeking that post. Though either  one of them will serve well, neither of  them will be truly able to succeed and  replace  the  giant  that was  John  Hainkel.  I want to thank my colleagues again  for their support.

He grew up in the  Second Ward of Allentown, in an ethnically diverse neighborhood.  Too poor to attend college after graduating from what was then Allentown  High School, he enlisted in the United  States Navy and served his country  during the Korean War. After safely returning  from overseas, Mr. Daddona  put himself through Lehigh University  and received an engineering degree.  Although he began his career as a  planning  engineer  for  the Western  Electric Company, he found himself increasingly drawn to politics in the City  of Allentown. In the mid-1960s, as a  member of the Allentown Jaycees, Joe  Daddona spearheaded the effort to create a Charter Study Commission for  the city. He subsequently won a seat on  that  commission,  helped  draft  the  city’s strong mayor  form of government, and later served a term as an Allentown city councilman.

781,24,2005-06-27,Mr. PEARCE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1084  introduced by the gentleman from New  Hampshire  (Mr. BRADLEY) would authorize the construction of a memorial  at the Antietam National Battlefield  to members of the New Hampshire Infantry that fought in the Battle of Antietam. The bill directs the Secretary  of the Interior to select persons responsible for the establishment of the memorial and prohibits the use of Federal  funds in the design, acquisition, preparation, and installation of the memorial. Additionally, the Secretary must  approve the size, design, and inscriptions placed on the monument. Once  the memorial is in place, the Secretary  will accept responsibility for maintenance, but will be permitted to accept  donations into a specific account for  the New Hampshire memorial.  I urge passage of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. UDALL  of New Mexico. Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  (Mr. UDALL of New Mexico asked  and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)  Mr. UDALL  of New Mexico. Mr.  Speaker, as the majority has explained,  H.R. 1084 authorizes the establishment  of a Civil War Memorial to New Hampshire soldiers who fought at the Battle  of Antietam in 1862.  Evidently, New Hampshire  is  the  only State  that participated  in  the  Battle of Antietam that does not have  a memorial to its soldiers at the site.  The citizens of New Hampshire are  proud of their ancestors’ participation  in the battle and would like to commemorate their participation.  Mr. Speaker, we have no objection to  the adoption of H.R. 1084, as amended,  by the House today.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank  the majority and minority staff of the  House Resources Committee, and especially Rick Healy of  the Resources  Committee, for their diligent work on  this bill.

Mr.  Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution (H. Res.  199) expressing the sense of the House  of Representatives regarding the massacre at Srebrenica  in July 1995, as  amended.  The Clerk read as follows:  H. RES. 199  Whereas in July 1995 thousands of men and  boys who had sought safety in the United  Nations-designated ‘‘safe area’’ of Srebrenica  in Bosnia and Herzegovina under the protection of the United Nations Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) were massacred by Serb forces  operating in that country;  Whereas beginning in April 1992, aggression  and ethnic cleansing perpetrated by Bosnian  Serb forces, while taking control of the surrounding territory, resulted in a massive influx  of Bosniaks  seeking  protection  in  Srebrenica  and  its  environs, which  the  United Nations Security Council designated  a ‘‘safe area’’ in Resolution 819 on April 16,  1993;  Whereas  the  UNPROFOR  presence  in  Srebrenica  consisted  of  a Dutch  peacekeeping battalion, with representatives of  the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees, the  International Committee of  the Red Cross, and the humanitarian medical  aid agency Me´decins Sans Frontie`res (Doctors Without Borders) helping to provide humanitarian relief to the displaced population  living in conditions of massive overcrowding,  destitution, and disease;  Whereas Bosnian Serb forces blockaded the  enclave early in 1995, depriving the entire  population of humanitarian aid and outside  communication and contact, and effectively  reducing the ability of the Dutch peacekeeping battalion to deter aggression or otherwise respond effectively to a deteriorating  situation;  Whereas beginning on July 6, 1995, Bosnian  Serb forces attacked UNPROFOR outposts,  seized control of the isolated enclave, held  captured Dutch soldiers hostage and, after  skirmishes with local defenders, ultimately  took control of the town of Srebrenica on  July 11, 1995;  Whereas an estimated one-third of the population of Srebrenica, including a relatively  small number of soldiers, made a desperate  attempt to pass through the lines of Bosnian  Serb forces to the relative safety of Bosnian-  held territory, but many were killed by patrols and ambushes;  Whereas the remaining population sought  protection with the Dutch peacekeeping battalion at its headquarters in the village of  Potocari north of Srebrenica but many of  these individuals were randomly seized by  Bosnian Serb forces to be beaten, raped, or  executed;  Whereas Bosnian Serb  forces  deported  women, children, and the elderly in buses,  held Bosniak males over 16 years of age at  collection points and sites in northeastern  Bosnia and Herzegovina under their control,  and then summarily executed and buried the  captives in mass graves;  Whereas  approximately  20  percent  of  Srebrenica’s total population at the time—at  least 7,000 and perhaps thousands more—was  either executed or killed;  Whereas the United Nations and its member states have largely acknowledged their  failure to take actions and decisions that  could  have  deterred  the  assault  on  Srebrenica and prevented  the  subsequent  massacre;  Whereas Bosnian Serb  forces, hoping to  conceal  evidence  of  the  massacre  at  Srebrenica,  subsequently moved  corpses  from initial mass grave sites to many secondary sites scattered throughout parts of  northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina under  their control;  Whereas the massacre at Srebrenica was  among the worst of many horrible atrocities  to occur  in  the  conflict  in Bosnia and  Herzegovina  from April 1992 to November  1995, during which the policies of aggression  and ethnic cleansing pursued by Bosnian  Serb forces with the direct support of the  Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic and its  followers ultimately led to the displacement  of more than 2,000,000 people, an estimated  200,000 killed, tens of thousands raped or otherwise tortured and abused, and the innocent  civilians of Sarajevo and other urban centers  repeatedly subjected to shelling and sniper  attacks;  Whereas Article 2 of the Convention on the  Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of  Genocide (done at Paris on December 9, 1948,  and entered into force with respect to the  United States on February 23, 1989) defines  genocide as ‘‘any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in  part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious  group, as such: (a) killing members of the  group; (b) causing serious bodily or mental  harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of  life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) imposing  measures intended to prevent births within  the group; (e) forcibly transferring children  of the group to another group’’;  Whereas on May 25, 1993, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution  827  establishing  the world’s  first  international war  crimes  tribunal,  the  International Criminal Tribunal for the former  Yugoslavia (ICTY), based in The Hague, the  Netherlands, and charging the ICTY with responsibility  for  investigating  and  prosecuting individuals suspected of committing  war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva  Conventions on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia since 1991;  Whereas nineteen  individuals at various  levels of responsibility have been indicted,  and  in  some  cases  convicted,  for  grave  breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions,  violations of the laws or customs of war,  crimes  against  humanity,  genocide,  and  complicity in genocide associated with the  massacre at Srebrenica, three of whom, most  notably  Radovan  Karadzic  and  Ratko  Mladic, remain at large; and  Whereas the international community, including the United States, has continued to  provide personnel and resources, including  through direct military intervention, to prevent further aggression and ethnic cleansing,  to negotiate the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina  (initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on November 21,  1995, and signed in Paris on December 14,  1995), and to help ensure its fullest implementation, including cooperation with the  VerDate Aug 04 2004  04:24 Jun 28, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A27JN7.031 H27PT1 ",2005

796,45,2005-06-27,Mr. OSBORNE.," Mr. Speaker, there  has been a great deal of debate on this  House floor recently about the war in  Iraq and not so much about Afghanistan, interestingly, but certainly about  Iraq. Some in Congress are clamoring  for us to pull out of Iraq immediately.  Some want a timetable  indicating a  date certain when we will withdraw.  Some say there is no plan concerning  postwar Iraq, no exit strategy. I would  like to address each of these points just  briefly.  Number 1, we promised the Iraqi people that we would not pull out prematurely. Remember that back in the  Gulf War in the early 1990s, we made a  similar promise. We did pull out, and  thousands of Iraqis died. We have had a  very  difficult  time  regaining  their  trust since. I think to this point we  may have regained some of that status  and some of that trust.  A date certain on which we will leave  Iraq will encourage insurgents to hang  on until that date and then intensify  the attacks. I think the date certain of  withdrawal will certainly be  looked  upon by many insurgents as a sign that  they were winning, a sign of victory. I  am sure they would claim victory at  that point.  Also, I think it is important that a  withdrawal without victory will dishonor the memories of those who have  died and  sacrificed, and  I,  for one,  would very much hate to go back and  face some of those parents and some of  those husbands and wives who have  lost soldiers in the war and try to tell  them that basically their son, their  daughter, their husband, or their wife  died for no cause at all. That would be  very, very difficult for them to swallow.  Then I think most of us who have  been overseas, and a great many Members of Congress have, have been to  Iraq and Afghanistan and Kuwait, and  Landstuhl in Germany to the hospital,  and up to Walter Reed, and one thing  that we  found almost universally  is  that our soldiers have tremendous morale. They have a very strong sense of  mission, and they have a real sense of  purpose. Almost to a person the military personnel that I have talked to  would tell you that they absolutely do  not want to leave this thing undone.  They want to make sure there  is a  sense of accomplishment and a sense of  purpose.  Finally, let us address the issue of no  plan, that there is no strategy, no exit  plan at all. We might refer to this  chart here. One year ago, there was one  Iraqi military  battalion  that  was  trained and equipped. Now there are  more than 100 battalions trained and  equipped, and those are reflected over  here on this 75,791 total of Ministry of  Defense forces. Also, in addition, there  are 90,883 policemen and other patrol  and security guards that have been  trained. So it is a total of 170,000 Iraqis  who  are  currently  trained  and  equipped.  I have been to Iraq where I have seen  some of this training occur. I have been  to Amman, Jordan, where a lot of the  police academies are held. So at the  present time we are aiming for 270,000,  and we are most of the way there. We  still have 100,000 to go, and we are  training about 10,000 a month. So that  means in about 10 months we will be at  roughly 270,000.  General Petraeus says there  is no  shortage of volunteers; we have more  people applying for this position than  we have  slots  to  fill  them at  the  present time.

801,59,2005-06-27,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to thank the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. REICHERT) for sharing his  thoughts  and  perspectives with us,  again a 33-year first responder and police officer from the Seattle year.  Now, I yield to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. ROGERS), another fine individual, member of the committee,  from the Third District of Alabama. In  addition to working on the Committee  on Armed Services and the Committee  on Agriculture, he also serves with me  on the Committee on Homeland Security where he is assigned to the Subcommittee  on Emergency Preparedness, Science,  and Technology  and  chairs the Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and Oversight. As  chairman of  this  subcommittee, my  colleague is very concerned about making sure that the Department of Homeland Security operates in the most efficient and  effective and  transparent  way possible.  With that, I yield to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS).  ",2005
802,59,2005-06-27,Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.," I thank  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  DENT) for organizing this discussion tonight. It is vital we take the time to  talk about these important issues, and  I appreciate the gentleman’s efforts to  highlight some of our accomplishments  this evening.  Mr. Speaker, this Congress has done  many good things to help secure our  homeland, some of which we are discussing tonight, but in other areas, we  still have a ways to go.  Take, for example, the issue of border  surveillance. About 2 weeks ago, the  subcommittee I chair held a hearing to  discuss the camera system that monitors our Nation’s northern and southern borders. Known as the Integrated  Surveillance  Intelligence System, or  ISIS, these cameras are a critical link  for helping secure our border.  Unfortunately,  this  system  is not  working as planned. What began as a  program to monitor the border crossing of illegal immigrants, drug trafficker, and even terrorists has morphed  into what one of our witnesses called  ‘‘a major project gone awry.’’  According to a 2004 GSA audit, the  problems go even further. For example,  the  initial  $2 million  contract was  awarded without full competition. Just  1  year  later  that  same  contract  ballooned to over $200 million, again  without full competition, and the problems do not end there.  The GSA audit also reported significant issues relating to the surveillance  system itself: 60-foot poles that were  paid for but never installed; sensitive  equipment that  failed to meet electrical  codes;  an  operations  center  where contractors and government employees did little or no work for over a  year; and not surprisingly, numerous  cost overruns. To top it off, in September 2004, the GSA abruptly ended  the maintenance contract. This left approximately  70 border  sites without  monitoring equipment.  Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. What we have here, plain  and simple,  is a case of gross mismanagement of a multimillion-dollar  contract. This agreement has violated  Federal contracting rules, and it has  wasted taxpayers’ dollars. Worst of all,  it has seriously weakened our Nation’s  border security.  Before DHS spends another $2.5 billion on a replacement system known as  the America’s Shield  Initiative, we  need to first fix the system we have  got. With Federal dollars scarce and  budgets  tight,  it  is vital  that  the  American people know what they are  getting.  Thanks to the work of this Congress  and many of my colleagues here tonight, we are improving the safety of  America’s homeland, but we still have  a ways to go. As we move forward, I  hope we can continue to address these  issues at DHS.  I thank my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle for their support.  ",2005
803,59,2005-06-27,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank the gentleman from Alabama for  his comments as well and appreciate  his  leadership on the Committee on  Homeland Security.  I would now like to further this conversation tonight, this Special Order  and this discussion with the American  people, and I would like to say a few  words about the interrelationship between immigration and homeland security.  While so many immigrants who come  to this country do so legally and with  the sole intention of seeking a better  life, there are those who have links to  terrorist organizations or who come  here to do us harm. To be fully effective, then, the homeland security programs need  to contain measures  to  curb illegal immigration and to prevent those who would seek to propagate acts of violence  from crossing  international borders.  Legislation  recently passed  in  the  House contains these kinds of measures. The Real ID Act is one such provision. It serves to protect the homeland in four distinct ways.  First, it establishes rigorous proof of  identity for all driver’s license applicants and strong security requirements  for all licenses and State-issued identity cards. It further requires that Federal agencies only accept State-issued  licenses and ID cards from those States  that have confirmed by substantial evidence that the applicant  is  lawfully  present within the jurisdiction. These  measures are important because they  make it more difficult for would-be terrorists to utilize phony or temporary  licenses or secure cover for their nefarious activities here in the U.S. As the  9/11 Commission  states:  ‘‘It  is  elemental to border security to know who  is  coming  into  the  country. Today  more than 9 million people are in the  United States outside the legal immigration system. All but one of the 9/11  hijackers acquired some form of U.S.  identification  document,  some  by  fraud.  b2215  ‘‘Acquisition of these forms of identification would have assisted them in  boarding commercial  flights, renting  cars, and other necessary activities.’’  That is from the 9/11 Commission.  The REAL ID Act also makes it easier to deny asylum to and deport would-  be terrorists. Prior to REAL ID, individuals who allegedly committed certain terrorist acts could be denied admission to the U.S., but an anomaly  within U.S. immigration law provided  that once here,  individuals who had  committed these same acts could not  be deported. The REAL ID Act rectifies  this situation.  In addition, terrorist organizations  have been using  front organizations  and alleged charities to support and  provide cover for their terrorist activities. As President Bush has  stated,  ‘‘International  terrorist  networks  make frequent use of charitable or humanitarian  organizations  to  obtain  clandestine,  financial and other support for their activities.’’ Money given  to terrorist organizations is fungible.  Unfortunately, prior  to  the act, an  alien could provide funding or other  material support to many terrorist organizations and then escape deportation merely by claiming he did not  know  the  funds would be  spent on  weapons or explosives.  The REAL ID Act, by contrast, directs that an alien who provides funds  or other material support to a terrorist  is  inadmissible and deportable  if he  knew or reasonably should have known  that he was giving to a terrorist organization.  Finally, the REAL ID Act provides  an important component to the physical security of the United States. In  1996, Congress mandated the building of  a 14-mile border fence inland from the  Mexican border in the San Diego area.  The goal was to curb illegal entries  into the most heavily trafficked corner  of the United States and to guarantee  security at the U.S. naval base in San  Diego. More than 8 years later, that  fence is still not completed, in large  part because the construction is tied  up in litigation. In order to facilitate  the construction of this important security perimeter, the act waives all  Federal laws necessary to ensure the  expeditious completion of this structure.  Immigration as a security issue was  also  the  subject of portions of  the  Homeland Security Authorization Act  for fiscal year 2006. The act fully funded the hiring and training of some 2,000  VerDate Aug 04 2004  04:24 Jun 28, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K27JN7.099 H27PT1 ",2005
804,66,2005-06-27,Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise this evening to discuss  for the next 45 minutes the most important topic that will allow us to protect the homeland, provide for the security of the American people and our  allies and our troops around the world:  our intelligence.  Last Thursday, Mr. Speaker, I had a  meeting with the very able and distinguished chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence,  the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HOEKSTRA). We discussed many things, one  of which was a source that I had hoped  that we could get some information to  assist us in understanding the threats  in Iraq and the Middle East, and especially in regard to Iran.  I said to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. HOEKSTRA),  I am going to  make a prediction to you. Based on my  source, I said, common wisdom tells us  that the winner of the election in Iran  that will take place on Friday and Saturday  our  time  will  probably  be  Rafsanjani. He is the name that most  pundits have said would be the likely  winner in a two-person runoff against  the more conservative and not well-  known mayor of Tehran. But I said to  the  gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr.  HOEKSTRA), based on  information we  had, the election was not going to be  close; it will be a landslide. But the  conservative mayor of Tehran, a relative unknown, had been anointed by  Ayatollah Homeni in Iran and he would  in fact win the Iranian election.  We all saw the results, Mr. Speaker,  on Saturday night and Sunday morning as, in fact, the mayor of Tehran  won the election with a margin of 62 to  38 percent, an overwhelming landslide.  I raise this issue, Mr. Speaker, because  good intelligence and good information  is the most critical tool that we can  have over the next several years and  decades to protect our homeland.  Mr. Speaker, I rise because information has come to my attention over the  past several months that is very disturbing. I have learned that, in fact,  one of our Federal agencies had,  in  fact,  identified the major New York  cell of Mohamed Atta prior to 9/11; and  I have learned, Mr. Speaker, that in  September of 2000, that Federal agency  actually was prepared to bring the FBI  in and prepared to work with the FBI  to take down the cell that Mohamed  Atta was involved in in New York City,  along with two of the other terrorists.  I have also  learned, Mr. Speaker,  that when that recommendation was  discussed within that Federal agency,  the lawyers in the administration at  that time said, you cannot pursue contact with the FBI against that cell.  Mohamed Atta is in the U.S. on a green  card, and we are fearful of the fallout  from the Waco incident. So we did not  allow that Federal agency to proceed.  Mr. Speaker, what this now means is  that prior to September 11, we had employees of the Federal Government in  one of our agencies who actually identified the Mohamed Atta cell and made  a specific recommendation to act on  that cell, but were denied the ability to  go forward. Obviously, if we had taken  out that cell, 9/11 would not have occurred and, certainly, taking out those  three principal players  in  that cell  would have severely crippled, if not totally stopped, the operation that killed  3,000 people in America.  Tonight, I am going to provide some  background to my colleagues, because I  think this represents a major problem  with our intelligence that needs to be  focused on by the committees of the  House and the Senate, by the leadership of the House and the Senate, by  John Negroponte, the new person assigned by President Bush, and a very  able man, to integrate the 33 classified  systems overseen by the 15 Federal  agencies.  I want to also start off by praising  Porter Goss, the director of the CIA.  Porter served us extremely well in this  body as the chairman of the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence; and  he went over to the CIA with an aggressive agenda to change that agency,  and he has begun that process. We, in  this body, need to rally the American  people to support the efforts brought  forward by Porter Goss and to allow  John Negroponte to undertake perhaps  the most difficult task in protecting  the security of America, a task that  will not be easy, given the history of  our Federal agency system.  Let me take my colleagues back, Mr.  Speaker, to 1999. It was, in fact, the  spring of 1999 when I was first involved  in taking a delegation of 10 Members of  Congress to Vienna with the support of  my  friend  and  colleague,  the  gentleman  from Maryland  (Mr. HOYER),  and with the support of the Clinton  State Department.  b2320  The  11-member  delegation  of  five  Democrats, five Republicans and myself, along with the State Department  employee, traveled to Vienna to meet  with five senior leaders of the Russian  political parties. Our purpose was to  try to reach a framework that could  allow for a peaceful resolution of the  war in Kosovo on the terms that the  U.S. had desired after Ramboullet.  After securing a military plane, my  Russian  friends  told me  they were  bringing a Serb along with them, a  Serb who would be able to understand  what we were talking about and help  us decide and determine whether or not  Milosevic back in Belgrade would accept any  recommendations  that we  would develop. I did not know anything  about the Serb. I knew the Russians.  But I figure I had better ask the CIA  what they knew about this Serb so I  could be better prepared, and to make  sure that the Serb was not a part of the  Milosevic regime, because that would  cause myself and my colleagues to be  in violation of the Hobbs Act because  we were at war with Serbia at that  time.  So I called George Tenet. I said, Director Tenet, can you give me some information about this Serb? His family  is evidently well known.  I need  to  know whether or not he is a part of the  Milosevic regime. I need to know any  other information you can provide to  me because we are going to meet with  him when we travel to Vienna to meet  with the Russian leaders to help provide a beginning of a solution to end  the war in Kosovo.  He called me back the next day and  he gave me a couple of sentences and  said not to worry, he was not a part of  the Milosevic  regime. And he had  strong ties to the Communist Party inside of Moscow and had ties to other  leaders in the Russian Government. It  was not much to go on.  But at the time, Mr. Speaker, I was  chairman of the Defense Research Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. My job was to oversee the funding, approximately $40 billion of defense research money on new systems  and new technologies. And one of the  most  striking  technologies was  the  work being done by the Army’s Information Dominance Center  at Fort  Belvoir, formerly known as the LIWA,  the Land Information Warfare Assessment Center. I had visited the LIWA  several times and was tremendously  impressed with not just the ability to  provide security for our Army classified systems, but I saw a unique approach to doing well beyond that, data  mining, data collaboration, using cutting-edge software tools like Starlight  and Spires, able to do profiling. Having  plussed-up  funding  for  this  facility  after talking to George Tenet, I called  my friends at the Army’s Information  Dominance Center and said, can you do  something for me as a favor, off the  record? And they said sure, Congressman, whatever you like. Would you run  me a profile of this Serb, for the same  reason I had asked the Director of the  CIA. They said, no problem, Congressman; we will get back to you in a few  hours. And they did. They gave me 10  pages  of  information, Mr. Speaker,  about the Serb and his ties. Now, the  information was not vetted but it was  from a number of sources that the Information Dominance Center was able  to pull together very quickly. I used  that information as we traveled to Vienna to understand who we were meeting with. We had those meetings for 2  days and my colleagues, my five Republican and five Democrat colleagues,  worked  aggressively  to  establish  a  framework that would begin the end of  the Kosovo war. In fact, it was historic.  When we returned to Washington several weeks later I was contacted by the  FBI and they said, Congressman, we  would like to debrief you. We would  like you to tell us what you know  about that Serb that you all met in Vienna.  I said, no problem,  I will be  happy to do it Monday afternoon in my  office. The Friday before the Monday,  my D.C. office paged me with a 911  page. When I called them they said,  you have got to call CIA Congressional  Affairs immediately, which I did.

813,87,2005-06-27,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, there  has been quite a controversy developing in recent weeks about the Corporation  for Public Broadcasting.  I  have spoken on the Senate floor a couple of times about the subject, and I  wish to address it now, particularly because of actions that were taken last  week.  The Corporation  for Public Broadcasting has a Board of Directors that is  headed by a Mr. Kenneth Tomlinson.  Mr. Tomlinson decided to take it upon  himself to describe public broadcasting  as having a liberal bias. Because it has  a liberal bias, according to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, appointed by President Bush, he hired a  consultant, a fellow who had worked  for 20 years at a  journalism center  founded by the American Conservative  Union. He hired a consultant for just  over $14,000 without the knowledge of  the Board of Directors to evaluate particularly  programming  by  the Bill  Moyers show called ‘‘Now.’’ The Inspector General at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is now investigating  that expenditure of money.  It is curious to me that the American  people, by a wide margin, believe that  public television and public radio, National Public Radio, for example, and  PBS, is not biased, is good information,  provides good programming, balanced  programming, and yet the Chairman of  the Board, who is partisan, has made it  his cause to tell the American people  there is a liberal bias in public broadcasting over television and radio on  NPR and so on.  Most of us, of course, know public  television by Big Bird, Ernie, the Cookie Monster, the Count, Grover. I was  thinking, when I have heard the discussions about public broadcasting by the  Chairman of the Board, Mr. Tomlinson,  I was thinking of Oscar the Grouch,  who  complains  about  everything.  I  would not take the analogy so far because Oscar the Grouch lives in a trash  can, but every time he peeks his head  out something is wrong. He complains  about everything, Oscar the Grouch.  Well, maybe we have an Oscar the  Grouch  running  the Corporation  for  Public Broadcasting. After all, he is a  partisan who has decided to allege that  there is a partisan and liberal bias at  the  Corporation  for Public Broadcasting. Then he hires a conservative  to do an evaluation of that.  When he did that with public funding, I asked Mr. Tomlinson, by letter,  to provide me the information gleaned  from this consultant. He then sent me  the raw data, which was many pages of  raw information. I have described that  on the Senate floor. I will not do that  again. He told me that it was not a  summary but he was  completing a  summary. I have now been given the  summary in the last couple of days—I  believe last Friday.  In the intervening period, Chairman  Tomlinson also decided that his candidate to become President of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a position that was open, should be assumed by a former Co-Chair of the Republican National Committee. Over the  objections of  some members of  the  Board of Directors, he made that happen last week. So the former Co-Chair  of the Republican National Committee  is now going to become the President  of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,  an  organization  that  the  Chairman of the Board of the Corporation  for Public Broadcasting alleges  has a liberal bias. He believes that it is  political  or  partisan;  therefore,  he  brings in a partisan.  If a  former co-chair of the Democratic National Committee had been  hired, I assume there would be a howl  that one could hear all the way to West  Virginia coming  from  this Chamber  and the Chamber across the hall because they would say: You are politicizing  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting. Regrettably, that is exactly what Mr. Tomlinson is doing by  hiring a former Co-Chair of the Republican National Committee.  Public broadcasting does a real service in this country. There are some stories no other broadcasters will do. Do  my colleagues think that ABC, CBS,  NBC, or FOX will ever do a no holds  barred, in-depth story about concentration in the media and about the rules  that  the  Federal  Communications  Commission tried to foist on this country  that would  allow  further  concentration until they were stopped by  the Federal courts? Do my colleagues  think that would ever be dealt with by  the major television networks? Not on  your life because they are all making  money consolidating.  The Federal Communications Commission came up with a goofy rule—one  that, in my judgment, subverts the interests of the American people—and  said it will be all right if in one major  American city one company owns eight  radio  stations,  three  television  stations, the dominant newspaper, and the  cable company. That is just fine, according  to  the Federal Communications Commission. Well, it is not fine  with me. That was the quickest and  biggest cave-in to the special interests  I have ever seen in my life, and the  Federal court has at this point stopped  it.  Guess who did the in-depth reporting,  the hard-hitting reporting on the concentration of corporate  interests  in  broadcasting. Was it CBS, NBC, ABC,  FOX News? No, not on your life. They  would not touch it because they make  money continuing the concentration.  It was public broadcasting. It was Bill  Moyers. For that, he pays a price. The  price he pays: Mr. Tomlinson and others accuse him of going astray, a liberal bias.  When I looked at the papers I was  given that represent the raw data from  the consultant, some of the  listings  evaluated  programming  on  public  broadcasting as either anti-Bush or  pro-Bush. Is that what we are going to  do in this country—run our evaluation  of whether something is fair through a  prism of whether it supports our President, whoever our President is? Is that  the way one would have wanted to  evaluate  public  broadcasting  when  President Clinton was in office—anti-  Clinton, pro-Clinton? I do not think so.  That is not the way we have a responsibility to evaluate these things.  This country is still a democracy, a  free country. It is not unpatriotic to be  critical of our Government. In the case  of the FCC rules, that would allow  massive concentration of broadcasting  properties so that only four or five people will determine what the American  people by and large will see, hear, and  read. When that happens, when the  FCC tries to do that, it is not unpatriotic to raise questions and do in-depth  reporting and do tough reporting on it.  There  is nothing unpatriotic  about  that.  So the selection of the former Co-  Chair of the Republican National Committee to be President of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a step  that will  injure public broadcasting.  The board members who objected have  told me that they felt the process for  the selection of the chairman was not  fair, and I intend to ask the Inspector  General to include that question in the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:54 Jan 08, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\S27JN5.REC S27JN5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005

820,108,2005-06-27,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing legislation to address  conflicts of interest and the appearance  of conflicts involving former Federal  officers and employees who represent  Indian tribes.  The  legislation amends the  Indian  Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEA), 25 US.C. 450i(j),  by limiting the exemption from Federal conflicts of interest laws. Current  law exempts from the conflicts laws  former Federal officers and employees  who ‘‘are employed by Indian tribes’’,  thus permitting these former Federal  employees  immediately to  lobby the  departments they just left and act as  agents and attorneys  for the tribes.  The legislation limits this exemption  only to those former Federal employees who are employees of Indian tribes  pursuant  to  self-determination  contracts or self-governance compacts.  The bill clarifies what I believe was  the  intent of  the Congress, as evidenced by House Report No. 93–4600  that accompanies the ISDEA, that Federal employees who work in an area  that is contracted or compacted to a  tribe be able to continue performing  their jobs if they become employees of  the Indian tribe for purposes of working  in the contracted or compacted  area. The exception that was made to  the conflict laws appeared to have been  made  in response to the recognition  that when Indian tribes took on the responsibility of operating programs traditionally fulfilled by the Federal Government, they would need experienced  individuals  to  fulfill  contracted  or  compacted functions.  Former Federal employees who leave  the Federal Government and go  to  work as outside lawyers or lobbyists  for  Indian  tribes,  however, would,  under the legislation I am introducing  today, be subject to the same conflicts  of  interest  restraints  that apply  to  other  former Federal employees who  work for other entities. The bill takes  effect one year after  enactment  to  allow time  for people to  familiarize  themselves with the new law and for  tribes to seek alternative representation if necessary.  Limiting the waiver of conflicts laws  in this manner proposed in this bill  will address a problem identified by the  Inspector General of the Department of  Interior. In a report dated February  2002, entitled  ‘‘Allegations  Involving  Irregularities in the Tribal Recognition  Process and Concerns Relating to Indian Gaming, the IG laid out a number  of contacts by former BIA and DOI officials, who left Federal employment to  represent tribes at law firms, to the  BIA  regarding  recognition matters  that, but for the exemption from the  conflicts rules, they would be barred  from making. The IG suggested that  these contacts were improper, but not  illegal. These contacts were all made  by  former  Federal  employees who  worked as outside lawyers and lobbyists for tribes. In his testimony before  the Senator Committee on Indian Affairs earlier this year, the Inspector  General again raised the issue of conflicts of interest and referred to a problem of a  ‘‘revolving door’’  involving  former Department of  Interior officials. This legislation seeks to address  that problem. I urge my colleagues to  support it. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 1312  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

821,108,2005-06-27,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce new legislation, entitled the Protection of Homes, Small  Businesses, and Private Property Act  of 2005. I introduce this legislation in  response to a controversial ruling of  the United  States  Supreme  Court  issued just last Thursday.  The protection of homes, small businesses,  and  other  private  property  rights against government seizure and  other unreasonable government interference is a fundamental principle and  core  commitment  of  our  Nation’s  Founders. As Thomas Jefferson  famously wrote on April 6, 1816, the protection of such rights is:  the first principle of association, ‘‘the guarantee to everyone of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.’’  The Fifth Amendment of the United  States Constitution  specifically provides that ‘‘private property’’ shall not  ‘‘be taken for public use without just  compensation.’’ The Fifth Amendment  thus provides an essential guarantee of  liberty against the abuse of the power  of eminent domain, by permitting government to seize private property only  ‘‘for public use.’’  On June 23, 2005, the U.S. Supreme  Court issued its controversial 5–4 decision in Kelo v. City of New London. In  that ruling, the Court acknowledged  that ‘‘it has long been accepted that  the sovereign may not take the property of A for the sole purpose of transferring it to another private party B,’’  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:54 Jan 08, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\S27JN5.REC S27JN5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005

The RECORDwill reflect that at the end of  the debate, as a result of the agreement by  Chairman REGULA to work to maintain funds  for Arts in Education programs in conference,  I stated that I would not seek a vote on my  amendment. Immediately following the debate,  however, in his haste to keep the proceedings  moving, the Chair called a vote, contradicting  my intention to withdraw my amendment. With  nobody apparently listening, or realizing there  was a vote  in progress—no  ‘‘aye’’ or  ‘‘nay’’  vote was heard—the Chair declared the voice  vote in the negative.  I would like the RECORD to reflect that it was  my intention to withdraw my amendment, because of Chairman REGULA’s commitment to  the Arts  in Education program.  I  trust  that  commitment will not be affected by the procedural error.  f  DEPARTMENTS  OF  LABOR,  HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,  AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED  AGENCIES  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT, 2006  SPEECHOF  HON. DANNY K. DAVIS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  tions offered by President Bush’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, minimizes  the importance of mental health to the well-  being of Americans, and threatens vital efforts  to promote access to mental health services.  Mental health is one of the greatest problems facing our Nation. During any one-year  period, up to 50 million Americans—more than  22 percent—suffer from a clearly diagnosable  mental disorder  involving a degree of  incapacity that interferes with employment, attendance at school or daily  life. Among other  things, mental health affects whether one gets  involved  in substance abuse, commits violence,  follows  through on medical advice,  cares for a child, performs his work, and engages  in healthy behaviors.  In short, one’s  mental health affects almost every aspect of  life.  I believe strongly in the need to support children’s physical and mental health, while respecting  parental  rights. Recognizing  that  early childhood is a critical period for the onset  of emotional and behavioral problems,  the  President’s Commission encouraged organizations that work with children to improve early  identification of children with mental health  needs. Research shows that early detection,  assessment, and connection to treatment and  support helps prevent mental health problems  from worsening. Because more than 52 million  students attend schools in the U.S., the Commission recognized that schools are in a key  position  to  identify mental health problems  early and help  link children  to appropriate  services. The Commission  in no way  recommends mandatory legislation or any effort  to circumvent parental consent to screening.  Quite the opposite, in fact. It repeatedly recommends  that  child-serving  organizations  work with parents to support identification and  treatment efforts.  Like so many disorders, mental illness does  not discriminate and effects every age, ethnic,  and socioeconomic group. Given  its widespread effect on  individuals and society, we  need to put more emphasis on mental health,  not less. I urge my colleagues to vote against  the Paul amendment.  f  DAVID MUELLER OF WESTFIELD,  INDIANA  HON.

824,129,2005-06-27,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker, for many years  we  in  this body have been discussing  the  issue of the use of methyl bromide and the impact of the elimination of this chemical as stated in the Montreal Protocol. We must look at  how  this will affect our diverse economy as  well as  lay  the groundwork  for new alternatives to replace methyl bromide. As signatories  to  the Montreal Protocol,  the United  States negotiators have a  responsibility  to  Congress and the Administration to seek an  acceptable balance as they travel to Montreal  in a few days to attend the Twenty-fifth Open-  Ended Working Group Meeting of the Parties  to  the Montreal Protocol, Second Extraordinary Meeting of the Parties, and associated  meetings 26 June–2 July 2005.  I am proud to say that the answer to this  international problem  is  found  right  in  the  State of Indiana and is being promoted by a  Hoosier with a vision to create a safer environment while  at  the  same  time  stimulating  growth in the Hoosier economy.  This person is David Mueller of Westfield,  Indiana. He is a fumigator and the son of a  flour miller and has been fumigating since he  was a  teenager. His privately owned  family  business was  founded  in 1981 and has 25  employees.  Methyl bromide is a product that his company Fumigation Service & Supply, Inc. began  using  in  the 1980s  for  fumigating  flourmills,  food processing structures, and post harvest  commodities throughout the United States. At  one point Mr. Mueller and his company used  or sold over 300,000  lbs of methyl bromide  per year in the early 1990s. This represented  about 55 percent of their total fumigation business.  As of January 1, 2005,  this  Indiana company no longer uses methyl bromide, How did  they phase out of this biocide?  In 1995 they heard that methyl bromide was  going  to be phased out under  the Montreal  Protocol. Dave understood  that  the  loss of  methyl bromide would have a dramatic effect  on his business. He attended several domestic  and international meetings to determine if this  was a true story. After determining that alternatives would, in fact, be required under the  U.S. Clean Air Act and the international treaty  signed by President Reagan called the Montreal Protocol, his company began to search  for credible alternatives.  As  a  stored  product  entomologist, Mr.  Mueller started this search process by looking  at methyl bromide and how it affects the insects and other pests. It is a biocide that kills  like napalm. When  it  touches something,  it  kills it: egg, larva, pupa and adult. Other fumigants needed more time or a higher dosage  rate to work. However, he understood that the  respiration of the insects could be increased  substantially by increasing the temperature in  the  flourmills and  food  factories or choosing  the warmest  time of  the year  to plan  the  scheduled fumigations.  By increasing the temperature of the insects  they were observed to become stressed, dehydrated, and would die  faster. The dosage  rates  for conventional  fumigants and  insecticides like phosphine, dichlorvos, and sulfuryl  fluoride worked better,  faster, and at  lower  dosage rates when temperatures of 90–100°F  (30–40°C) were created.  He also added carbon dioxide (3–5 percent)  to  the mix  to allow  for better mortality and  shorter shutdown times for these post harvest  fumigations. The carbon dioxide makes the insects and rodents breathe harder and faster  allowing the fumigants to kill better and faster.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

Corporal Keeling’s  life was defined by his  family, friends, love for his country and an unbridled energy and joy that he freely extended  to others. He received inner strength and faith  from those who knew him best and loved him  most, especially his parents, Sherry Berry and  Thomas Keeling, step-parents, Robert Berry  and Diane Palos, and siblings, Erin, Kristen  and Rebecca.  Corporal Keeling was a dedicated  family  member, student and Marine. After graduating  from Strongsville High School in 2000, he enrolled at Kent State University, where he graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in 2004. He  was always willing to go the extra mile for his  family,  friends, and  for  those with whom he  served beside, with the highest level of honor  and integrity, the men and women of Weapons Company—3rd Battalion, 25th U.S. Marine Regiment in Iraq.

CHARLES W. DENT  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2005  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 3010) making appropriations for the Departments of Labor,  Health and Human Services, and Education,  and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for other purposes:  ",2005
827,136,2005-06-27,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my support for the Community Services  Block Grants, and take a moment to highlight  the effect  these grants have on my District.  CSBG funds are used to support the Community Action Committee of  the Lehigh Valley  (CACLV). I have a long history of working with  the CACLV on a wide range of antipoverty initiatives which  include housing, hunger, and  community development, and I have seen the  positive contributions  that CACLV has made  as a result of CSBG funding.  CSBG grants are uniquely effective because  they are locally-controlled and respond to the  particular need of each individual community.  The grants produce a return on investments  and have a sophisticated outcome-based accountability system. In my district, the CACLV  generates over $8 for each CSBG dollar; half  of that leveraged money comes from private  sources which include utilities, banks, churches, foundations, and individuals.  CACLV runs two homeless shelters in my  district—Safe Harbor  in Easton and  the 6th  Street Shelter  in Allentown. These shelters  serve  individuals  and  families with  issues  ranging from drug and alcohol dependence to  mental health. The CACLV also operates Second Harvest Food Bank, distributing about 5  million pounds of donated and government  food to over 170 agencies each year.  CACLV operates three community development subsidiaries  that are conducting entrepreneurial  training and offer micro  loans  to  help create dozens of micro enterprises each  year. These CDC’s operate  two  inner-city  farmers’ markets, offer  cash assistance  to  struggling  neighborhood-based  businesses,  provide residential and commercial facade improvement grants, and youth recreation programs.  Finally, CACLV operates a comprehensive  financial services program  that  teaches dozens of low income families to save money and  buy homes. Additionally,  the CACLV offers  free tax preparation services to over 600 taxpaying households.  Beyond  these  impressive  efforts,  the  CACLV has a record of building partnerships.  It conceived and led a campaign that resulted  in two open space referenda. This project is  set to generate $70 million to create and enhance parks, protect natural areas and preserve farms. The CACLV’s housing initiatives  have  led campaigns  to create housing  trust  funds in two counties in my district, and funded programs that have dramatically expanded  homeowners hip throughout the Lehigh Valley.  The funding reductions included in this bill  will greatly impact CACLV and Community Action Agencies across the country. The Executive Director of CACLV expects that a cut in  excess of 50 percent will result in the closing  of one of its homeless shelters and all of its  small business development work and perhaps even more.  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that my district and  the nation need the services that Community  Action agencies provide. Although  I understand  the  tight budget constraints we  face,  these programs will stimulate  the economy  and improve the quality of life for the residents  of my district. As the appropriations process  advances, I would like to express my support  for funding levels equal to the final FY 2005  appropriations for CSBG.  f  REGARDING MEETING WITH  GENERAL LLOYD W.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING  BORDER SECURITY.  folthe  finds  (a)  FINDINGS.—Congress  lowing:  (1) The illegal alien population has risen  from 3,200,000 in 1986 to 10,300,000 in 2004.  (2) In fiscal year 2001, United States Border  Patrol agents apprehended almost 1,200,000  persons  for  illegally entering  the United  States.  (3) Senate Report 109–083 states, ‘‘there are  an estimated 11,000,000 illegal aliens in the  United States, including more than 400,000  individuals who have absconded, walking  away with impunity from Orders of Deportation and Removal’’.  (4) Between 1,000 and 3,000 special interest  aliens  from countries with an active terrorist presence enter the United States each  year.  (5) Of the 1,200,000  illegal aliens apprehended on the border between the United  States and Mexico, 643 were from countries  with known terrorism ties, including Syria,  Iran, and Libya.  (6) Senate Report 109–083 states, ‘‘officials  of the Department of Homeland Security  have conceded the United States does not  have operational control of its borders’’, including areas along the 1,989-mile southwest  border between the United States and Mexico.  (7) The daily attempts to cross the border  by thousands of illegal aliens from countries  around  the globe  continue  to present a  threat to United States national security.  (b) SENSEOFTHESENATE.—It is the sense  of the Senate that—  (1) this Nation cannot thoroughly address  the security of the United States without  recognizing the reality of terrorists taking  advantage of inadequacies in border security  along the border between the United States  and Mexico;  (2) every effort should be made to increase  the technology and efficiency in preventing  these individuals from entering the United  States across the Mexican border;  (3) the Mexican Government has an obligation to secure its side of the border between  the United States and Mexico; and  (4) the Mexican Government must commit  to addressing inadequacies in its own domestic and border security policies, which are  contributing to the present dilemma in border security.

852,64,2005-07-11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, the amendment is agreed to.  The amendment (No. 1070) was agreed  to.  ",2005
853,64,2005-07-11,Mr.  ISAKSON.," Mr. President,  the  amendment  is  a  sense-of-the-Senate  amendment to the Homeland Security  Appropriations bill dealing with border  security. I commend the subcommittee  chairman on the tremendous  investment this bill makes in homeland security and  in border  security  to  the  United States of America.  A few months ago when I made one of  the first speeches in the Senate with  regard  to  the  floor  supplemental,  I  talked a little bit about REAL ID and  what  is  the  largest  single domestic  issue in the United States today, illegal immigration.  In that particular speech I made a  note that I love our system of immigration, love the fact you can come to  this country and become a citizen—I  am a second-generation American myself—but we have been flooded as a nation over the past decade by a tremendous influx of those who have come illegally, many over the border of the  south, although obviously to the north  as well.  This goes a  long way toward providing the funding to Customs and to  Immigration to begin enforcing laws on  the books, making it tougher to come  into the United States the wrong way  and hopefully making it easier to come  to the United States the right way, the  legal way.

854,71,2005-07-11,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor a community in North  Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 2, the residents of  Dawson, ND,  gathered  to  celebrate  their community’s history and founding.  Dawson is a small town in south central North Dakota with a population of  approximately  75. Despite  its  small  size, Dawson holds an important place  in North Dakota’s history. The Sibley  Expedition helped begin the settlement  of this area, but it was the railroad’s  expansion  that was  responsible  for  Dawson’s birth. J. Dawson Thompson,  along with Fredrick D. Hager and Robert E. Wallace established the city of  Dawson in 1880. This town started with  a windmill and a water tower and later  developed into an important city. As a  railroad center, it was responsible for  welcoming early settlers.  As the first established city of Kidder  County, Dawson has experienced many  changes over the years. Today, Mayor  Rand Loveness leads this great city.  Known for its excellent hunting and  fishing, Dawson attracts a wide variety  of sportsmen. Although small in size,  Dawson has found ways to touch the  lives  of many  people. Dawson  has  served thousands of children and adults  through Camp Grassick. This  camp  specializes in giving people with disabilities and special needs a wonderful  summer  camp  experience. The Veterans Memorial Wall in Dawson is another example of how this town has  given back to its community. This wall  honors 1,010 veterans serving from the  Crimean War to the gulf war.  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in  congratulating Dawson, ND, and  its  residents on their first 125 years and in  wishing them well through the next  century. By honoring Dawson and all  the other historic small towns of North  Dakota, we keep the pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations.  It is places such as Dawson that have  helped to shape this country into what  it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.  Dawson has a proud past and a bright  future.∑  f  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF LANKIN,  NORTH DAKOTA  ∑",2005
855,71,2005-07-11,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor a community in North  Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 8–10, the residents  of Lankin, ND, celebrated their community’s history and founding.  Lankin is a small town in the northeast part of North Dakota. Despite its  small size, Lankin holds an important  place in North Dakota’s history. The  site was originally named ‘‘Young’’ for  G.W. Young, a Park River lawyer and  former teacher. He established the post  office  on April  7,  1898,  and  John  Matajeck became the first postmaster.  The name was changed to Lankin on  July 27, 1905, when John Lankin became postmaster and the townsite was  established on the Soo Line Railroad.  Lankin was officially incorporated as a  village in 1908. Among the town’s residents were Jack McDonald, a trumpet  player with Philip Sousa’s famous band  and Herman Witasek, a member of  Lankin’s  1930  State  Class  C High  School basketball champions, who is  considered to be North Dakota’s first  professional player of the sport.  Today Lankin is a delightful community in which to live and work. Lankin  is home to a number of businesses, including a grain elevator, post office,  bank, restaurant and an American Legion Club. There is also an active volunteer fire department and EMS squad.  The community hosted a variety of festivities during its centennial celebration. On Friday, it held an all-school  reunion, banquet and dance. Saturday  kicked off with a parade and that will  be followed by a day of entertainment  featuring games, music, a  three-on-  three  basketball  tournament  and  a  fireworks display  that evening. The  weekend will close with a church service and picnic on Sunday.  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in  congratulating Lankin, ND, and  its  residents on their first 100 years and in  wishing them well through the next  century. By honoring Lankin and all  the other historic small towns of North  Dakota, we keep the pioneering tradition spirit alive for future generations.  It is places such as Lankin that have  helped to shape this country into what  it is today, which is why Lankin is deserving of our recognition.

856,71,2005-07-11,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor a community in North  Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 8–10, 2005, the residents  of McClusky, ND,  celebrated  their community’s history and founding.  The community of McClusky is located at the geographic center of North  Dakota, approximately 65 miles northeast of the State capital, Bismarck,  and 50 miles east of beautiful Lake  Sakakawea, a manmade lake formed  by the Garrison Dam on the Missouri  River. Within  45 miles of  18  lakes,  McClusky  is home  to  some of  the  world’s premier hunting and fishing.  Founded in 1905 as the result of railroad  expansion  into  the  area,  McClusky became a bustling farming  community. Farming was, and continues  to  be,  the  mainstay  of  McClusky. In fact, the community received its name from William Henderson McClusky, a local farmer responsible for the town’s establishment. In  addition to farming, however, at this  time McClusky’s 500 residents are also  vital to the continued existence of numerous organizations and businesses,  including 6 churches and a bed and  breakfast.  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in  congratulating McClusky, ND, and its  residents on their first 100 years. By  honoring McClusky and all of the other  historic small towns of North Dakota,  we keep the pioneering frontier spirit  alive for future generations. It is places  such as McClusky that have helped to  shape  this country  into what  it  is  today, which is why this fine community is worthy of our recognition.

858,78,2005-07-11,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, today I  rise  to  introduce  a much  needed  amendment  to  the  Indian Arts and  Crafts Act. I am pleased to be joined by  the vice chairman of the Indian Affairs  Committee, Senator BYRON and my good friend and colleague from  Arizona, Senator JONKYLas original  cosponsors of this bill.  This bill expands the existing Federal  investigative authority by authorizing  other  Federal  investigative  bodies,  such as the BIA Office of Law Enforcement, in addition to the FBI, to investigate cases of misrepresentation of Indian arts and crafts. This bill is substantially the same as Section 111 of  the Native American Omnibus Act, S.  536, which passed out of the Committee  on Indian Affairs earlier this year. This  bill also addresses concerns that were  raised by the administration.  A major source of tribal and individual Indian income is derived from  the sale of handmade Indian arts and  crafts. Yet, today, millions of dollars  are  diverted  each year  from  these  original artists and Indian tribes by  those who reproduce and sell counterfeit Indian goods. However, it is my understanding that few, if any, criminal  prosecutions have been brought in Federal court for such violations. It is understandable that enforcing the criminal law that prohibits the sale of Indian arts and crafts misrepresented as  an Indian product is often stalled by  the other responsibilities of the FBI including investigating terrorism activity and violent crimes in Indian country. Therefore, expanding the  investigative  authority  to  include  other  Federal agencies  is  intended to promote the active  investigation of alleged misconduct. It is my hope that  with  this much needed change will  deter those who dare to violate the act.  I ask unanimous consent that text of  the bill be printed in the RECORD.  S. 1375  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

863,176,2005-07-11,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I rise  to speak on a resolution submitted by  Senator FRIST and Senator REID to  commemorate the life and work of Senator Gaylord Nelson. It is with mixed  emotions that I make this statement  honoring Senator Nelson.  I am proud—proud to have known  Gaylord Nelson, proud to be from the  same State as him, and proud to occupy his Senate seat. I am also deeply  saddened—saddened by the loss to his  family, especially  to his wife of  58  years, Carrie Lee; saddened by the loss  to our Nation; and saddened that a personal hero and dear friend of mine is  gone. I am also thankful—thankful for  Senator Nelson’s long life, thankful for  the example he set of how to make a  difference in this world, and thankful  to his family for sharing this good and  decent man with the Nation. We mourn  his death, but we also celebrate his remarkable legacy.  Gaylord Anton Nelson was born on  June 4, 1916, in Clear Lake, WI. Gaylord’s parents were always interested  in politics, and in true Wisconsin tradition, they were La Follette Progressive  Republicans at  the State  level and  Democrats at the national level. Their  Wisconsin-style  progressive  politics  rubbed off on young Gaylord.  When he was 10, Gaylord traveled  with his dad to hear a campaign speech  by Senator Bob La Follette, Jr., who  succeeded his father in the Senate in  1925. Gaylord recalls in his biography:  On the way back home to Clear Lake, my  dad asked if I wanted to be a senator. I said  I’d love to be a senator, but I’m afraid that  Bob La Follette will solve all of our problems before I get a chance to serve.  Thirty-three years later, Gaylord was  nominated to be the Democrat candidate for Governor of Wisconsin. At  the 1958 Democrat convention in LaCrosse, Gaylord’s father had a heart attack. When Gaylord went to see him in  the hospital, the elder Nelson smiled  and then said to his son, ‘‘Do you think  Bob La Follette left enough problems  behind for you to solve?’’ Gaylord’s father died 10 days later.  Unfortunately, Gaylord’s father did  not get to see his son’s rise to the national political  level.  If he had, he  would have seen Gaylord attack those  ‘‘remaining problems  left  to  solve’’  with La Follette-like dogged determination and commitment to Progressive politics. From consumer protection to employee rights, Senator Nelson fought doggedly to address problems affecting countless Americans.  Gaylord Nelson was also willing to  take a tough stand. When President  Johnson requested money to escalate  the war in Vietnam, for example, Nelson was one of three senators to vote  against the proposal. In a speech on  this floor, he said:  At a time  in history when the Senate  should be vindicating its historic reputation  as  the greatest deliberative body  in  the  world, we are stumbling over each other to  see who can say ‘yea’ the quickest and the  loudest. I regret it, and I think some day we  shall all regret it. . . . Reluctantly, I express  my opposition . . . here by voting ‘nay.’ The  support in the Congress for this measure is  clearly overwhelming. Obviously, you need  my vote less than I need my conscience.  Whether it was issues of war and foreign affairs, worker safety and health,  or access to affordable healthcare, Gaylord Nelson was guided by his conscience, and by the wellbeing of Wisconsinites.  Out  of  his  impressive  record, however, one issue stands out  as central to his legacy—Gaylord Nelson’s passion and commitment to protecting our environment.  Not many people who have served in  this distinguished body can lay claim  to a day, but Gaylord Nelson can. On  April 22, 1970, Gaylord Nelson created a  day to celebrate the glory of the Earth.  Where did Nelson get his lifelong interest and dedication to the environment?  ‘‘By  osmosis,’’  Nelson  would  say,  ‘‘while growing up in Clear Lake, WI.’’  It’s true that Wisconsin has a tradition  of  great  conservationists—Aldo  Leopold, author of A Sand County Almanac; Sigurd Olson, one of the founders of the Wilderness Society; and John  Muir, founder of the Sierra Club. The  people of Wisconsin, living in such a  beautiful  and  ecologically  diverse  State, feel a special connection to our  natural resources. We share a long tradition of our State government achieving excellence in its conservation policies. Many Wisconsinites would agree  with Senator Nelson that our conservation ethic comes  ‘‘by osmosis’’ from  the  intense  natural  beauty  of  our  State. Every year I hold a town hall  meeting in each one of Wisconsin’s 72  counties, and protecting the environment is always one of the top issues  raised at these forums.  Senator Nelson’s vision and determination helped crystallize this Wisconsin  conservation  ethic  into  an  international phenomenon. Thanks to  Gaylord Nelson, Wisconsin  can  lay  claim to the genesis of Earth Day, a  day of national and international reflection on the importance of our natural resources and a clean environment. Thanks to him, for the past 35  VerDate Aug 04 2004  05:36 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00144 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A11JY6.087 S11PT1 ",2005
864,183,2005-07-11,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to an outstanding representative from the  1st District of the great State of Washington,  Frank Maziarski, CRNA, MS, CLNC. Mr.  Maziarski will soon complete his year as national president of the American Association of  Nurse Anesthetists (AANA). I am very pleased  that this son of Washington was tapped as the  2004–2005 president of  this prestigious national organization, and I am honored to count  him as one of my constituents.  The AANA is the professional organization  that represents more  than 33,000 practicing  Certified  Registered  Nurse  Anesthetists  (CRNAs). Founded in 1931, the AANA is the  professional association representing CRNAs  nationwide. As you may know, CRNAs are anesthesia professionals who administer approximately 65 percent of all anesthetics given to  patients each year in the United States. They  work in every setting in which anesthesia is  delivered including hospital surgical suites and  obstetrical delivery rooms, ambulatory surgical  centers, and the offices of dentists, podiatrists,  and plastic surgeons.  CRNAs provide anesthesia for all types of  surgical cases and,  in some states, are  the  sole anesthesia providers in approximately 70  percent of all rural hospitals, affording these  medical facilities obstetrical, surgical and trauma stabilization services.  Mr. Maziarski earned his Master of Science  (MS) degree and his Bachelors of Science degree in nursing (BSN) from the University of  Nebraska at Omaha. He was educated in the  art and science of Nurse Anesthesia at the Albany Medical Center, School of Nurse Anesthesia, Albany, NY. He spent 21 years as an  officer in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps, first as  an anesthesia provider and then as an educator  in  the  Academy  of Health  Sciences  Schools of Nurse Anesthesia and was a Director of the Phase I (clinical) and also a Director  of Phase II (academic) portions of the Nurse  Anesthesia programs. He retired as a Lieutenant Colonel at Beaumont Army Medical Center, El Paso, Texas. He also spent one year  as Chief Nurse Anesthetist of the 93rd Evac.  Hospital, in Long Binh, Viet Nam during July,  1968–July, 1969. He is currently a practicing  nurse anesthetist and owner of Allied Anesthesia Associates, which provides anesthesia  services in and around the Shoreline, Washington area, in my congressional district.  Mr. Maziarski has held various  leadership  positions  in  the AANA as President-Elect,  Vice-President, and Regional Director before  becoming the National President of the AANA  in 2004. In addition, Frank has served terms  as President, President-Elect, Vice-President,  Treasurer, and as a Member of the Board of  Directors  for  the Washington Association of  Nurse Anesthetists (WANA). He was also appointed by Governor Gary Locke to the Washington State Nursing Care Quality Assurance  Commission from 1997–2004 and was elected  as its chair twice during his tenure.  Adding to his professional accomplishments,  Mr. Maziarski has been recognized  for both  publishing and speaking on anesthesia-related  topics over the years. He has taken his experience and knowledge from the workplace and  AANA leadership roles to lecture on political  and academic anesthesia related topics before  different professional groups. During his AANA  Presidency, Mr. Maziarski has played important  roles  in advocating  for  the practice of  nurse anesthesia and its patients before Medicare and other Federal agencies, promoted  anesthesia patient  safety  through  vigorous  participation  in  the  interdisciplinary National  Quality Forum (NQF), and advanced principles  of wellness among practitioners in this highstress profession. In addition, Mr. Maziarski directed that the AANA be represented before  three key subcommittees of this Congress, in  which members of  this organization  testified  about the importance of nurse anesthesia education, the roles and contributions of CRNAs  in the Veterans’ Affairs health system, and the  dedication with which CRNAs have provided  safe anesthesia care to members of the U.S.  Armed Forces at home and abroad.  It  is my  understanding  that  under Mr.  Maziarski’s leadership, the AANA continued to  foster an important line of communication with  the American Society  of Anesthesiologists  (ASA). While  these organizations of anesthesia professionals have not always seen  eye-to-eye, both the AANA and ASA are working to ensure the safe administration of powerful anesthesia drugs, and have shared interest  in patients’ safe access  to anesthesia care  with respect to Medicare regulations governing  locked anesthesia carts. These two societies’  professional working  relationship may  not  have been possible without the continued initiative of AANA President Maziarski and his  ASA counterpart.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  today  in  recognizing Mr. Frank Maziarski,  CRNA, MS, CLNC, for his notable career and  outstanding achievements. f  TRIBUTE TO ELISSA  GIAMBASTIANI  HON.

865,183,2005-07-11,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Elissa Giambastiani who is retiring after  18 years as President and CEO of the San  Rafael, California, Chamber of Commerce.  Under Elissa’s dynamic leadership, the Chamber has successfully promoted not only the immediate needs of  local businesses but also  the long-term economic interests of the community.  As an advocate for workforce housing and  transportation  infrastructure  improvements,  Elissa has been in the forefront of efforts to  establish a housing trust and to pass a transportation sales  tax. Her expertise  is widely  recognized, and she was recently  invited  to  speak at a National Workforce Housing summit in Arlington, Virginia, on ‘‘Fostering Community Acceptance of Affordable and Workforce Housing.’’  Born  and  raised  in Minnesota,  Elissa  worked there as a teacher before taking a job  with the Army teaching in Europe. After her return, she moved to San Francisco where she  worked  in an architect’s office and met her  husband Ron Giambastiani who worked in the  same office and lived in San Rafael. She also  worked as public relations consultant before  joining the Chamber in 1987.  As President, Elissa developed and implemented the overall program for an organization with over 950 members. She also took the  lead in tracking and advocating the business  viewpoint on  legislation,  including an  instrumental role in the formation of the Alliance of  North Bay Chambers to increase clout. This  function  lead  to  the San Rafael Chamber  earning an Advocacy Chamber of  the Year  Award, one of the first winners in this category  which was created by the California Chamber  of Commerce in 2003.  Elissa has also won an award from Western  Association of Chamber Executives for management excellence and an Accredited Chamber  Executive  designation  from  the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce. Locally, she  is a  member of the League of Women Voters, the  Ecumenical Association for Housing, and the  San Rafael Rotary.  Mr. Speaker, ‘‘tenacious’’ and ‘‘tireless’’ are  appropriate words frequently used to describe  Elissa Giambastiani. I would add ‘‘clear-sighted, passionate, and  caring,’’ all adjectives  which do  justice  to her effectiveness as a  leader in of the San Rafael community. I wish  her luck in her new pursuits of piano playing,  Japanese flower arranging, Italian study, public  relations  consulting  as  well  as  grandmothering.

Chuck has been at my  side for the last 11 years, starting with grassroots outreach, then on to handle legislative  issues in my Washington, DC office before returning back to Texas to run my Dallas district  office. Chuck has provided experienced judgment and advice to his fellow staff members  and me for years, and his tireless work ethic  will be greatly missed. I have come to appreciate and value his keen ability to lead by example and facilitate smooth flowing district operations for so many years.  Chuck graduated with a bachelor of science  degree in political science in 1993 from Texas  Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas and  he received his masters of business administration from the McCombs School of Business  at the University of Texas earlier this year.  Chuck and his wonderful wife have two children, Abbey  (3) and Hayden  (6 months).  I  wish the entire Bauer family all the best for  Chuck’s next endeavor.  I  thank him  for his  great service to the people of the 32nd Congressional District of Texas.  Even though he will no longer be employed  by the Congress, I will always be able to call  him my dear friend. I am sure that the great  Chuck Bauer will continue  to  impress  those  around him in his new line of work. f  IN RECOGNITION OF MARY WEST  HON. JOHN T.

867,190,2005-07-11,Mr. SALAZAR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of Mary West, the 2005 recipient  of the Disney Teacher award. Ms. West is a  special  needs  high  school  teacher  in  Montrose, Colorado.  In  this  capacity,  she  teaches students what they need to know to  function in their community. Working with students as old as 21, she is often times the last  teacher these students will have before they  enter the adult world.  It  is an honor and a privilege  to have a  teacher of Mary West’s caliber in my district.  Ms. West’s dedication exemplifies the kind of  steadfast determination and drive  I grew up  with in Colorado. As one of only 45 winners  selected out of more than 50,000 nominees,  Ms. West, and her school, will  receive upwards of $15,000 from the Walt Disney Company for use in maintaining this high quality of  education at Montrose High School.  Education is about the future, about making  our dreams  for a better  tomorrow a reality.  Family values, a good education,  these are  the foundation on which that future ought to  rest. What more could we possibly want for  our children than the opportunity to see their  dreams, large or small, come true. More than  simply watching our children succeed though,  this  foundation allows us  to  take pride  in  knowing that their success is not due to luck,  but rather to their own ability to make something of themselves.  We therefore have a responsibility to ensure  our children enter  that  future with  the best  education possible. Teachers, like Mary West,  are putting these seemingly incredible dreams  within reach. So, it is my hope that you will  join with me in congratulating Ms. West on her  accomplishments. With the help of Ms. West  and other dedicated teachers throughout Colorado, I feel confident that today’s youth will be  prepared  to accept  the challenges and  the  possibilities of tomorrow. f  TRIBUTE TO LINDA GRAHAM  WARD  HON. KEN CALVERT  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 11, 2005 ",2005
868,190,2005-07-11,Mr. CALVERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor and pay tribute to Linda Graham Ward,  who retired on June 17,2005 after thirty three  years as a teacher in the Ocean View School  District of Huntington Beach, California.  Linda G. Ward  is a  fantastic  teacher who  truly cares  for her students. She has dedicated her 33 years of teaching to improving  the quality of life of her students by teaching  them Fitness  for Life. Her greatest career  achievements include not only saving the lives  of several students, but teaching students how  to live healthier lives through physical fitness.  She inspired her students to go on to become  Olympians, professional athletes, and  teachers.  Linda was born and  raised  in EI Centro,  California. Her love of learning lead her to the  University of Southern California where she  earned her teaching credential in 1972. That  fall she began her long career with the Ocean  View School District  teaching Physical Education and Science. Her. campus assignments  took her to the Rancho View School, the Vista  View Middle School and the Spring View Middle School. She kept  learning as well and  earned a master’s degree  in kinesiology  in  1973.  At each campus she served as a teacher,  coach  and mentor  to  her  students. She  coached  volleyball, basketball,  track,  cross  country, softball and soccer. She was  the  Mentor Teacher for Ocean View School District Physical Education Program and Developed  and  implemented  the Ocean  View  School District’s Physical Fitness Program for  Grades 6, 7 and 8. Linda went above and beyond the normal teaching role to inspire her  students to live a fit and healthy lifestyle. She  created  the Ocean View School District’s  Physical Fitness Awards Program based on  Olympic Games model to recognize students’  achievements and implemented the California  Fitness  Testing  Program  in Ocean  View  School District.  She made remarkable strides in improving  the health of her students by becoming a CPR  Instructor for the Ocean View School District  and teaching students and employees how to  save lives. Linda also served as Physical Education expert and advisor to Orange County  Grand Jury  investigation regarding childhood  obesity. She also wrote, obtained and expended PEP grant  funds  in  the amount of  $472,000 to implement the SPARK Program  for physical fitness in her district. For her efforts Linda was named the Most Inspirational  Teacher in the Ocean View School District, an  award she certainly deserves.  For over three decades Linda G. Ward has  been educating and motivating the young people of Southern California. She has  indeed  made a positive difference  in  thousands of  lives and earned my many thanks. I wish her  all the best in her future endeavors. f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. TOM COLE  OFOKLAHOMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 11, 2005 ",2005

BUTTERFIELD  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 11, 2005 ",2005
870,190,2005-07-11,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  remember U.S. Army CPL Phillip  Charles Edmundson, of my hometown of Wilson, NC, for serving our country during Operation  Iraqi Freedom. Corporal Edmundson  made  the ultimate sacrifice  for our country  when he died on June 1, 2005 when an improvised explosive device detonated near his  Bradley Fighting Vehicle during combat operations. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion,  9th  Infantry Regiment, 2nd  Infantry Division,  Fort Carson, CO. He was just 22 years old.  Corporal Edmundson was  the  first person  from my community  to die  in combat since  Vietnam. While we are saddened at this great  loss, we are so honored  to claim Corporal  Edmundson as the product of our community.  Corporal Edmundson had re-enlisted while  in Iraq and was scheduled to be promoted to  sergeant. During his funeral service, Corporal  Edmundson was awarded a Bronze Star and  Purple Heart posthumously for his bravery and  dedicated service.  It was my honor  to  represent U.S. Army  CPL Phillip Charles Edmundson and to have  a  friendship  with  his  parents,  Robert  Edmundson and Anne Edmundson. I extend  my deepest  sympathies  to his  family and  friends. He will be deeply missed and his service was greatly appreciated.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit for the  a  poem  by CPL Phillip Charles  Edmundson. RECORD A SOLDIER’SREFLECTIONS  I was that which others did not want to be.  I went where others feared to go  and did what others failed to do.  I asked nothing from those who gave nothing  and reluctantly accepted the thought of eternal loneliness . . .  Should I fail, I have seen the face of terror;  Felt the stinging cold of fear;  and enjoyed the sweet taste of a moment’s  love.  I have cried, pained, and hoped . . .  but most of all, I have lived times others  would say  were best forgotten. At least someday  I will be able to say that I was proud of what  I was . . .  ‘‘A Soldier’’.  —CPL Phillip Charles Edmundson VerDate jul 14 2003  04:12 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A11JY8.043 E11PT1 ",2005

874,45,2005-07-15,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, briefly in  response to my friend from Kentucky,  the  distinguished majority whip,  I  agree with him. We should have a civil  debate on the Supreme Court nominee.  That is going to happen based on what  the President has done to this point.  He met with me  in a one-on-one  meeting prior  to  the  resignation of  Sandra Day O’Connor. He called me the  day she resigned. There was a meeting  this past Monday in the White House  with Senator FRIST, this Senator, and  the two leaders of our Judiciary Committee. I thought it was a very good  meeting.  What happens regarding a Supreme  Court nominee  is dependent on  the  President. From all the indications I  have gotten, he does not want a big  battle, nor do we. I am hopeful and  confident that will be the case.  However, I say directly to my friend  from Kentucky, there is no reason we  can’t make the October 1 date if the  President selects someone next week or  the week after or the week after that.  We can have the FBI working. We can  have the Judiciary Committee staffs  working. The first or second week in  September, there can be hearings that  last a week. Everyone can ask all the  questions they want. Especially if it is  a Supreme Court Justice who is one  the President thinks, and he indicated  he would allow us to—certainly I would  like to conominate, but I know that is  not our purpose in the Senate. He did  indicate if there is someone who is deserving of a red flag for reasons that  maybe he does not anticipate, we can  maybe help in that regard.  Keep in mind, Sandra Day O’Connor,  being the brilliant woman she is, made  her resignation effective upon appointment of her successor. It would be better if we had the new Supreme Court  Justice when they begin their Court  hearings in October. We are going to  try to do everything we can to cooperate in that regard. If it does not happen, Sandra Day O’Connor will still be  there. During this period of time, the  summer months, she is still handling  her circuit duties, doing everything she  needs to do as a member of the Supreme Court. I admire her for not making the resignation effective upon the  President receiving that letter. Everyone should cool the rhetoric and see  what will happen. The ball is in the  President’s court.  As has been indicated, a significant  number of names were discussed with  him. We did not discuss anyone with  him in a negative tone. Every person  we talked about with him was positive,  some of whom he knew, some he knew  personally.  I am hopeful this will all work out  for the good of the country. When I say  ‘‘good of the country,’’ it would be better  for  everyone—the President  included, the Democrats and Republicans  in the Senate—that we did not have a  protracted problem in the Senate regarding Sandra Day O’Connor’s  replacement. We would do her honor by  having someone move into this position without a lot of problems.  f  MISALLOCATION OF SENATE TIME  ",2005
875,45,2005-07-15,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, my friend,  the  distinguished majority  leader,  noted this morning that we have been  in session for over 6 months. That is  certainly true. My colleague from Tennessee  is  correct,  we  have made  progress over these last 6 months.  But it is important to the American  people that the other side of the story,  as Paul Harvey says, is also told. What  is that other side of the story? He cited  progress we have made but made no  mention of the wasted time  in this  Senate on the so-called judicial option,  the nuclear option. The time we wasted  there was multiple weeks. I don’t know  if anyone has kept an accounting of the  exact time, but the rough calculation I  have made is more than one-third of  the time we have been  in session—  about 89 days—we have devoted all or  most of 30 days to that issue. More  than one-third of the time we have  spent in the Senate was spent on the  so-called nuclear option.  What did that involve? First of all,  we approved, prior to starting, 208 of  the President’s nominees and turned  down 10. The President, as soon as he  was reelected, renominated 7 of the 10  we turned down. Three of the individuals decided they did not want to be  judges or they did not want to go  through the process. One of the judges  retired who the President recess appointed. We spent more than one-third  of the Senate’s time on seven judges.  From  the  very  beginning  of  the  President’s  reelection, we  said with  two of them, there is no problem, the  two Michigan judges. No problem whatever. Just bring them here, we will  vote on them, and they can go through.  The reason they were turned down  earlier is because of all the problems in  the past when the majority at that  time—the Republicans sometimes were  in the minority; it flipped back and  forth; but they would not allow some  judges who came from Michigan. It was  a procedural problem. Upon the President’s reelection, we said: You have  those two Michigan judges. So we have  spent one-third of the Senate’s time on  five people, five nominees.  These people could be members of the  President’s  family,  but would  you  spend one-third of the Senate’s time on  that while  leaving  important  issues  dealing with this body alone, ignoring  them and rejecting them? I don’t think  so. But these were not members of the  President’s  family  but  people who  wanted  to  be  judges. What  did  it  amount to when we finished? Out of  the  five, three have been chosen as  judges, two were not. It boiled down to  three people. That is what it amounts  to. I don’t think that is a good allocation of our time, and that is a gross understatement.  Not a single day have we spent in  this Senate dealing with health care—  not a debate on health care, let alone  legislation. I don’t think we can find a  person anyplace in America who would  not say, Boy, this problem with health  care is significant. Why do they feel  that way? Because 45 million Americans have no health care, and millions  more are underinsured, meaning they  have insurance but it is not very good.  This problem is affecting the very core  of our society.  Employers know their employees are  happier and they are better employees  when they have health insurance. Why  did these employers not have health insurance for their employees? They are  not mean. They are not miserly. They  have no health insurance because they  cannot figure out a way to get it. With  the present state of our society, employers all over America cannot buy  health insurance. Once they buy it, it  is canceled if someone gets sick or is in  an accident. It is a problem we should  be spending time on. Ignoring it does  not do the trick.  Education. I have said in the Senate,  and I will say it again, I met some time  ago with  all  17  superintendents  of  schools of the State of Nevada. We  have a wide range of sizes of our school  districts. The Clark County school district, Las Vegas, has about 300,000 students. It is one of the largest school  districts in all of America.

ROB SIMMONS  OFCONNECTICUT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 14, 2005 ",2005
877,66,2005-07-15,Mr. SIMMONS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  praise  the service and sacrifice of a brave  young soldier  from my district, SPC Christopher Lee Hoskins, who gave his life in the  cause of  freedom and democracy  in  Iraq.  I  also pay tribute to SPC Hoskins’ family, who  raised this fine young man in an environment  of loving care and who supported his decision  to serve his country in uniform in Iraq.  On June 21, Army SPC Christopher Hoskins, of Killingly, Connecticut, was killed  in  Ramadi, Iraq, after his unit came under small  arms fire west of Baghdad. The death of SPC  Hoskins, who was a member of the Army’s 1st  Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade  Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, marked  the 25th death of a Connecticut soldier in the  war in Afghanistan and the Middle East.  SPC Hoskins was 21 years old. He, along  with  so many other  fine  young men and  women from across our Nation, was serving  America and the cause of freedom by fighting  terrorism and helping to bring stability to a part  of the world that for far too long has known  mainly violence and misery.  SPC Hoskins graduated from Killingly High  School  in 2001. He enlisted  in  the Army  in  2003. He had recently re-enlisted for another  four years.  In many ways, SPC Hoskins was typical of  most American youths. His  friends  recalled  that he was generous and polite; he enjoyed  listening  to Metallica; he played chess and  was a member of his high school wrestling  team; he enjoyed painting and he worked the  cameras at school plays.  And  in many ways he was  typical of  the  men and women who preceded him as members of our Nation’s armed forces. This was a  young man who wanted to serve a cause larger than himself.  This was a young man who did not have to  place himself in harm’s way but volunteered to  do so in service to our Nation, our people and  the way of life that we treasure. America is a  better place because of young men like Army  SPC Christopher Hoskins.  We cannot repay the debt we owe Christopher Hoskins; we can only honor him and  his family. And we do.  Memorial Day was set aside as  the day  when Americans  remember  those who  left  their homes, families and jobs to defend our  Nation—and never returned. But our men and  women in uniform defend freedom every day,  and every day there are those who pay the ultimate price for their selflessness. It would be  highly appropriate if we took a moment out of  every day  to honor and remember  the men  and women who stand between America and  those who would do her harm.  Today, July 14, 2005 SPC Hoskins was interred at Arlington National Cemetery overlooking Washington, D.C. with full military honors. He will posthumously  receive a Purple  Heart for his wounds and a Bronze Star for his  valor. SPC Hoskins will rest in good company,  among others who answered the call to duty,  honor and country.  We pray  that  the service and sacrifice of  SPC Hoskins will remind us of the high cost  which is paid by those who love our freedom,  who believe in our democracy and who give  their best to defend the best Nation on Earth.  May God rest his soul. f  FREEDOM FOR ALEJANDRO  GONZA´LEZ RAGA  HON. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 14, 2005 Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to speak about Alejandro  Gonza´lez Raga, a political prisoner  in  totalitarian Cuba.  Mr. Gonza´lez Raga is an independent journalist and a  contributor  to  the Camagu¨ey  Press Agency. As an independent journalist in  a totalitarian Cuba, Mr. Gonza´lez Raga’s truthful articles have helped the world to learn the  facts about the nightmare that is the Castro  regime. Because of his belief in factual reporting, Mr. Gonza´lez Raga relentlessly chronicled  the atrocities committed by Castro’s machinery  of  repression.  I  remind my colleagues  that,  under Castro’s  totalitarian  regime, any  freedom of  the press, any effort  to display  the  atrocities of the regime under the spotlight of  truth, is met with swift and violent repression.  In March, 2003, Mr. Gonza´lez Raga was arrested as part of  the dictatorship’s heinous  crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy activists. According to Reporters Without Borders,  as part of his sham trial, Mr. Gonza´lez Raga  was accused of ‘‘cooperating with the foreign  press,’’ and of  ‘‘systematically endangering  territorial integrity’’ by writing reports on subjects considered ‘‘very sensitive’’ by the dictatorship such as  ‘‘shortages due  to  the economic crisis, relations with other countries, TV  programs, the education budget.’’ He was sentenced to 14 years in Castro’s dungeons for  these ‘‘crimes.’’  Let me be very clear, Mr. Gonza´lez Raga is  currently  languishing  in  the depraved conditions of the totalitarian gulag for his truthful articles. The U.S. State Department describes  the conditions in the gulag as, ‘‘harsh and life  threatening.’’ The State Department also reports that police and prison officials beat, neglect, isolate, and deny medical treatment to  detainees and prisoners. It is a crime of the  highest order  that people are  imprisoned  in  these nightmarish conditions simply for reporting the facts.  Mr. Speaker, it is as inconceivable as it is  unacceptable that, while the world stands by  in  silence  and  acquiescence,  independent  journalists who write the truth about totalitarian  regimes are systematically  tortured. My Colleagues, we must demand the immediate and  unconditional  release of Alejandro Gonza´lez  Raga and every political prisoner in totalitarian  Cuba. f  MONMOUTH  DANSKIN  BIRTHDAY  COUNTY’S  CELEBRATES  BEN  80TH  HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 14, 2005 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to offer my best and warmest wishes to a good friend and constituent, Mr. Benjamin H. Danskin, who  today celebrates his  80th birthday.  Ben Danskin has been a key figure in government service, public advocacy and business development in Monmouth County, New  Jersey  for more  than 50 years. He  is  respected, admired and well-liked by colleagues,  associates and former political rivals. His family and close friends are inspired by his wit,  good nature, character, charisma and kindness.  Born and raised in Spring Lake, New Jersey, Ben and his older brother, Clyde, learned  the importance of public service through their  father’s example. Their  father, Benjamin S.

Danskin also  succeeded in the public arena. He served as  the Secretary of the State Division of Tax Appeals, President of the New Jersey Association of Tax Commissioners, and Deputy Director of Taxation, assisting in the creation of the  state  tax equalization program. Government  service would become a family trait.  In September 1943, young Ben Danskin  joined the Army as a Lieutenant and began  training to become a B–25 bomber pilot.

880,2,2005-07-25,Mr. DEFAZIO.," Mr. Speaker,  I was  just actually watching a speech by the  President. It was sort of the Grimm’s  Fairy Tales version of why Members of  this House should vote for CAFTA, why  Members of this House should vote to  extend a failing trade policy to another  five nations in Central America as a  template for an even larger expansion  of failed U.S. NAFTA free trade policies  throughout  the western  hemisphere.  He  talked about  their  subsistence  farmers and how, if only the tariffs on  very expensive U.S. agricultural machinery were removed, that additional  10 or 15 percent on the cost, how the  subsistence farmers who average less  than  $1,000  a year will  be  buying  $100,000, $500,000 pieces of farm equipment. They will just trot right down to  the local bank, and I guess the bank  will extend them a loan for a $500,000  piece of equipment they will never be  able to pay for, and they will not be  able to afford fuel to put this.  Now, that is the same kind of falsehood we heard about NAFTA, that this  was going to be a boon for U.S. workers  and manufactured goods because all  the people of Mexico would take all  their pesos, put them together, and  they could afford to buy almost as  much stuff as the people of New Jersey.  In the case of CAFTA it is an even  smaller economy, less capability.  He  talked about how  the  factory  workers there are just waiting in line  to buy American goods. Of course $0.40  an hour, you are not going to be buying  a lot of American goods or probably  not any. But they are working for a lot  less than American production workers.  So what  is going to happen with  CAFTA? The same thing that happened  with NAFTA. You are going to see U.S.  capital flood south into Central America so that they can produce things  that were once made here, textiles and  other things  in the case of Central  America and in all probability. In the  case of NAFTA,  it was automobiles,  auto parts,  it was a whole  flood of  things, washing machines, driers, other  appliances. It all went to Mexico. They  predicted that NAFTA, just like with  CAFTA, they said, oh, CAFTA is going  to be great for the American economy.  It will put people to work, create jobs.  They  said  the  same  thing  about  NAFTA. It was going to create a million jobs. Instead it lost a million jobs.  Now, what they do is really tricky  when they talk about CAFTA. They  talk about how they have studied it  and studied it, and they see an increase  in exports to Central America.  What they do not say is the President’s own trade commission sees a  much bigger increase in imports from  Central America. That means a net deficit. That means we are selling less  there  than we are buying back.  It  means we are going to lose more jobs.  It is the same condition we are in with  the rest of the world.  The United States of America is borrowing $2 billion a day to finance the  purchase of overseas goods, goods that  were once made here by people who  earned a decent living.  This is not a sustainable model. And  to extend it to Central America is not  going to begin to put America on a better path to bringing jobs home to the  United States, bringing wages back up  for our production workers, seeing that  they continue to have benefits.  American workers  should  not  be  asked to compete with workers who  earn less than a $1 an hour in Central  America. But that is what will happen  if this is passed.  Time and time again, the experts, the  administrations, including the Democratic administration, the Clinton administration, which was a total disaster on trade, as bad as Bush and  maybe worse, they come to this Congress and they say if only, if only you  will open up our borders, it will bring  great wealth to the American people,  prosperity and jobs. And what it has  brought is the loss of 3 million manufacturing jobs, a deficit of $2 billion a  day in trade, and driven down wages in  countless industries across this country where all the boss has to say is, you  will not take a pay cut? Not far to the  Mexican border. That  is where your  plant is going. And they have done that  again and again and again. So we  should not extend this disaster one  more time. And when all the apologists  stand up and talk about all the wealth  it is going to create, all the jobs and all  the exports, remember, they said exactly  the  same  thing  about  the  NAFTA. They said exactly the same  thing about China MFN and the WTO,  and they were wrong, and there is no  reason why they are not going to be  wrong again, because they know that  what they are saying is not true. It is  just the way they have got to sell the  package here to benefit a few industries to the disadvantage of the rest of  the people in this country.  It  is time  for a trade policy that  makes sense for all the people of America, not just a treasured few who own  the stock and the factories of the multinational corporations that have been  profiting from our failures.  f  ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS  ",2005

Our Nation is in the midst of a  health care crisis. This crisis affects  Pennsylvania’s  health  care  professionals, their patients and the doctor-  patient relationship. This crisis is especially acute in my district in Southeastern Pennsylvania.  Last week I held a small business  committee forum in my district. The  health care crisis and how it affects  small businesses was the topic of the  forum. The gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. MANZULLO) was kind enough to  come to the forum and to apply his  many years of experience to the issue,  and I thank the gentleman for his contribution and for his insights.  Pennsylvania’s health care problems  are among the worst in the Nation.  Doctors in Pennsylvania are faced with  some  of  the  highest medical malpractice insurance rates in the country. Because they cannot afford to pay  for malpractice insurance, many Pennsylvania physicians are practicing defensive medicine or simply shutting  their doors, moving to other states or  retiring. Young doctors establishing a  new practice are reluctant to consider  Pennsylvania because of malpractice  insurance problems.  Over 50 percent of Pennsylvanians  say their family has had difficulty in  paying the cost of health care or obtaining  health  insurance  coverage.  Since 2001, the cost of health insurance  has risen 59 percent, and employers  who offer health care benefits are paying an average of 11 percent more for  health insurance premiums than they  did in 2004. This is the fourth year in a  row of double digit increases with no  end in sight.  From a national perspective, the statistics are staggering. The Labor Department has recently reported that 3.7  million new  jobs were created since  May of 2003, marking 25 consecutive  months of positive job growth for the  U.S. economy. Unfortunately, there are  41 million Americans who are without  health care insurance. Nearly 60 percent of the 41 million uninsured Americans are employed by small businesses  or are dependent on someone who is  employed  by  a  small  business. As  health care costs continue to increase,  fewer employers and working families  will be able to obtain coverage, and the  number of uninsured will  inevitably  rise. For a Nation of the 21st Century,  and  in  a  country  that  boasts  the  world’s  largest and most productive  economy, this is simply unacceptable.  The skyrocketing cost of health care  is making employer-sponsored health  coverage harder and harder for businesses, especially small businesses, to  provide to their employees. This fact  makes it nearly impossible for many  hard working  families to receive affordable care that they need and deserve.

884,9,2005-07-25,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I will be brief, because,  in fact, the minority member, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DAVIS) who is  managing this, is the author of this  bill.  This bill, House Resolution 289, honors our Nation’s  community health  centers and their invaluable contributions to thousands of Americans, perhaps millions of Americans, in need.  Health centers provide primary and  preventative medical, dental, and pharmaceutical  services; and  their work  acts as a vital safety net in the health  care delivery system.  Mr. Speaker, I urge that we give this  resolution immediate consideration.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2005
885,9,2005-07-25,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as one who began much  of what I would call my public career  working in community health centers,  I worked at the Martin Luther King  Community  Health  Center,  and  I  worked at the Miles Square Community Health Center, I was around during the days when we decided to organize a National Association of Community Health Centers and ultimately had  the pleasure of serving as its president.  And so, Mr. Speaker, I rise today as  the proud sponsor of this resolution to  establish a national community health  center week.  I would like to thank the cochairs of  the Community Health Care Center  Caucus, the gentleman  from Florida  (Mr. BILIRAKIS), the gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr. BONILLA),  and  the  gentleman  from  Massachusetts  (Mr.  CAPUANO), for their constant voice to  better community health centers.  I would also like to thank the gentleman  from New Hampshire  (Mr.  BRADLEY) for joining the cochairs of  the caucus as a main sponsor of this  legislation.  As we continue  to discuss health  care, and as we continue hopefully to  move towards enactment of a national  health plan that covers everyone without regard to their ability to pay, we  can take greet pride in some of our accomplishments in health care. One of  the most important and effective accomplishments since the enactment of  Medicare and Medicaid has been the development of community health centers.  The community health center network is available throughout the Nation to help those  in need, such as  those who get displaced by job status  or other economic conditions. Community health centers have become the  safety net within the health care delivery system, serving more than 15 million people in over 3,600 communities.  They care for one out of every seven  uninsured individuals, one out of every  nine Medicaid beneficiaries, one out of  every seven people of color, and one  out of every nine rural Americans. In  addition they reach out to over 621,000  homeless persons and more than 709,000  migrant and seasonal farm workers.  Community health centers are established in almost every corner of our  Nation, representing every aspect of  any congressional district, whether it  is assisting the working poor in the  inner city, or in the rural farmland,  migrant workers or even those who  have insurance but do not have access  to any other health facilities.  One of the most amazing and important aspects of community health centers is the involvement of the community. Each center tailors its services to  best meet the needs and priorities of  the communities in which they reside.  Citizens in these communities become  active participants  in their communities’ health care decision-making.  Health centers even provide approximately 100,000 jobs to the residents in  communities  of  these  areas. These  health  centers  provide high-quality,  cost-effective health care as they continue to meet escalating health needs  and assist in reducing health disparities.  With  the weakened  economy  and  soaring number of uninsured Americans, our Nation’s health centers will  continue to feel the brunt of increasing  numbers of patients.  By  establishing  a week  to  raise  awareness of community health centers, we will also be highlighting each  year the great accomplishments these  nonprofit community-owned and -operated health centers offer to many communities throughout the Nation.  With recent numbers indicating that  the Nation’s uninsured population  is  even higher than once thought, possibly as high as 60 million, if our Nation will not realize the need for universal health care, we need at least to  realize the importance of funding our  community health centers.  The United States spends nearly $100  billion per year to provide uninsured  residents with health services, oftentimes  for preventable diseases  that  physicians could treat more efficiently  with early diagnosis.  Community health centers are one of  the keys to such earlier diagnosis and  crucial to lowering the overall cost of  health care on the uninsured throughout the country.  Therefore, I am pleased with the significant increase in the fiscal year 2006  budget that our community health centers will receive so that they can continue to serve their patients and expand their services.  Mr. Speaker, community health centers are indeed the safety net which is  committed to serving all  individuals  with  the mission  that everyone deserves quality health care services regardless of where they reside, whether  or not they can pay, or whether or not  they have insurance.  They are vital to ensuring that even  the poor and disadvantaged  in  this  country have the greatest opportunity  to be healthy. These centers are indeed  a hallmark of our Nation’s health care  delivery system.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that I can  stand and be a part of promoting the  awareness or their existence and the  accomplishments  which  they  have  achieved.  I urge my colleagues to stand beside  me in supporting this resolution, and I  want  to  thank  especially  the  gentleman  from  Virginia  (Chairman  DAVIS) the ranking member; the gentleman from California (Mr. WAXMAN);  and the Speaker, the gentleman from  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:00 Jul 26, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A25JY7.005 H25JYPT1 ",2005

899,30,2005-07-25,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr. Speaker,  this past weekend Members of  the  Black, Hispanic and Asian Pacific Islander caucuses met in Chicago to review the status of health in communities of color there and discuss policy  and legislative remedies.  On the weekend before that, the Congressional Black Caucus held a brain  trust, held similar meetings in Cleveland, Ohio. Both meetings,  like the  ones we have held in L.A., Miami, Newark, Charleston, and the U.S. Virgin Island were opportunities to talk to our  wider constituencies, particularly people of color in this country, about their  health care, or lack of it, their needs  and what they think we, their Members  of Congress and our colleagues, should  be doing about it.  Mr. Speaker, all of the places we visited are communities in which African  Americans in particular, but all people  of color, suffer disproportionately from  disease and disabilities and die prematurely from preventable causes in  numbers which are far in excess of our  white counterparts.  They are the health disparities that  we have repeatedly come to the floor to  talk about. Some examples are as follows: American Indian/Alaskan natives  have diabetes rates that are nearly  three times higher than the overall  rate.  The death rate from asthma is more  than three times higher among African  Americans than among whites. The infant mortality rate for African Americans and American Indian and Alaskan  Natives are more than two times higher.  Latino women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer or lung cancer were diagnosed in later stages and  had  lower survival rates than white  women with the same conditions.  Vietnamese women  have  cervical  cancer death rates that are almost five  times higher, and people of color make  up almost  three-fourths of all new  AIDS cases.  In our discussions on these and other  realities of health care in our country,  what our community said to us was affirming, but it was also frustrating, affirming because their comments, complaints and recommendations told us  that our agendas are on target, but  frustrating because we have not been  able to get this or the other body to  make these needs the high priority  they ought to be.  What is even more distressing is that  what is on the health care agenda of  this Congress would instead reduce access and increase gaps in health, and  because of this, increase the cost of  health care for everyone.  We, people of color, are already over  half of the uninsured. Medicaid cuts  will further reduce access to quality  medical services; so we will continue to  get  to  the  system  sicker,  requiring  more expensive care.  Association health plans,  like  the  misguided  health  savings  account,  work best for the healthy, which because of centuries of neglect, minority  communities are not.  Worst of all, the association health  plans remove these plans from State  laws that protect our access to an adequate level of benefits and our ability  to seek redress  if denied. The only  place fairness can be found in the bill is  in its name.  What our communities have told us  they need are adequate coverage, expanding Medicaid. Just to cover 200  percent of poverty would make a major  difference. They also want help to overcome the language barriers, and they  want language services paid for, and  not by the physicians and centers that  provide our care.  They want health care providers to  reflect the diverse Nation we have become, providers on all levels who know,  understand and speak the same  language they do. They want comprehensive care and more emphasis on prevention and health maintenance for the  diseases that disable and kill us in disproportionate, preventable numbers.  They want a more effective office of  minority health, office of civil rights,  and  Indian health service; and they  want the health  facilities that take  care of us to stay open and be better  funded. They also said they want resources and the technical assistance to  be provided to our communities and  our  indigenous organization, not  to  groups from the outside who then come  in and try to provide what only we ourselves can do effectively.  They want all of the agencies of government that impact our communities,  and thus our health, to work together.  I want to take this opportunity to  thank the hundreds of people who came  out to meet with us, our sponsors that  are too many to name, and our hosts,  Case Western Reserve and the University of Illinois at Chicago schools of  medicine.  We of the Asian Pacific, Hispanic,  Native American, and Black caucuses  have listened. And this week we stand  ready to provide the vehicle that responds to this important and large segment of the American population.  The health of all Americans and the  strength of our Nation depend on fairness in health care services and equality and health status for all of its people  no matter  their  race,  socioeconomic status, ethnicity, religion or  national background, sexual identification or geography.  Mr. Speaker, I am calling on all of  my colleagues to provide the health  leadership this country really needs to  unite and not divide us as the bills that  will be on the floor this week will do,  and to support a better America, a  stronger America, and the America our  Founders envisioned by supporting the  Health Care Equality and Accountability Legislation, or the Heal America Act, when it is introduced later this  week.  f  CONGRATULATING COLONEL  CHARLES E. POWELL  ",2005
900,30,2005-07-25,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY) is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2005
901,30,2005-07-25,Mr. CONAWAY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  tonight to recognize a friend and constituent, Colonel Charles E. Powell, retired U.S. Air Force of San Angelo,  Texas.  On June 14, 2005, Colonial Powell received the Road Hand Award from the  Texas Department of Transportation,  presented  by  Texas  Transportation  Commissioner John W. Johnson.  The Road Hand Award was created in  1973 by Luther DeBerry, a former State  highway engineer of the Texas Department of Transportation. It is designed  to honor public servants throughout  Texas who have dedicated themselves  to  improving  public  transportation  safety.  In 32 years, only 198 awards have been  given, an average of about six per year.  b2000  Previous Road Hand Award winners  include former mayor of San Antonio  and Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development  Henry  Cisneros,  and  former Congressman Jake Pickle, who  recently passed away.  Colonel Powell is the seventh recipient from the San Angelo district and  the first honoree ever to receive the  award  for their dedication to Texas  aviation safety. Honorees have their  names inscribed on the Road Hand Hall  of Fame plaque, which is displayed in  the foyer of the DeWitt C. Greer Highway Building in Austin, Texas.  Colonel Powell’s  career of  service  brings  credit  to all Americans and  pride to his hometown of San Angelo.  Colonel Powell served as commanding  officer at Goodfellow Air Force Base  from 1980 to 1984. In 2000 he was appointed to the Texas Aviation Advisory  Committee, where he helped increase  grants by 44 percent. As a member of  the San Angelo Chamber of Commerce,  Colonel Powell was a great advocate  for local transportation issues, including  to  our State  government,  and  helped  secure  funding  for  the U.S.  Highway  67 Houston Harte Freeway  through San Angelo.  Texas has over 79,000 miles of roadway, the most in the United States,  and  it takes a  lot of work to keep  Texas safe in our many transportation  systems. To a long list of honors and  awards reflecting a lifetime of public  service, Colonel Powell has added the  Texas Department of Transportation  Road Hand. Colonel Powell represents  the best of District 11 and the State of  Texas, and I am proud to be his Congressman and his friend.

902,37,2005-07-25,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  appreciate the gentleman from Colorado’s leadership. The key point, many  of them that he made, was that America’s  agricultural  community  is  so  strongly behind this trade agreement.  There are nearly 70 ag associations  around America who are  supporting  this. In fact, the American Farm Bureau Federation believes that we will  sell almost $1.5 billion more ag products each year to Central America.  That is our beef, that is our chicken,  that is our pork, our corn, our milk,  our potatoes, you name it, at a time  when a lot of the world is closed to  America’s ag products.  b2100  We have got the most productive ag  community in the world; but if we keep  making things cheaper and faster and  better but do not have anyone to sell it  to, the price just goes down. We want  those ‘‘American need not apply’’ signs  to be torn up all throughout this world,  give our ag community a chance to  compete. Watch what we will  sell  around the world.  And we ought to start with Central  America, a neighbor, a proven neighbor, who cannot only buy our goods  and services but is easy to ship to and  in the process we are going to continue  to help those six countries into stronger democracies, a stronger rule of law.  It is truly a win-win situation.  I appreciate the gentleman’s leadership. As a business person, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BEAUPREZ)  knows what small businesses and small  farmers and small communities have  to go through to compete, and giving  them a level playing field is good for  Colorado and good for America as well.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like  to yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. CARTER), who served, before coming to Congress, as a district judge for  more than 2 decades. And his background is just filled with decades of  common sense. He did a great job on  the bench  in Texas. Here  in Washington he has been intent not only on  national  security,  supporting  our  troops, but also in serving on his committee, finding ways to help our American economy grow.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. CARTER).  ",2005
903,37,2005-07-25,Mr. CARTER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY),  who clearly has been in the lead and is  outspoken for the CAFTA-Dominican  Republic project, for yielding to me.  This is critical not only to the Central America region but to the United  States of America. We are opening up  trade so that our products get sold in  Central America without duties on our  products.  The Central American countries have  the opportunity to sell in our country,  and they do not have a burden on their  products up here. And, in fact, we are  their number one trading partner. The  expansion, the benefit that we see is  what is going to happen to our folks.  Whenever  I  look at one of  these  things that are coming up in Congress,  I try to take a look at my district and  see who is in my district and try to  learn and study and figure out who is  going to get helped by these things.  And it was easy to see how the high-  tech industry with Dell Computer, one  of our great neighbors in Williamson  County,  it was easy to see what  is  going to happen there. But I look further down  to  that dairy  farmer  in  Stephenville, Texas, in Erath County.  This is not a little dairy farm operation in Erath County. We are talking  about one of the most important parts  of the agriculture industry in Texas.  The area in my district produces over  $40 million to the Texas economy every  year in milk and dairy product production. And under the CAFTA agreement,  doors are going to open to them that  VerDate Aug 04 2004  03:21 Jul 26, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K25JY7.097 H25JYPT1 ",2005
904,44,2005-07-25,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman very much for his eloquent  statement.  Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity tonight to listen to an hour that  was presided over by my colleague on  the Committee on Ways and Means on  the majority side, the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. TURNER), and his fellow Republicans and the statements of my  colleagues on the Democratic side. It  has been refreshing in this sense, that  we have talked about the issues. I very  much disagree with the statements of  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER)  and others, and I will get to that; but  at least we have been talking about  issues.  In the last few days, when it comes  to CAFTA, that is not what the administration or the Republican majority  have  been  doing.  Instead, we have  learned about a number of deals that  have been cut, one of them relating to  dams and locks in return for a vote; or  if not in return, that being taken into  account if the vote was cast.  We have heard the administration  make statements regarding fabrics, regarding apparel and textiles. They have  made commitments that they cannot  on their own keep. And if history is  any judge, they are unlikely to do so.  They have made a commitment, for example, regarding pockets and linings,  essentially reopening the agreement,  saying that they are going to secure  that change. However, the truth of the  matter is it would take action by this  Congress to do that, and not under  Fast Track; and also there would have  to be agreement by the six DR-CAFTA  countries.  Regarding a provision of concern to  Nicaragua,  the  administration  has  made some statement that Nicaragua  will more or less back off. However, it  is only  for Nicaragua to make that  statement.  And then there has been the same  process regarding sugar in order to try  to win some votes from people who object to the provisions on sugar. There  have been statements about some adjustments that will be made or some  further actions  that will be  taken.  Again, they are not in the agreement.  There is nothing that this administration can really say that it can be assured of producing.  Oh, and then I guess it was today I  read about discussions relating to agricultural shipments to Cuba and some  bargaining  back  and  forth  between  some of the Members of this Congress  and the administration regarding that.  So while I very much disagree with  the statements in almost every case  made  by  the  majority  regarding  CAFTA, in a way they were talking  about issues and they were not talking  about bait being offered for people to  cast their vote.  I want to talk about what is really,  as I see it, and my colleagues in so  many cases see it, as the overriding  issue. Why are so many of us who have  worked for expanded trade, who have  helped to shape trade agreements opposed to this agreement? There are  economic aspects, and one can argue  them various ways. I suggest that they  be kept to the economic data in perspective. One estimate is that in terms  of GDP, the impact of CAFTA on the  U.S. would be less than one-fifth of 1  percent. As to Central American countries, there is evidence on all sides of  the issue, including dislocation, that  would occur.  But, again, I want to talk about the  larger  issue,  and  that  is  where  globalization is today and where it is  going.  Because  here  at  CAFTA,  globalization  is at a crossroads, and  that is why so many of us who have  worked for expanded trade feel that we  needed to take a hard look to judge  whether this agreement was going to  shape globalization so, as was put by  President Clinton some years ago, it  would level up, not level down.  I think the basic assumption of many  proponents of CAFTA  is, well, that  does not really matter because trade is  win-win; that there is no possible loss;  that trade  inevitably works out  for  everybody’s benefit. But for those of us  who,  I  say, have worked and often  worked very hard and successfully to  shape expanded trade the right way, we  believe this does it the wrong way; that  you need to shape trade agreements so  it is not a race to the bottom.  And that is why the issues relating to  worker rights are so important. That is  what  this basic  issue  is  really all  about. This is why Central America,  Dominican Republic and CAFTA, matter so much in terms of where trade is  going. Regarding the CAFTA countries,  we are now talking about countries in  a region that has, Latin America, the  worst income distribution of any region in the world. We are talking about  within most of the countries immense  maldistribution  of  income. We  are  talking about immense poverty. There  is a weak middle class in most of the  countries.  It was  interesting to read a Wall  Street Journal article just a week ago.  The headline was: ‘‘In Latin America,  Rich-Poor Chasm Stifles Growth,’’ and  I quote: ‘‘Because of an abundance of  natural resources and a large indigenous population, Latin American nations group up relying on raw materials, cheap manual  labor to exploit  them, and  low government taxation.  The system concentrated land ownership and wealth in a few hands, deprived governments of money to spend  on education and other incentives, and  essentially ordered the incentives for  the elite to invest not in human capital  or technology. Latin America has also  historically relied on monopolies and  franchises,  leaving  few opportunities  for entrepreneurs to advance through  hard work and innovation.’’  If you look at the history of trade  agreements, there has been an effort to  begin to have them relate to workers,  to take  into account the capital of  workers as well as financial capital.  And so in recent years, we had agreements, Jordan, Cambodia, which essentially  said  to countries:  look,  take  steps to make sure that workers have  their basic rights.  We are not talking about the laws of  the United States; we  are  talking  about the five core internationally recognized rights: no child labor, also no  forced labor, no discrimination in the  workplace, and also, so  importantly,  the rights of workers to associate and  to organize.  And what has happened is that this  agreement is a step backwards from  where we were going, a step backwards  from Jordan, a step backwards from  the Cambodia experiment, and also a  step backwards from CBI and the second CBI, and what is called the ‘‘generalized  system of preferences.’’ What  this agreement says to a country when  it comes to these basic rights of workers is, enforce your own laws, no matter what they are, no matter how bad  they are. That is the standard: enforce  your own laws.  That standard  is not used  in any  other part of the agreement, whether it  is  intellectual properties or  investments or tariffs or subsidies. Here it is:  enforce your own laws.  b2215  There has been an effort to obscure  what the reality is on the ground in  Central America, but State Department reports make it clear, the ILO reports make it also very clear.

Observances and  celebrations are being held and will be  held all across the country. In fact, I  attended three in Iowa over the weekend. There will be a big celebration tonight at the Kennedy Center where I  look  forward  to  introducing  former  President George Bush, the signer of  the Americans with Disabilities Act,  who will give the keynote address.  On this 15th anniversary, we celebrate one of the great landmark civil  rights laws of the 20th century, a long  overdue emancipation proclamation for  people with disabilities. We also celebrate the men and women  from all  across America whose daily acts of heroism and protest and persistence and  courage moved this law forward to passage 15 years ago.  In 1964, this country passed a civil  rights bill. After much struggle, after  the freedom riders and the marches in  places such as Selma, AL, that are  burned in our memories, we passed the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 which closed a  long, disgraceful chapter of segregation  and discrimination, lack of equality of  opportunity for Americans just based  on race, mostly, sex, creed, and national origin.

ADDITIONAL AMOUNT FOR COOPERATIVE  THREAT  REDUCTION  PROGRAMS.

(2) The amount available for initial construction of associated silos is hereby reduced by $20,000,000.  ",2005
916,58,2005-07-25,Mr.  REED.," Mr.  President,  this  amendment was offered by Senator  LEVINand myself would do several very  critical and  important things. First,  the amendment would increase funding  for the Cooperative Threat Reduction  Program by  $50 million. The offset  would be twofold: $30 million would be  taken from the long lead procurement  of ground-based interceptors as part of  the National Missile Defense Program  and another $20 million would be taken  from the funding for initial construction for silos to house these interceptors.  Essentially what Senator LEVIN is  doing with this provision is to recognize the fact that a more immediate  threat to the United States rests with  literally thousands of locations where  nuclear material might be housed from  the breakup of the old Soviet Union,  and other locations that need attention  with respect to the reduction of these  materials. I believe the greatest threat  we  face  in this country  is the  fact  that—hopefully not, but the situation  where a terrorist might gain control of  these materials, bring them into this  country and use them with devastating  effect.  So this amendment recognizes the  most  immediate  threat  comes  from  these materials and therefore is putting additional resources from the National Missile Defense Program, modest changes, to approach this major effort with respect to cooperative threat  reduction.  The  funds would  come  from  our  ground-based midcourse defense  system. The interceptors and silos where  the offsets occur are now currently  being deployed at Fort Greely, AK, and  Vandenberg Air Force Base  in California.  Because  of  recent  developments, we have an opportunity to address the critical issue of loose nukes  by transferring these  funds. I would  argue this is a most worthy cause. The  offset will not affect the missile defense system at all. In fact, as we understand it, in the last several months  the missile defense system has been reevaluating itself, looking at whether  the technical issues are challenging, in  fact, and have not conducted tests as  they thought they could over the last  several months. So I think now is the  opportune time to put more resources  in cooperative threat reduction.  We are all aware, as I have mentioned before, that the greatest threat  to us today is the possibility that terrorists will acquire nuclear weapons or  nuclear material and use it with devastating effect against us. Of course,  one country with enormous amounts of  this nuclear material is Russia.  It is estimated that Russia has approximately  16,000  nuclear weapons  stored at between 150 and 210 sites.  While that is a significant reduction  from the 40,000 weapons at the end of  the Cold War, it is still a huge number  of weapons and also a large number of  storage sites.  Indeed,  there  is  some  imprecision  about where all the sites might be. Of  course, we have also heard reports of  potential sites for, if not nuclear material,  other  dangerous material  in  former  components  of  the  Soviet  Union, the newly independent states.  So this is a challenging issue we have  to face.  Only about 25 percent of the total  number of weapons sites have received  any upgrades in the past five years.  Many of them still lack adequate security  and  safeguards.  At  the  rate  planned for in the fiscal year 2006 budget request, it would be around 2011 or  2012 before the work at only a portion  of the sites would be completed to  bring them up to levels of security and  safety that we would feel confident this  nuclear material would not be stolen,  misplaced or somehow find itself in the  world community.  The Defense Department only  expected work to be scheduled on one or  two sites in fiscal year 2006 so they  budgeted approximately $60 million in  the process. But  then  in February,  when President Bush and President  Putin met at the summit in Bratislava,  Slovakia, the two agreed on a way to  address security upgrades at 15 key nuclear weapons sites. With this agreement, we have the opportunity to accomplish in 2 years what we thought  would take 10.  The issue, of course, is funding. The  total cost of these upgrades is approximately $350 million. With this amendment, we are adding $50 million to this  project, which is not the total needed  but will allow for a good start. Again,  this is a huge breakthrough that occurred  after  the President’s  budget  submission. It is a major opportunity  we simply must take advantage of.  As I have indicated before, the proposal of Senator LEVIN is to move this  $50 million into cooperative threat reduction from the National Missile Defense Program. I think it is useful to  look at this program to indicate where  these transfers are possible, available,  and even desirable.  When President Bush first took office  in 2001, he made missile defense one of  his highest priorities.  In May  2000,  President Bush  said America must  build effective missile defense based on  the best available options at the earliest  possible  date. Missile  defense  must be designed  to protect all  50  States, our friends, allies, and deployed  forces overseas from missile attacks by  rogue nations or accidental launches.  President Bush’s first major action was  to significantly  increase  funding  for  missile defense.  Since fiscal year 2002, approximately  $45 billion, including fiscal year 2006 requests, has been provided for missile  defense. That is $45 billion and here we  are talking about a transfer of $50 million  from  that huge program. This  amount is half of what has been spent  on missile  defense  since President  Reagan launched the Strategic Defense  Initiative in 1984. We have seen a huge  acceleration of funding with respect to  missile  defense. Another  aspect  of  President Bush’s plan for missile defense was that the systems would be  developed and acquired under an approach called spiral development. As  the Congressional Research Service  succinctly summarizes: A major consequence of the administration’s proposed evolutionary acquisition strategy is that the Missile Defense Program would not feature the familiar  phases and milestones of  the  traditional DOD acquisition  system. Another consequence is the Missile Defense Agency cannot provide Congress  with a description of its final missile  defense architecture, the capabilities  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:26 Jul 26, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G25JY6.011 S25JYPT1 ",2005

Sometimes we get bogged down in all  the detail and we  forget about the  overall picture, the big picture.

The  small  infractions  found were  found by our own government, corrected and now reported. In all the  cases no further incidents occurred. We  have nothing to be ashamed of. What  other country attacked as we were  would exercise the same degree of self-  criticism and restraint. Again, keep in  mind, 24,000 interrogations, and they  only found three. And they were found  by us, not  somebody  else  snooping  around.  Most, if not all, of these incidents are  at least a year old. I am very impressed  with the way the military, the FBI,  and other agencies conducted themselves. The report shows me that an incredible amount of restraint and discipline was present at Gitmo.  Having heard a lot about the Field  Manual 3452, I asked,  ‘‘Are the DOD  guidelines, as currently published  in  that manual, appropriate to allow interrogators to get valuable  information,  intelligence  information, while  not crossing the line from interrogation to abuse?’’ The answer from Gen.  Bantz J. Craddock, Commander of U.S.  Southern Command was, ‘‘I think, because  that manual was written  for  enemy prisoners of war, we have a  translation problem,  in  that enemy  prisoners are to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions—  that doesn’t apply. That’s why the recommendation was made and I affirmed  it. We need a further look here on this  new phenomenon of enemy combatants. It’s different, and we’re trying to  use, I think, a manual that was written  for one  reason  in another  environment.’’  Lt. Gen. Randall M. Schmidt, the  senior investigating officer said, ‘‘Sir, I  agree. It’s critical that we come to  grips with not hanging on a Cold War  relic of Field Manual 3452, which addressed  an  entirely  different  population. If we are, in fact, going to get  intelligence to stay ahead of this type  of threat, we need to understand what  else we can do and still stay in our lane  of humane treatment.’’  Brig. Gen. John T. Furlow, the investigating officer, stated, ‘‘Sir, in echoing that, F.M. 3452 was originally written in 1987, further updated and refined  in 1992, which is dealing with the Geneva question as well as an ordered battle  enemy, not the enemy that we’re facing currently.  I’m aware  that Fort  Huachuca’s currently in a rewrite of  the next 3452, and it’s in a draft form  right now.’’  It is clear that our military has humane treatment placed at the forefront  of their concerns.  At the same time I want to ask: What  other country would freely discuss interrogation  techniques used  against  high-value intelligence detainees during a time of war when suicide bombers  are killing our fellow citizens?  That was disturbing to me. The last  of the many hearings we had was one  where they were describing in detail  our interrogation techniques, knowing  full well that the terrorists are watching on live TV and training their people on how to handle those. I think it  is something on which we have gone far  enough. That is another subject we will  be discussing in a few minutes.  In  the past  15 years,  the United  States has provided more than $1.5 billion in funding to the ICRC. I ask for  some accountability for the use of this  money and a modicum of oversight.  For example, I think it is fair to ask:  How is our money being spent? What  are the activities of the ICRC to determine the status of American POWs/  MIAs, unaccounted for since World War  II? What were the efforts of the ICRC  to assist America’s POWs held in captivity during the Korean war, the Vietnam war, and other subsequent conflicts? Has the ICRC exceeded its mandate, violated established practices or  principles,  or  engaged  in  advocacy  work that exceeds the ICRC’s mandate  as provided under the Geneva Convention? That essentially  is what  this  amendment does.  At this point I will read the very last  paragraph of the Wall Street Journal  article. It says:  We are trying to understand how a representative of an organization pledged to  neutrality and the honest investigation of  detainee practices could compare American  soldiers to Nazi SS. And considering the timing and content of several ICRC confidentiality breaches concerning the U.S. war on  terror, it’s fair to ask if similar views aren’t  held by a substantial number in the organization.  The world needs a truly neutral humanitarian body of the sort the ICRC is supposed  to be. But the Camp Bucca incident—in addition to leaked Gitmo and Abu Ghraib reports—is evidence it isn’t currently up to the  task.  EXHIBIT1  [From the Wall Street Journal, May 23, 2005]  ASBADASTHENAZIS?  The International Committee of the Red  Cross is granted a privileged status to inspect the conditions of prisoners of war and  other detainees in return for confidentiality.  But in recent years it has demonstrated a  habit of selective media leaks damaging to  American purposes. This is the backdrop for  two recent incidents that make us think the  U.S. should reconsider the ICRC’s role.  The first concerns a story we heard first  from a U.S. source that an ICRC representative visiting America’s largest detention facility in Iraq last month had compared the  U.S. to Nazi Germany. According to a Defense Department source citing internal Pentagon documents, the ICRC team leader told  U.S. authorities at Camp Bucca: ‘‘You people  are no better than and no different than the  Nazi concentration camp guards.’’ She was  upset about not being granted immediate access shortly after a prison riot, when U.S.  commanders may have been thinking of her  own safety, among other considerations.  A  second,  senior Defense Department  source we asked about the episode confirmed  that the quote above  is accurate. And a  third, very well-placed American source we  contacted separately told us that some kind  of reference was made by the Red Cross representative  ‘‘to either Nazis or the Third  Reich’’—which understandably offended the  American soldiers present.  The world needs a truly neutral humanitarian body of the sort the ICRC is supposed  to be. But the Camp Bucca incident—in addition to the leaked Gitmo and Abu Ghraib reports—is evidence it isn’t currently up to the  task.  ",2005

919,72,2005-07-25,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, No. 1506  deals with the mineral rights at Rocky  Flats. This basically will provide for  the Secretary to purchase these mineral rights. There is money that has  been provided for this in previous legislation and that is pending. This allows  for the transfer of those mineral rights  on Rocky Flats. It  is based on the  owner of the mineral rights being willing to sell.  In 2001, I successfully inserted a provision in the National Defense authorization bill that authorized the creation of  the Rocky Flats National  Wildlife Refuge. Under this legislation,  the Department of Energy was required  to transfer most of the Rocky Flats  Environmental Technology Site to the  Department of  Interior  for the purposes of creating a wildlife refuge to  preserve Colorado’s rare Front Range  habitat.  Earlier, 2 months ago, the Departments of Energy and Interior signed a  memorandum  of understanding  that  stipulated how and when the Department of Energy would  transfer  the  management of most of  the Rocky  Flats Environmental Technology Site  to the Department of Interior. However,  this memorandum  of  understanding was incomplete. It completely  deferred the issue of the disruptive surface mining of privately owned mineral  rights that  is occurring on the site  until later this year. This deferral did  not meet the legislation requirement  under the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act and represented a critical  impediment  to  the  closure  of  Rocky Flats.  The Department  of  Interior  contended that surface mining such as  that now occurring at Rocky Flats is  fundamentally contrary to its refuge  management  goals,  and makes  the  achievement  of  refuge  purposes  on  those lands impossible.  To better understand this issue, I requested that the Department of Energy  hire an independent contractor to conduct an appraisal on the value of the  mineral rights. The independent contractor determined the owners and provided a preliminary cost estimate as to  the fair market value of those mineral  rights containing sand and gravel.  After the appraisal was completed,  my  staff personally  contacted  each  mineral rights owner. I wanted to see if  they would be interested in selling if  they were offered money for the fair  market value of the mineral rights. I  also reassured them that the owners  would not be  forced to sell  if they  didn’t want to.  Shortly thereafter, it was brought to  my attention that the purchase of mineral rights could be included as part of  a comprehensive natural resource damage settlement. I am pleased to announce that the State of Colorado, my  colleague  from  Colorado,  Senator  SALAZAR, and I have worked out legislation providing for such an arrangement. I am confidant that this arrangement will be acceptable to the Department of Energy and the Department of  Interior.  Under the amendment I am  introducing today, the Secretary of Energy  will be required to purchase essential  mineral rights necessary to transition  Rocky Flats to a national wildlife refuge.  The Secretary  can  only  purchase  these mineral rights once the following  conditions are met: (1) The owner of  the minieral right is a willing seller;  (2) the Secretary purchases the mineral  right at fair market value; and (3) the  Trustees for Rocky Flats release the  Department from its natural resource  damage  liabilities  under  the  Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation, and Liability Act of  1980, CERCLA.  Also included in this legislation is a  provision that states that if the owner  of the mineral right refuses to sell, the  Secretary of Energy may satisfy the  Department’s natural resource liability  obligation by paying the trustees of  the site an amount equal to the fair  market value of  the mineral  right  owned by the unwilling seller.  I believe this amendment makes too  much sense for us to pass up. We have  winners, winners, and winners. It  is  certainly a win for the State of Colorado—the State mechanism that would  provide more dollars for Colorado than  most  likely would have been gained  through the normal natural resources  damages settlement process. The owners of the mineral rights win because  they now have an opportunity to sell  their mineral rights at  fair market  value, a possibility that never existed  before. The Department of Energy wins  because it is able to pay off its natural  resource damage liabilities that would  have arisen under the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. The Department of Interior wins because this  legislation would remove the last impediment to the memorandum of understanding between Interior and the  Department of Energy so that Interior  can move forward with creating a wildlife refuge at Rocky Flats. Most importantly, the people of Colorado win because now they will be able to enjoy  the pristine beauty and splendor of the  Rocky  Mountain’s  Front  Range  through  the Rocky Flats National  Wildlife Refuge. Hundreds of acres of  rare xeric tallgrass prairie will be preserved. The natural wildlife in the refuge will be protected.  As I said, this is a win-win proposal.  Everyone gains. I urge my colleagues  to support my amendment.  AMENDMENTNO. 1492  I rise in opposition to the Levin missile defense amendment. This amendment eliminates $30 million—there has  been $50 million requested—for  long-  lead  funding  for ground-based  interceptor missiles 31–40 and $20 million for  associated silo construction. The $50  million would be used to plus-up the  Cooperative Threat Reduction Program  which is already fully funded at $415.5  million, with an additional $1.6 billion  for DOE nonproliferation programs.

931,100,2005-07-25,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President,  this  amendment is not new to this Senate.  We have considered  it several times  and passed it. It has not survived conference committees, but I hope this  time it will be successful, we will be  successful in our effort in passing it. It  is the reservist pay amendment.  Here is what is going on in America:  All across America members of Guard  units and Reserve units are being activated, called into service for our country,  risking  their  lives,  spending  lengthy periods of  time away  from  their  families. We understand  these  new assignments create a lot of personal hardship and sacrifice on the part  of these soldiers and marines, sailors,  airmen, members of the Coast Guard,  and others. We also understand it creates much financial hardship on some  as well.  So we, as a nation, encourage the employers of Guard and Reserve members  to try to stand by the men and women  who are  serving our  country,  even  when  they have been  activated.  It  turns out that well over 1,000 employers across America have said: We will  do just that. They continue to make up  the difference in pay for these activated members of the Guard and Reserve. We salute them. We thank them.  They are bringing financial peace of  mind to men and women who are serving our country every day, separated  from their homes and their families.  Now, the concern I have is the fact  that one of the largest employers in  America is not doing the same thing,  and that is the Federal Government.  The Federal Government is not making  up the difference in pay for those members of the Guard and Reserve who are  activated. Some of them face quite a  setback when they are activated and  receive less money and a lot of financial hardship.  Last year, when we debated  this  amendment, the Government Accountability Office told us that about 40 percent of Guardsmen and Reservists lose  some amount of  income when mobilized. Well, I want to report to the Senate that figure has now been updated.  The new figure is 51 percent. More than  half of the men and women activated in  the Guard and Reserve lose income because of that activation, causing financial hardship and economic difficulties  for some. Over 11 percent of those activated lose more than $2,500.  We also find that income loss is one  of the top reasons given by Guardsmen  and Reservists as to why they stop  serving  in Reserve  components. We  need to actively recruit and retain the  very best to serve in America’s military. And when you ask those currently serving why they are not reupping, why they are not reenlisting,  many of them give as a major reason—  one of the top reasons—the loss of income when they are activated to serve  from Reserve units.  We want to make certain that we salute the employers across America who  are dealing with these troops and helping them. But I think we have an obligation, those of us who work here in  Washington, to make sure our Government does the same.  Roughly 1 out of every 10 Guardsmen  and Reservists in service to our country is also a Federal employee. How  can we on the one hand say to private  employers,  and  even State  governments, ‘‘We salute you for your foresight and compassion in helping our  troops’’ and not do the same? I think  we ought to be standing by those Federal employees who are activated in  the service to our country as well. We  should not be lagging behind those who  have made real contributions and have  shown this  leadership. We should be  setting an example.  This measure does not bust the budget. It results in some expenditures, but  the money to make up any lost income  by mobilized Federal workers is drawn  from funds already previously appropriated. Secondly, it is not additional  pay  for military  service. Reservists  continue to receive the same military  pay for the same military job. Any differential pay they receive is separate  and apart,  simply  intended  to keep  such employees financially whole while  serving our country.  I do not believe our service men and  women sit down and ask those serving  with them, ‘‘Do you have a supplement  in pay coming in here?’’ and resent it if  some do and some do not. Why, then,  would we put Federal employees in this  unfortunate situation? The wisdom of  this amendment is it is readily understandable by the entire force, whether  VerDate Aug 04 2004  03:31 Jul 26, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A25JY6.044 S25JYPT1 ",2005
932,107,2005-07-25,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  recognize and honor ADM  Vern Clark, U.S. Navy, our 27th Chief  of Naval Operations, who  last week  turned over the helm of the U.S. Navy  to his successor. As former Secretary  of  the Navy and a member of  the  Armed  Services  Committee  for  27  years, I have worked closely with every  Chief of Naval Operations since Admiral Clark was Ensign Clark.  A  child of  the Midwest, Admiral  Clark is a graduate of Evangel College  and holds a master’s degree in business  administration from the University of  Arkansas. It is this Nation’s great fortune that Admiral Clark heard the call  of the sea and attended Officer’s Candidate School, receiving his commission in August 1968.  His first sea duty tour was aboard  USS John W. Weeks, DD 701. One of the  first things Admiral Clark did upon assuming his present post was to obtain  the picture that formally hung in the  wardroom of USS John W. Weeks to remind him of where he came from and  to keep his focus on the fleet.  Admiral Clark has had the good fortune to spend more than half of his career in command. The Navy recognized  early on his potential for leadership  when as a lieutenant he commanded  USS Grand Rapids, PG98. He would go  on command USS McCloy, FF 1038, USS  Spruance, DD 963, the Fleet Anti-Submarine Training Center Atlantic, Destroyer Squadron One Seven, Destroyer  Squadron  Five,  Cruiser  Destroyer  Group Three, Second Fleet, and the  U.S. Atlantic Fleet.  On those rare occasions when Admiral Clark was not  in command, he  served in a series of increasingly challenging  shore assignments. He completed assignments as the Special Assistant to the Director of the Systems  Analysis Division in the Office of the  Chief of Naval Operations, the Administrative Assistant to the Deputy Chief  of Naval Operations, Surface Warfare,  and as the Administrative Aide to the  Vice Chief of Naval Operations. He  served as head of the Cruiser-Destroyer  Combat Systems Requirements Section  and Force Anti-Submarine Warfare Officer for the Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, and he  directed the Joint Staff’s Crisis Action  Team  for Desert Shield and Desert  Storm.  Admiral Clark first hoisted his flag  aboard the U.S. Transportation Command where he was Director of both  Plans and Policy, J5 and Financial  Management and Analysis, J8. While  commanding the Carl Vinson Battle  Group, he deployed to the Arabian Gulf  and later served as the Deputy Commander, Joint Task Force Southwest  Asia. Admiral Clark has also served as  the Deputy and Chief of Staff, United  States Atlantic Fleet; the Director of  Operations, J3 and subsequently Director of the Joint Staff.  Admiral Clark assumed his duties in  peacetime on July 21, 2000. Sitting in  his office on September 11, 2001, war  came to Admiral Clark’s Navy when  American Airlines  flight  77 hit  the  Pentagon just a few yards from where  he was sitting. Since that day he has  skillfully led the Navy in the global  war against terrorism. Throughout this  time, he has continued to focus on his  top five priorities manpower, current  readiness, future readiness, quality of  service and alignment. Chief among  those priorities is manpower. Admiral  Clark is fond of saying that the Navy is  winning the war for people. That is due  in no small part to his leadership during this difficult time.  Standing beside this officer throughout his superb career has been his wife  Connie, a woman to whom he owes  much. She has been his key supporter,  devoting her life to her husband, to her  family, and to the men and women of  the Navy family. She has traveled by  his side for these many years visiting  the  fleet. Her sacrifice and devotion  have served as an example and inspiration for others. This team has served  our Navy well and we will miss them  both.  With these words before the Senate, I  seek to recognize Admiral Clark for his  unswerving  loyalty to the Navy and  this great Nation. We thank him and  wish Vern, his wife Connie, and his  sons Jeffery and Christopher fair winds  and  following seas as they continue  forward in what will most assuredly remain lives of service to our country.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  CONGRATULATING KANSAN  ANDREW WOJTANIK  ∑",2005

Andrew Wojtanik,  of Overland Park, KS, won gold for the  2004 National Geographic Bee, and has  also published a book, called Afghanistan to Zimbabwe: Country Facts that  Helped Me Win  the National Geographic Bee.  Then 14-year old-Andrew was among  three young Americans  to  compete  against over 5 million students from all  over the world. In preparation for the 5  day world championship, Andrew compiled a 432-page study guide with information on 193 countries around the  world. After Andrew’s guide was published by National Geographic Society,  he was congratulated by the United  States Congress on the  floor of the  House of Representatives. The House  passed House Resolution 815 in honor of  Andrew as the champion of the National Geographic World Championship.  Andrew Wojtanik’s  recognition  for  the Geographic Bee is well deserved.  His commitment to understanding the  world helped America defend its championship title in the 2004 National Geographic Bee.  Today, I join the United States Congress in recognizing and paying tribute  to this extraordinary young American.  Andrew Wojtanik is a true champion,  and I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing this young man for his outstanding achievement in the 2004 National Geographic World Championship.∑  f  125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  TURNER COUNTY FAIR  ∑",2005
934,107,2005-07-25,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, today  I wish to honor and publicly recognize  the 125th anniversary of the Turner  County Fair. From August 14 through  August 18, 2005, the citizens of Turner  County will gather in Parker, SD, to  celebrate their proud past as well as  their hope for a promising future.  The Turner County Fair is South Dakota’s oldest fair, first organized by  the Turner County Agricultural Society and held on October 13 and 14 of  1880.  Since then, the fair has grown into a  major event. This year, more  than  65,000 people are expected to visit during  the  4  days  of  festivities,  and  fairgoers will be treated to a rich variety of entertainment. Scheduled activities include a parade, races, concerts, a  carnival, a livestock show, and a rodeo.  The fair will end with a fireworks display  that  the  local newspaper,  the  Southeast Trumpet, has advertised as  ‘‘bigger and better than ever.’’  I would especially like to recognize  the Turner County 4–H Club for their  part in this event. Turner County 4–H  has played a leading role in the fair for  the last 103 years and will figure prominently again this year. The local Jaycees Club, fire department, and a number of other community organizations  also deserve recognition for their participation in organizing and producing  this event.  For  125 years,  the Turner County  Fair has brought citizens together to  celebrate their heritage, their communities, and their shared hopes.

937,184,2005-07-25,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor and  remembrance of Tess Manalo-  Ventresca, devoted wife, mother, dedicated  community activist, environmentalist, child advocate and  friend and mentor  to countless  people.  Mrs. Manalo-Ventresca was born and raised  in  the Philippines, and  immigrated  to San  Francisco with the hope of a better life for herself and her three children. A single mother,  Ms. Manalo-Ventresca worked  full-time at a  union trustfund, yet still found time to become  deeply  involved  in  the  issues of her urban  neighborhood,  particularly,  quality  of  life  issues, environmental issues and concerns regarding the youth of the community.  Mrs. Manalo-Ventresca ’s  tireless advocacy  on behalf of the people of her community was  framed by heart, personal strength and conviction. In 2000, she joined Experience Corps, a  national organization that links volunteers with  public schools. Her focus on uplifting the lives  of the children of her neighborhood was unwavering, and she spent countless hours volunteering her time at Francis Scott Key Elementary School in the Outer Sunset neighborhood, even long after her own children were  grown. She became a permanent source of  hope and energy at the school, serving as a  member of the PTA, and leading the effort to  organize  environmental  projects  and  programs. Her efforts to protect and improve her  neighborhood are numerous and significant.  She organized her neighbors to rally against  the  intrusion of adult businesses  into her  neighborhood, and led a triumphant effort to  stop an international coffee shop chain from  establishing a store  in her community, preventing a detrimental impact to independently  owned businesses nearby.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me  in honor and remembrance of Tess Manalo-  Ventresca, an exceptional human being whose  integrity, kindness and concern for others has  instilled light, hope and justice throughout San  Francisco. I offer my deepest condolences to  her husband, Joel; her children, Mark, Michael  and Aurelia; her eight grandchildren; and her  extended family and many friends. Her journey  through  life has made our world a better  place, and her legacy will live on, carried aloft  by  every  tree  she  planted  and  everyone  whose lives were changed forever by knowing  her.  f  IN HONOR OF WADE BOGGS  HON. JIM DAVIS  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2005  ",2005
938,184,2005-07-25,Mr. DAVIS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  honor of Wade Boggs, who will be inducted  into Baseball’s Hall of Fame  this weekend.  Wade represents the latest addition to Tampa  Bay’s proud history of achievement in sports,  particularly baseball.  Wade’s success has come full-circle, from  his beginnings  in Tampa area Little League  games, to the start of his pre-professional career at Plant High School, and finally the conclusion of his career with the Tampa Bay Devil  Rays.  Wade has been a strong community leader  for the Tampa Bay area. Currently he assists  the coaching staff of Wharton High School’s  baseball team, where his son Brett looks to  follow in his dad ’s footsteps.  Even a partial listing of Wade’s career successes would be too lengthy, but one of Tampa’s  proudest moments  is  certainly when  Wade got his 3,000th hit at home in a Devil  Rays uniform. The Devil Rays will never forget  Wade, as he hit the first home run in Tampa  Bay’s history.  Two of baseball’s greatest rivals also share  Tampa’s pride in Wade’s achievements. The  Boston Red Sox gave Boggs his first chance  at a career in baseball when they drafted him  right out of high school. As a player  in  the  team’s minor  league  ranks, Boggs bounded  from New York, to North Carolina, and New  England. In 1992, Wade signed with the New  York Yankees, whose spring training facilities  in Tampa once more brought him home.  In 1998, as an expansion team, the Tampa  Bay Devil Rays signed Wade to be a part of  their  inaugural season. There, Wade carried  on his well-known idiosyncrasies such as eating chicken before every game and hitting exactly 150 ground balls during batting practice.  Wade Boggs personifies the values of baseball, both on and off the field, and serves as  an inspiration to many. The Tampa Bay area  is privileged to count Wade among its sons,  and congratulate him on his latest success.  f  A PROCLAMATION IN MEMORY OF  REUBEN RAY MILLER  HON. ROBERT W.

Therefore, while  I understand how words  cannot express our grief at this most trying of  times, I offer this token of profound sympathy  to the family and friends of Reuben Ray Miller.  f  STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR  TONY HALL  HON. FRANK R. WOLF  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2005  ",2005
940,184,2005-07-25,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  share with my colleagues the attached statement by our former colleague Tony Hall, who  now serves as U.S. ambassador to the World  Food Programme. Ambassador Hall  is concerned about the future of world food aid in  light of current negotiations at the World Trade  Organization.  In  the past year,  the world has been  broadsided  by  tragedy. Mother  Nature  wreaked havoc in Indonesia, destroying lives  and impairing the ability of tens of thousands of survivors to  feed themselves. In  Darfur, the constant need for food aid will  not subside until people can safely return to  their homes and begin to plant seeds. Ethiopia has once again found itself on the brink  of famine. There, the causes are complex, but  the need is simple. Food aid is helping Ethiopians stay alive.  I want to discuss another looming tragedy.  But we can prevent this one. I’m talking  about negotiations happening right now in  Geneva at the World Trade Organization.  Some European members of the WTO are  working to eliminate most in-kind food donations to humanitarian situations. There is  a belief among some countries that the best  way to insure minimal impact is to move to  a cash only system for donations.  The U.S. is adamantly opposed to any proposal that would RESTRICT and therefore  REDUCE the amount of donations to the  world’s hungry. There are 850 million people  who don’t have enough food to eat. And yet  we are reaching only about 100 million of  them with assistance. We need to be increasing our volumes of food aid worldwide but  some of the wealthy WTO member states are  pushing positions that will inevitably cut  food aid back.  Eliminating in-kind assistance results in  smaller amounts of food aid to the hungry of  the world. For example, WFP’S own research  found  ‘‘a clear decline in European Union  food aid after the EC and other European  member nations moved  from  in-kind  to  cash.’’  It is inconceivable to me that a group of  our colleagues meeting in Geneva would put  already fragile lives at risk. Why is this conversation even happening, considering the  humanitarian  emergencies  in  the world  today?  The U.S. has given $1.6 billion in 2005—  that’s half of total food aid—and emergency  needs are still not being met.  The WTO should not be even be discussing  food aid reform. FAO and WFP are the experts. The discussions of improving food aid  ",2005
941,191,2005-07-25,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor and recognition of Richard Cordray, an  outstanding public servant who has recently  been named the 2005 County Leader of the  Year.  In his many years of service he has  proven his dedication to the betterment of the  constituents he serves, and as Treasurer of  Franklin County, Ohio, he has redefined his  post to accommodate the particular needs of  the county and the people who belong to it.  A man full of ideas and enthusiasm, Richard  is always ready to think outside the box to find  a solution  that works  for everyone, and he  never loses touch with the higher goal of improving  the quality of  life  for all whom he  serves.  Richard’s ingenuity, combined with a sincere  and determined desire  to help people, has  driven him  to create numerous programs  to  help the citizens of Franklin County learn to  help themselves. From providing public services to seniors in danger of losing their homes  to foreclosures and back taxes to establishing  educational programs to help high school students become  financially  responsible at a  young age, Richard finds inventive solutions to  many chronic problems faced by the community of Franklin County. With his ability to look  beyond what is, to see what could be, Richard  is a shining example of the kind of public servants who are really making incredible and lasting changes in their communities.  Richard frequently goes above and beyond  the call of duty with programs that seek to improve  financial  literacy, but even within his  conventional job description he shines. In the  last year alone, he has collected over $77 million in unpaid back real estate and personal  property taxes. Due to his interest in all aspects of county operations, he is able to help  on both  the micro and macro  level and  the  positive effects of his programs and policies  are truly improving the lives of the entire community.  Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me  in honor and recognition of Richard Cordray  for his years of outstanding service  to his  community. His ability to seek out the greatest  needs of his community and fill those needs is  to be commended and admired. Through his  energy and dedication he has had a tangible  affect on the lives of many in Franklin County  and deserves our sincere appreciation.  f  RESOLUTION HONORING THE  CAREER OF LANCE ARMSTRONG  HON.

942,191,2005-07-25,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  am introducing a resolution honoring and congratulating Lance Armstrong upon hls retirement  from professional cycling  following his  7th successive victory of the Tour de France.  One of  the world ’s most grueling athletic  events,  this year ’s Tour de France bicycling  race covered 2,254 miles in 21 days.  Aside  from his many victories as a racer,  Lance Armstrong has become a household  name, vital to the promotion of cycling as a  sport, a healthy fitness activity, and a pollution-free transportation alternative. These athletic accomplishments are even more dramatic  considering his successful battle against widespread cancer. Lance has become a  role  model  to  cancer  patients  and  his  efforts  through the Lance Armstrong Foundation have  helped to advance cancer research, diagnosis,  treatment, and after-treatment services.  The resolution being introduced today is a  deserving tribute to Lance Armstrong and his  Tour de France victory, commitment to cancer  awareness and survivorship, and promotion of  bicycling.  f  IN MEMORY OF COLONEL BENNIE  HOWARD MANN  HON. CHRISTOPHER COX  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2005  ",2005
943,191,2005-07-25,Mr. COX.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to a distinguished constituent of mine,  Colonel Bennie Mann of Laguna Woods, California. Bennie Mann’s recent passing follows  an inspiring, 31-year career as one of the finest  helicopter  pilots  in  the United States  Armed Forces.  Bennie was born in Yuma, Arizona, on May  31, 1928, to Mr. and Mrs. Bennie H. Mann, Sr.  After Colonel Mann graduated  from Yuma  Union High School in 1946, he attended Arizona State University at Tempe. He joined the  Navy in 1950, traveling to Korea aboard the  U.S.S. Essex. He was selected for the Aviation Cadet Program  the  following year, and  was commissioned a second lieutenant in the  U.S. Marine Corps in 1953.  Following a second  tour of duty  in Korea  and an assignment to instructor duty with the  training command at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, Bennie was  transferred  to  the  Marine Corps Air Station  in Cherry Point,  North Carolina. In 1960, he was ordered to the  Second Marine Division, Camp Lejuene, North  Carolina, for duty with the Force Communications Company.  Bennie, then a captain, received a military  science degree from the University of Omaha.  After attending the Junior Officers’ Course at  Quantico, Virginia, in 1962, Mann became a  helicopter pilot based in Santa Ana, California.  In December 1964, then-Major Mann departed  for Vietnam, serving as operations officer and  executive officer of Marine Medium Helicopter  Squadron 163 before moving to Washington,  DC, to serve in the policy analysis and career  planning branches of the Marine Corps headquarters.  Mann  returned  to Vietnam  in December  1969, serving as commanding officer of HMM–  161 and as executive officer of MAG–16. After  a year in Vietnam, he returned to Santa Ana,  where he remained until 1972. In due course,  Mann’s leadership was rewarded with a promotion  to  the  rank of colonel. He  then  received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University and  joined  the 3rd Marine Aircraft  Wing, serving as assistant chief of staff before  assuming command of MAG –16  in 1977.  In  June 1978, Colonel Mann became chief of  staff of  the Third Marine Amphibious Force,  Okinawa, Japan.  Colonel Mann retired from the United States  Marine Corps on December 23, 1981. He was  the first Marine helicopter pilot in our Nation’s  history to be awarded the Navy Cross. Colonel  Mann was the deserving recipient of a host of  other awards, including the Distinguished Flying Cross,  the Bronze Star,  the Meritorious  Service Medal, and 37 Air Medals. Colonel  Mann recently passed away, and was buried  at Arlington National Cemetery on July 7. He  is survived by his wife Carroll of Laguna  Woods, California, his sons George and Russ,  his daughter Connie Lee Coln, his nine grandchildren, and his six great-grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the California delegation and the people of Orange County, I  am honored  to salute Colonel Mann  for his  service to this great country and to extend my  condolences to his friends and family.  f  USA  PATRIOT  AND  TERRORISM  PREVENTION REAUTHORIZATION  ACT OF 2005  SPEECHOF  HON.

944,2,2005-07-29,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  job growth in the U.S. has increased for  25 straight months with unemployment  at 5 percent, lower than the average for  the last three decades. And the news  just keeps getting better.  New home sales hit a record high in  June. And that should not come as a  surprise, seeing as how more Americans are working than ever before—  over 130 million jobs.  But we do not see this on the front  page of our newspapers or on the nightly newscasts.  The Republican accomplishments of  this House speak for themselves. We  passed medical liability reform to prevent  frivolous  lawsuits  from  forcing  doctors out of practice or closing hospitals and leaving patients with limited access to care.  We passed Association Health Plans  to let small businesses pool their resources together in order to purchase  affordable health  insurance  for their  employees.  Mr. Speaker,  remember  the death  tax, the tax that unfairly burdened  American families at the most inopportune of times? We listened to Americans, to our constituents, and we voted  to repeal that unjust and unfair tax.  Mr. Speaker, as we head into the August work period we have a record of  accomplishment and we look forward  to sharing it with the American people.  f  TRANSPORTATION BILL: ITEMS  ARE LARGER THAN THEY APPEAR  (Mr. FLAKE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2005
945,2,2005-07-29,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Speaker, this bill  that we consider today, the transportation bill, ought to carry the same  warning that drivers see on their rear  view mirror: Items are larger than they  appear.  This bill contains a rescission on the  last day authorized by the bill several  years hence which rescinds about $9  billion. It is a gimmick. It is nothing  more than a gimmick to allow us to  spend more than the President said we  need to or he would veto the bill.  Mr. President, please veto this bill.  We are out of control here on spending.  And this bill goes far over the mark  that you have laid out.  It also bothers a lot of us Republicans to hear it described as a ‘‘jobs  bill.’’ We are hearing jobs, jobs, jobs.  We are not all Keynesians here. We do  not believe that taking money out of  taxpayers’ pockets is the best way to  create jobs. The best way is to leave it  with them.  Mr. Speaker, we ought to have a  transportation bill that reflects what  is in the trust fund—nothing more. And  it ought to be distributed in a way that  does not include 6,000 earmarks.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2005

954,9,2005-07-29,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, there  is an old saying, success has a thousand  fathers, failure is an orphan. We bring  to this House success with at least 435  parents, starting with the Speaker of  the House, who is a strong advocate for  the original bill that the gentleman  from Alaska (Chairman YOUNG) and I  introduced, and nearly all of the members of our committee, for $375 billion,  to respond to the Nation’s transportation needs over the next 6 years. We  did that in 2003 at a time when gasoline  was selling for $1.34 a gallon.  I appreciate the Speaker being an advocate for a robust investment, but I  even more appreciate the gentleman  from Alaska (Chairman YOUNG) for advocating  before his  conference  this  level of  investment that we did not  pick out of the thin air, but that was  recommended by  the Department of  Transportation as directed in TEA–21  to evaluate paving condition, bridge  condition, safety needs, and congestion  across  the country; and  they came  back with their estimates, after consulting with all of the States and all of  the  transportation  experts, what  it  should be, and we did what we thought  should be.  When the chairman broke his pick on  that number after vigorous advocacy,  we agreed to scale the bill back incrementally, further down the ladder to  below $300 billion, and then down to  $275 billion. We brought that bill to the  House floor last year, and it passed; we  went to conference with the Senate and  they could come to no resolution, as we  quaintly say in this body.  We had a little higher threshold. We  came back this year, and while TV and  newspaper stories report conflict and  gridlock in Congress, there is no black  smoke coming out of the Committee on  Transportation  and  Infrastructure  committee room. There is no discord or  disagreement on how to approach policy  issues. They are  resolved  in a  thoughtful, constructive, and positive  way that brought a bill that every one  of us on both sides of the aisle could  support, as if there were no aisle. For  that, I express my deep appreciation  and admiration for the gentleman from  Alaska (Chairman YOUNG), whose patience  nurtured  the  process  along,  whose  impatience prodded the other  body along, whose smile deflected critics, and whose scowl sent them skittering.  The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  PETRI),  the  chairman  of  the  subcommittee, whose thoughtful and deliberative approach over many years on  this  committee  contributed  enormously to our work product. The ranking member, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), plunged into this  subject matter, mastered the  issues,  and became a vigorous and constructive advocate of all of the principal features of the bill. The gentleman has  been  an  extraordinary,  constructive  partner.  This bill, in the end, was a measure  so loved that all who were interested  came to it bearing gifts and adorned it  like a tree. At the end, one by one, we  took those ornaments off until there  was only one remaining last night; and  that one, too, has been put back in its  box to await another vehicle, perhaps a  future omnibus bill where that ornament will be plucked out and hung on  another tree. For now we have a tree of  solid oak for this century, an investment in transportation, highways and  bridges and transit and safety, tripling  the investment in safety that we had in  TEA–21.  Most importantly, this bill will move  us in the direction of reclaiming our  productivity in the marketplace and in  the world economy.  In 1987, logistics consumed 17 percent  of our gross domestic product, that is,  moving people and goods. Last year, logistics consumed 9 percent of our gross  domestic product, and that is a $750 billion a year gain in productivity, meaning it is less costly to move people, less  costly to move goods. Take the example of UPS for whom a 5-minute delay  nationwide costs $40 million. We will  make an assault upon our slipping productivity, keep momentum going, address  the  congestion  points  across  America and move America forward.  This is a good bill for America. It is  good for people, it is good for economic  sectors, and we all ought to pass this  bill this morning and move America  forward. Vote for the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2005
955,9,2005-07-29,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  the conference report for H.R. 3, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005. I want to acknowledge  the work of  the Transportation Committee on  this complex bill and especially  thank my  friend and  colleague  from Wisconsin, Mr. PETRI,  for his  leadership on  the  legislation; the Wisconsin delegation is lucky  to have such a strong advocate for our citizens.  H.R. 3  is a significant economic development and job creation bill, and now is certainly  the time that we need more jobs throughout  the country. I consistently hear from constituents who are searching  for work; who have  sent out dozens of resumes and updated their  skills but remain unemployed. Each billion dollars spent on highway funding creates not only  safer and better roads, but it also creates an  estimated 47,500 news jobs. An investment in  highway funding is an investment for steady  work for those in Wisconsin and around the  nation.  In addition, I am pleased that the bill recognizes the importance of funding crucial highways and bridges in Wisconsin’s Third Congressional District. Specifically, the inclusion of  funding  for  the Stillwater Bridge, which connects Houlton, Wisconsin, and Stillwater, Minnesota,  is great news  for  those of us who  have been working on this project for years.  The bridge is only one example of an important project that will provide our citizens with  safer  roads, shorter commutes, and better  jobs.  Furthermore, I would like to recognize the  important conservation provisions that are included in H.R. 3. As a hunter and fisherman,  I am particularly pleased with a provision  which  recaptures  the  final 4.8 cents of  the  18.3 cents per gallon  tax on motorboat  fuel  and directs  it back  into  the Federal Aid  in  Sport  Fish Restoration Act’s Aquatic Resources Trust Fund (ARTF). This full recovery  of the motorboat fuel excise tax will provide  about $110 million a year  for  recreational  trails, new funding for signage identifying access for anglers and hunters, and vital safety  programs dealing with wildlife-vehicle  collisions. These important provisions make H.R.  3 the most comprehensive transportation bill  for sportsmen ever created.  I am proud  to have served on  the conference committee to help reconcile this bill so  it could reach  the House and Senate  for a  final vote. Moreover, I would like to thank Senators KOHLand FEINGOLD for all the work they  have done with this bill to make sure that it  benefits the citizens of Wisconsin. The long-  awaited passage of this bill is great news for  western Wisconsin.  I urge my colleagues  to  support the bill.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  commend Chairman YOUNG and  Ranking Member OBERSTAR, as well as  the  Subcommittee leadership for their hard work in  crafting  the underlying  legislation.  I consider  the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure and the appointed Conferees for this  bill to be a ‘‘club’’ of sorts, and it is in that vein  that I commend them for the tremendous job  appropriate funding for surface transportation  projects and environmental mitigation projects  of importance to every congressional district.

961,23,2005-07-29,Mr. CONAWAY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to memorialize a friend and a  true hero of our country. Americans  honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom through a  variety of methods.  Most of the times we talk about this  sacrifice in terms of all of those brave  men and women as a group. While this  is entirely appropriate, I encourage everyone to make the issue personal by  thinking about a specific individual.  Every soldier has their own important story, and every American should  have one  story  that pulls at  their  heartstrings and personifies the ideals  of our young men and women in uniform. For me that story is Rex Young.  Rex graduated  from Odessa Permian  High School in 1965 and attended Odessa College for 1 year before joining the  Army on September 15, 1966.  He took basic training at Ft. Bliss in  El Paso, and he had been serving in  Vietnam for 10 months when he was  killed. Rex’s mother, Marilyn, said Rex  planned to attend Texas Tech University in Lubbock following his service.  I would like to read from the citation  that describes Rex’s heroism: ‘‘For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in  action at the risk of his life above and  beyond the call of duty. Staff Sergeant  Rex Young distinguished himself at the  cost of his life while serving as a squad  leader with Company C. While conducting a reconnaissance mission  in  the vicinity of Ben Cui, Company C was  suddenly engaged by an estimated regimental-sized force of the North Vietnamese Army.  ‘‘During the initial volley of fire, the  point  element  of  1st Platoon was  pinned down, sustaining several casualties and the acting platoon leader was  killed.  Staff  Sergeant  Young  unhesitatingly assumed command of  the platoon and immediately began to  organize and deploy his men into a defensive position in order to repel the  attacking force.  ‘‘As a human wave attack advanced  on Staff Sergeant Young’s platoon, he  moved  from position to position encouraging and directing fire on the hostile insurgents while exposing himself  to the hail of enemy bullets.  ‘‘After receiving orders to withdraw  to a better defensive position, he remained behind to provide covering fire  for the withdrawal. Observing that a  small element of the point squad was  unable to extract itself from its position, and completely disregarding his  personal safety, Staff Sergeant Young  began moving toward their position,  firing as he maneuvered. When half  way to their position, he sustained a  critical head injury, yet he continued  his mission and ordered the element to  withdraw.  ‘‘Remaining with  the  squad as  it  fought its way to the rear, he was twice  seriously wounded in the arm and leg.  Although his leg was badly shattered,  Staff Sergeant Young refused assistance that would have slowed the retreat of his comrades, and he ordered  them  to  continue  their withdrawal  while he provided protective covering  fire.  ‘‘With indomitable courage and heroic  self-sacrifice, he  continued his  self-assigned mission until the enemy  force engulfed his position. His gallantry, at the cost of his life, is in the  highest traditions of the military service. Staff Sergeant Young has reflected  great credit upon himself, his unit and  the United States Army.’’  For his service to his country and  tremendous valor displayed in battle,  Rex was awarded the Medal of Honor,  and I believe he is the first individual  to  receive  that honor  from Odessa,  Texas.  Like so many of the bravest men and  women that our Nation has to offer,  Rex Young  lived the  life unfinished.  But he provided an outstanding example of service beyond self and brought  credit  and  honor  upon  the United  States Army and our country.  As  the  37th anniversary of Rex’s  death arrives on August 21, I would  like to thank Staff Sergeant Young  and his family for their sacrifice to our  great Nation.  f  ",2005

967,30,2005-07-29,Mr. POE.," The gentleman from Georgia is exactly correct. I know a lot of  police officers. Some  rookies,  some  have been around, some have retired.  They do it for the reason that they  want to help the community protect  the neighborhoods and enforce the rule  of law. They, too, are frustrated about  these sanctuary laws throughout the  United States that basically give them  a hands-off  policy  in  dealing with  illegals. They want to work with the  Federal authorities. Of  course  they  know the consequences of enforcing the  law. Some of them have been threatened with being terminated if they arrest people who have been illegally in  the United States for no other purpose.  ",2005
968,30,2005-07-29,Mr. NORWOOD.," If the gentleman will  yield one more time, part of the problem of this is that groups like La Raza  and others make it their business to  try to sue cities, county commissions,  law enforcement when they do enforce  Federal law because the present law is  just written in such a way that they  can get away with some of that. Does  that deter a city like Houston, Texas,  from encouraging its law enforcement  officials to help obey the law, help enforce the law, or is that why they are  saying to their officials, Hey, don’t  help anything with this. We may get  sued?  ",2005
969,30,2005-07-29,Mr. POE.," I think part of the reason is  exactly that. Cities and communities  are afraid of those lawsuits and being  tied up in court on enforcing the rule  of law. How silly has this all become  where cities cannot enforce the rule of  law in the United States for fear of  being sued by some other entity. As my  colleague well knows, this needs to be  cleared up so that these authorities  can have the proper legal authority to  arrest individuals that are here illegally  and  have  them  dealt  with  through Federal immigration policy. It  is a very frustrating thing, and we see  that occur. We hear police officers talk  about that very problem on numerous  occasions.  Let me mention, Mr. Speaker, a few  more matters before I conclude here.  This is a national security issue. It is  an immigration issue. It is protecting  the borders and making sure that we  keep our borders safe for the Americans who live in the United States. As  the gentleman from Georgia has pointed out, we only have about 2,000 officials in the whole United States that  are actually seeking out people illegally in the United States once they  cross the border.  One of the solutions maybe is to require a passport for people coming into  the United States  from Mexico and  from  Canada.  Immigration  officials  have to look at hundreds of different  types of documents to verify someone’s  legal status or who they are, their  identity, before they come  into the  United States. Maybe we should reevaluate that policy. A passport policy  would certainly not discriminate as we  seem to do now on entry  into the  United States, and requiring individuals to have those passports to come  and go from the United States would  certainly help identify the true identity of these individuals.  So often people who come to the  United States have already obtained a  false identification. I experienced even  in my time at the courthouse that individuals were sometimes using one Social Security card and there were seven  or eight people using the same Social  Security card to work in the United  States. That Social Security card to  begin with was fraudulent and a forgery. Maybe the passport idea is something that we need to evaluate and  something that we certainly need to do  as soon as we can to ensure the quality  and safety of our borders.  I have received, as all Members of  Congress  receive,  numerous  letters  from constituents about many issues.  The comments I receive the most have  to do with immigration and safety of  the United States and national security and homeland security. It all centers around the borders. I had a senior  citizen who contacts my office on a  regular basis who sent me this letter,  and with this last letter I will close.  However, before doing so, I yield to  the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING).  ",2005
970,30,2005-07-29,Mr. KING of Iowa.," I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I appreciate  the gentleman yielding. I have been  watching the gentleman on C–SPAN  from my office.  I was compelled to  come over here. I want to compliment  you for your leadership and the fact  that you are down here on a regular  basis carrying this message that the  American people need to hear. It needs  to echo across all this land, the border  States that are well represented in this  presentation  here  today,  but  also  throughout the heartland of America.  It is an intense issue. I know that the  gentleman  from  Arizona  (Mr.  HAYWORTH) talked about a 9 to 1 survey  that they want tighter border controls  in Arizona. Your statistics, I think,  would be close to that. We put out a  survey a year ago last March to 10,000  of my constituents in a random mailing that went into these households,  Democrats and Republicans alike. It  was all on immigration. The question  that was the most significant was: On a  scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most  intense, how  intensely do you agree  with this statement: We should reduce  legal immigration and eliminate all illegal immigration. If you counted the  6s, 7s, 8s, 9s and 10s as being agreeing in  intensity, 97 percent of my constituents said we want to have less legal  and no more illegal immigration.  I wanted to tell you that we stand  with you in Iowa, we stand with you in  the Midwest, we  stand  together as  American citizens. It is time to defend  our  borders  and  protect  our  sovereignty. If you do not have a border  that you control, you cannot have a  nation. It is the core of this country.  Law and order and respect for the rule  of law is an essential component of any  nation. I sit on the Immigration Subcommittee  of  the House  Judiciary  Committee, and I am pledged to going  forward on this same cause. I look forward to locking arms with you and dozens of Members of this Congress as we  move forward into this national debate  that is so long awaited on immigration.  ",2005
971,30,2005-07-29,Mr. POE.," I thank my  friend  from  Iowa. We hopefully will deal with this  issue as a body in September, come up  with a commonsense immigration policy and plan that works. But any plan  that we come up with has to start with  the basic premise that we have to secure the borders and make sure that  people in other nations respect the rule  of law in the United States. As you  mentioned and alluded to, we have people that come here legally. The process  of coming here  legally  is taking so  long, it discourages legal immigration  and  encourages  those people  to go  around the rule of law and come into  the United States illegally. A commonsense immigration policy that is fair to  Americans, puts America first, is something that we need to deal with.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like  to read a short letter from a senior citizen down in east Texas. There is that  east Texas wit and common sense that  sometimes we do not see throughout  other portions of the United States. He  starts out his letter: ‘‘There is an iceberg in the national bathtub. Illegal  immigration and our current government’s nonresponse to  it  is  jeopardizing our national security, our State’s  security and our local security. With  these  25 million  illegal  immigrants  comes a huge problem and even larger  risks.  b1300  ‘‘We have more than likely allowed  several terrorists and their weapons  into the country. We all but rolled out  the red carpet. The social welfare costs  are damning. The disease and heightened risk from an epidemic increase  every day. The threats to our law and  order are real as crime rates attributable to certain gangs and the human  smugglers is intolerable.  ‘‘The most telling tale of neglect and  dereliction of duty is the Minute Men,  having to do the job the Federal Government refuses to do. I am joining  these individuals with my vote. No one  will ever get my vote unless this cart  and horse is turned around 180 degrees  in the next election cycle. I am sick of  excuses and political statements and  rhetoric and all of these fake hands  across the border. We have got to seal  the borders, get control, and fix our  immigration laws and the rule of law  at this time.’’  Mr. Speaker,  the members of our  community seem to get it.

984,58,2005-07-29,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to present to the Senate the  legislative branch fiscal year 2006 appropriations conference report. This is  my first year as chairman of this subcommittee and I am delighted we’ll be  able to send the bill to the President  prior to the beginning of the  fiscal  year. I very much appreciate the support of my ranking member, Senator  DURBIN, as well as the full committee  chairman, Senator COCHRAN, and ranking member, Senator BYRD.  In general, I believe this is a fair  agreement. It provides $3.8 billion for  the Congress and its support agencies.  Funding in the conference agreement is  $198 million above the fiscal year 2005  enacted level and a reduction of $225  million below the request. While there  are very few programmatic increases in  the bill, funding is sufficient to maintain current operations in all agencies.  Significant increases above the fiscal  year 2005 budget are recommended in  only a few areas, such as funding to  complete the Capitol Visitor Center.  Highlights of the bill include funding  of $250 million for the Capitol Police,  which will enable the Capitol Police to  maintain its current staffing level of  1,592 police officers and ensure appropriate levels of security for the Capitol  complex. The Capitol Police salaries  funding has  increased by almost 100  percent since fiscal year 2002, and the  number of officers has  increased by  about  one-third. This  indicates  our  support for Capitol Police and all the  good work they do to protect this great  institution.  The  recommendation also  includes  $428 million for the Architect of the  Capitol, including $42 million for Capitol Visitor Center construction and  $2.3 million  for  initial  operational  costs of the CVC. The Architect believes this amount will be sufficient to  complete the CVC construction. Also  within the AOC budget is storage modules for the Library of Congress at Ft.  Meade,  totaling  $40.7 million. While  this is an expensive project, it is critically needed to take care of burgeoning  storage requirements at the library  For the Library of Congress, funding  would  total  $560 million,  including  funding for the Library’s highest priorities such as the new National Audio-  Visual Conservation Center and Congressional Research Service enhancements.  Funding for the GPO would total $123  million, including $2 million to retrain  staff for the new digital environment;  the Government Accountability Office  would  receive  $482 million, and  the  Open World Leadership Program would  be funded at the budget request level of  $14 million.  I do have some concerns about this  conference agreement which I would  like to bring to my colleagues attention. First, I am deeply disappointed  that the House insisted on the elimination of the Capitol Police mounted  unit. I believe, as my predecessor Ben  Nighthorse Campbell did, that there  are some significant benefits to the  Capitol Police having a mounted unit,  and the costs are relatively small—  about $150,000 a year. The officers who  are part of this unit have received extensive training, the horses and attendant equipment have been purchased.  This investment will be down the drain  just 1 year after the unit became operational.  We reluctantly went along with the  House only because this bill needs to  get done. But I believe it is a short-  sighted decision that we will all regret.  Another regret I have with this conference agreement is the elimination of  Senate language authorizing the Architect of the Capitol to hire an executive  director for the Capitol Visitor Center.  The CVC project is something I have  been following closely, with monthly  hearings in our subcommittee. In addition to concerns regarding the management of this mammoth construction  project, I am very concerned that the  Architect hasn’t been given direction  and authority to make operational decisions including the hiring of an executive director. GAO has reported it is  critical AOC develop a strategic plan  for moving from construction to operations. Without an executive director  such decisions will surely languish.  Despite these concerns, I believe it is  a fair and balanced conference agreement and I urge my colleagues to support it.  ",2005

997,65,2005-07-29,Mr.  GRASSLEY.,"  Mr.  President,  today we have the opportunity to finish a very long journey in the quest to  build a dynamic, comprehensive energy  policy for the United States of America. I can say with pride that this Congress, through many trials and tribulations, has now performed admirably  in  its duty to the American people.  This is a balanced energy bill that focuses as much on the future as it does  the present. We have the opportunity  with the passage of this legislation to  safely produce more energy from more  sources and with more infrastructure  security then ever before.  On June 21st, the Senate passed H.R.  6 which  included the Energy Policy  Tax Incentives Act of 2005. The tax progenis  is  the  visions were a bipartisan product formulated with Senator BAUCUS, after  consultation with many Members of  the Senate.  In my estimation, the energy policy  tax  incentives reflected  in this conference agreement are a fair balance of  the interests of the Members and effectively supports the development of energy production  from renewable and  environmentally beneficial sources.  I would like to briefly describe these  tax incentives that are included in the  final energy Conference agreement.  For years, I have worked to decrease  our reliance on foreign sources of energy and accelerate and diversify domestic  energy production.  I believe  public policy ought to promote renewable domestic production that uses renewable energy and fosters economic  development.  Specifically, the development of alternative energy sources should alleviate domestic energy shortages and insulate the United States from the Middle East-dominated oil supply. In addition, the development of renewable energy resources conserves existing natural resources and protects the environment.  Finally, alternative energy development provides economic benefits  to  farmers,  ranchers  and  forest  landowners, such as those in Iowa who have  launched  efforts  to  diversify  the  State’s economy and to find creative  ways to extract a greater return from  abundant natural resources.  Section 45 of the Internal Revenue  Code currently provides a production  tax credit for electricity produced from  renewable sources including wind, biomass, and other renewables. The final  Energy Tax Incentives Act extends the  section 45 credit through the end of  2007.  I have been a constant advocate of alternative energy sources. Since the inception 13 years ago of the wind energy  tax credit, wind energy production has  grown considerably. In addition, wind  represents an affordable and inexhaustible source of domestically produced  energy.  Extending the wind energy tax credit  until 2008 will support the tremendous  continued development of this clean,  renewable energy source.  The conference agreement supports a  maturing green energy source. Experts  have established wind energy’s valuable  contributions  to maintaining  cleaner air and a cleaner environment.  Every 10,000 megawatts of wind energy  produced in the United States can reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 33  million metric tons by replacing the  combustion of fossil fuels.  In addition, this agreement helps to  empower  our  rural  communities  to  reap continued economic benefits. The  installation of wind  turbines has a  stimulative economic effect because it  requires significant capital investment  which results in the creation of jobs  and the injection of capital into often  rural economic areas.  In addition, for each wind turbine, a  farmer or rancher can receive more  than $2,000 per year for 20 years in direct lease payments. Iowa’s major wind  farms currently pay more than $640,000  per year to landowners, and the development of 1,000 megawatts of capacity  in California, for example, would result  in annual payments of approximately  $2 million to  farm and  forest  landowners in that State.  Environmentally  friendly  biomass  energy production is a proven, effective  technology  that generates numerous  waste management  public  benefits  across the country.  The biomass definition covers open  loop biomass. Open loop biomass includes organic, nonhazardous materials  such as sawdust, tree trimmings, agricultural byproducts and untreated construction debris.  The development of a local industry  to convert biomass to electricity has  the potential to produce enormous economic benefits and electricity security  for rural America.  In addition, studies show that biomass crops could produce between $2  and $5 billion in additional farm income for American farmers. As an example, over 450 tons of turkey and  chicken litter are under contract to be  sold for an electricity plant using poultry  litter being built  in Minnesota.  This  is a win-win. Not only do the  farmers not have to pay to dispose of  this stuff, they get paid to sell the litter. You could find similar examples  throughout  the Midwest  and  other  farm regions across America.  Finally, marginal farmland incapable  of sustaining traditional yearly production is often capable of generating  native grasses and organic materials  that are ideal for biomass energy production. Turning tree trimmings and  native grasses into energy provides an  economic gain and serves an important  public interest.  I am very proud of a long history of  supporting new alternative energy concepts in the production of electricity.  The energy conference agreement continues that commitment.  By using animal waste as an energy  source, an American livestock producer  can reduce or eliminate monthly energy purchases from electric and gas  suppliers and provide excess energy for  distribution to other members of the  community.  Swine and bovine energy  is  truly  green electricity, as it also furthers environmental objectives.  Specifically, anaerobic digestion of  manure improves air quality because it  eliminates as much as 90 percent of the  odor from feedlots and improves soil  and water quality by dramatically reducing problems with waste  runoff.  Maximizing farm resources in such a  manner may prove essential to remain  competitive in today’s livestock market. In addition, the technology used  to create the electricity results in the  production of a fertilizer product that  is of a higher quality than unprocessed  animal waste.

998,86,2005-07-29,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today in support of the Energy bill conference agreement. The final version of  this  legislation  is  imperfect, but  it  takes important steps forward in addressing some of this Nation’s energy  problems. This  bill will  strengthen  electric reliability, further develop our  renewable energy resources, and  improve energy efficiency.  I would like to begin by thanking  Chairman DOMENICIand ranking member BINGAMAN for their long and arduous work on this subject. We have now  been working on comprehensive energy  legislation  for nearly 5 years, under  three different Congresses and three  different Energy Committee chairmen.  I know  it has been a very difficult  path. I express my sincere appreciation  to Chairman DOMENICI for his dedication, leadership, and willingness to accommodate a great diversity of views  on the subject of energy policy.  I am very pleased that the Energy  bill provides nearly $3 billion for wind,  biomass, and other renewable energy  sources. This credit could help a major  wind energy development project move  forward in Aroostook County and will  help Maine’s forest products industry  by  providing  an  important  revenue  stream for waste forest products. Developing Maine’s wind and biomass resources creates jobs in rural areas, provides additional revenue to farmers and  struggling  industries,  reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and helps diversify our energy supply. While I am disappointed that the bill does not contain the provision which I authored,  along with Senator BINGAMAN, to require that 10 percent of our electricity  come from renewable energy sources by  the year  2020,  the bill nevertheless  makes important strides forward in developing  our  renewable  energy  resources.  This bill will also help improve our  electricity reliability by creating new  standards  for  the  national  electric  transmission grid and creating incentives to spur the creation of a stronger  and more robust grid. This bill also  provides  for  improved market transparency, the first ever broad prohibition on market manipulation and filing  false information, and new consumer  protections for utility customers.  I am also pleased by a number of provisions included in the bill to help spur  greater energy efficiency. Consumers  will be able to take advantage of tax  credits  for hybrid cars,  solar water  heaters, and energy efficient improvements to existing homes. Additional  tax credits will spur energy-efficient  appliances and alternative fueled vehicles, which will not only reduce smog  and greenhouse gas emissions but also  reduce oil imports. In addition, a number of new Federal programs and 15  new product standards will reduce natural gas use in 2020 by 1.1 trillion cubic  feet, and reduce peak electric demand  by an amount equivalent to that produced by 85 power plants. All of these  programs will not only help protect the  environment, but also help consumers  save money on their energy bills.  Several other provisions bear mentioning. I am pleased that the final legislation retains the amendment which  Senator LEVINand I offered regarding  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This  amendment requires the Department of  Energy to develop procedures for using  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  in  such a way as to reduce the impact on  taxpayers and energy consumers, while  maximizing oil supplies and improving  U.S. energy security. This amendment  will help mitigate the impact of the  Department  of  Energy’s misguided  policies on the Nation’s gasoline prices.

999,93,2005-07-29,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, exactly 1 month ago I praised the Appropriations Committee’s efforts to fund  the State Revolving Fund for Wastewater Treatment  and  for Drinking  Water at the highest possible levels.  Today, however,  I am gravely concerned about the overall cut in environmental spending contained in the  bill before us today and specifically  with a large cut in the clean water program.  First, let me say that I intend to  vote for this conference report, as it  contains a  $1.5 billion  supplemental  spending package to cover a shortfall  in veterans health care funding.  I was highly disappointed to learn  last month of the shortfall in funding  for veterans health care. It was particularly  outrageous  that  this  announcement followed on the heels of  assurances from the Veterans’ Administration and President Bush that the  additional funding we attempted to add  in the emergency supplemental funding  bill was not needed. Clearly, this was  not the case. I am pleased that the  Senate moved immediately to rectify  this problem and dealt with this problem while we still had a chance.  I am frustrated, however, that the  funding to combat this shortfall was  not attached to the more appropriate  vehicle. At a time when our soldiers  are returning from war and veterans  are coming into the VA in record numbers, our veterans and our local VA  hospitals need and deserve this funding. I only hope that we have learned  our lesson from this unfortunate sequence of events and that we will do  what is necessary in the future to ensure that the essential funds are provided for our veterans in a timely manner and  following appropriate procedures. Our veterans deserve no less.  A  clean and healthy  environment  may be our most important legacy for  our children. It saddens me to think  that under the guise of fiscal responsibility, the bill before us today cuts  spending at the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to levels not seen  since fiscal year 2001. This bill funds  the EPA at about $7.7 billion. As recently as fiscal year 2004, the EPA received $8.365 billion. This is a cut of  over $600 million in just 2 years.  Because of the administration’s fiscal  policies and priorities, which have led  to record deficits, we are now going to  underfund many programs that are important  to  the protection of public  health and the environment. There are  many programs I could touch on, but  let me focus my remarks on the sad  state of the clean water State revolving fund, CWSRF.  The CWSRF offers long-term, low-interest loans to State and local governments to help them meet Federal water  quality standards by fixing old, decaying sewer pipelines, building and repairing wastewater treatment plants,  and controlling other sources of water  pollution. The conference report before  us today funds the CWSRF at about  $900 million, down from almost $1.1 billion last year and over $1.3 billion in  FY 2004. This huge drop in spending is  occurring at a time when nearly half of  America’s rivers and lakes do not meet  basic Clean Water Act standards.  Furthermore, municipalities are currently struggling to fix old water and  sewage pipes. The EPA estimates that  clean water  infrastructure needs nationwide will cost $390 billion over the  next 15 years. The aging of the Nation’s  sewage treatment infrastructure has a  direct effect on our waters and the people who come into contact with them.  Many systems have exceeded their effective lives and are decaying because  they were designed and built decades  ago when urban areas were more compact  and  had much  smaller  populations.  I intend to carry on this fight for increased spending on water infrastructure  and  other  important  environmental programs. I hope that we can  come to our senses before it is too late.

1004,107,2005-07-29,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. President, I have  some great friends in law enforcement.  They have served their country and  States and communities well over the  years. We hunt and fish together at  various times. I am not hearing them  say this is what they would like to see.  If you talk to law officers, what they  are concerned about  is  repeat dangerous offenders getting released on  the  streets. A  police  officer never  knows when he may face someone like  that around the corner, at a traffic  stop, or in a domestic violence situation. Those are things that concern  them. They do feel sometimes that the  criminal  justice system  is too slow,  that the punishment and penalties that  are imposed by law never get carried  out. Those things frustrate them. That  follows through and is consistent with  the letters we have received regarding  the Kennedy amendment.  I am looking at the Law Enforcement  Alliance of America letter, which they  wrote to Senator CRAIG. This is a very  clear and strong message. They represent 75,000 members in support of law  enforcement. They wanted to ‘‘add our  voice to the growing group of law enforcement representatives who strongly oppose efforts to gut or kill S. 397,  the Protection of Lawful Commerce in  Arms Act.’’  They refer to this amendment as a  ‘‘poison pill’’ and object to the term  ‘‘cop killer bullet’’ as a ‘‘thinly veiled  fraud.’’ They go on to say:  This amendment, along with other amendments, should be identified for what they  are: an outright attempt to kill S. 397.  Please know that many in the law enforcement community encourage you to continue  steadfastly in support of America’s gun manufacturers who provide our officers the tools  to return home safely at the end of their  shift.  CRAIG Also, the Fraternal Order of Police  has written  to  Senator  in  ‘‘strong opposition’’ to the amendment  offered by Senator KENNEDY. They say  that this will be presented as a ‘‘officer  safety  issue’’ to get dangerous  ‘‘cop  killer bullets off the shelves.’’  Then they add:  Regardless of its presentation, the amendment’s actual claim and effect would be to  expand the definition of ‘‘armor-piercing’’ to  include ammunition based, not on any threat  to law enforcement officers, but on a manufacturer’s marketing strategy.  Then they add this, which is interesting:  The truth of the matter is that only one  law officer has been killed by a round fired  from a handgun which penetrated his soft  body armor—and in that single instance, it  was the body armor that failed to provide  the expected ballistic protections, not because the round was ‘‘armor-piercing.’’  They say:  It is our view that no expansion or revision  of the current law is needed to protect law  enforcement officers.  That letter is to Senator CRAIG. No  additional legislation is needed to protect law officers.  To put it simply, this is not a genuine [law  enforcement] officer safety issue.  They noted that it had been rejected  previously—last year, 63 to 34. They  say it should be rejected again.  I thank the Chair.  ",2005
1005,107,2005-07-29,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President, I believe  all that can be said about these two  amendments has been said. I hope my  colleagues join in voting for the first-  degree relevant amendment I have offered that toughens up penalties and  recognizes the reality that the law we  have today is working to protect our  law  enforcement  community  from  armor-piercing bullets.

1013,114,2005-07-29,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President,  I  have already registered my disappointment at the majority leader’s decision  to cease work on an important defense  authorization bill in order to move to  the bill before us, S. 397. Today,  I  would like to speak about S. 397, the  gun  liability bill, and  some of  the  amendments relating to firearms that  have been offered to it.  Listening to the debate on this bill,  the American people might get the impression that there are just two sides  to this issue. On one side are those who  view the right to bear arms as absolute  and oppose any proposals that could remotely be considered as restrictions on  that right. On the other side are those  who view gun use as an evil in our society that must be limited in any way  possible. Sometimes the rhetoric gets  turned up so high that reasoned analysis and debate is obscured. That is unfortunate.  I have never accepted the proposition  that the gun debate  is a black and  white issue, a matter of ‘‘you’re with  us, or you’re against us.’’ Instead, I  have followed what I believe is a moderate course, faithful to the Constitution and to the realities of modern society. I believe that the second amendment was not an afterthought, that it  has meaning today and must be respected. I support the right to bear  arms for lawful purposes—for hunting  and sport and for self-protection. Millions of Americans own  firearms  legally and we should not take action  that tells them that they are second-  class citizens or that their constitutional rights are under attack. At the  same time, there are actions we can  and should take to protect public safety that do not infringe on constitutional rights. I supported the amendment offered by  the  senior Senator  from Wisconsin regarding child safety  locks and was pleased that the Senate  approved this measure, which does not  infringe on the rights of law-abiding  citizens to own and use guns.  I do not believe that granting special  liability protection to the gun industry  is necessary to protect the right to  bear arms, however. There is no evidence that liability lawsuits threaten  the existence of the gun industry in  America. I believe it would be a mistake to impose a nationwide standard  of tort liability on this industry that is  more lenient than the standard that  applies to the manufacturers or suppliers of any other product. The gun industry, like other industries, owes a  duty to consumers of reasonable care,  and juries of citizens are best able to  define that standard as they do in tort  cases of every imaginable type every  day in this country.  Giving sweeping liability protection  will cut off the rights of those injured  by negligence and set a very dangerous  precedent for how Congress treats corporate wrongdoers.

1014,128,2005-07-29,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of final passage of the transportation  reauthorization  bill.  The  road to final passage has been long and  brutal, but I am pleased that we have  finally reached this point. This is a  good bill for Maryland and a good bill  for our Nation.  The State of Maryland is the fifth  most densely populated State in the  Nation. Our  highways  and  byways  serve almost 54 billion vehicle miles of  travel annually. Maryland has the second  largest urban  interstate  traffic  density and the sixth largest percentage of roads  in urban areas  in the  United States. As part of the Northeast  corridor, Maryland experiences an extremely high volume of through traffic,  especially on roadways such as 1–95.  Maryland is also one of the few States  in the Nation with two major metropolitan areas, Washington, DC, and  Baltimore, and  two major beltways  with some of the highest traffic volumes in the country, within 30 miles of  each other. In the Washington metropolitan area, we have the third longest  average commute time in the Nation.  This bill will provide much needed  relief to the stresses that our commuters experience every day by making critical  investments  to highway  safety and expansion, improvements to  our Metro system, and expansion of our  transit systems.  Maryland will receive more funding  for highways and mass transit under  this bill than it does now. For highways, Maryland can expect to receive  $140 million more per year in Federal  highway  formula money, more  than  $2.9 billion over the life of the bill. This  funding will help make our roads safer,  improve traffic conditions, and help  promote  economic  development  throughout the State. For our transit  systems this bill provides more than  $900 million. This means critical funding to  improve the capacity of the  Washington Metro  and  expand  and  build  capacity  for  transit  systems  throughout Maryland.  In closing, I would like to thank my  colleague, Senator SARBANES, for all of  his hard work on this bill, particularly  for his steadfast dedication to the transit needs of Maryland and our Nation.  Thanks to his efforts, this bill provides  essential support to State and  local  governments to ensure greater access  to safe and reliable transit services.  ",2005
1015,128,2005-07-29,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of the highway bill conference  report. This legislation is 2 years overdue, and I am pleased that we are finally  completing  this  very  critical  piece of legislation.  I would  like  to  Senators  thank  INHOFE, BOND, JEFFORDS, BAUCUS, and  LOTT their staffs for their very hard work on  this bill and commend them for the bipartisan way in which they have proceeded.  I would also like to thank Senator  and Senator INOUYE, the chairman and co chairman of the Commerce  Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine, for their  work on the safety portions of this bill,  as well as Senator STEVENS, the chair  of the full Commerce Committee. I was  proud to have worked on these very important motor carrier and passenger  safety provisions.  I have addressed  this body before  with my concerns about the need for a  highway bill.  In America over one-third of our  major roads are both deteriorating and  congested. In Arkansas, 47 percent of  our roads are in poor or mediocre condition—almost half. Additionally, over  one in four bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.  The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that close to 42,800  persons died in car crashes in 2004. Over  2,000 Arkansans have died on our highways over the past several years. Too  many families die on our highways—  plain and simple.  The amount of freight expected to  travel on our Nation’s highways over  the next 20 years is expected to double.  Not only do we need to improve the existing system, we feed to increase the  capacity of the system.  This bill would decrease congestion  on American roads and enable businesses  to  transport  their materials  across  the United States  safely.  It  would also spur economic development  and create many jobs for hard-working  Americans.  The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that for every $1 billion of investment in our highways, we  create 47,500 jobs annually. This bill  provides a record amount of  investment  in our Nation’s highways and  interstates, over $286 billion.  But we still have much work to do.  We must continue  to make  investments in infrastructure, and we must  work toward finding creative solutions  to our transportation problems. After  all, good schools, good health care, and  good jobs don’t mean much if you can’t  get there.  I am pleased this bill provides funding  increases that could be used to  make substantial progress on important economic development projects in  my State and around the country. With  passage of this bill, Arkansas would be  able to make progress on many critical  projects such as the Northeast Arkansas Connector,  the Caraway Bridge  Overpass, the Interstate 430/630 Interchange Modification, the Perry Road  Overpass, and the Hot Springs East-  West Arterial,  just  to name a  few.  These projects will greatly enhance the  capacity and safety of Arkansas roadways.  This bill also enables Arkansas to  make significant progress on our two  large corridors, I–49 and I–69, that, if  completed, would help generate economic expansion, add jobs, and provide  isolated areas with transportation options. I am pleased this bill provides  $75 million for the I–69 Corridor, including the Great River Bridge which  serves as a ‘‘Bridge Across the Delta.’’  It provides $72 million for the I–69 Connector, which will enable the northern  part of the State to access I–69. 1 am  also pleased that this bill provides $37  million for the I–49 Bella Vista Bypass  and several other projects that will reduce congestion and allow for further  economic  development  in northwest  Arkansas, one of the top 10  fastest  growing areas in America.  This is a wise investment that will  pay for itself by fostering interstate  commerce, bolstering tourism, and creating jobs.  Mr. President, this is a good bill. It is  a long overdue bill. It is a bipartisan  bill. My constituents support it, I support it, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",2005
1016,128,2005-07-29,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, today we  are passing a significant bill for the  people of this country. It will create  hundreds of thousands of jobs. It will  reduce congestion on our highways. It  will move goods more efficiently. And  it will improve local transit systems.  I was pleased to have been a part of  putting this bill together as a member  of the Environment and Public Works  Committee and as a conferee on this  legislation.  This is a good bill for the State of  California. In total, California will receive $21.6 billion in highway and transit funding over the next 5 years. That  is an average of $1.175 billion more per  year for California than the last highway bill in 1998. And it will create an  estimated 800,000 jobs in my State.  When I arrived in the Senate in 1993,  California was getting about 83 cents  on the dollar in highway funds. I am  pleased to report that with this bill  California’s rate of return will reach 92  percent. Not what it should be—but a  significant improvement.  This bill also includes over $1 billion  in special projects for California, including over $130 million for the I–405  HOV lanes in the Los Angeles area and  $58 million for the Golden Gate bridge  seismic retrofit—an extremely important project in helping to preserve one  of American’s most notable landmarks.  Let me tell you why increased funding is so crucial for California.  According  to  the Texas Transportation Institute, Los Angeles and the  San  Francisco-Oakland  region  are  ranked No. 1 and 2 for the worst roadway congestion in this country. California has two more cities in the top  five, with San Jose ranked fourth and  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:48 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S29JY5.REC S29JY5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005
1017,135,2005-07-29,Mr.  FEINGOLD.,"  Mr.  President,  today, Congress is finally completing  work  on  a  bill  to  reauthorize  the  Transportation Equity Act for the 21st  century. This bill has been a long time  coming and while it is 668 days overdue, for Wisconsin it may have been  worth the wait. I am pleased that Wisconsin will now have a chance to address our State’s vital transportation  needs for the next year and plan its priorities for the next 5 years. I am even  more pleased that this conference report builds on the precedent set under  TEA–21, where Wisconsin, after decades  of not getting our fair share, finally  started to receive at least as much in  highway funding as we pay to the Federal Government. During this summer  travel season, the people of Wisconsin  should be happy to know that their tax  dollars will be used to improve Wisconsin’s roads, bridges, trails, rails and  transit system.  While the bill is not perfect, it goes a  long way toward ending Wisconsin’s  decades-long legacy as a donor State.  Historically,  Wisconsin’s  taxpayers  have received about 78 cents for every  dollar we have paid into the highway  trust fund. As a result, we have lost  more than $625 million between 1956  and when TEA–21 was passed in 1998.  Under TEA–21,  the  previous  6-year  highway authorization, Wisconsin received  approximately  102  cents  for  every dollar it paid contributed to the  highway trust  fund through gasoline  taxes. I was pleased to work with the  Wisconsin delegation to  finally turn  around decades of our State getting the  short end of the stick, and am happy  that we are now able to build upon that  success. The conference report guarantees Wisconsin an absolute dollar increase of over 30 percent, or about $165  million per year, over the last bill and  improves our rate of return to 106 cents  per dollar paid in over the 5 years of  the bill. This will help us make up for  the decades where Wisconsin was instead on the losing end of the highway  funding equation.  I applaud the efforts of Wisconsin’s  delegation in achieving an even greater  measure of fairness for Wisconsin’s taxpayers. Throughout this over 2-year  process,  I have worked closely with  Senator KOHLand the entire House delegation to get the best possible treatment  for Wisconsin. The conference  bill represents a great victory for Wisconsin, largely due to this bipartisan  bicameral cooperation. I would like to  give special thanks to those members  of both bodies who have worked in the  trenches as conferees to craft this bill,  especially Congressman TOMPETRI, the  chairman of the House Subcommittee  on Highways, Transit and Pipelines. As  one of the key conferees, he worked  tirelessly over the past 2 years or more  to come to this agreement and to ensure that Wisconsin was treated fairly.  While  there  are  probably  some  projects in this large bill that may not  be priorities for their States or local  communities, but  instead were proposed by special interests, I don’t feel  that this is the case for Wisconsin. I  worked closely with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation when  I  made requests for funding of specific  projects to ensure that they addressed  Wisconsin’s transportation priorities. I  think this was probably true for the  entire Wisconsin delegation as well,  and I want to thank the State Department of Transportation for this valuable advice and support. The projects I  requested were chosen to meet a range  of State and local needs and span the  entire State from our urban areas, with  the Marquette  Interchange  in Milwaukee or East Washington Avenue in  Madison, to suburban and rural areas  like the Stillwater Bridge linking St.  Croix County  to Minnesota, or  the  Sturgeon Bay Bridge and State Highway 57 in Door County. These projects  will create jobs in Wisconsin, allow for  the more efficient movement of manufactured goods and agricultural products throughout the State, provide access to Wisconsin’s natural wonders to  residents and visitors, and  in many  cases make the roads safer for Wisconsin’s families as they go about their  daily lives.  Finally, while attention has been focused  on money  for highways  and  bridges, this bill also includes funds for  important safety improvements, transit projects, recreational trails, boating programs and funds to give seniors  and  the disabled more mobility,  to  name a few. I was proud to support  many of these programs that were ultimately  included  in the bill. Having  fought to secure funds for recreational  trails, senior transportation, and various transit projects from the statewide bus funding to the Dane County’s  Transport 2020 and the commuter rail  extension through Kenosha, Racine and  Milwaukee, I can attest that these are  as important to many citizens in Wisconsin as the essential highways and  bridges.  As I noted before, this bill is not perfect. I am concerned about some of the  environmental provisions in the bill,  particularly those with a potential impact on the Nation’s air quality. The  language modifies  current  transportation regulations dealing with long-  range transportation planning and its  impact on air quality. The current  rules  require  that major new  road  projects must not contribute to violations of air quality standards over a 20-  year period. The conference report instead mandates that Clean Air Act conformity will  be  considered  over  10  years. The bill also contains environmental review streamlining provisions  that include tight review deadlines and  conflict resolutions provisions. I agree  with these measures in principle, but I  am  concerned  that  the  articulated  deadlines may not be realistic.  On balance, my concerns about these  provisions are not enough to cause me  to oppose this bill that provides critical highway funds in a fair manner. I  will vote for the bill.  ",2005
1018,135,2005-07-29,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I rise to  discuss the conference report that accompanied  the  Safe,  Accountable,  Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act reauthorization bill. The Senate adopted this measure earlier today  and I voted in support of it.  I would like to begin by thanking the  principal Senate authors of this important  legislation: Senator INHOFE and  Senator JEFFORDSof the Environment  and Public Works Committee; Senator  SHELBYand Senator SARBANESof the  Banking Committee; Senator GRASSLEYand Senator BAUCUSof the Finance  Committee; and Senator STEVENSand  Senator  of  the  Commerce,  Science  and  Transportation  Committee.  I commend  them and  their  staffs for their hard work over these  past 3 years in crafting this legislation.  I would also like to thank my colleagues who served on the conference  committee during these past 2 months.  Reconciling legislative differences with  the other body over a bill of this large,  complex and important nature is no  easy task; I appreciate all of their hard  work.  The conference  report  that passed  the Senate funds our Nation’s transportation infrastructure at $286.4 billion between fiscal year 2005 and fiscal  year 2009. This includes all of our Interstate highways, the National Highway  System, secondary roadways, intercity  passenger rail,  local transit systems  and  transportation  safety programs.  Taken together, these elements form  one of the most essential factors that  determine the well-being of our country and our country’s national economy: ensuring the safe and efficient  passage of people and goods.  The conference report provided $233.8  billion for our Nation’s roadways. Included in this amount was $25 billion  for the maintenance and expansion of  our Interstate highway system, $30.5  billion for the maintenance and expansion of our larger National Highway  INOUYE VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:48 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S29JY5.REC S29JY5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005

1036,142,2005-07-29,Mr. DOMENICI.," Madam President, I  rise today before we leave on this recess to tell the Senate and those interested in how we do the people’s business, what a successful 6 months we  have had in the Senate. I have been  here a long time. I believe this first 6  months has been like a great marathon  runner. We started off slow and crossed  the finish line a winner.  About 4 hours ago, we passed the first  comprehensive Energy bill in about 14  years. We have been trying for 6 years,  and now it is done. The Senate did that  in a bipartisan way, and we worked  with the House and got a great policy  for our Nation.  A few moments ago, we passed a comprehensive Transportation bill for all  of our States and our people, and regardless of what is said about it, in meticulous detail it is a terrific jobs package and infrastructure building bill for  America.  In addition, I submit that we have  also  accomplished  some  things we  never were able to do: we enacted a  bankruptcy reform act. I know people  wonder why that is important, but we  will not talk about why. Let’s just say  credit is the lifeblood of our Nation. If  something is wrong with the credit system, you have to fix it. We have been  waiting around to fix the bankruptcy  law, which is an integral part of the  credit system, for at least 5 years. We  passed the bill about three times in the  Senate and, yes, in this particular 6  months, we did that. We sent it to the  House and it is a law.  The budget resolution, I did them for  years—let’s be honest,  for 31 years.  This new Senator produced, under our  leader’s  leadership,  the  fifth  fastest  budget resolution, and he got it in on  time.  The emergency supplemental was as  big as many appropriations bills, gigantic—for Iraq, the tsunami, and we  provided real help for the borders of  our country. Five-hundred new Border  Patrol people were in that bill, along  with other things.  We included, since then, in an Interior  appropriations  bill, which  also  passed, veterans funding of $1.5 billion.  Let me go on with the list. After the  emergency supplemental, we did six  judges who had been filibustered for  months upon months.  We did CAFTA. That is the last of a  long list of American free-trade agreements. This one, for a change, went our  way. It was taking off tariffs that were  imposed mostly on us, instead of the  other way around.  Now, 5 of the 12 appropriations bills  have passed. All of the appropriations  bills have been reported out of committee, except one. I didn’t check the  history, but I think that is close to a  record.  We  confirmed  the  Secretaries  of  State, Justice and Homeland Security.  We confirmed the Director of National  Intelligence. That is the equivalent of  another Cabinet seat.  We  also  passed  the  Legislative  Branch appropriations bill. We did, a  while ago, a very important piece of  legislation, gun liability reform. People wonder what that has to do with—  as we say out in the country—the price  of eggs. I will tell you, it is important  legislation, too. It conformed liability,  as  far as the  liability of those who  manufacture, which is growing out of  proportion to our regular negligence  laws, and put that under some kind of  reasonable control as far as the liability of manufacturers, those who build  firearms. If these gun manufacturers  went out of business, we would have  had to get guns produced overseas, and  that would not have been good.

1037,149,2005-07-29,Mr. FRIST.," Tomorrow, America celebrates  the  40th  anniversary  of  the  Medicare law.  Forty years ago,  standing  in  the  Harry S. Truman library in Independence, Missouri, President Johnson told  a grateful nation that ‘‘Through this  new law, every citizen will be able, in  his productive years when he is earning, to insure himself against the ravages of old age.’’  Passage of the Medicare law ensured  that never again would health care for  the elderly be a matter of charity, but  one of national conscience.  Medicare has served millions of seniors,  improving  their  health  and  lengthening their lives. Today, 41 million elderly and disabled Americans  have Medicare coverage. That number  is expected to hit 77 million in 2031  when the baby boom generation is fully  enrolled.  I am proud to have worked to pass  the Medicare Modernization Act  in  2003. This legislation guarantees seniors for the first time have access to affordable prescription drugs.  It also expands health care choices,  improves preventive care, and begins to  take a number of additional steps to  improve quality and affordability of  care in the Medicare program.  In just a few short months, in January 2006, every senior will have access  to prescription drug coverage under  Medicare. This represents the most significant improvement to the Medicare  program since its inception 40 years  ago. And 41 million American seniors  and individuals with disabilities finally  have  the prescription drug coverage  they need and the Medicare choices  they deserve.  As a physician, I have written thousands of prescriptions  that  I knew  would  go  unfilled  because  patients  could not afford them. Under the Medicare Modernization Act that will soon  change.  As a senator, I watched a decades-old  Medicare  program  operate  without  flexibility, without comprehensive and  coordinated care, without preventive  care or disease management, and with  no  catastrophic  protection  against  high  out-of-pocket medical  costs.  I  watched as science raced ahead, and  Medicare stood still.  Now, under the Medicare Modernization Act  that,  too,  is beginning  to  change. By expanding opportunities for  private  sector  innovation, Medicare  now combines the best of the public  and private sectors. It provides better  and more comprehensive coverage for  today’s seniors, and helps to lay the  foundation  for a stronger and more  modern program for tomorrow’s seniors.  The Medicare Modernization Act also  offered  some  benefits  for  younger  Americans. Most  significantly,  it  is  making health insurance more affordable  through  portable  and  tax-free  health savings accounts. Health savings  accounts  are  already  giving  younger Americans more control over  their health care choices and hard-  earned dollars.  The Medicare Modernization Act was  a historic step forward for a program  that has served millions of America’s  seniors. And it continues to draw on  technological advances, like health information  technologies  and  e-prescribing, to deliver more effective and  more affordable care.  Medicare is a compact between generations. It is one of the most valued  and compassionate legislative achievements  of  the  20th  century. More  changes will be needed in the future.  But we have already begun to lay the  groundwork. Medicare  is providing a  platform for making health care more  affordable, more available, and more  dependable for all Americans.  f  BERKH.J. RES. 59, WOMEN SUFFRAGISTS  ",2005
1038,149,2005-07-29,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I rise today  to express my support for H.J. Res. 59,  a joint resolution that expresses the  sense of Congress with respect to the  women suffragists who fought for and  won the right of women to vote in the  United States. It is my privilegte to  join Congresswoman SHELLEY LEY, my colleague and fellow Nevadan,  in the effort to honor and celebrate  their hard-won achievements.  Our Nation was founded on the principle of ‘‘consent of the governed.’’ Yet  for the greater part of America’s history, women were denied the  fundamental right to participate in our democracy through the power of the vote.  Today, it would be unthinkable and unconscionable to hold elections where  not every vote properly cast is counted.  Eighty-five  years  ago—perhaps  within the lifespan of our mothers or  grandmothers—this was not the case.  Next month we will observe the 85th  anniversary of the 19th amendment,  which finally secured women’s right to  vote  in the United States. The 19th  amendment does not  just  represent  voting rights. It also represents a profound victory  for women  suffragists  long seeking to be affirmed as equal  partners in America’s civic, cultural,  and social affairs. But as victories with  enduring  and  far-reaching  consequences tend to, this one required  the suffragists to first overcome numerous setbacks.  In 1866, Elizabeth Cady Stanton ran  for Congress to test women’s constitutional right to hold public office—and  received only 24 of 12,000 votes cast. In  1872, Susan B. Anthony registered to  vote in Rochester, New York, and cast  a  ballot—and  subsequently was  arrested. Two years later, the Supreme  Court considered whether citizenship  itself conferred voting rights and ruled  that it does not for women. During the  several years leading up to 1920, many  suffragists, including Alice Paul, exercised their right to engage in civil discourse  through  protest  and  were  thrown in jail for doing so.  These names may not sound familiar  to everyone. Nor are these events the  full extent of the challenges that the  women suffragists faced as they fought  for the ratification of the 19th amendment. The joint resolution would let us  remember them and give them their  due tribute.  The women suffragists commended in  this resolution were instrumental not  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:48 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S29JY5.REC S29JY5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005
1039,156,2005-07-29,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I rise  to recognize and pay tribute to CAPT  Kenneth J. Panos, U.S. Navy. Captain  Panos will retire  from the Navy on  September 1, 2005, having completed an  exemplary 26-year career of service to  our Nation.  Captain Panos was born  in Union,  NJ, and is a 1979 graduate of the U.S.  Naval Academy. He also earned a masters degree in Financial Management  from the Naval Postgraduate School in  Monterey, CA.  During his military career, Captain  Panos excelled at all facets of his chosen profession. As a naval aviator, he  deployed to South America and the  Caribbean. While serving aboard USS  Paul (FF 1096), Captain Panos participated  in peacekeeping operations  in  the waters off Beirut, Lebanon.  In 1986, Captain Panos was redesignated a full-time support officer in the  Navy Reserve. He reported aboard Helicopter  Anti-Submarine  Squadron  (Light)-94 as the head of the Maintenance, Training  and Administration  Departments and achieved 1,000 flight  hours in the SH–2F Seasprite while deployed aboard various Navy Reserve  Force frigates. His outstanding capacity for leadership was recognized when  he was selected as the HSL–94 Junior  Officer of the Year in 1988. During Captain Panos’ tour as the assistant reserve programs director/reserve service  officer and later department head at  Naval Air Station Willow Grove, he  transitioned to fixed-wing aircraft and  achieved an airline transport pilot rating while flying the UC–12B transport.

1040,170,2005-07-29,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I want to  take a moment to speak about Guatemala, a country that receives too little  attention by the Congress, where we  have seen both progress and disturbing  trends in recent years.  Guatemala is struggling to emerge  from more than three decades of civil  war in which tens of thousands of civilians, mostly Mayan Indians, were disappeared, tortured and killed. The majority of those atrocities were committed by the army.  A year and a half ago, Guatemala  elected a new President, Oscar Berger,  who pledged to support the implementation of the 1996 Peace Accords which  his predecessors had largely ignored.  President  Berger’s  election  offered  hope  for change, beginning with the  downsizing of the military, his appointment  of  Nobel  Peace  Laureate  Rigoberta Menchu´ as a Goodwill Ambassador, and his pursuit of corruption  charges against former President Alfonso Portillo. I was among those who  praised President Berger for those important and courageous initiatives.  However, I am concerned that after a  promising beginning, corruption, organized crime, and human rights violations are getting worse.  In 2004, President Berger reduced the  size of the Guatemalan military by 50  percent. However, to the consternation  of many civil  society organizations,  the Interior Ministry announced that  the Guatemalan military would continue to participate in joint law enforcement  operations with  the National Civil Police, in violation of the  Peace Accords. This is also a concern  because, according to the State Department, there are credible allegations of  involvement by police officers in rapes,  killings and kidnappings. Rather than  prosecute these officers, they are often  transferred to different parts of the  country. Impunity remains a serious  problem.  Organized crime is thriving in Guatemala, and the government faces an uncertain future if it is perceived as powerless against these wealthy criminal  networks. In one day this year, 17 people were reportedly murdered in Guatemala City. Our Ambassador is reportedly confident  that organized crime  has not infiltrated the Berger administration, and President Berger deserves  credit for removing Attorney General  Carlos de Leon who was suspected of  corruption. But he also needs to crack  down on these violent gangs.  President Berger also deserves praise  for his support of the proposed Commission for the Investigation of Illegal  Armed Groups and Clandestine Security Organizations, CICIACS. His initial efforts ran into problems with the  judiciary and continue to face opposition in the Guatemalan Congress. But  the establishment of CICIACS would  assist in the consolidation of democracy as well as in combating clandestine groups.  Reports of intimidation, kidnappings,  and death threats remain all too frequent. In January and February of this  year alone, Amnesty International documented that 26 human rights activists  were threatened or attacked in Guatemala.

1041,177,2005-07-29,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to meet a  wonderful American, Donald Butler,  who served his country ably in Vietnam. His story is typical of so many  Americans who have placed their lives  and health at risk for their country.  Donald Butler was drafted 6 months  after graduating from Straughn High  School in Covington County, AL. After  completing  basic  training  and  advanced  infantry training, he  left  for  Vietnam on April 17, 1966.  Having trained as an infantryman, he  was slated to go with the Big Red One,  the  first division called to  fight  in  Vietnam, but at the last minute became a replacement for the 25th Infantry Division and later went with the  27th Infantry, Tropic Lightening, Charlie Company in CuChi, Vietnam.  CuChi, Vietnam, as the world later  learned, was home to the CuChi tunnel  complex—130 miles of underground passageways  started  during  the  war  against the French and expanded when  the Americans arrived. Built by night  over many years, the tunnels allowed  the Vietcong to become invisible to the  enemy, conceal snipers and move weapons silently. The G.I.’s that fought in  the  tunnels were  a  special  breed,  known  by  their  peers  as  ‘‘Tunnel  Rats.’’ They were  fearless warriors.  Donald Butler was one of them.  At a slight 100 pounds, Donald was  able to do what many of his fellow soldiers could not, squeeze through the  tight trap doors and crawl along the  narrow passages of the clay tunnels  with relative ease. Make no mistake,  while his size aided him in his mission,  it was his even temperament and inquisitive mind that made him a true  ‘‘Tunnel Rat’’. It was not uncommon  for him to crawl through narrow, pitch  black tunnels for hours looking for the  enemy.  Over a period of 9 months, Donald  went out on 37 operations, most of  which were search and destroy missions. He saw his fellow soldiers lose  their  limbs and,  in many  instances,  their lives. He lived through air strikes  and mortar attacks and somehow managed to return from the front lines of  Vietnam without ever sustaining a direct hit. For that, many would say he  was lucky.  Like so many of our veterans, Donald  Butler returned from the war to face  an uncertain future. ‘‘When I got off  the plane in Montgomery on April 18,  1967, I thought I was going to get shot  because we had heard of the protests  back in the U.S.’’ he later recalled. To  this day he suffers from post traumatic  stress and severe hearing loss. He is an  undecorated hero who should be applauded and thanked for his service and  I rise to do that today.∑  f  RECOGNIZING DELEGATE ALLEN  L. LOUDERBACK  ∑",2005
1042,177,2005-07-29,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased today to recognize one of Virginia’s most dedicated public servants,  Delegate Allen L. Louderback, who is  retiring after serving three terms in  the Virginia House of Delegates.  Delegate Louderback  has  been  a  strong advocate for lower taxes in Virginia, serving as the ranking majority  member of the House Finance Committee, and as the chairman of both  the House Subcommittee on Sales Tax  Exemptions and the Subcommittee on  Tax Preferences. From 2001 to 2003, he  also served on the Joint Subcommittee  to Reform Commonwealth Tax Structure.  In  addition, Delegate Louderback  served on the Agriculture, Chesapeake  and Natural Resources  Committee,  where he chaired the Chesapeake Subcommittee, and sat on the House Committee on Militia, Police and Public  Safety. In 2002, he was named Legislator of the Year for the 140-member  Virginia General Assembly  by  the  Family Foundation. And in 2003, Allen  was awarded the same honor by the  Commissioners  of Revenue Association. Delegate Louderback  is also a  member of the Commonwealth Competition Council, the State Procurement Commission, and the State Water  Commission, where he chairs the Karst  Subcommittee.  Prior to his small business entrepreneurship and public service in Luray,  VA, Allen worked in Washington, DC,  as an investigator and manager for the  U.S. General Accounting Office for 18  years. As a manager at GAO, he was  the recipient of the Director’s Award  for his ‘‘outstanding managerial skills’’  in 1979.  Delegate Louderback earned his B.S.  from Virginia Polytechnic  Institute  and State University. He  is a past  president of the Luray Rotary Club and  the Luray Kiwanis Club. His wife,  Nadia, and two sons attend Leaksville  United Church of Christ.  The 15th District, and indeed all of  Virginia, will surely miss the leadership and talents that Delegate Allen  Louderback displayed in the Virginia  General Assembly. I would like to recognize and thank Allen for his commitment to bettering the Commonwealth  of Virginia. I congratulate him on his  retirement and wish him many more  years of success and happiness.∑  f  RECOGNIZING MAYOR RALPH H.  DEAN  ∑",2005
1043,177,2005-07-29,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased  today  to  recognize Mayor  Ralph Dean of Luray, VA, as he celebrates  his  silver  anniversary  this  month as the town’s highest elected official. Since  1980, Mayor Dean has  worked to make the town of Luray a  better place to work and live, and I applaud him  for such dedicated public  service.  For 25 years, Mayor Dean has been a  successful advocate for lower taxes and  business growth in Luray. His policies  have helped to attract industry and investment, which have in turn created  more jobs for the local citizens. He has  also helped develop recreational opportunities for his town, such as Lake Arrowhead and Luray Recreational Park.  And, in 2004, Ralph oversaw the beautiful new renovation of Luray Town  Hall. The expansion and revitalization  of Luray under Mayor Dean’s leadership has helped the town become a  more prosperous and enjoyable place to  call home.  The mayor has also built a great  family with his wife Billie. They have a  daughter named Dixie Dean Foltz, and  a  grandson  named  Patrick  Foltz.  Mayor Dean is a member of the Luray  Christian Church. He has also been a  member of the Luray Lions Club for  over 30 years and a Boy Scout Leader  for over 20 years. Prior to his tenure as  mayor, Ralph  served on  the Luray  town council from 1974 until 1980.  Mayor Dean is an effective leader in  Luray  because he  genuinely  enjoys  what he does and cares about the citizens  of Luray.  I  congratulate  the  mayor on 25 years of dedication to public service in Luray, VA, and wish him  and his  family many more years of  happiness and success. Our Commonwealth is fortunate to have a man of  his character and  leadership  leading  the way in the town of Luray.∑  f  RECOGNIZING COL HENRY  MITNAUL  ∑",2005

1045,198,2005-07-29,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, today I  introduce  legislation  that will  safeguard and promote specialty crops and  value-added agriculture in Oregon and  in the United States. The great farmers  and ranchers of Oregon produce over  200 commodities. This bill intends to  improve  their marketing  opportunities, help Oregon  farmers and processors get better prices for their products, and help Oregon  farmers and  processors compete in an increasingly  global market. As it will help Oregon  farmers so it will help specialty crop  farmers  from New York to Florida,  Wisconsin to California.  I introduce this bill as my colleague  from Oregon, Congresswoman HOOLEY,  introduces the same bill in the House  of Representatives.  In  the  increasingly  technological  world of microchips, products like potato chips and other agricultural commodities still remain a large part of  Oregon’s economy. In fact, agriculture  is Oregon’s second largest traded sector  and Oregon’s second largest export, behind the electronics industry. Oregon  agriculture creates more than $8 billion of direct and indirect economic activity, in both urban and rural areas in  the state.  At the center of this bill is the expansion of a specialty crop grant program, authorized by Congress in 2001,  of which Oregon producers have already made use. Oregon received about  $3.2 million that was used for over 50  projects  involving  product  development, marketing, research, and export  promotion. The Oregon Department of  Agriculture estimates that over 3000  producers  benefited  from  these  projects. They also estimate that enhanced  sales  resulting  from  these  projects reached $20 million—about six  times what was invested.  The problem with this pilot program  was  the grants were only available  once. Last year Congress passed legislation that reinstated these specialty  crop grants but at funding level that  would provide only around $500,000 to  Oregon. This legislation raises the authorized  level  to  $500 million  and  makes the grant program permanent.  Under this expansion Oregon has the  potential to receive $5 million a year in  specialty crop grants.  The bill I am introducing today also  improves USDA’s value added grant  program. Right now this program is  run by bureaucrats in Washington, DC  who have probably never been to Oregon and probably couldn’t name the  top Oregon specialty crops. My office  has heard numerous complaints that  this program is unwieldy, bureaucratic,  and difficult to navigate. Last year  every applicant from Oregon was disqualified on a technicality. This bill  would make one simple but very important change: instead of having the  Federal Government  distribute  the  money, each State would get a share of  the money to hand out to their chosen  priorities.  Between these two grant programs  each State in the union should have  plenty of money to implement agricultural promotion strategies that match  the needs of  its  individual growers,  processors, and citizens.  This bill also authorizes  funds  for  farmers and processors to become ‘‘certified.’’ Certification comes  in many  forms  like  ‘‘Good Agricultural Practices,’’ ‘‘Good Handling Practices,’’ or  ‘‘Organic.’’ Often getting certified  is  necessary before farmers or processors  can effectively market products whether in local grocery stores or to foreign  countries.  Certified  products  often  fetch premium prices. To encourage  farmers to get these certifications and  increase their market share this legislation would have the USDA reimburse  half the cost of the certifications.  Last, this legislation improves opportunities for specialty crop farmers to  get crop insurance, increase loan availability, provide additional funding for  export promotion, and make sure that  American trade policy takes specialty  crops into account.  I know that Oregonians doing a great  job growing some of the best quality  crops in the world. There are a lot of  challenges  facing  agriculture:  cheap  imports,  low commodity prices, taxation, labor, and dozens of others. This  bill won’t solve everything, but I think  it will make an important contribution  to  improving Oregon agriculture by  making it more competitive on a global level and helping farmers get a decent price  for what they produce. I  look forward to working with my colleagues to assure the enactment of this  legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 1556  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

1046,205,2005-07-29,Mr.  SARBANES.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation to  facilitate the orderly disposition of an  800 acre parcel of Federal property located in Laurel, Maryland, a portion of  which is currently used by the District  of Columbia as the Oak Hills Juvenile  Detention  and Commitment Center.  The legislation is a companion to a  measure which has been introduced in  the House by Representative BENJAMIN  CARDIN.  The Oak Hill Youth Center, located  adjacent  to  the National  Security  Agency and the Baltimore-Washington  parkway, is a detention facility for juvenile offenders from the District of  Columbia between the ages of 12 and 21.  It has been plagued by  facility and  management problems for many years.  The buildings at the center are in deplorable condition and  fail  to meet  health  and  safety  standards. Overcrowding, mismanagement,  escapes,  drug use and abuse of detainees at the  center have been the subject of numerous  investigations, press reports and  lawsuits over the years, and are of  great concern to juvenile justice advocates, families of detainees and local  residents, alike. Nearly two decades  ago, a consent decree stemming from  the lawsuit Jerry M. v. District of Columbia, required the District to make  improvements at the facility and address the chronic neglect of its adolescent detainees. Since the decree, ‘‘sixty  judicial orders, 44 monitoring reports  and almost $3 million in court imposed  fines’’ have been issued in connection  with the District’s Youth Services Administration  failure to  fully comply  with the decree, according to a July  2001 article  in the Washington Post.  Last year a report issued by the District’s Inspector General’s office found  that, ‘‘many of the same types of problems that resulted in the 1986 Jerry M.  lawsuit still exist today . . .’’ The report  documented numerous  security  problems, health issues, deficiencies in  management,  failures  to  effectively  maintain the safety of female youth  housed at the center, and drugs being  smuggled into the facility on a continual basis.  There is a consensus that the Oak  Hill Youth Center should be shutdown.  A Blue Ribbon Commission on Youth  Safety and Juvenile Justice Reform,  established by Mayor Williams in August 2000, recommended in its final 2001  report that the Oak Hill Juvenile Detention center be closed and demolished. The Justice for DC Youth coalition, whose members include parents  and juvenile justice advocates, has adamantly supported closing the existing  Oak Hill facility and replacing it with  a smaller, more homelike facility that  is closer to the youth’s homes.  This measure seeks to ensure the closure of the facility and the orderly disposition of the property, while addressing  the  concerns  of Anne Arundel  County, the NSA, the District of Columbia and all surrounding neighborhoods and  residences. Above all,  it  would serve the youth currently being  held at the facility by helping to place  them in an environment that is more  suitable for successful rehabilitation. I  hope this measure can be acted upon  quickly by the Congress and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 1564  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. DISPOSITION OF OAK HILL PROPERTY.  (a) INGENERAL.—The Oak Hill property  shall be disposed of as follows:  (1) The portion of the property which is located west  of  the Baltimore-Washington  Parkway shall be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Director of the National Park  Service, who shall use such portion for parkland purposes.  (2) Subject to subsection (b), the portion of  the property which is located east of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and 200 feet and  further north of the Patuxent River shall be  transferred to the Secretary of the Army  (acting through the Chief of Engineers) for  use by the Director of the National Security  Agency, who may lease such portion to the  District of Columbia.  (3) The portion of the property which is located  east  of  the Baltimore-Washington  Parkway and south of the portion described  in paragraph (2) shall be transferred to the  jurisdiction of the Administrator of General  Services, who shall in turn convey such portion to Anne Arundel County, Maryland, in  accordance with subsection (c).

(c) CONVEYANCEOFPORTIONOFPROPERTY  TOANNEARUNDELCOUNTY.—  OF AND CONVEYCONDITIONS (1)  IN GENERAL.—The Administrator  of  General Services shall convey, without consideration, to Anne Arundel County, Maryland, all right, title, and  interest of the  United States in and to that portion of the  Oak Hill property referred to in subsection  (a)(3).  (2) TERMS ANCE.—The conveyance under paragraph (1)  shall be carried out under such terms and  conditions as may be agreed to by the Administrator and Anne Arundel County, except that, as a condition of the conveyance—  (A) Anne Arundel County shall agree to  dedicate a portion of the property which is  adjacent to the Patuxent River to parkland  and recreational use; and  (B) Anne Arundel County shall agree to reimburse the National Security Agency for  the amounts paid by the Agency under subsection (b) for the construction of a new juvenile detention facility for the District of  Columbia, but only if the County makes 25  percent or more of the property conveyed  under this subsection available for purposes  other than open space or recreational use.  SEC. 2. OAK HILL PROPERTY DEFINED.

1047,219,2005-07-29,Ms. CANTWELL.," Mr. President, I am  proud to rise today with my colleagues  Senators BINGAMAN, ROCKEFELLER, LINCOLN, MURRAY and CORZINE to introduce the ‘‘Affordable Access to Medicare Providers Act.’’  Securing  access  to  affordable  healthcare, especially for our Nation’s  seniors, is critical and it remains to be  one of my top priorities. Access to  healthcare is impacted by two key factors: we must have enough well qualified healthcare providers that are willing and able to accept Medicare patients, and the beneficiaries must be  able to afford the premiums required to  utilize their Medicare benefits. This  bill addresses both of these issues—it  will provide some stability in physician Medicare payment rates so that  physicians can continue to offer high  quality healthcare services while ensuring that the Medicare beneficiaries  are not saddled with the cost and even  higher premiums for physicians services.  Medicare was written to cover the  most basic health care  for  seniors.  When the original bill passed in 1965,  the legislation’s conference report explicitly stated that the intent of the  program is to provide adequate ‘‘medical aid  . . .  for needy people, and  should ‘‘make the best of modem medicine more  readily available  to  the  aged.’’  While  the Medicare Modernization  Act provided some improvements such  as: It also had some unfortunate consequences  on  the Medicare  beneficiaries  in Washington State. Medicare payments per beneficiary will be  further exacerbated and continue to penalize Washington state for our efficient healthcare  system. Fifty-seven  percent of Washington state physicians  are limiting or dropping Medicare patients from their practices. Washington  falling to 45th in the Nation on reimbursements will not help the situation.  A survey conducted by the Medicare  Payment Advisory Council, MedPAC,  found that 22 percent of patients already have some problems  finding a  primary care physician and 27 percent  report delays getting an appointment.  Physicians are the foundation of our  Nation’s health care system. Continual  cuts, or even the threat of repeated  cuts, put Medicare patient access to  physicians’ services at risk. They also  threaten to destabilize the Medicare  program and  create a  ripple  effect  across other programs. Indeed, Medicare cuts jeopardize access to medical  care  for millions of our active duty  military family members and military  retirees because their TRICARE insurance ties its payment rates to Medicare.  Now we are told by the Medicare  board of Trustees that if Congress does  not act by the end of the year, the  Medicare physician payment  formula  will likely produce a 4.3 percent decrease next year with similar reductions to follow in the years to come.  The Medicare Board of Trustees also  estimates that the cost of providing  medical care will increase by an estimated 15 percent over the next six  years, while  current  reimbursement  levels are scheduled to drop by an estimated 26 percent over the same time  period.  After adjusting for inflation, Medicare payments to physicians  in 2013  will be less than half of what they were  in 1991. That declining reimbursement  rate would likely mean a growing percentage of family physicians would decline to see new Medicare patients and,  as a result, access to care would suffer.  Washington stands to lose $39 million  in 2006 and 1.9 billion from 2006–2014 if  these cuts go through. For physicians  in Washington, the cuts over this period will average $13,000 per year for  each physician in the State.  The American Medical Association  conducted a survey of physicians  in  February and March 2005 concerning  significant Medicare pay cuts from 2006  through 2013 (as forecast in the 2004  Medicare  Trustees  report).  Results  from the survey indicate that if the  projected cuts in Medicare physician  payment rates begin in 2006: more than  a third of physicians (38 percent) plan  to decrease the number of new Medicare patients they accept; more than  half of physicians (54 percent) plan to  defer the purchase of information technology, which  is necessary to make  value-based purchasing work; a majority of physicians (53 percent) will be  less likely to participate in a Medicare  Advantage plan; about a quarter of  physicians plan to close satellite offices  (24 percent) and/or discontinue  rural outreach services (29 percent) if  payments are cut in 2006. If the pay  cuts continue through 2013, close to  half of physicians plan to close satellite offices  (42 percent) and/or discontinue rural outreach (44 percent);  and one-third of physicians (34 percent)  plan to discontinue nursing home visits  if payments are cut in 2006. By the  time the cuts end, half (50 percent) of  physicians will have discontinued nursing home visits.  Physicians can  simply not absorb  cuts these cuts and still deliver high  quality care. We must ensure our doctors have the resources they need to  ensure that our seniors have access to  their physicians.  There have been efforts made to address the physician payment issue however; they have not addressed the impact  on Medicare  beneficiaries  and  their premiums. I’m concerned some of  the proposals would result in an additional  burden  being  placed  on  the  Medicare beneficiary by way of a $24  billion increase in part B premiums in  2006 and a $60 billion increase in 2007.  This happens because by  law, the  monthly Part B premium is set at 25  percent of the part B Trust Fund costs.  Administrative or legal changes to increase physician payment rates that  don’t include a hold-harmless clause,  increase Medicare part B expenditures  and ultimately, the Part B premiums  paid by beneficiaries.  This is not a viable solution either as  the beneficiaries are already being hit  with premium increases and additional  cost sharing due to implementation of  the prescription drug benefit. For this  reason, along with my colleagues,  I  have chosen to  introduce  legislation  that provides the update for physician  reimbursement rates but also holds the  part B premiums harmless.  I look forward to working my colleagues to pass this legislation to ensure that access to care for our seniors  is preserved and enhanced.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 1574  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

1048,233,2005-07-29,Mr.  BINGAMAN.,"  Mr.  President,  today with Senators DOMENICI, MURRAY, JEFFORDS, ALEXANDER, CANTWELL,  AKAKA, REED, CHAFEE, LEAHY, DODD,  and DAYTONwe introduce legislation  entitled the ‘‘Children’s Health Equity  Act of 2005.’’  This legislation would extend provisions  that were  included  in Public  Laws #108–74 and 108–127 that amended  the State Children’s Health Insurance  Program, or SCHIP,  to permit  the  states of Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New  Mexico,  Rhode  Island,  Tennessee,  Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin  to apply some of their enhanced SCHIP  matching funds toward the coverage of  certain children enrolling in Medicaid  that were part of expansions of coverage to children through Medicaid in  those 11 states prior to the enactment  of SCHIP.  As a article in the September/October  2004 issue of Health Affairs by Genevieve Kenney and Debbie Chang points  out, when SCHIP was created, ‘‘Inequities were . . . introduced across states  because  those  that had already expanded Medicaid coverage to children  could not receive the higher SCHIP  matching rate for these children . . .  [and this] meant that states that had  been ahead of the curve in expanding  Medicaid eligibility for children were  penalized financially relative to states  that expanded coverage after SCHIP.’’  The article adds  that  ‘‘additional  cross-state inequities were introduced’’  during the creation of SCHIP because  three states had their prior expansions  grandfathered in during the bill’s consideration. Left behind were the aforementioned 11 states.  Fortunately, with  the  passage  of  Public Laws #108–74 and 108–127 in 2003,  the inequity was recognized and the 11  states, including New Mexico, were allowed to use up to 20 percent of our  State’s enhanced SCHIP allotments to  pay  for Medicaid  eligible  children  above 150 percent of poverty that were  part of Medicaid expansions prior to  the enactment of SCHIP. As the Congressional  Research  Service  notes,  ‘‘The primary purpose of the 20 percent  allowance was  to  enable  qualifying  states to receive the enhanced FMAP  [Federal Medical Assistance Percentage]  for certain children who  likely  would have been covered under SCHIP  had the state not expanded their regular Medicaid coverage before SCHIP’s  enactment in August 1997.’’  Unfortunately, one major problem  with the compromise was that it only  allowed the 11 states flexibility with  their SCHIP funds for allotments between 1998 and 2001 and not in the future. Therefore, the inequity continues  with SCHIP allotments from 2002 and  on.  In  fact, with  the expiration of  SCHIP funds from FY 1998–2000 as of  September  2004,  that  leaves  the  11  states with only the ability to spend  FY 2001 SCHIP allotments on expansion children. For those states, such as  Vermont and Rhode Island, that have  already spent their 2001 SCHIP allotments, they no longer benefit from the  passage of this provision. Furthermore,  the FY 2001 funds will also expire at  the end of September 2005. Thus, under  current law, no spending under these  provisions will be permitted in fiscal  year 2006 or thereafter.  Therefore, our legislation today prevents the full expiration of this provision for our 11 states and ensures that  the compromise language is extended  in the future. It is important to states  such as New Mexico that have been severely penalized for having expanded  coverage to children through Medicaid  prior to the enactment of SCHIP. In  fact, due to the SCHIP inequity, New  Mexico has been allocated $266 million  from SCHIP between fiscal years 1998  and 2002, and yet, has only been able to  spend slightly over $26 million as of the  end of last fiscal year. In other words,  New Mexico has been allowed to spend  less  than  10 percent of  its  federal  SCHIP allocations because the expansion children have been previously ineligible  for  the  enhanced  SCHIP  matching funds.  As the health policy statement by  the National Governors’ Association  reads, ‘‘The Governors believe that it is  critical that innovative states not be  penalized for having expanded coverage  to children before the enactment of S–  CHIP, which provides enhanced funding  to meet these goals. To this end, the  Governors support providing additional  funding flexibility to states that had  already  significantly  expanded  coverage  to  the majority of uninsured  children in their states.’’  It is important to note the bill does  not  take money  from other  states’  CHIP allotments. It simply allows our  states  to  spend our States’  specific  CHIP allotments from the federal government on our uninsured children—  just as other states across the country  are doing.  According to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service, thus far  eight states have benefited financially  from the passage of the legislation. In  the fourth quarter of 2003 and for all  four quarters in 2004, Hawaii reported  federal SCHIP expenditures using the  20 percent allowance in the amount of  $380,000, Maryland  received  $106,000,  New Hampshire received $2.1 million,  New Mexico  received  $2.3 million,  Rhode  Island  received  $485,000, Tennessee received $4.5 million, Vermont  received $475,000, and Washington received $22.2 million.  I urge that this very important provision for our states be included in the  budget reconciliation package the Congress is preparing to consider in September and ask unanimous  consent  that the text of the bill be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 1587  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Children’s  Health Equity Technical Amendment Act of  2005’’.  SEC. 2.

1050,247,2005-07-29,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to discuss a bill, the Small Business Lending Improvement Act of 2005,  which I have introduced today to provide small businesses with easier access to loans and to increase efficiency  in the Small Business Administration’s  largest loan program, the 7(a) program,  which provided $12.7 billion in small  business loans in 2004.  As Chair of the Senate Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I  am committed to supporting our Nation’s Main Street small business community by increasing its access to capital. This  legislation will  reform a  cumbersome  SBA  lender  licensing  process that does not provide our small  businesses with  the most  efficient  means of accessing the capital they  must have to start and sustain their  firms. The bill would allow the SBA’s  7(a) loan program to better capitalize  on the demonstrated potential small  business have to create jobs and economic growth.  As our Nation continues to prosper  from economic growth, low inflation,  and low unemployment, we should not  forget the critical role played by our  small businesses. Without strong and  successful small businesses, our prosperity would not be what it is today.  Under current law, the most prolific  lenders in the SBA’s 7(a) loan program  can participate in the ‘‘Preferred Lender Program’’ (PLP Program), which allows them to use their own processing  facilities and therefore both increases  lenders’ efficiency and reduces costs  for the SBA. However, PLP lenders are  required to apply for PLP status in  each of the 71 SBA districts nationwide  to obtain PLP status in that district,  and they must re-apply each year in  each district. This is extremely inefficient and wasteful, and creates enormous  unnecessary  administrative  costs.  Section 2 of this bill would allow  qualifying lenders to participate in the  PLP Program on a nationwide basis  after just one licensing process. This  provision was  in S. 1375, the Small  Business Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003, which  I introduced in 2003 and which the Senate  approved  unanimously  in  September 2003.  This provision would drastically reduce administrative costs and would  standardize the operation of the PLP  program. A National Preferred Lenders  Program would eliminate the  inefficiencies and cost of applying for PLP  status in each district, and would increase the ease with which loans are  made to small businesses, thereby improving small businesses’ access to capital. Competition among  lenders  for  small business  customers would  increase,  increasing  financing  alternatives and lowering costs for small  businesses.  In addition to simplifying licensing  processes for both lenders and the SBA,  the bill would allow the SBA’s lender  oversight to be done more efficiently  and effectively, on a national basis.  The current process of having to renew  licenses in each district is extremely  time-consuming and administratively  burdensome  for the  lenders and the  SBA. A National Preferred Lenders  Program could remedy the inefficiencies and cost of applying for PLP status in each district and save a tremendous amount of taxpayer dollars.  Section 3 of the act  increases the  maximum size of a 7(a) loan to $3 million, from the current $2 million, and  increase the maximum size of a 7(a)  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:48 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00201 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S29JY5.REC S29JY5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005
1051,261,2005-07-29,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, I want  to take time to comment on the resolution I am introducing today which designates the month of November 2005 as  the ‘‘Month of Global Health.’’  Today we live in a global community  where all nations both benefit  from  those countries that prosper, and suffer  with those that do not. The Month of  Global Health is a great opportunity to  increase  awareness  of  the  pressing  global health crisis that threatens our  own public health and that of all nations around the world.  I believe this resolution is important  and draws attention to the needs of a  growing population of children in the  developing world that are living without proper health care and the essential nutrients they need to survive. The  resolution  also  highlights  the  necessary steps that must be taken to increase child survival rates  in developing countries.  Child survival is one of the key elements to addressing global health. As a  nation, there is much more we can do  to assist developing nations in their effort to increase child survival rates. We  must work on a global scale to avert  the millions  of unnecessary  deaths  among children caused each year from  preventable diseases.  This resolution reaffirms our commitment to the children of the world  and sends a message that child survival  is a fundamental component in our efforts to improve global health.  ",2005

1066,282,2005-07-29,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, I intend  to be very brief. Tonight the Senate is  passing the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act by unanimous consent. It is  certainly not often that such a procedure would be used for a statute of  such extraordinary importance. I believe that it is possible to fight terrorism ferociously without sacrificing  civil liberties. Tonight I remain concerned that there will be an effort in  the conference between the House and  the Senate  to  authorize what  are  known as administrative subpoenas for  the FBI under the law. These administrative subpoenas are warrants that  FBI field offices can write themselves  without having to make an application  to a judge.  Under an administrative subpoena,  an FBI field office could get records secretly  for  just about anything  from  just about anybody. Here is an example  of how intrusive these administrative  subpoenas could be. There are 56 field  offices, one in almost every major city.  The head of a field office could issue an  administrative subpoena to a hospital  director and ask  for all of the hospital’s medical  records  simply  by  claiming they were relevant to an investigation, the hospital director was  busy or didn’t have the resources to  make a challenge. No judge would ever  see the subpoena. The patients would  not know their records had been seized.  They would be totally  in the dark.  Your mother’s, your husband’s, your  own medical records could move into  the Government’s  hands,  and  you  would be none the wiser.  Despite the very aggressive efforts in  the Senate to include this power to  conduct these what I believe are fishing expeditions, it is not in the version  of  the PATRIOT Act  that  is being  passed tonight, since it is not in the  House bill either. My view  is  that  under rule XXVIII, it would be outside  the scope of the conference to include  these administrative subpoenas in any  form in the PATRIOT Act. If I am informed  later that  it  is  in the conference report  in some  form,  I will  make a point of order at that time and  the conference report would fall.  Finally, I want to state that I commend our  leader, Senator REID and  Senator LEAHY, for their handling of  this. I know Senator DURBINhas been  very involved in these issues for years  as well. I also want to commend Chairman SPECTERwho has talked with me  about the PATRIOT Act on a number  of occasions. We can strike a balance.  We can ensure that we pull out all the  stops to fight the terrorists without  throwing our civil  liberties  into the  ash can. If these administrative subpoenas show up in that conference report, that will skew the balance that is  so important to make sure we can win  the war on terrorism but also to protect the rights that we have brave men  and women fighting for.  I yield the floor.  ",2005
1067,282,2005-07-29,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, last week,  after negotiations that went late into  the night and early morning, the Judiciary  Committee  unanimously  approved S.  1389,  a  bipartisan,  compromise bill to build on the PATRIOT  Act.  This bill, entitled the USA PATRIOT  Improvement and Reauthorization Act  of 2005, is not perfect. Like all compromises,  it  includes provisions that  are not supported by everyone in this  body. However, Democratic and Republican members of the Judiciary Committee came together in a spirit of cooperation and compromise to agree on  this bill, and I strongly support it.  I am very pleased that we have also  been able  to bring Republicans and  Democrats together in the full Senate  to pass this bill by unanimous consent.  Given the divisions we have seen over  this legislation in the years since it  was passed, I believe it is very important for our Nation and for the American people that we have been able to  compromise and to come together in a  spirit of bipartisanship to pass this legislation unanimously.  This bill preserves the vital tools the  Government needs to protect our national security. At the same time, it  puts in place some important checks  on the expanded authorities granted  the government by the original PATRIOT Act.  Although Members of both parties  may feel there are additional improvements that can be made to this bill,  Senate Democrats have agreed to join  our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle to take up and pass the compromise  legislation  approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee  with no amendments in order.  The President and other officials in  his  administration  have  repeatedly  called upon Congress to renew the PATRIOT Act as quickly as possible. Senate Democrats agree with the President that we should reauthorize the  PATRIOT Act and do so quickly.

1079,310,2005-07-29,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I know the  hour is late. I will be as quick as possible on this very important issue.  Four months ago the Senate Finance  Committee reported S. 667, the Personal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone Act, known as  the PRIDE Act. This would reauthorize  temporary assistance for needy families, which was due for reauthorization  in 2002. It is a bipartisan bill and received virtually unanimous support in  the  committee,  a  compromise  that  demonstrates how things can work.  The PRIDE Act contains increased  funding to help parents cover the costs  of childcare, among other things, so  that they can join the workforce. It  contains critical transitional medical  assistance so that parents who work do  not immediately lose their health care  benefits in the transition to work. In  short, it will help tens of thousands of  Americans who are simply trying to do  the right thing by their families and  their communities.  That is why our Governors and State  legislatures, both Democrats and Republicans, have asked that we reauthorize  the  program  and  pass  the  PRIDE Act at  the earliest possible  date.  Unfortunately,  instead  of  helping  working families and listening to our  Governors and legislatures by immediately taking up this important bipartisan  legislation, Republicans  have  spent months  fighting among themselves, delaying  its consideration. In  the meantime, these working families  that I have described  in our States  have had  to  live with uncertainty  about whether this program will continue and, if so, in what form and at  what cost.  While we have been forced to wait  several months  for  the majority  to  work out their  intraparty squabbles,  Congress has had to pass a series of  stop-gap extensions to keep the program going. Just before the last recess  we passed what was the tenth extension of this program. However, that extension will expire at the end of September if we do not act on permanent  legislation before then.  Even more threatening, some of our  Republican colleagues are interested in  including  TANF  in  reconciliation,  which will mean serious cuts, not increases, in many of the important programs contained in the bipartisan legislation reported by the Finance Committee.  I  commend Senators BAUCUS and  GRASSLEY, the chairman and ranking  member of that committee, for their  efforts in behalf of this legislation and  the American people. The chairman  and ranking member of the Finance  Committee have been working together  for months in an effort to bring the  committee-reported bill to the floor,  but we must consider  this measure  soon. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that no later than the close of  business on September 9, the Senate  begin consideration of Calendar No. 60,  S. 667, the PRIDE Act, and that all  amendments be relevant to the subject  matter of the bill without the need for  textual reference; and that the bill be  completed before the Senate considers  any reconciliation bill.

It is a bipartisan bill. I do, too, want to thank  the chairman and the ranking member,  Senators GRASSLEY and BAUCUS,  for  their diligent work, their hard work in  bringing this bill forward.

I have  enjoyed it. We have differences every  day about what Members want to do in  this body. We have tried, and I think  we have accomplished civility. I have  never to my knowledge raised my voice  to  the majority  leader, nor has he  raised his voice to me. We have distinct  differences on occasion, but we have  been able to work through those.  I  hope our ability to work together, in  spite of the differences of the two political parties, has been good  for  the  country.  We have spent time talking about  what we need to do and how we are  going  to accomplish  that. We have  sometimes even disagreements on that.  But the disagreements are not in any  way unpleasant.  On behalf of the Democratic Senators, I express my appreciation  for  your always being able and willing to  respond to my phone calls quickly. Mr.  President, I say through you to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, he  is always a gentleman, for which I am  very grateful.  ",2005

The American people, as the Democratic leader suggested, expect us to  govern in a way working together with  civility, and  I  think we have demonstrated that on some very tough and  contentious issues. I look forward, as  we enter into the post-recess session,  to continuing that bipartisan civil spirit as we address, again, some very challenging issues.  f  LOOKING AHEAD: ISSUES BEFORE  THE SENATE  ",2005
1088,310,2005-07-29,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, in the last  few minutes here, I do want to look  back very briefly and look ahead and  foreshadow some of the issues we will  be looking at. Before we leave for this  August recess, I would like to look at  and review very quickly some of the  big, important issues we will be tackling this fall.  First and foremost, we will focus on  one of the most significant and historic  constitutional  responsibilities,  and  that is, as we all know, to provide advice and consent on the President’s Supreme Court nomination. Our goal, as  spelled out a little bit earlier is to have  a fair debate and a dignified debate on  Judge Roberts, and to confirm him before the Supreme Court begins its new  term on October 3.

Dr. Showers has been an outstanding educator  in North Alabama. Throughout his career, Dr. Showers has held many diverse positions. He has been an elementary technology  teacher, a middle school earth science teacher, a middle school industrial teacher, a vocational education  teacher, an adult education  teacher, and an adult education coordinator.  Additionally Mr. Speaker, Dr. Showers has  proudly served  the Huntsville community as  the District One City Council Member since  October of 1988. In fact, he was the first African-American to be elected to the City Council  since 1907. As a council member, Dr. Showers sponsored the first smoking ordinance in  the city, he was successful in locating an industrial park in North Huntsville, and he supported efforts in naming the Northern bypass  in honor of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Showers has had a  tremendous effect on our community as a teacher and City Council member and I would like  thank him for his lifelong commitment to inspiring our community’s children and his encouragement of adults to continue their education.  I rise  today  to  join his  fellow  teachers, students,  family members, and  friends  in celebrating his distinguished career and  to congratulate him upon his retirement.  f  IN HONOR OF CAPTAIN SANDRA L.

1091,317,2005-07-29,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor and wish well  in  retirement Captain  Sandra L. DeGroot of Lemoore, California.  Captain DeGroot has diligently served her  country for the past thirty years.  In  September  1975  Sandra  joined  the  United States Navy as a Nurse Corps Candidate and was commissioned an Ensign.  It  was  there  that Captain DeGroot committed  herself to ensuring proper care and recovery  for the women and men who place themselves  in harm’s way in the effort to protect our freedom.  She graduated from Keuka College with a  Bachelor of Science Degree  in Nursing  in  1976 and  reported  for Officer  Indoctrination  School in Newport, Rhode Island. Upon completion of her Officer training, Sandra began  her career at the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida in the Intensive Care unit.  Captain DeGroot’s profession brought her to  a variety of places. She was assigned  to  Naval Hospital Pensacola, Florida  as  the  charge nurse of  the medicine ward. Shortly  thereafter Sandra became head nurse of the  Pediatric Clinic at Naval Hospital, Guam and  after a brief return to Florida, she joined the  ranks  in California at Naval Hospital San  Diego. At San Diego Captain DeGroot  filled  many roles; she served as the staff nurse on  Labor and Delivery, Division Officer OB/GYN  clinics and Perinatal Clinical Nurse Specialist.  Ever  the avid  learner, Sandra  transferred  to  Utah where she completed her Master of  Science Degree  in Nursing, with a major  in  Nurse-Midwifery. Her dedication to work and  school brought great  rewards and  in 1996  Captain DeGroot reported  to Naval Hospital  Jacksonville where she was  the Navy’s  first  Director of Women’s Health Services. A few  years  later Sandra was assigned  to U.S.  Naval Hospital Keflavik, Iceland before returning to California at Naval Hospital Lemoore as  the Commanding Officer.  On  top of her successful career Captain  DeGroot has also made time for membership  in various organizations. The American College of Nurse Midwives, the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, the American Holistic Nurses Association and the Association  of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal  Nurses are just some of the organizations with  which she is involved. Her hard work has not  gone unnoticed because Captain DeGroot has  received  the Meritorious Service Medal with  Gold Star, Navy Commendation Medal with  Gold Star, Navy Achievement Medal, National  Defense Service Medal with Bronze Star and  the Overseas Service Ribbon.  For us, her  retirement  is bittersweet—although it is well deserved Captain DeGroot’s  efforts will be greatly missed.  I congratulate  Captain Sandra L. DeGroot, and wish her and  her family all the best.  f  HONORING MR. GARY NEALE  HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005

1093,324,2005-07-29,Mr. RYUN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today in support of H.R. 525, which would authorize small businesses around the country to  establish Association Health Plans. An estimated 45 million people are uninsured in the  United States, and  the number has grown  since 1989. Eighty-five percent of these people are in working families where the price of  premiums have increased so much that they  cannot afford the coverage that will give them  peace of mind.  The majority of Americans receive health insurance coverage through their employers, but  with rising health care costs, many small businesses can no longer afford to provide coverage  for  their employees. H.R. 525 would  remedy this by allowing small businesses to  band together to garner greater buying power  when bargaining with health care providers.  Let’s give Americans access to more affordable  health  care  and  support Association  Health Plans.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE MOUNT  CLEMENS ROTARY  HON. SANDER M. LEVIN  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005
1094,324,2005-07-29,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Mount Clemens Rotary as they plan a  unique local celebration of the 100th anniversary of Rotary International.  The Mount Clemens Rotary Club, organized  in 1920, is the oldest and largest service club  in Macomb County. The Mount Clemens Rotary and many individual rotarians have been  at the forefront of activity in their community.  A few of the many projects over the years include: assistance through the Cripple Children  Society and the Boy Scouts; providing aid to  the Clinton River Flood victims; working in the  Relief Store during  the Great Depression;  leading  the Urban Renewal Program  in  the  1950s and 60s; and helping to establish both  Rotary Park in Downtown Mount Clemens and  the Playscape on the old Wilson School property.  To commemorate the 100th anniversary of  Rotary International, the Mt. Clemens Rotary  is preserving a bit of history in downtown Mt.  Clemens.  Two  cannons,  donated  by  the  United States Government in 1901, were originally in front of the old Macomb County Court  Building. The cannons were placed on pedestals and remained there until 1942 when at  the request of the U.S. Government they were  donated as part of  the World War  II scrap  metal effort.  For sometime the Macomb County Historical  Commission has wanted to replace the missing cannons, but the cost was always a major  hurdle. Members of the Mount Clemens Rotary Club decided  this worthy project could  both commemorate local history and the history of Rotary.  The two cannons are accurate representations of a cannon used by General Alexander  Macomb in 1812 and a cannon used by Colonel Stockton in the Civil War. General Alexander Macomb was the hero of the battle of  Plattsburg and Lake Champlain during  the  War of 1812. General Macomb with only 3,000  troops was able to rout 13,000 British troops.  The other cannon was dedicated to the memory of  the Michigan Eight Calvary Regiment  and their commander, Colonel John Stockton.  The Regiment along with the Battery M of the  1st Michigan Artillery was  organized  and  trained at Camp Stockton in Mount Clemens  from the Fall of 1862 to May 1863.  Mr. Speaker,  on August  27,  2005,  the  Mount Clemens Rotary, working with  the  Macomb County Historical Society, will replace  and rededicate  the  two cannons at a grand  ceremony during the Bath City Festival. I look  forward to joining with them, and ask my Congressional colleagues to join me in saluting a  major community asset,  the Mount Clemens  Rotary, on  this  important and historic occasion.  f  A PROCLAMATION HONORING EVA  J.

TAMMY BALDWIN  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 27, 2005  ",2005
1096,324,2005-07-29,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday  I  voted against the Dominican Republic-Central  America Free Trade Agreement. As negotiated  by the Bush Administration, it fails the fundamental tests that our trade agreements should  meet.  First, our trade agreements must be structured to raise labor standards, not put downward pressures on the rights and protections  of American workers. All workers—in the U.S.,  the Dominican Republic and Central America—deserve fair wages, safe workplaces, and  reasonable working conditions.  Second, all citizens—in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and Central America—deserve  clean air and clean water. Polluting factories  that poison our environment should not be located in San Salvador or San Jose, any more  than they should be in Baraboo or Beloit, or  Waunakee or Wisconsin Dells.  The United States should be a leader in the  world in raising standards for everyone. DR–  CAFTA was an opportunity to enshrine these  fundamental  protections  in  a model  trade  agreement that could have served as a template  for  raising working standards, wages,  safety and environmental protections around  the world. Instead, it is an opportunity squandered.  Unfortunately, even more  than an opportunity squandered,  it  threatens  to undermine  those very protections that American workers  and their families have every right to expect.  We need a truly fair trade deal. DR–CAFTA  isn’t fair, and it isn’t a deal.  f  RECOGNIZING  MICHAEL  ‘‘MIKE’’  WALKER OF LOWER LAKE, CALIFORNIA  HON. MIKE THOMPSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005
1097,324,2005-07-29,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to recognize California Highway  patrolman, Michael  ‘‘Mike’’ Walker of Lower  Lake, California as he retires from 33 years of  public service.  Born in Vallejo, California, and raised nearby in Benicia, Mike learned at an early age the  importance of public service and the necessity  of helping others. Compelled  to serve our  country, he enlisted  in  the Marine Corps  in  1972. He served as an instructor teaching jungle survival  techniques overseas. His hard  work and commitment were duly noted as he  earned four promotions during his three years  in the United States Marine Corps.  In 1975, Mike joined the Benicia Police Department as a reserve officer. One year later,  he transferred to the Alameda County Sheriff’s  Department where he served as Deputy Sheriff. Three years later, in 1978, he joined the  California Highway Patrol and went  through  the academy in Sacramento. Upon graduation  Officer Walker was assigned to the Glendale  law enforcement team. In 1980 he transferred  to Newhall and in 1984 to Clear Lake where  he has spent the past 21 years serving the  citizens of Lake County.  Officer Walker served as an instructor, training and arming his  fellow officers with  the  proper  knowledge  and  skills  needed  for  fieldwork, including physical methods of arrest  and advanced accident investigation.  Officer Walker  is a kindhearted man, who  has selflessly devoted his life to helping others. He is revered throughout Lake County as  someone always willing to lend a hand wherever it is needed.  In retirement, Mike and his beloved wife of  29 years, Dorrie, plan on spending more time  with  their children, Christopher and Patricia,  and their 2 grandchildren, Denim and Katie.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues,  it  is appropriate  that we honor and  thank California  Highway Patrolman Michael ‘‘Mike’’ Walker for  his hard work and dedication to public service  and extend our best wishes to him in retirement.

1098,331,2005-07-29,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  order  to recognize  the achievement of Mrs.  Peggy Heinkel-Wolfe. Mrs. Heinkel-Wolfe has  been awarded a contract from the University  of North Texas to publish her book detailing  the first four years of her son’s life before he  was diagnosed with autism.  After  attending  the University  of North  Texas, also my alma-mater, Peggy Heinkel-  Wolfe worked with UNT as a research and development specialist and wrote  for various  publications  including  the Denton Record  Chronicle. She has returned  to UNT and  is  now a web marketing specialist for the university relations office.  Mrs. Heinkel-Wolfe’s manuscript was chosen from among 34 entries by a panel of literary professionals at  the Mayborn Literary  Nonfiction Writers Conference of  the Southwest. The book will provide insight for millions  of individuals across the country who can relate to her son, Sam. The simple yet significant milestones she describes will allow readers a chance  to place  themselves  ‘‘in her  house’’ and ‘‘in her shoes.’’  Peggy Heinkel-Wolfe has captured  the  incredible compassion in her home and skillfully  transposed  those  feelings  into a novel. The  compassion her family displays is an attribute  every household should strive to instill.  I look forward to the completion of her story,  and I applaud her for providing insight and advice to all who have the opportunity to read it.  f  UPON RETIREMENT OF JACK KATZ  HON. ROBERT W.

1099,331,2005-07-29,Mr. NEY.," Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of  his retirement, I would like to thank Jack Katz  for his outstanding service to the U.S. House  of Representatives over the past 28 years.  Throughout the years, Jack has made significant contributions to the financial management of  the U.S. House of Representatives’  accounts and the processing and oversight of  the staff payroll. Jack began his career with  the House on March 25, 1977 and has served  this great institution in financial counseling and  payroll positions within the offices of both the  Clerk of the House and the Chief Administrative Officer. He has held the positions of Auditor, Accounts Clerk and Financial Management Counselor in the Office of Finance, and  currently holds the position of Payroll Counselor in the Office of Human Resources. During  the past 28 years, Jack has provided  financial and payroll guidance to every entity  of the House, assuring that House staff is paid  accurately and on time each month. His payroll and financial acumen has enabled House  entities to make critical decisions related to financial and staff payroll issues. He has also  provided many years of financial and payroll  support and guidance to the countless House  staff members who have worked in this great  institution throughout the years.  On behalf of the entire House community, I  would  like  to extend my congratulations  to  Jack Katz  for his many years of dedication  and outstanding contributions  to  the House  staff payroll function. I wish Jack and his wife  Melissa many wonderful years in fulfilling their  retirement dreams.  f  CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF  LUCILLE ‘‘LUCY’’ BRIGGS TEMPLE  HON. JOE WILSON  OFSOUTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today, I am happy to congratulate Rachel  and Adam Temple of Columbia, South Carolina, on the birth of their beautiful baby girl.  Lucille Briggs Temple was born on April 19,  2005 at 6:30 p.m., weighing 7 pounds, 9  ounces and measuring 21 inches long.  Lucy has been born  into a  loving home,  where she will be raised by parents who are  devoted  to her well-being and bright  future.  Her birth is a blessing. Adam is doing a wonderful job as Deputy Communications Director  for U.S. Senator JIMDEMINT, and I appreciate  the friendship of both Mr. and Mrs. Temple.  f  DOMINICAN  REPUBLIC-CENTRAL  AMERICA-UNITED STATES FREE  TRADE AGREEMENT  IMPLEMENTATION ACT  HON. MARK UDALL  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005
1100,331,2005-07-29,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in opposition to H.R. 3045, the Dominican Republic-Central  America-United  States  Free  Trade Agreement  Implementation Act, DR–  CAFTA. Deciding how to vote on this has not  been easy, but ultimately  I believe  that  the  bad in the agreement outweighs the good.  I definitely believe free trade brings benefits,  but  in  this case  I question who would get  those benefits. I agree that open markets have  helped  lift up  the  lives of people  in many  countries of the world. But I am also alarmed  about the growing economic inequality within  and between countries. Unless  free  trade  is  also fair trade, we risk lifting up the few to the  detriment of the many.  I think that an improved commercial relationship with the Dominican Republic and the five  Central American countries could benefit our  economy  and U.S.  farmers, workers,  and  manufacturers. But  I am concerned about a  number of provisions of DR–CAFTA. The  agreement will help some U.S. agricultural industries,  services markets, and high  technology, chemical, medical and scientific equipment companies, among others. But  it will  harm other agricultural markets, and could  have a detrimental  impact on small Central  American farmers as well. We ought to be encouraging rural economic development in this  part of the world, not undercutting it.  The most problematic aspect of DR–CAFTA  is that the administration failed to incorporate  internationally recognized labor standards. Nor  does the agreement clearly require any country to maintain and enforce a set of basic environmental regulations. America’s interests are  VerDate Aug 04 2004  01:01 Aug 01, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A28JY8.063 E29JYPT1 ",2005
1101,338,2005-07-29,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act  with Congressman Bennie Thompson. As a  former ‘‘Freedom Rider’’ in Mississippi during  the 1960s, I have seen first hand the need for  this bill.  While most are familiar with the recent prosecution of Edgar Ray Killen his participation in  the slayings of Civil Rights workers James  Chaney, Michael  Schwerner  and  Andrew  Goodman,  there are many other cases  that  aren’t as well known or remain unsolved, like  Emmett Till. These cases need to be investigated.  We as a Congress have a moral obligation  to bring justice to the families of these victims.  Furthermore, as a society based on laws, we  have a responsibility to ensure that criminals  don’t go unpunished.  This bill creates a special section within the  Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to focus specifically on unsolved pre-1970  Civil Rights’ homicides. In addition, the bill authorizes up to $5 million annually for this new  section, which will provide States assistance  with prosecuting Civil Rights era cases  that  have grown cold over time.  Unlike many other endeavors  that have  come before this House to address past racial  injustice, this bill goes beyond mere rhetoric  and ‘‘lip service’’ and provides an avenue to  actually address Civil Rights’ crimes.  Our country has come a long way since the  1960s. For example, seven states, since 1989,  have  reexamined 29 killings  from  the Civil  Rights era, leading to 27 arrests and 22 convictions. However, as most are aware, there  are still many unsolved homicides  from  that  time period. And, while we can’t go back in  time, we can acknowledge our past  transgressions and do our best  to work  towards  correcting them.  ‘‘Justice delayed’’ is better than ‘‘Justice denied’’!  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘SAFE  COMMUNITIES ACT OF 2005’’  HON. EARL BLUMENAUER  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005
1102,338,2005-07-29,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, an essential component of  livable communities  is  the  ability to avoid, withstand and quickly recover  from disaster events. Today I am joined by my  colleague from Pennsylvania, CURTWELDON,  in introducing the Safe Communities Act 2005.  This bill will give communities the tools to help  them plan for and reduce the impact of disaster events.  The Safe Communities Act will create a new  grant program to support state, local and regional planning activities aimed at  reducing  threats posed by natural and human-caused  disasters. Grant-eligible projects include: comprehensive risk assessment and inventory of  critical  infrastructure,  land-use planning  for  natural hazards and terrorism security, updating building codes and urban design  techniques for risk-reduction. The bill will also create a research program to investigate the best  practices in comprehensive land use and community planning aimed at  reducing  threats  posed by natural hazards and acts of terror.  The number of people who  live  in harm’s  way  is expanding dramatically; more properties and more lives are at risk from both natural and human-caused disasters.  It  is estimated that almost 75 percent of our communities are at risk for some type of natural disaster, be  it wildfire, hurricane,  flooding, or  earthquake. Rising disaster-recovery costs impact us all:  taxpayers,  the  financial services  and insurance industry, as well as local communities.  Federal  investment  in  natural  disasters  should  include prevention and mitigation as  well as response and recovery. Investment in  prevention can save money in the long-term:  The World Bank and U.S. Geological Survey  have estimated that $40 billion invested in risk  reduction  strategies  could  have  saved  as  much as $280 billion in worldwide economic  losses from disasters in the 1990s—a $7 return for each dollar invested.  I hope that this bill moves quickly through  the  legislative process so  that  the Federal  Government can be a good partner to communities  to help  them prepare  for and prevent  natural disasters.  f  40TH ANNIVERSARY OF MEDICARE  HON.

1104,345,2005-07-29,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor the life of Vice Admiral James  Bond Stockdale, a true American patriot and a  great military veteran. Vice Admiral Stockdale  passed away on July 5, 2005 at the age of 81  after a life of public service and sacrifice. He  is survived by his beloved wife Mrs. Sybil B.  Stockdale of Coronado, Calif., and his  four  sons.  I believe Gordon R. England, the Secretary  of the Navy, eloquently described the legacy  Mr.  Stockdale  has  left  behind:  ‘‘Admiral  Stockdale’s courage and life stand as timeless  examples  of  the  power  of  faith  and  the  strength of the human spirit.’’  I could not agree more and would  like  to  share a  few details of his extraordinary  life.  Vice Admiral Stockdale was born on Dec 23,  1923  in Abingdon,  Ill. At  the age of 24 he  graduated  from  the U.S. Naval Academy  in  the Class of 1947 and began his unmatched  naval career. Among his many distinctions,  Vice Admiral Stockdale is remembered for his  remarkable leadership as the senior naval officer held in captivity during the Vietnam War.  On September 9, 1965, after  flying more  than 200 missions over Vietnam, he ejected  over a small village after his plane was struck  by anti-aircraft fire. He broke his left knee during the landing and it was broken a second  time during his captivity.  During his 71⁄2year imprisonment, Vice Admiral Stockdale was tortured numerous times,  was forced to wear heavy leg irons for over  two years and spent four years in solitary confinement.  But his spirit and determination  to survive  never wavered. Despite the torture and abuse,  he refused to participate in enemy propaganda  films. Vice Admiral Stockdale’s extraordinary  heroism became widely known when he was  in 1976, only  awarded  the Medal of Honor  three years after his release.  His 26 combat awards included two Distinguished Flying Crosses,  the Distinguished  Service Medals,  two Purple Hearts and  four  Silver Stars. He is a member of the Navy’s  Carrier Hall of Fame,  the National Aviation  Hall of Fame and an Honorary Fellow of the  Society of Experimental Test Pilots. Stockdale  received several honorary doctoral degrees.  He  is  the highest-ranking naval officer  to  wear both aviator wings and  the Medal of  Honor. His  other  accomplishments  include  earning a master’s degree from Stanford University and serving at the prestigious institution’s Hoover Institute for 15 years. He was  also President of the Citadel for two years.  In 1992, he was a candidate for Vice President of the United States winning nearly 20  percent of the popular vote.  Mr. Speaker,  I  introduce  this  resolution  today  to recognize  the great sacrifices Vice  Admiral made protecting the freedoms of the  United States and  to recognize his commitment to public service. I would also like to extend my deepest sympathies to the family Mr.  Stockdale left behind, including his wife and  four sons.  His life serves as an inspiration to the many  servicemen and women protecting our country  at home and abroad. Vice Admiral Stockdale  was admired and respected  for his courage  and unfaltering determination.  f  A TRIBUTE TO JOHN KERFOOT  HON. ROBERT E. ANDREWS  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005
1105,345,2005-07-29,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the 90th birthday of one of New Jersey’s  finest citizens, John Kerfoot, and  to  honor all that he has done for his fellow Americans.  John is a model citizen who devoted his life  to serving his country and community. He  fought bravely  in  the European Theater  in  World War Two, and was rightly honored with  a Combat Infantry Badge and a Bronze Star  for his service.  Upon his  return, John Kerfoot committed  himself to helping the great state of New Jersey. He has devoted time and energy to the  Camden County Democratic Committee,  the  Office of the Aging, and the Camden County  Municipal Utilities Authority. He has served as  a Sergeant at Arms for the New Jersey State  Senate, a Camden County Freeholder, and a  Labor Compliance Inspector for the Camden  County Community Development Program.  Over the past fifty years, John has helped his  hometown of Audubon by serving honorably  with the Audubon Park Fire Company, the Audubon Board of Education, and the Audubon  Park Borough Council.  Although John  is an extremely busy man,  he still finds time to bowl with his wife Anne.  His skills are certainly not limited to bowling,  however. He successfully boxed in the Golden  Gloves Tournament in the early 1930’s, and  even won the boxing championship at Fort Dix  in 1932 at the age of seventeen.  Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to honor  John Kerfoot today. He has certainly accomplished much in the past 90 years, and his exemplary life of service is one to be admired.  Moreover, it is a pleasure to call John a friend,  and I wish him a very happy birthday, with the  hope of many more to come.  f  SHERIFF LAWRENCE ‘‘LUMPY’’  LEVEILLE  HON. BART STUPAK  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005
1106,345,2005-07-29,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to an outstanding law enforcement  officer who 40 years ago began his dedicated  career in St. Ignace, Michigan as a police officer and rose through the ranks to head the  Mackinac County Sheriff’s Department. Sheriff  Lawrence  ‘‘Lumpy’’ Leveille  retired  this past  winter with  eight  service  stars  upon  his  epaulets, each representing five years on the  force. Sheriff Leveille’s nearly 40 years as a  law enforcement officer and leader stand as a  shining example to us all.  Sheriff Leveille graduated from LaSalle High  School in St. Ignace in 1965 where in the 10th  grade he was given the nickname ‘‘Lumpy’’.  Being native of the first city across the Mackinac Bridge from Michigan’s Lower Peninsula,  it seemed  fitting  for Leveille  to return  to St.  Ignace when he began his career as a police  officer on May 25th, 1965. That same year on  September 11, he married Ara Jean Litzner.  Through the years, they have grown their family with five children and eleven grandchildren.  After nine years of patrolling and protecting St.  Ignace along  the shores of  the Straights of  Mackinac, Leveille was promoted to Sergeant  of the local police department.  Among his  long  list of accomplishments,  Sheriff Leveille has decreased the number of  drunk driving arrests thanks to new technology  and better training for his officers, despite the  increase in Mackinac County’s population. He  has improved safety for residents and his officers because of new cameras installed on patrol cars and  in booking rooms which have  lead to a reduction in criminal trials. He was  also able to achieve fast finger print and background searches to help officers as well as the  Straits Area Narcotics Enforcement Team.  Sheriff Leveille’s staff of 22 and budget of  about $1.5 million made his department  the  largest in the county.  Although Sheriff Leveille’s career with  the  Mackinac County Sheriff’s Department has  come to an end, he has continued to serve  the public as a Mackinac County Commissioner. There he has and will continue to have  an influence on local policy with the best interests of County  residents  in mind. Having  worked with many of the people involved in  the county’s administration, ‘‘Lumpy’’ Leveille’s  transition to the Board has been smooth as he  works to bring a better harmony to the system.  On a personal note, Mr. Speaker, as a  former State Trooper myself, I have had the  pleasure of knowing Sheriff Leveille over the  years and can attest to his impeccable reputation of being a fair and honest protector of the  people. I know that through his work he has  encountered  both  exciting  opportunities  to  grow with the community but also hard times  when  tragedy and  tough  times affected  the  area. He has given his heart and soul to his  work and I have always admired his dedication  to  the people of Mackinac County and  Michigan’s First Congressional District.

1107,352,2005-07-29,Mr. COX.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute  to a close  friend and exceptional employee,  Cynthia Barile, in anticipation of her last day  as Caseworker  in my California office.  It  is  with deep gratitude—and more  than a  little  sadness—that my staff and I must wish Cynthia farewell. I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for her 6 outstanding years  of dedicated service to my office and to the  residents of the 48th district of California.  Since joining my staff 6 years ago, Cynthia  has been a tireless advocate on behalf of Orange County residents. She was first hired in  August 1999 as  the Office Manager  for my  California office, and assumed her new administrative duties with great ease. With Cynthia  in this critical post, the district office was in the  most capable of hands. She quickly demonstrated excellent communication and interpersonal skills and, thanks to her fluency in  both English and Spanish, she became a vital  link between the staff and our diverse constituency. In 2002, Cynthia was promoted to Congressional Caseworker, a position  in which  she has excelled for the past 3 years. In this  time, Cynthia has personally handled over  2,500 cases and has helped  literally  thousands of people resolve  their problems with  Federal agencies. Though she has dealt with  nearly every Federal agency during her tenure  in my office, she has specialized in cases involving the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  Service;  the Department of Veterans Affairs;  the  Department  of  Defense  and military  branches; the Department of Justice; and the  State Department and U.S. Embassies around  the world.  Cynthia’s career in public service predates  her work on behalf of the 48th Congressional  District. Prior to joining my office, she was the  Scheduler and Office Manager for former California Assemblyman Bill Campbell. Bill  is a  close, personal friend of mine, so I know how  greatly he valued Cynthia’s years of service to  him and the constituents of the 71st Assembly  District. Although she is now departing my office, she  is not  leaving  the House of Representatives. Cynthia is moving just 25 miles  up  the  road—and saving herself countless  hours of commute time in Orange County traffic—to be a Caseworker in the district office of  U.S. Rep. EDROYCE in Fullerton. I have no  doubt  that she will continue  to excel  in  this  new position, and commend my  friend and  colleague, ED, for his foresight in bringing her  onboard.  Over the past 5 years, I have had the privilege of getting to know Cynthia and her family.  Her love for and dedication to her two daughters, Brianna and Alexis, are inspiring. While  on my staff, Cynthia celebrated her marriage  to her husband Mark Barile, and the birth of  their son Christian. Along with all those who  have had the opportunity to know and work  with Cynthia, I have been incredibly impressed  by her ability to balance the demands of being  a mother, wife and successful career woman.  Cynthia’s  professionalism,  patience,  and  courtesy in working with her colleagues, constituents, and agency  representatives have  made her an invaluable asset to my staff. She  is a dedicated, diligent and loyal public servant, and she will be missed greatly by all of us  who have had the honor of working with her.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  today  in  recognizing Cynthia Barile as she  prepares to celebrate her last day as Caseworker  in my California Office. She will be  greatly missed, and I wish her every success  in her future endeavors.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE CHARITY  CARE FOR THE UNINSURED ACT  HON. FRANK R. WOLF  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005
1108,352,2005-07-29,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker,  there are more  than 40 million uninsured Americans today—  nearly a million in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Throughout the country, medical professionals and countless others have responded  to the need of those who are seriously ill and  cannot pay for a doctor, medicine, and other  health costs.  In many places,  this help has  come in the form of community free clinics.  Community  free clinics, particularly  in Virginia, have helped people  in  communities  come together to care for those in need. The  health care ‘‘safety net’’ for the poor, like the  community  free clinics  in my congressional  district, exists in communities across America,  but often in widely varying degrees.  I am pleased  to  introduce  today  ‘‘Charity  Care for the Uninsured Act.’’ While this legislation alone will not solve the problem of the uninsured, I believe it will help strengthen community ‘‘safety nets,’’ like the community free  clinics in Virginia, for those in need and will  allow doctors recognition for their willingness  to give back to their communities.  The Charity Care  for  the Uninsured Act  would provide a personal income tax credit of  up to $2,000 for doctors who provide between  25 and 50 hours of uncompensated, pro bono  charity care to the uninsured in a single calendar year. This legislation would encourage  the many physicians who have  treated patients who were not able to pay, either in their  offices or in community clinics, to continue to  do so.  The Charity Care for the Uninsured Act also  will help provide a valuable tool—a personal  tax credit—to community clinics  in recruiting  physicians as well as helping motivate countless specialty doctors to take community clinic  referrals. Free clinics have contributed to reduced emergency room (ER) utilization among  the uninsured, helping save taxpayer dollars.  A safety net in which the uninsured can access specialists and medications will improve  their health and guard against catastrophic illnesses and trips to the ER.  All of the cost savings and health benefits  can be traced back to the commitment and the  compassion of  the doctors and community  partners, and their concern for those who cannot afford insurance. The Charity Care for the  Uninsured Act of 2005 recognizes and encourages  these caring acts made  to help  those  who need a helping hand. This legislation can  be an important tool for communities as they  seek  to strengthen or build  the health care  safety net available  to  their uninsured  residents.  H.R. —  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Charity Care  for the Uninsured Act of 2005’’.  SEC. 2. CHARITY CARE CREDIT.

Mr. Boulouha, who took his citizenship oath  on June 1, 2005, came to the United States  from Morocco 6 years ago. He quickly established himself as a valuable member of  the  local community. In addition to pursuing academic studies, he holds the position of Senior  Vice President for Marketing and Operations  at Amena Consulting. His engaging personality and  impressive knowledge of American  politics make him a popular figure at the Monocle Restaurant on Capitol Hill.

1110,359,2005-07-29,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call  attention  to  the commemoration of  the 16th  annual National Recovery Month  this September. National Recovery Month serves as  an important reminder of the benefits of treating alcohol and drug use.  It promotes  the  message that recovery from alcohol and drug  use disorder in all its forms is possible and  lauds  the  collective  effort  that  goes  into  achieving such recovery.  Substance abuse and substance dependence create substantial health risks not only to  the  individual, but also  to other community  members in that individual’s life. According to  the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services, as many as 63 percent of Americans  admit that addiction to alcohol or illicit drugs  has had an impact on them at some point in  their lives. This may include either their own  personal addiction or that of a friend or family  member.  In 2003, an estimated 22.2 million  Americans age 12 or older were considered in  need of treatment for an alcohol or drug use  disorder. Substance abuse is not only linked  to chronic health problems, but also with other  problems  such  as  unemployment,  crime,  homelessness, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  These disorders can be  treated, and  the  treatments  leading  to  recovery are as successful as treatments to other medical conditions such as high blood pressure or asthma.  Recovery, or  the process of  initiating and  maintaining abstinence  from drug use,  requires persistent and often multiple courses of  treatment, including behavior based therapies  and for some, medication. Unfortunately, many  people who are in need of treatment do not  receive it.  National Recovery Month 2005 heightens  awareness of the need to improve the process  of assessing abuse problems and  referring  people to appropriate treatment. It is imperative that families are provided with the support  services they need, that appropriate treatment  is affordable, and that access to treatment options are more readily available.  Addiction  is a  real and complex disease,  one which impacts the individual, family, and  community. Our esteemed  former colleague,  Congressman Michael Forbes, was directly  impacted by the substance abuse of a beloved  family member, one of my constituents. Carrick Forbes of Hastings-on-Hudson is a courageous young woman who overcame her addiction problems and successfully rebuilt her  life. Her recovery serves as an example of the  importance of treatment and the need to support more programs and initiatives to help our  friends, family, and members of our community.  f  HONORING DAVID J.

AL GREEN  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 27, 2005  ",2005
1112,359,2005-07-29,Mr. AL GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Congress debated and passed H.R.  3045, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement  (DR–CAFTA).  I  voted in opposition to the trade agreement because of my concerns regarding the full ramifications of its passage and because I am a  proponent of trade policies that enhance the  welfare of participating countries. Any  free  trade agreement entered  into by  the United  States should be fair. CAFTA, however, is neither free nor fair. CAFTA will cost American  jobs,  is unfair  to American workers and exploits cheap foreign labor.  As we consider future trade agreements, I  believe it is particularly relevant that we learn  the  lessons  from NAFTA. We have  learned  that the promises of U.S. economic prosperity,  curbed  undocumented  immigration,  robust  markets  and massive  job  creation  went  unfulfilled. I fear that NAFTA is a precursor for  what can be expected under CAFTA.  NAFTA promised millions of new jobs and a  trade surplus for the United States that was  never realized. Instead the U.S. has lost over  one million lobs to Mexico and Canada. More  specifically, the rise in the U.S. trade deficit  with Canada and Mexico  through 2004 has  caused  the displacement of production  that  supported over one million U.S.  jobs since  NAFTA was signed in 1993. Jobs have been  displaced in most states and many industries  in  the United States.  In my home state of  Texas alone, more  than 170,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost. The loss of these  jobs has contributed significantly  to  the expanding burdens of unemployed workers  in  our state.  Why do  these  trade agreements cost us  American  jobs? Free  trade agreements can  create an environment  that encourages corporations to relocate and take American jobs  with them. By making it easier for the Central  American countries to export certain products  and because  they have cheaper  labor and  weaker labor rights protections, CAFTA would  encourage  U.S.  businesses  to  relocate.  Though supporters tout Central America as a  market  for U.S. goods,  it  is not. CAFTA  amounts to nothing more than an outsourcing  agreement.  Adding  insult  to  injury, Trade Adjustment  Assistance (TAA) programs designed to help  those who lose their jobs due to trade agreements  remain underfunded and  ineffective.  Congress has not provided adequate funding  for this program to meet the needs of thousands upon thousands of workers who have  been displaced by  trade. You cannot have  trade agreements like NAFTA and CAFTA that  VerDate Aug 04 2004  04:05 Aug 01, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A28JY8.178 E29JYPT1 ",2005
1113,366,2005-07-29,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago,  landmark civil  rights  legislation—the Americans with Disabilities Act  (ADA)— was enacted to provide a clear and comprehensive  national mandate  for  the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.  As we celebrate the 15th anniversary of the  Americans with Disabilities Act, we  reaffirm  the simple premise—and the law of the land—  that every American has the right to live independently and to fully participate in all aspects  of our society.  We also celebrate the hard-fought victories  that have resulted in social inclusion so that  individuals with disabilities will not be isolated  and living separate lives. However, we would  be remiss to think that all the barriers are behind us or that we are close to meeting the  goals of the ADA.  Complete implementation of ADA policies is  necessary, so that individuals with disabilities  can obtain jobs for which they qualify. Full and  equal access for individuals with disabilities in  regards to education, governmental services,  public accommodations, transportation, housing, and  the right  to vote must also be secured.  Let us remember, that this 15th commemoration of the ADA is our call to renew our efforts, to realize the promise of the ADA and to  continue to work towards the restoration of full  protections for disabled Americans.  f  SOLIDARITY  ON  15TH  ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005
1114,366,2005-07-29,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, as we  commemorate  the  fifteenth anniversary of  the  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which  occurred this week, I would like to share the  attached Statement of Solidarity, signed by  170  national  organizations  and  numerous  state and local organizations. This Statement  of Solidarity demonstrates the strong commitment  in our nation  for building upon  the  progress achieved  in  the  first  fifteen years  after passage of the ADA, and continuing to  strive  to  improve  the  lives of all Americans  with disabilities.  STATEMENTOFSOLIDARITYON15THANNIVERSARY OF AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES  ACT—JULY26, 2005  Fifteen years ago today, with bipartisan  support in Congress and broad endorsements  from the civil rights coalition, President  George H. W. Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), calling for  the  ‘‘shameful wall of exclusion’’ to come  tumbling down. As we mark this significant  anniversary, we celebrate improvements in  access to polling places and the secret ballot,  government services and programs, transportation, public places, communication and information  technology.  Parents  pushing  strollers, workers delivering packages, and  travelers pulling roller bags have grown accustomed to curb cuts, ramps, and other accessibility features less common in 1990. Our  country is more accessible today thanks to  the ADA, and all Americans are better off.  Although  substantial progress has been  made, we are reminded every day of the significant remnants of the ‘‘shameful wall of  exclusion’’  that continue  to prevent  this  great country from realizing the full promise  of the ADA. The majority of Americans with  disabilities continue to live in poverty and  unnecessary isolation. Most adults with disabilities are either not working or not working to their full potential, robbing the economy of the contributions of tens of millions  of would-be workers. Children and youth in  special education continue to drop out of  school in alarming numbers before obtaining  a regular high school diploma. The promises  of higher education, accessible and affordable housing and transportation, quality affordable healthcare, and a living wage continue to elude many adults with disabilities  and their families. The ADA is slowly driving policy changes that have enabled more  people with significant mental and physical  disabilities to live independently in the community, but the ongoing institutional bias in  the Medicaid program keeps too many people  trapped in nursing homes and other institutions, unable to enjoy the freedoms and personal choices about where and how to live  that other Americans take for granted.  New technologies are increasing the independence and productivity of many Americans. Yet, advances in technology alone are  not guaranteed to improve the lives of people  with disabilities. As we develop applications  like Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VOIP) telephony, wireless telecommunications, widespread broadband internet connectivity, new  medical devices, new computer applications,  and a plethora of new genetic tests, it is critical that these technologies be designed and  used in a way that increases the inclusion,  independence, and empowerment of Americans with disabilities as well as America’s  growing senior population.  The ADA has begun to change the landscape of our cities and towns, but a civil  rights law alone does not create the kind of  transformation of attitudes that Americans  with disabilities, their families, and allies  are fighting to achieve. This kind of change  requires widespread discussion, education,  and consciousness-raising.  In 2005, how do fears, myths, and stereotypes continue to artificially limit understanding and acceptance of disability as a  form of human diversity? What role do the  mass media and entertainment  industries  play in forming public perceptions of disability, and how can decision makers  in  these  important  fields  be  influenced  to  produce more content that depicts the actual  life experience and first person perspectives  of people with disabilities? What can be done  to further improve accessibility at the design stage of new products and programs?  How can disability awareness and disability-  friendly practices create more productive  places of business and learning? What concrete actions can worship communities and  sports and recreation programs take to foster full participation of children, youth, and  adults with disabilities in these activities?  Why do so many Americans continue to  view disability as a fate worse than death,  and how do these views affect surrogate medical decision making and the application of  new genetic testing technologies?  These questions form the basis of an American conversation that still needs to take  place.  Widespread  social  change  cannot  simply be legislated, and it will not  occur without bold leadership from all  sectors of American society.  Public  and  private  employers,  in  particular, must make a serious, concerted effort to recruit and advance qualified workers  with disabilities within their labor force.  Election officials must take the necessary  actions to ensure that every adult is able to  enter his or her polling place and cast a secret and independent vote.  School  administrators  and  university  presidents must embrace their responsibility  to deliver a worldclass education to all their  students.  It is time for leaders across America—business owners, little league coaches, moms and  dads, sheriffs and clergy—to reject exclusion,  paternalism, and segregation and to take  personal responsibility for removing barriers  to full participation that still exist in every  community in this country.  With the aim of making America work better for everyone, the undersigned organizations pledge to build on the progress of the  last 15 years and join together to promote  the full participation and self-determination  of the more than 50 million U.S. children and  adults with disabilities. We believe that disability is a natural part of the human experience that in no way should limit the right of  all people to make choices, pursue meaningful careers, live independently, and participate fully in all aspects of society. We encourage every American to join us in this  cause, so that our country may continue on  the path that leads to liberty and justice for  all.

1115,373,2005-07-29,Mr. ROSS.," Mr. Speaker, on July 26, 1990,  President George H. W. Bush signed into law  the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act.  This  legislation was  the world’s  first comprehensive declaration of equality for people  with disabilities.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)  was the next step in the civil rights revolution  that began with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The ADA extended broad civil rights protections  to America’s 54 million citizens with a  disability. To the over 97,000 working disabled  Arkansans, this legislation has helped to establish greater options for individuals who are  willing and able participants  in our communities.  Among its key provisions, the ADA prohibits  employers with 15 or more employees  from  discriminating against qualified individuals with  disabilities. It calls for the removal of barriers  to access for people with disabilities to a wide  range of public accommodations,  including  restaurants, lodgings, places of entertainment,  hospitals, doctors’ offices, pharmacies, grocery  stores, and all other retail and service establishments. It also requires the removal of barriers to access for people with disabilities to  various public services, including public transportation. Additionally  it mandates  that  telecommunications be made accessible to those  with speech and hearing impairments through  the use of special relay systems.  Over the last 15 years, there is no question  that  the ADA  has  ushered  in  significant  change. One need only look around to see the  signs of progress: curb cuts, wheelchair lifts,  Braille signs, and assistive listening devices at  movie  theaters. The ADA has made  transit  systems and communications systems more  accessible. And, perhaps most importantly, the  ADA has begun to change society’s attitudes  toward people with disabilities.  Despite  this  important  and  widespread  progress,  the promise of  the ADA  remains  unfulfilled for far too many. A major focus of  the ADA, for example, was to improve employment opportunities. However,  the evidence  shows that there has been little change in the  employment  rate of people with disabilities.  Only 32 percent of people of working age who  have a disability are employed. And  today,  people with disabilities are still  three  times  more likely to live in poverty.  Furthermore, we can still find disparities for  the disabled in education, housing, and technology. It is for this reason that we need to  take greater steps to ensure that the disabled  community not only has access to, but is also  participating  in gainful elements of all programs and facets of society. I call on my fellow colleagues to join together in a bipartisan  effort to find ways we can strengthen the ADA  and  fulfill our commitment  to our disabled  communities.  been the constant target of Castro’s machinery of repression. He has been harassed by  the tyrant’s thugs and, now, unjustly incarcerated as a political prisoner for his peaceful activities.  Eight  years  before,  in  1997,  after  coauthoring the important and historic work ‘‘La  Patria es de Todos’’ (‘‘The Homeland Belongs  to All’’) with Martha Beatriz Roque, Felix  Bonne Carcasses and another Cuban patriot,  Vladimiro Roca, Mr. Go´mez Manzano was arrested by  the dictatorship and sentenced  to  various years in the gulag. During his unjust  imprisonment, and after being released, Mr.  Go´mez Manzano never wavered in his commitment  to bring  freedom, democracy and  human rights  to  the Cuban people. Unfortunately,  in an additional act of extreme and  despicable repression by the dictatorship, Mr.  Go´mez Manzano, along with dozens of others,  was arrested once again on July 22, 2005, before he could attend a peaceful demonstration  in front of the French Embassy in Havana to  protest  the  resumption  of  the  European  Union’s policy of so-called engagement with  the terrorist regime in Havana.  I have never had  the honor of personally  meeting Mr. Go´mez Manzano, but I can certainly say that I know him quite well. I have  spoken  to him by  telephone during various  Congressional  hearings  and  other  public  events dedicated to highlighting the suffering  and oppression of the Cuban people. He is a  great patriot, a man of  the  law, a man of  peace, and an apostle of freedom for Cuba.  Mr. Speaker, it is completely unacceptable  that, while the world stands by in silence and  acquiescence, Mr. Go´mez Manzano  languishes in the gulag because of his belief in  freedom, democracy, human  rights and  the  rule of law. We cannot permit the brutal treatment by a demented and murderous tyrant of  a man of peace like Mr. Go´mez Manzano for  simply supporting freedom for his people. My  colleagues, we must demand  the  immediate  and unconditional  release of Rene Go´mez  Manzano and every political prisoner in totalitarian Cuba.  f  f  FREEDOM FOR RENE GO´MEZ  MANZANO  HON.

Mr.  Speaker,  I rise  today  to speak about Rene  Go´mez Manzano, a political prisoner in totalitarian Cuba.  Mr. Go´mez Manzano is a lawyer and a distinguished member of the pro-democracy opposition in Cuba. Along with fellow Cuban patriots Martha Beatriz Roque and Felix Bonne  Carcasses, he is a leader of the Assembly to  Promote Civil Society. The Assembly  is an  umbrella organization of over 300 groups of  Cubans who have asserted  their  independence from the totalitarian state. On May 20,  2005, the Assembly carried out a meeting of  approximately 200 Cubans who publicly demonstrated their rejection of totalitarianism and  their support  for democracy and  the rule of  law in Havana. Mr. Go´mez Manzano was one  of the primary architects of that historic, admirable accomplishment.

1117,380,2005-07-29,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to draw attention to the ongoing struggles of our neighbors on  the Caribbean  island-nation of Grenada. Hurricane Emily recently struck the island causing significant structural damage to  homes, as well as public and private buildings—including two main hospitals. There was  widespread  flooding across  the country, and  many crops were destroyed. Damage  from  this storm alone is estimated at $110 million.  This most recent disaster is especially saddening when we consider what Grenada has  gone through over the last year. In September  of 2004, Hurricane Ivan devastated Grenada,  causing nearly 50 deaths and displacing thousands more. A staggering 90 percent of the  country’s buildings were destroyed by the hurricane, and the nutmeg crop, which accounts  for the overwhelming bulk of the country’s export  earnings, was  almost  completely  destroyed. Nutmeg is a very slow-growing crop  which makes its destruction that much more  tragic.  The damage  to Grenada  from Hurricane  Ivan was easily in the billions of dollars—several times more than the country’s Gross Domestic Product. A July 26th article in the publication CaribNews entitled ‘‘Grenada Needs All  the Help It Can Get’’, argues that the U.S. and  the international community must do more to  help Grenada. Indeed, Grenada has suffered  serious economic repercussions following the  destruction caused by Ivan.  Before Ivan, the economy of Grenada was  projected to grow by 4.7 percent, but the island’s economy instead contracted by nearly 3  percent in 2004. The economy was also projected to grow by at least 5 percent through  2007, but, as of 2005, that estimate had been  lowered to less than 1 percent. The government of Grenada also has  incurred an extremely high level of debt. While it is taking  steps on its own to remedy the problem it will  need help from the U.S. and organizations like  the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  More than $150 million in disaster and reconstruction aid was sent to Grenada in 2004,  including nearly $50 million  from  the United  States, but the country is still in a very fragile  state. The IMF reported that the economic situation could get much worse, due  to deficiencies in donor financing and tax revenues,  and the risk of increasing global oil prices.  With all that said, the U.S. must do all it can  to help Grenada. The President was able to  get Congress to pass the controversial CAFTA  bill this week by arguing, among other things,  that  it would help  the countries of Central  America to develop. I hope that the President  and this Congress will not forget our friends in  the Caribbean, as they also need our assistance and attention. The plight of Grenada  proves this, and calls out for our collective action.  [From the CaribNews, July 26, 2005]  GRENADANEEDSALLTHEHELPITCANGET  For the second time in less than a year  Grenada, often called the ‘‘Spice Island’’ of  the Caribbean and a ‘‘gem’’ in the region was  hit hard by a devastating. hurricane.  Thank God it wasn’t as bad as last year’s  tragedy.  Although the damage wasn’t nearly as severe as last year’s havoc left in the wake of  Hurricane Ivan, the pain and troubles inflicted on the people, the government, business, church and other institutions are much  more than any single country should be  asked to bear.  That’s why we join in the appeal by Dr.  Keith Mitchell, Grenada’s Prime Minister for  all the assistance, which the United States,  the Caribbean, the broad international community, and  the Caribbean Diaspora can  offer.  When ‘‘Ivan the terrible’’ struck in 2004, it  caused more than $2 bi1lion in damage, destroying about 90 percent of the homes, businesses and other structures, setting back the  country for several years. After achieving  significant gains in its quest to improve the  quality of its people’s lives in the 1980s and  1990s, Ivan struck with vengeance and halted  that progress. Now Emily has added to the  woes.  Dr. Mitchell met U.S. President George  Bush over breakfast at the White House yesterday morning and laid out a strong case  for more American assistance. He also appealed to the President to use his influence  with  the  international  community,  especially the World Bank, the  International  Monetary Fund, the Inter-American development Bank and United Nations development  agencies to get them to provide even more  help to Grenada.  President Bush should act decisively on  Dr. Mitchell’s request. Grenadians abroad  should also heed his advice and unite behind  the national efforts at reconstruction and  development.  They should resist any attempts to resort  to partisan politics or even to stay on the  sidelines in these times of need.  Last year, Grenadians reacted with determination and generosity and they should do  so again.  f  HELP  EFFICIENT,  ACCESSIBLE,  LOW-COST, TIMELY HEALTHCARE  (HEALTH) ACT OF 2005  SPEECHOF  HON.

This bill would hurt  patients who are harmed by medical malpractice by arbitrarily capping damages, denying justice to injured patients and their families.  This bill makes a number of changes to current law affecting medical malpractice lawsuits  filed in Federal and State court, including limiting the amount of non-economic and punitive  damages that could be awarded to a plaintiff,  and restricting the contingency fees that can  be charged by attorneys. The bill also pre-  empts State laws that conflict with the enforcement of any of  its provisions. The measure  does not, however, pre-empt any State statutory limits on the amount of compensatory, punitive or total damages awarded in health care  lawsuits. The provisions of the measure dealing with caps on awards would apply only to  those States that have no statutory limits on  damage awards in health care lawsuits.

1120,387,2005-07-29,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, many  of us have serious concerns about the recent  decision of  the U.S. Supreme Court  in  the  case of Kelo v. New London and the potential  effects on private property owners from local  governments’ exercise of  the power of eminent domain.  Because of those concerns, I joined in voting for H. Res. 340, expressing disapproval of  that decision, which was passed by the House  last month.  However, as I said then, although I agreed  with the resolution’s statement that Congress  could seek to ‘‘address through legislation any  abuses of eminent domain by State and local  government;’’ I think we should be reluctant to  take actions  to  curb what  some—perhaps  even a temporary majority—in Congress might  consider improper actions by a State or local  government.  The States, through their legislatures or in  some cases by direct popular vote, can put  limits on the use of eminent domain by their  agencies or  local governments.  I  think  this  would be  the best way  to address potential  abuses, and  I  think we  in Congress should  consider taking action to impose our ideas of  proper limits only as a last resort.  So, I am glad to note that in Colorado discussion  is already underway  regarding possible changes to our laws that would modify  the scope of eminent domain authority available to local governments.  A good example of that discussion is a recent editorial in Grand Junction’s Daily Sentinel, which notes with approval a proposal for  an amendment  to  the Colorado constitution  but points out that its proponents should be  cautious in their approach.  I think the editorial’s points are well taken.  I attach its full text and commend it to the attention of all our colleagues.  [From Grand Junction (CO) Daily Sentinel,  July 21, 2005]  VOTERSCOULDCHECKEMINENT-DOMAIN  ABUSE  State Rep. Al White, R–Winter Park, is  joining a host of state government officials  around the country who want tougher state  rules on government’s use of eminent domain to condemn private property.  Efforts are being pushed  in at  least 25  states in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court  ruling last month that said the city of New  London, Conn., could condemn homes in an  older middle-class neighborhood and  turn  them over to private developers for razing to  build condos, a hotel, athletic clubs and  other amenities.  Millions of Americans were understandably  angered by the ruling. It opens the possibility that any home or small business can  be condemned if some developer can demonstrate that his plans can produce more  revenue for local government.  White says he intends to push a measure in  the Legislature  for a state constitutional  amendment that would prohibit local government from taking land for private gain. If  it doesn’t pass the Legislature, he said he  will mount a petition drive to get it on the  2006 ballot.  White’s concerns for the rights of private  property owners are well taken. But White  should  be  cautious  about  overreaching.  There are some cases where it may be legitimate  for government to condemn private  property and allow another private entity to  benefit from it.  Even before this June’s ruling, the Supreme Court had long held that governments  can use eminent domain to condemn private  property and turn it over to other private developers in order to eliminate blight.  Although ‘‘blight’’ may sometimes be poorly defined, eliminating health and safety  issues associated with severely run-down or  neglected properties meets a legitimate public need.  White’s proposal or any other aimed at reducing  the potential  for  eminent-domain  abuse in Colorado must recognize that public  need and provide clearly worded conditions  under which it could be allowed.  f  HONORING THE MEMORY OF CORPORAL GEORGE ALLEN ALFORD,  JR.

Sergeant Taylor was assigned to B Battery, 1st  Battalion, 41st Field Artillery Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, at Fort Stewart, Georgia, and  according to initial reports died when he was  struck by  indirect  fire on a Coalition  forces  base. His survivors include his wife Janina, his  son Xavier; and his daughter Aaliyah.  Christopher Taylor was proud to serve his  country, Mr. Speaker. He was a graduate of  Opelika High School and was known  in  the  community as a loving friend and father. Like  every soldier, he dutifully left behind his young  family and  loved ones  to serve our country  overseas.  Words cannot express the sense of sadness  we have for his family, and for the gratitude  our country  feels  for his service. Sergeant  Taylor died serving not just the United States,  but the entire cause of liberty, on a noble mission to help spread the cause of freedom in  Iraq and liberate an oppressed people from tyrannical rule. He was a true American.  We will  forever hold him closely  in our  hearts, and remember his sacrifice and that of  his family as a remembrance of his bravery  and willingness  to  serve. Thank  you, Mr.  Speaker, for the House’s remembrance on this  mournful day.  f  CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 6,  ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005  SPEECHOF  HON. TOM UDALL  OFNEWMEXICO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I  rise today in support of the energy bill conference report, but  I do so with very strong  reservations. Although  I believe we missed  many opportunities  to make  this energy bill  truly comprehensive,  I also believe  that  the  conference report is an improvement over the  House-passed energy bill.  It is a sad indictment of the way the Majority  is running this Congress that it has taken us  5 years to pass an energy bill and the final  product  falls  far short of what  I believe  the  American public wants. I will vote for this conference report, but this bill lacks boldness and  vision. There is more we can and must do to  reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lower  skyrocketing gas prices, protect our environment, and steer our country  in a more  forward-thinking direction on energy policy. I am  pleased, however, that the bill makes strides  in encouraging alternative energy  research  and production. Specifically, $3.2 billion is included for renewable energy production incentives and $1.3 billion is allotted for energy efficiency and conservation.  I was disappointed to see that a Renewable  Portfolio Standard, RPS, was not included in  the bill. The Senate-passed bill  included an  RPS that would have required utilities to generate 10 percent of  their electricity  from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar,  biomass, and geothermal, by the year 2020.  Studies conducted by the Energy Information  Administration  illustrate  that a  federal RPS  could save consumers $19 billion. Moreover,  20 States have already enacted RPS requirement, many of which go beyond the Senate-  passed provision. A federal RPS would have  established a nationwide market-based trading  system to ensure that renewables are developed at the lowest possible price. I strongly  supported this provision, and over 70 of my  colleagues signed onto a  letter with me  to  conferees urging them to keep the RPS in the  bill. The Senate conferees voted in a bipartisan manner to keep the RPS in the bill, but  the House conferees stripped the provision. I  hope that my colleagues will work with me in  the future to support H.R. 983, a bill with bipartisan support that I introduced to create a  federal RPS of 20 percent by 2027. The time  for a federal RPS has come.  We also missed an opportunity to address  the serious problem of global warming. I believe that the amendment Senator BINGAMAN  offered,  and  that  passed,  expressing  the  sense of the Senate that mandatory action on  climate change should be enacted was an important step  towards congressional action  to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While I am  disappointed that we could not do more, and  that this sense of the Senate amendment was  stripped  from  the conference  report,  I am  pleased that the conference report includes a  provision to establish a new cabinet-level advisory committee, charged with developing a national policy to address climate change and to  promote  technologies  to  reduce greenhouse  gas emissions.  In addition,  the provision allows the Energy Department to authorize demonstration  projects  designed  to  test  technologies  that  limit harmful emissions. The  long-term solution to solving the global warming problem lies in the creation of new technologies and the Federal Government has a  key role to play in promoting technological innovations.  I believe we should have done  more, something along  the  lines of  the recommendations made recently by the National  Commission on Energy Policy, but it is critical  that we do something, and this climate change  provision is the least we can do to begin the  process of slowing global warming.  I am very pleased that a provision included  in the House-passed bill, giving $30 million to  uranium mining companies, was stripped from  the bill. If enacted, this provision would have  posed a grave threat to the water resources of  two Navajo communities in northwestern New  Mexico where four uranium in-situ leach mines  have been granted conditional licenses by the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

1123,401,2005-07-29,Mr. HENSARLING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to discuss funding for veterans’ healthcare. As  the son, grandson, and brother of veterans, I  understand just how important this funding is  to our brave men and women who have answered the call of duty to serve their country.  Since coming to Congress, it has been one of  my greatest pleasures to be able to provide  our veterans with the care and the treatment  they deserve.  Since 1995, Congress has increased spending on veterans by more than 59 percent—an  average increase of 6.9 percent per year. During  this Congress alone we have  increased  the death benefits and life insurance coverage  of our Armed Services personnel. We have  also provided  funding  for  specialty mental  health care for the first time ever, increased  funding  for  the  treatment of conditions  like  Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, and doubled  funding for mental health care issues. This is  indeed a record to which we can all be proud.  I was also proud to cosponsor H.R. 303, the  Retired Pay Restoration Act, in the 108th Congress. With the agreement of the House and  Senate, another version of this bill was passed  and signed by President Bush  in order  to  allow certain military retirees to receive both  their  longevity retired pay and veterans disability  compensation.  As  Speaker  of  the  House J. DENNISHASTERTnoted, ‘‘Congressman HENSARLING’s strong support for our nation’s veterans and concurrent receipt legislation was critical to ensuring that we achieved  the most significant, positive step forward for  veterans in our nation’s history.’’  Unfortunately, sometimes Congress can fall  short. For instance, the Fiscal Year 2004 Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill,  fell $1.8 billion  short of what was agreed  to  in  that year’s  budget  resolution. This  inadequate  level  for  funding  for veterans healthcare greatly concerned me, and that is why I voted against the  bill. When thousands of veterans were waiting  6 months or longer for healthcare, I did not  believe that it was the time to skimp on needed resources.  Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House of Representatives voted on  the Fiscal Year 2006  Department of the Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies Appropriations bill. Included  as part of this legislation was $1.5 billion in  funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs  to cover an anticipated budgetary shortfall for  the current fiscal year. I am very pleased that  the House of Representatives has approved  the funding necessary to ensure that they receive  the medical care  they deserve. However, because  the underlying  legislation  to  which we attached this important provision violated the budget we agree to abide by earlier  this year, I found myself in the difficult position  of having to vote against this legislation.  There were a number of alternative methods  that could have been used  to alleviate  this  problem—methods  that would not have violated the budget. Most notably, we could have  amended H.R. 3130, which was approved  unanimously by the House of Representatives  on June 30, 2005, to provide the necessary  funding levels. This broadly supported measure would have demonstrated our firm commitment to our veterans, and it is unfortunate this  alternative was not utilized.  Mr. Speaker, in the end the greatest threat  to adequately  funding  the needs of our veterans is Congress’ seemingly inherent inability  to control runaway wasteful spending  in our  budget. Each and every  time we spend another dollar on wasteful measures like bulletproof vests for K–9s, bridges to nowhere, or  an underground cafeteria in the Carlsbad Caverns, is a dollar that is not available for our  veterans.  One of Congress’s most solemn obligations  is to care for our veterans. I remain committed  to funding 100 percent of the benefits veterans  have earned  through  their service and sacrifice  to our country.  I will continue  to work  with Members of Congress to explore ways to  ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs  gets the money they need within the rules of  our budget agreement. I will not however, support legislation to grow the budget of another  department, such as this bill would have done  with the Department of the Interior, at the expense of our veteran’s and our children’s future.  f  COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAM  HON. JOE KNOLLENBERG  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 29, 2005  ",2005
1124,401,2005-07-29,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Mr. Speaker, the Cooperative Development Program, CDP,  of  USAID serves an important role in America’s  international development assistance. For a  modest annual investment, credit unions and  cooperatives can have a greater opportunity to  flourish through the work of the World Council  of Credit Unions and other non-governmental  cooperative development organizations.  In a world where three billion people live on  less than $2 a day, access to safe and sound  financial services is essential to helping people build better  lives  for  themselves. The  World Council of Credit Unions, WOCCU,  works  to  strengthen  credit  unions  implementing technical assistance programs to improve credit union performance so that these  non-for-profit cooperative  financial  institutions  can offer an array of client-responsive services, extend  their geographic coverage, and  harness technology.  Created by  the vision of  the U.S. credit  union movement, WOCCU has been  implementing  their  technical assistance programs  for over 30 years. Prior to WOCCU’s formation  in 1970, the Credit Union National Association,  CUNA, had an  international division called  CUNA Global Projects dedicated to overseas  credit union activities. Today, CUNA and their  state  league system, representing 86 million  credit union members in the U.S., work with  WOCCU to promote credit union growth in developing countries.  Through  the  current  funding  cycle  of  USAID’s CDP, WOCCU will spend the next 4  years working with credit unions around  the  world and focused in Afghanistan, Kenya, the  Philippines, Ecuador and Nicaragua  to build  networks—expanding  low-cost  transaction  services  for members,  including remittances;  creating enabling environments; training credit  union managers and board members; and extending credit union operations to difficult operating environments,  including HIV/AIDS-affected communities, conflict-prone zones and  poverty-entrenched rural areas.  Credit  unions  and  cooperatives  provide  hope for economic prosperity through grassroots businesses  that provide  jobs,  income,  basic education and democratic experience. I  will continue to support the USAID Cooperative Development Program to sustain overseas  cooperative development in developing countries and emerging democracies.  f  MEDICAID  IS  IMPORTANT  FOR  PEOPLE  AND  CHILDREN WITH  SERIOUS ILLNESSES  HON. JAMES P. MORAN  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 29, 2005  ",2005
1125,401,2005-07-29,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, as we  approach the 40th anniversary of Medicaid on  July 30, I want to underscore the importance  of Medicaid to children and adults with serious  illnesses. Medicaid  is a public health  insurance program that helps 52 million low-income  and disabled Americans,  including 540,000  Virginians,  stay healthy. Nationally, half of  Medicaid enrollees are children.  Medicaid is particularly important to people  with serious  illnesses. Medicaid can be  the  only way to pay for care.  Many people with serious  illnesses must  turn to Medicaid for several reasons. Many insurance policies have a lifetime upper limit of  $1 or $2 million. Approximately 51 percent or  87.5 million people with employer-based insurance have a lifetime cap, according to a 2004  Kaiser Family Foundation survey. Many private insurance plans impose pre-existing condition and other exclusions and refuse to insure people with serious illnesses and disabilities. Many working Americans do not have  job-based health insurance because their employers do not offer it. The cost of individual  health insurance policies is often out of reach.  And most Americans are too young for Medicare.  A serious, chronic illness can be emotionally  and  financially devastating. While we have  made great strides  in  treating cancer  today,  everyone  fears cancer.  In 2004, 1.4 million  new cases of cancer were diagnosed. In 2005,  34,000 Virginians will have cancer, says the  VerDate Aug 04 2004  04:05 Aug 01, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A29JY8.098 E29JYPT1 ",2005
1126,6,2005-09-01,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, like  all Americans, my thoughts are with  those struggling to cope with the terrible effects of Hurricane Katrina. The  devastation brought by the storm is  absolutely heart-wrenching and beyond  description. Many of my constituents  are deeply concerned by the scenes of  suffering  they are witnessing and  I  share their desire that the Government  do all it can to get help to Katrina’s  victims as soon as possible.  I commend the majority leader and  minority  leader  for acting to make  sure that the Federal help is available  to deal with Katrina’s aftermath.  I  hope that the emergency supplemental  we are passing will help to ensure that  disaster  relief  efforts  proceed  as  smoothly and expeditiously as possible.  I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress and with the President to make sure that the Federal  Government does all it can to assist  those who have lost so much in this national tragedy.∑  (At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to be  printed in the RECORD.)  ∑",2005
1127,6,2005-09-01,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President,  even  though we have all been  scattered  across the country during this past  week as the Senate has been in recess,  we have all witnessed through television  the  devastating  scenes  from  Louisiana and Mississippi. My heart  goes out to all of those who have been  affected by Hurricane Katrina—those  who have lost friends and family members; those who have lost homes; those  whose lives have been completely upended. My thoughts and my prayers are  with them all.  Having represented California in the  Senate for the past 121⁄2years, I have  been through my share of disasters—of  earthquakes,  floods, mudslides,  and  fires. I know a little of what they are  going through right now in the South.  But no matter how many disasters I  have witnessed first hand in California,  I must admit, these are some of the  most  disturbing  and  catastrophic  scenes I have ever seen.  And here we are, several days after  the hurricane struck, and it does not  appear to be getting much better. Tens  of  thousands  of  people  remained  stranded and trapped—there is a critical lack of food and water—and people  are dying. It is truly a desperate situation.  So I am pleased to support this legislation to provide emergency funding to  help the relief efforts. I doubt it will be  enough, and I suspect we will need to  do more. I trust that the action we are  taking tonight will be just the first  step—and will serve to underscore our  desire to take care of the people of the  Gulf States.∑  The bill (H.R. 3645) was read the third  time and passed.

1135,11,2005-09-09,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, as chair  of  the Senate Committee on Small  Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise  today to bring to the attention of the  Senate a proposal which was included  in the hurricane supplemental bill at  the request of the Office of Management and Budget and the Department  of Defense. I wholeheartedly supported  the supplemental bill and the funding  it would provide to the  individuals,  families, and small businesses that experienced so much suffering in this terrible tragedy. Their plight should not  be prolonged by delays in delivery of  much-needed assistance funding. However, I believe that this particular provision would  seriously  harm  small  businesses in the Gulf Coast region and  all across America—by excluding them  from Government contracts and subcontracts  for  the  relief and  rescue  projects. While I appreciate the need to  get supplies and services quickly  in  order to save lives, the provision at  issue is not tailored to lifesaving, and  we need to exercise caution in working  around  laws aimed at helping small  business, in the rush to pass emergency  appropriations.  The OMB’s proposal extends to hurricane relief and rescue operations that  the emergency procurement authority  previously approved by Congress  for  military  contingency  operations  in  cases of attack by the weapons of mass  destruction, war, or national  emergency. Most importantly, the proposal  raises  the  so-called  ‘‘micro-purchase  threshold’’ to $250,000. These measures  would abolish Small Business Act set-  asides for U.S. small businesses and the  Buy American Act preferences for U.S.  manufacturers on all rescue and relief  contracts  for years to come, potentially undermine the Stafford Act preference for local business, individuals,  and organizations in contracts for recovery from major disasters contained  in  the Stafford Act, and encourage  waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal contracts and in the reconstruction efforts  by drastically increasing the ability of  low-level Government officials to make  credit card charges.  The micro-purchase  threshold was  created in the 1990s to enable Government officials to quickly make limited  purchases  with  Government  credit  cards and without regards to competition,  small business, or other preference requirements. Congress strictly  limited  the  current micro-purchase  threshold amounts to $2,500 for all acquisitions, except to $2,000 for certain  construction projects and to $15,000 for  U.S.-based military contingency operations and WMD response and recovery  efforts.  This increase in the micro-purchase  threshold was  carefully  adopted  by  Congress just 2 years ago, in November  2003, in response to the 9/11 and the  global war on terror. The 2003 increase  was implemented subject to strict limitations to ensure that contracting accountability and  small business  requirements are not supplanted—limitations which are absent from the language in this bill.  The OMB plan in this bill increases  the  micro-purchase  threshold  to  $250,000, a hundredfold increase. Without appropriate protections,  such a  massive  increase  distorts  Congressional intent for the micro-purchases  and opens doors to greater credit card  contracting abuse. Government purchase card abuse has been the subject  of investigative and legislative actions  by the Senate Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee and  by the Senate Finance Committee. Indeed, the leadership of these Committees,  including Chairmen GRASSLEY  and COLLINSas well as ranking member  LIEBERMAN, already made known their  opposition to the OMB proposal. The  Government Accountability Office estimates that the Federal Government  could have saved $300 million a year by  imposing greater accountability on the  use  of Government  purchase  cards.  These  losses stand to balloon along  with the huge increases in credit card  spending called for in this proposal. A  massive expansion of the micro-purchase threshold could overwhelm the  fragile accountability mechanisms for  this program.  Most importantly, in addition to the  high potential  for waste and abuse,  raising the micro-purchase threshold  from its current levels to $250,000 obliterates small business contracting set-  asides for contracts that by law and by  tradition have been going  to  small  firms. The statutory  ‘‘small business  reserve’’ in the Small Business Act sets  aside for small business concerns all  Federal  contracts  in  the  amounts  below $100,000 and above the micro-purchase threshold, typically, $2,500. Contracts at $100,000 or less are uniquely  suitable  for  performance  by  small  firms. Excluding them now makes no  sense.  Further, the DoD/OMB proposal for  extension of the emergency procurement authority to Hurricane Katrina  improperly expands the scope of this  authority to future ‘‘relief’’ contracts  and to contracts with only distant relevance to Hurricane Katrina. As I already mentioned, the emergency procurement  authority  established  a  micro-purchase threshold  increase to  $15,000, provided the purchases are ‘‘directly  related’’  to military  contingency operations or WMD recovery. Extension of this authority would take  contracts ranging from $15,000 to $2,500  out of the statutory  ‘‘small business  reserve’’ under the Small Business Act.  In addition, this authority would also  allow large firms to exclude small businesses from subcontracts by treating  all Katrina-related contracts as purchases of commercial  items. Taking  work away from small businesses as  part of disaster relief is not the message we want to send.  Federal small business contracts are  a vital source of business and jobs creation for small firms. Prior to Katrina,  small  business  in  disaster-affected  States used to received a significant  boost from Federal contracts. Retaining,  renewing, and  enhancing  these  small business contracts will be critical for successful reconstruction of the  Gulf Coast region. For example, in Fiscal Year  2003, Alabama  small businesses received $2.05 billion in Federal  contracts,  including  $191 million  in  construction  contracts. Small  businesses in the State of Mississippi received  $419 million  in Federal contracts, with over a quarter of that  amount, $134 million, in construction  contracts. Finally, Louisiana received  $712 million  in  small business  contracts, including $242 million in construction. Small  business men  and  women in these States have the experience and the wherewithal to join hands  in the relief and reconstruction of their  communities. What  they need  is a  chance to work and rebuild their businesses.  We have an obligation to help the  small business sector of the Gulf Coast.  I am very concerned about the import  of the OMB contracting provision, and  I will work to ensure that this provision is limited and modified in future  legislation to ensure that it provides  the right balance between speed and  fairness in Government contracts.  f  HURRICANE KATRINA  ",2005

1138,25,2005-09-09,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President,  thank you.  By raising awareness one moment,  one person at a time, we can minimize  the harm that drinking during pregnancy causes to our most vulnerable  population, and that is our children.  In February of 1999, there was a small  group of parents who were raising children afflicted with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. These parents set out  to change the world. That small group  started an online support group which  quickly became a worldwide grassroots  movement to observe September 9 as  International Fetal Alcohol Spectrum  Disorders Awareness Day. Former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle was  instrumental  in  having  the Senate  take notice of this important issue. He  has worked very hard on this issue, and  continues so today. We thank him for  his efforts.  This year, for the seventh consecutive year, communities across the Nation are pausing at the hour of 9:09 a.m.  to acknowledge this day.  Events are occurring  in cities and  towns not just across the country but  around  the world—from Chilliwack,  British Columbia, to Cape Town, South  Africa, to Madagascar. Families are  joining  today  to  raise awareness of  Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder, or  FASD.  In Alaska, Alaskans will observe this  day in solemn events in Anchorage, Juneau, Kenai, Fairbanks, and other communities.  FASD is an umbrella term that describes a range of physical and mental  birth defects that can occur in a fetus  when a pregnant woman consumes alcohol. It  is a  leading cause of nonhereditary mental retardation in the  United States. Many children affected  by maternal drinking during pregnancy  have irreversible conditions, including  severe brain damage. It is causing permanent lifelong disability. We have to  keep this in perspective.  FASD is 100 percent preventable. Prevention merely requires a woman to  abstain from alcohol during pregnancy.  Knowing that it is entirely preventable, it is amazing to me to think that  every year  in this country an estimated 1 in every 100 babies are born  with FASD. That is about 40,000 infants  annually. FASD affects more children  than Down’s syndrome, cerebral palsy,  spina bifida, and muscular dystrophy  combined.  The cost of FASD is huge: More than  $3 billion each year in direct health  care  costs  and many  times  that  amount in lost human potential. Lifetime health costs for an individual living with FASD can average $860,000.  The  indirect  financial  and  social  costs to the Nation are even greater,  including specialized health care, education, foster care, job training, cost of  incarceration, general support services.  All in all, the direct and indirect economic costs of FASD  in the United  States are estimated to be $5.4 billion.  FASD is found in every community in  America, in Native, non-Native, rich,  poor. It does not discriminate.  That is why, last February, the U.S.  Surgeon General, Richard Carmona,  again issued another advisory, to protect women,  to  completely  abstain  from alcohol use.  In Alaska, we have very troubling  statistics as they relate to FASD. We  have the highest rate of FASD in the  Nation. Approximately 163 Alaskan babies are born each year affected by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy.  Among our Native communities, the  statistics are even worse. The rate of  FASD is 15 times higher than non-Native areas in our State.  This is a disease syndrome that is 100  percent preventable. We can save so  many children, so many families, so  much heartache simply by increasing  people’s awareness of what FASD  is  and how we can prevent it.  In fact, prevention of FASD is seven  times more cost effective than treating  the  disorder. That  is why Senator  JOHNSONand I and several other Senators from both sides of the aisle will  soon  introduce  legislation  to direct  more  resources  toward  this  terrible  problem. The legislation we are introducing is called the Advancing FASD  Research, Prevention and Services Act.  It is designed to develop and implement targeted State and community-  based outreach programs to  improve  coordination among Federal agencies  involved in FASD treatment and research by establishing stronger communication with these programs and  also to  improve support services  for  families and strengthening educational  outreach efforts to doctors, teachers,  judges, and others whose work puts  them in contact with those with FASD.  Mr. President, 40,000 American children a year are born with FASD. Our  investment today in prevention, treatment, and research will save countless  and  future health care costs of this  devastating, but entirely preventable,  disorder.  I ask my colleagues to join with Senator JOHNSONand I in supporting the  advancing FASD Research, Prevention  and Services Act.  Today, on Fetal Alcohol Awareness  Day, let us remember all innocent babies afflicted with this disorder and let  us  imagine the potential they could  have but for this damage from alcohol.  I hope we continue to recognize, to  pause in the ninth hour of the ninth  day of each September until fetal alcohol syndrome disorders are eradicated.

1146,6,2005-09-22,Mr. KELLER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of the rule and of the underlying Head  Start bill. Since I was elected to Congress in 2000, we have increased Head  Start funding by 28 percent, from $5.8  billion in 2000 to $6.8 billion today.  Head Start is a crucial program for  over 900,000 of our Nation’s most needy  students.  It provides  child development, educational, health, nutritional,  social and other activities to help prepare young children for kindergarten.  A good Head Start program will make  sure that low-income 4-year-old children will know their ABCs, be able to  count to 20, have the building blocks  they need to hit the ground running on  their first day of kindergarten.  We know today how important early  childhood  education  is  to a  child’s  long-term success. Head Start makes  sure  that children  from  low-income  families have the educational foundation they need to succeed.  As a father of two, I know firsthand  how precious our children’s first years  are and how important they are to our  children’s future. I am proud of Congress’ increased support for low-income  children through the Head Start program, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and  ‘‘yes’’ on the  Head Start reauthorization bill.  b1045  ",2005
1147,6,2005-09-22,Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Florida.," Mr.  Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3  minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman  from Minnesota  (Ms. MCCOLLUM).  ",2005
1148,6,2005-09-22,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to express my sincere disappointment in the Committee  on Rules decision to report a restrictive rule for consideration of the bill  before us today, the reauthorization of  Head Start, the future of our children.  Several  commonsense  amendments  were not ruled in order. Not surprising,  most of them were Democratic amendments.  Instead,  several amendments  that were ruled in order will weaken  Head Start and the opportunity for our  children.  In the committee, there was support  of adding the language  ‘‘faith-based’’  into the bill, even though faith-based  institutions  currently participate  in  providing Head Start programs. We  were happy to do this in committee; I  was also, along with my colleagues, because the Equal Opportunity Employment Act is also spelled out clearly in  the bill, which does not allow for discrimination in hiring.  But there was another amendment  that was not ruled in order, my amendment, an amendment which would have  protected  the privacy of our  faith-  based organizations and the integrity  of our tax dollars. The amendment that  I offered in the Committee on Rules  would have simply required faith-based  organizations to create a separate bank  account, a separate bank account in  which to receive Federal dollars for the  Head Start program, a distinct and separate bank account from the private  dollars that a religious organization  collects to put forward their religious  mission.  Why do we need to do that? Well,  first, we need to protect Federal tax  dollars  from being used  improperly;  and, secondly, we need to protect the  privacy of  faith-based organizations’  accounting books  for their religious  mission. With  the  commingling  of  funds, if fraud is suspected, a faith-  based organization would have to open  up all of their books for inspection. My  amendment would have required separate accounts, therefore, protecting the  church’s mission and the Federal education mission of Head Start.  Mr. Speaker, let me quote from the  Covenant Companion, a Christian publication. I quote from this publication,  and  I will also  include this  in the  RECORD, as well as two other publications that speak to this. From the Covenant: ‘‘Churches are particularly vulnerable to embezzlement because of the  high-level of trust given to employees  and volunteers that lack the sophistication,  fiscal  controls,  and  oversight.’’  My amendment simply would have  been a preemptive strike against financial abuse that we know will happen  because it has already occurred. For  example, this past summer, $80,000 was  stolen from a Federal Head Start program run by a church.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  reject this rule. We need a new rule,  one that will protect the taxpayers,  one that will protect faith-based organizations and stop discrimination.  [From the Covenant Companion, Apr. 2003]  WHENTHENUMBERSDON’TADDUP  (By Bob Smietana)  Sandra had a problem—an overdue Visa  bill for $672 and no cash to pay it. And the  Visa bill wasn’t the only problem. Sandra  was behind on a number of other bills and  her creditors were calling. And calling.  Then Sandra, the bookkeeper at a small  manufacturing company in Kansas, came up  with a desperate plan. She would use one of  the company’s checks to pay her bill.  ‘‘I  thought, just this one time, just to get back  on my feet,’’ she told Fortune Small Business (FSB) magazine. ‘‘No one will know.’’  To disguise her actions, Sandra recorded  the check under the name of one of the company’s vendors. When the bank statement  came, she removed the canceled check, leaving no trace of the theft.  But it wasn’t just one time. From 1992 to  1999, Sandra, a  former small town cheerleader and mother of two, wrote out eighty-  eight checks  to pay her bills and made  eighty-eight false entries. The total, according to FSB, was $248,383—all of it going to  pay living expenses. Since her employers at  the small, family-run business trusted her,  they never checked her work.  The embezzlement was discovered when  Sandra went on vacation. While she was  gone, one of the canceled checks was found  and her boss discovered what she had done.  Sandra was convicted of embezzlement and  sentenced to eighteen months in prison.  While fraud at major companies like World  Com and Enron have made headlines in recent years, small businesses, nonprofits, and  churches arc particularly vulnerable to embezzlement because of  the  level of  trust  given to employees and volunteers and the  lack of sophisticated financial controls and  oversight.  In the past three years, GuideOne, which  insures 45,000 churches in the United States,  paid 3,845 claims to churches for losses from  theft (by people outside the church) or embezzlement  (by people  inside the church).  Those claims total over $8 million, with an  average claim of $2,106.  In the past ten years, at least eleven Covenant churches have reported being victims  of embezzlement, with anywhere from ‘‘just  over’’ $10,000 to more than $300,000 taken by  people  they  trusted—volunteer  treasurers,  church staff, even a pastor. At  least one  major embezzlement at a Covenant church  was discovered in 2002. And the actual number of embezzlements is likely higher because many churches are reluctant to report  when a member of the church has embezzled  money.  Kent Egging, interim pastor of Bethany  Covenant Church in Mount Vernon, Washington, has studied embezzlement in churches as part of a doctor of ministry degree program. Egging also knows the effects of embezzlement on a church firsthand—while he  was co-pastor of a Covenant church in Portland, Oregon, the church’s treasurer embezzled more than $45,000.  The embezzlement began in 1992, soon after  Jim, a member of the church, became treasurer. His main qualification, Egging says,  was not formal training in business or accounting—‘‘he was willing to do the job.’’  Soon after starting, Jim learned that the  church had a separate account to handle  funds for a campaign to build a Christian  education (CE) wing. Since the funds were  not needed immediately, there seemed to be  no need to closely monitor the account.  That separate account gave Jim two things  that an embezzler needs to succeed—access  and no accountability. ‘‘He found he could  transfer funds into this CE account and then  withdraw them,’’ says Egging,  ‘‘and absolutely nobody knew.’’  VerDate Aug 31 2005  07:24 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H22SE5.REC H22SE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005

If what is being proposed under the  Boustany amendment is so awful, why  would President Bill Clinton, during  his 8 years in office, have signed the  following bills into law: the 1996 welfare reform law; the 1998 Community  Services Block Grant reauthorization,  the 2000 Community Renewal Tax Relief Act; the 2000 Substance Abuse and  Mental Health Services Administration  Act.  Why would President Bill Clinton  have signed all of these bills into law  if, in fact, this was such a bad idea? Because all of these acts, signed into law  by President Clinton, have the same  identical language that is going to be  offered later today.  The second point I would make is  that what do we have to fear from allowing the House to work its will and  letting the majority rule? Let us have  the debate. Let us have the vote. Unfortunately, my colleagues know that  we are likely to win, because we have  won on this case time and time again  as this debate has occurred  in this  House.

I am a Head Start kid. I experienced  firsthand the valuable and comprehensive  education  program  that Head  Start provides for low-income families.  Head Start opened up a new world, not  only for me, but also for the rest of my  family.  As I received an education and health  services, my mother learned valuable  lessons on how to become a more active and involved parent in America’s  public school system. I am glad to see  that H.R. 2123 preserves the valuable  Federal-to-local design that gives parents and local communities the right  and the responsibility to be active in  their Head Start program. For this is  really the key to the Head Start program, the fact that parents and families are also involved with their children.  To maintain the integrity of Head  Start, I would urge my colleagues to  pay special attention to two key votes.  My  colleague  from  Indiana  (Mr.  SOUDER) will be offering an amendment  to restore the joint governance structure of Head Start and to allow policy  councils made up of parents and community members to approve or disapprove program plans and operation  activities, along with the board of directors. I urge my colleagues to support that important amendment.  On the other hand, I urge the House  to oppose the amendment that would  allow faith-based Head Start programs  to use Federal tax dollars to discriminate against teachers and employees  solely on the basis of their religion. We  need to keep Head Start strong and to  open it up for everyone so that it can  remain the great program that it was  for me and so that it can continue to  be so for so many Americans.  ",2005

1153,20,2005-09-22,Mr. CUELLAR.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to focus on the extra provisions dealing  with the Migrant and Seasonal Head  Start programs. These programs are  among the most essential, providing  comprehensive education, health care,  child care services to the families who  often have literally nowhere else to go.  I am familiar with this, working with  the Texas Migrant Council in my district, Laredo, Texas.  This  year we  are  breaking  new  ground by mandating at least 5 percent  of the Head Start budget to go to migrant and seasonal programs. I want to  thank the chairman and the members  of the committee  for this. This  increase even by 1 percent means a lot,  going from 4 to 5 percent. It would permit Migrant and Seasonal Head Start  to serve as many as 10,000 additional  children. This is a case where a small  increase in funding can make a big difference to a lot of children, changing  the path they are on.  I want to emphasize that this program is extremely important. I know  that for the migrant farm worker population  facing a unique  set of challenges, working on a seasonal basis,  migrant families often have to move  from State to State during the year,  making it extremely difficult for the  children to get in and remain in high-  quality  educational programs. When  they are in the fields, parents often  work 12 hours a day or more, making it  very difficult for child care. This is  why this provision is extremely important.  This program  is  important, and  I  know because I am also the son of migrant workers. I want to thank the  chairman and the ranking member (Ms.  WOOLSEY) for the work, and the committee members  for  this new additional funding for the seasonal migrant  workers.  ",2005

Prior to ever  being elected to office and serving in  the State  legislature or Congress,  I  worked 6 years for Head Start. I started as assistant teacher, and I went on  to be the supervisor of Parent Involvement and Volunteer Services. I  love  Head Start, and I have a great appreciation for what my government has  done in creating this program to give  poor kids and the kids of working families an opportunity to get a head start,  to get prepared for kindergarten and to  get prepared for success. That is what  Head Start has been doing.  Not only does Head Start build self-  esteem,  it prepares children to read  and get ready for the educational experience. It teaches parents to appreciate  their children’s work. It teaches parents that they can have involvement in  their  children’s  educational destiny.  This is a wonderful program.  I think the committee did a good job  in working through some of the problems. I do not agree with everything,  but I would support this bill.  But I am absolutely shocked and surprised that my colleague that I came  into this Congress with would lead an  effort to kill Head Start. The gentleman knows he is killing Head Start  by putting  this amendment on  the  floor to put religious involvement in  the program. A faith-based initiative  has no place in Head Start. Head Start  teaches children to respect each other,  to enjoy each other, to respect all cultures.  On Sunday morning in America, religion is the most segregated sector of  our society. Whites go to white churches, blacks go to black churches, Greeks  go to Greek churches, Muslims are in  their mosque, Jews are in their synagogue; and that is all right. We have  religious freedom. People go to whatever church they want. But do not  bring that to Head Start. Allow Head  Start to be what it should be for all  Americans. Do not say to people because you are a different  faith, you  cannot work in this Head Start program.  We do not want to give that kind of  example to our children.

Head Start programs across the United States  have been an essential part of the academic,  physical, emotional, behavioral and cognitive  development of 3 and 4 year olds.  Early childhood education for pre-schoolers  is extremely important as an essential element  of child development. Guam’s Head Start programs have educated  thousands of children  over the past 30 years to become good upstanding citizens. The program not only caters  to the children, but integrates the involvement  of parents to nurture an ongoing education in  the homes.  I commend all  the hard working  teachers  who  have  enthusiastically  and  effectively  worked to positively influence the lives of at-  risk children and their families. I support Head  Start and H.R. 2123, which is critical to provide adequate funding for this wonderful program.  ",2005
1158,34,2005-09-22,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in support of this bill, though I have concerns about one specific provision that would  go too far to allow discrimination.  The basic  tenet of Head Start  is as  true  today as  it was a generation ago—quality  early education programs can be instrumental  in helping children overcome barriers to learning. This program not only plays an important  role in providing opportunities for the next generation but also has an important impact on  our economy. For every dollar spent on Head  Start, we receive seven dollars back. There  are few federal programs that can boost that  kind of success.  As a nation we must ensure that our children are prepared, academically, emotionally  and nutritionally to enter school. Removing the  outside  forces  that  result  in under-prepared  students opens up children’s minds  to  learn  and gain an education. Head Start is one of  the most  important programs  in our government and I am pleased to see this bill come  to the floor with bipartisan support.  Unfortunately,  I have concerns about an  amendment passed by this body that allows  faith-based Head Start grantees  to discriminate in hiring based on religion. Federally supported programs should never support discrimination in its programs on any level. Since  Head Starts inception in 1972 it has never discriminated in hiring for faith based and other  organizations. There is no need to start now.  I was pleased the House did not adopt an  amendment offered by Ms. MUSGRAVE that  would allow for-profit Head Start providers to  collect federal funds as profit. While for-profit  Head Start grantees play an important role in  school  readiness,  I do not support allowing  them to collect a profit from federal grants provided to serve low-income students. Any savings from funds designated for administrative  costs should go towards serving the needs of  these  low-income students. This amendment  provides the wrong type of incentive for Head  Start grantees.  While this bill is not perfect, there are many  provisions that will provide needed and worthwhile reforms to Head Start. Head Start has  proven to be a successful program and this  bill will largely make it even more successful  and efficient. So Mr. Chairman, I am voting in  favor of this bill.  ",2005
1159,34,2005-09-22,Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.," Mr. Chairman, for  almost 40 years, Head Start has assisted low-  income preschool children and their families. It  has been an invaluable resource to many children and families across our country.  I am pleased  to rise  to  join with my colleagues about  the  future of Head Start. As  Congressman and a former County Executive,  education is one of my top priorities. In particular, Head Start programs are essential to  so many children’s futures, for research shows  that early learning is a fundamental piece of a  child’s education.  I have long held a firm belief in the importance of education and have often spoke of  our nation’s need to ensure that, even at the  earliest stages our children have access  to  programs and services  that will enrich  their  education and lives.  Last year, Head Start helped 912,000 three,  four, and five year olds build a solid foundation so they are ready to tackle reading and  math in kindergarten. Head Start allows children to be ready to succeed in school and in  life. Giving  them  that extra boost  that  they  need will allow them to be productive citizens.  Head Start also provides  the youngsters  and their families with a comprehensive list of  support services—from health screenings  to  nutritional advice to parent counseling.  I stand behind this program because I have  seen first hand how Head Start helps the entire family grow and succeed together.  Head Start is a good start for America’s future.  ",2005

Disappointingly, I would have voted for this  legislation to reauthorize the Head Start program if it were the same bill that the Education  and Workforce Committee  passed  unanimously with bipartisan support. That bill’s new  teacher qualifications and increased accountability would have greatly improved the educational outcomes  for children  in  the Head  Start program. I would have preferred that bill  provide more funding to ensure all eligible children can receive Head Start services, but on  balance,  the bipartisan bill was worth voting  for.

Mr. Chairman, helping Head Start  centers develop with college students,  students who will then help young children when they are learning to read,  certainly will help those children. But  also it is going to encourage more students at the college level to become  and remain Head Start teachers.  Anything that accomplishes both of  these goals is worth doing. And I support the amendment.  ",2005

Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me just  say that I am excited about the opportunity for this amendment, because I  think that we can create a partnership  with the Head Start program and with  our college students. And the beneficiaries are our youngsters.  And we give an opportunity to college students to be stakeholders in an  education process. It keeps them involved in their community. It keeps  them involved in public life. And they  have so much to offer and to give, and  then couple that with the tremendous  work of the Head Start teachers.  So with that, I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  ",2005
1164,55,2005-09-22,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague,  the  gentlewoman  from  Connecticut  (Ms.  DELAURO) that would allow Head Start centers  to partner with colleges, universities and community-based organizations to recruit and train  college students  to serve as mentors and  reading coaches to preschool children.  Early childhood is a critical time for children  to develop  reading,  language and cognitive  skills. For 40 years, Head Start has worked to  increase the overall school preparedness for  the Nation’s  young  children  in  low-income  communities. As Congress moves forward to  reauthorize Head Start and make a number of  changes,  the  reauthorization should  include  meaningful programming to improve the offerings of Head Start programs. This amendment, that allows Head Start centers to partner with an institution of higher education or a  community-based organization in order to recruit and  train college students  to serve as  mentors and  reading coaches  to preschool  children, and would allow children to receive  the personal  instruction and attention  they  need to be successfully prepared for school.  One-to-one  learning  is a proven  teaching  method  that strengthens cognitive skills  in  young children. Mentors provide children with  the additional support they need to boost comprehension and self-confidence. Back home in  my district in Connecticut, the Jumpstart Hartford program is an excellent example of this  type of comprehensive  learning partnership.  Jumpstart Hartford,  in partnership with  the  University of Hartford,  facilitates one-on-one  instruction with students  from  the University  and young children from low-income families  in Hartford. The program places special focus  on developing stronger language, literacy, social and  initiative  skills. The program has  made significant gains in narrowing language  and literacy gaps with its young children.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the DeLauro amendment that would allow  mentor partnerships in Head Start and make  real progress towards preparing all children in  Head Start for success in school and throughout life.

The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to  House Resolution 455, the gentleman  from Florida  (Mr. STEARNS)  and  a  Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. STEARNS).  ",2005
1167,55,2005-09-22,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the Individuals with  Disabilities Act  and  the  1998 Head  Start Act simply required Head Start  programs to reach out to families who  have children with disabilities. Including children with disabilities in Head  Start programs can be a rewarding experience for all involved: children, parents, and of course Head Start employees.  But the linchpin for success with inclusion is proper training of employees  to care for the children’s unique needs.  However, the underlying legislation I  think perhaps can be strengthened in  this area.  My  amendment would  simply  do  that. How? Include families who have  one or more children with disabilities  in the list of training course subjects  the Secretary is directed to provide for  Head Start training employees so they  can cope with that. I know firsthand,  personally, both the victories and pitfalls of families who have dealt with  children with learning disabilities.  I know the worry and concern parents feel when they entrust the most  precious being in their lives to the care  of a stranger. Head Start personnel  need to be trained, my colleagues, to  mitigate these many concerns, and of  course to provide meaningful guidance  when a family faces a new challenge.  So families with children with disabilities need support. Proper training  of Head Start employees will enable  them to anticipate possible challenges,  evaluate the current difficulties that  they may or may not have, and will  educate the employees in current strategies and resources which are available  to parents.  For parents’ piece of mind, it is imperative that those individuals caring  for their children are simply equipped  to handle any situation that may arise  in that classroom. If not convinced,  they will not send their child to the  Head Start program, which would deprive the child from needed preparation for school.  Now, for Head Start teachers, training will equip them with the necessary  tools, of course, to be successful. Many  human resources studies show the most  common cause for dissatisfaction with  a  job  is when  employees  feel  ill  equipped to meet the goals that are expected of them.  Now  this  dissatisfaction  is  compounded for educational professionals,  because when they fail to meet their  goals, they feel they have failed the  child. With proper training, teachers  will  feel empowered. They will have  greater understanding of  the underlying issues causing difficulty for that  child and will be armed with a strategy  to help them so they can ultimately  succeed.  Training can make that experience  teaching children with disabilities a  positive one instead of a negative one.  Now, there was a teacher who did not  feel properly trained, for example, to  teach a child with disabilities. When  required to include a student with disabilities in her classroom, she then received the necessary training to do it.  As a result, and this is a good clear example, this is what she said. ‘‘Ronnie is  truly my most favorite student and my  greatest accomplishment.’’ Now that is  a learning disability student. Bear with  me here.  ‘‘Thanks to him, I cannot  wait to get to school every morning to  see what he has learned today. Thanks  to him I feel proud to be a teacher  again. On November 3, 2001, I never  thought anything good could come out  from having him in my class. Little did  I know that he would be a great blessing for which I will always be thankful.’’  Our children deserve effective teachers. Children with a disability generally do not respond well to change.  We all know that. School is an enormous change that needs to be adequately prepared  for. When  starting  school,  they enter  that  simple, unknown world that scares them.  Many of the expectations are new.  Directions  from the teachers do not  make sense. They feel out of control  themselves and they feel sort of helpless. Teachers can ease that child’s  anxiety,  see when  they are  feeling  overwhelmed, and simply provide support, and, more importantly, guidance.  They are also able to give children  specific strategies to handle these feelings, their feelings on their own, so  that they in turn will feel more in control.

1169,62,2005-09-22,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in very strong support of this  amendment, which goes along with a  number of other amendments which we  have had, which is recognizing the fact  that when you are dealing with Head  Start you are dealing with a population that comes from 100 percent of  poverty or less, and you are dealing  with people who are going to have barriers in terms of their education. They  may be barriers in terms of where they  live or the ability of the parents to  care for them. They may be homeless  or foster children, as the sponsor has  pointed out; and I think it is only right  and  just and absolutely the correct  thing to do to increase that access.  In fact, perhaps that is more important than anything else we can do in  terms of the kinds of children we are  reaching out to, in terms of their background issues. So for that reason, I am  extremely supportive of this amendment, and I think it is a great deal of  help to what I believe is already a good  piece of legislation, and I encourage  each and every one of us to support it.

1173,62,2005-09-22,Mrs. MUSGRAVE.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  First of all, I want to commend the  chairman on the good work that he did.  This bill really increases competition  and accountability in the Head Start  Early Childhood Program.  b1430  While  the vast majority of Head  Start programs are of very high quality, I have been concerned about recent  reports of mismanagement in some of  the Head Start programs. That is why  I am pleased that H.R. 2123 infuses the  Head Start program with  increased  competition.  This amendment I am offering would  ensure competition and access to high-  quality services for these needy children. It would allow a for-profit agency  that can demonstrate that it can provide a higher level of services for the  same number of Head Start children at  a lower cost, to keep a small portion of  the administration’s savings as profit.  I firmly believe Congress should be  doing everything possible to encourage  the highest-quality providers  to become involved in Head Start. I believe  my amendment will provide an incentive  for high-quality  for-profit providers to apply for Head Start grants  and serve our Nation’s neediest students.  I would also like to point out that  for-profit entities are already an allowable grantee under current law, as well  as H.R. 2123, so we would not be setting  a new precedent in terms of for-profit  participation in the program.  My amendment is bipartisan. It is  supported by the National Child Care  Association and the Early Care and  Education Consortium. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  Ohio  (Chairman BOEHNER), and commend the gentleman for his good work.  ",2005
1174,62,2005-09-22,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentlewoman for her amendment. I think it is a very good amendment.  Under current law, a for-profit entity  can apply to be a local grantee to a  Head Start program, but you are not  allowed to make a profit. This has been  in the law for some time. Given what  we are trying to accomplish in terms of  helping children be ready for school, we  ought to have all of the providers possible. If there is an entity out there  who  thinks  they  can provide Head  Start with a very high-quality program  and make a profit, we ought to allow  them the opportunity to apply and be  in the program. That is all this amendment does. It does not guarantee that  they are ever going to get a grant.  I am a big believer in competition, a  big believer in the private sector and  innovative solutions. Given the challenge we have with low-income children  in  very  low-income  neighborhoods, anything we can do to bring  more high-quality innovative services  to those children, we ought to take  that chance, and so I support the gentlewoman’s amendment.

1175,69,2005-09-22,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  to oppose  the Boustany amendment  to  the  School Readiness Act of 2005 (H.R. 2123).  This amendment would abolish long standing  civil  rights protections  that ensure  federally  funded jobs in the Head Start program are not  subject to discrimination.  At a time when 37 million Americans endure  the plight of poverty, Congress is tragically debating an amendment that would undermine a  successful anti-poverty program. Head Start  provides disadvantaged children with a genuine head start in life to outrun the clutches of  limited opportunities. While H.R. 2123 is not a  perfect bill, it positively maintains the successful federal-to-local structure of Head Start and  wisely promotes ‘‘smart accountability.’’  Mr. Chairman,  the Boustany amendment  needlessly dismantles  the bipartisan spirit of  the underlying bill  in an attempt  to rectify a  nonexistent problem. For decades, faith-based  organizations that provide Head Start services  have ably met the needs of children, while adhering  to  the  law protecting  their 198,000  teachers and 1.4 million volunteers from employment  discrimination.  The  Boustany  amendment would  repeal  those protections,  allowing  faith-based Head Start providers  to  establish a ‘‘religious test’’ to dictate personnel  decisions for positions funded with federal tax  dollars.  In  fact,  the Boustany amendment  could  allow discrimination on practically any basis.  Those whose race, gender, or lifestyle are not  aligned with a particular interpretation of faith  could be prohibited from federally funded employment under  the guise of preserving religious expression. For  instance,  in deciding  who gets hired and fired from Head Start, do  we really want an individual’s position on contraception or creationism to be equally as relevant  as  their  professional  qualifications?  Head Start teachers should be judged not by  faith, but by teaching ability.  That  is why hundreds of  faith-based and  civil rights organizations are leading the fight  against  this discriminatory amendment. The  Boustany amendment is a poison pill that represents  the worst of partisan politics. At a  hearing held by the Government Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy  and Human Resources, of which  I am  the  Ranking Member, David Kuo, former Deputy  Director of the White House Office of Faith-  Based  and Community  Initiatives,  testified  that:  ‘‘At the same time, many members of the  president’s own party expressed equal parts  apathy and antipathy  towards  this agenda.  Money for the poor? Why it will just get wasted, they said . . . all we really need to do is  make sure that we have a huge political fight  over religious charities right  to hire and  fire  based on  their own  faith. That way Republicans will be seen as fighting for religion and  Democrats will be seen as fighting against it.  ‘It is a good fight to have,’ I heard time and  again. A good fight for partisanship perhaps,  but less good for the poor.’’  His words are telling of how some in this  body are using religion  to divide  the nation  and to enact federally subsidized discrimination. That is most unfortunate.  As many of my colleagues have pointed out  and I will repeat for emphasis—current law already supports the notion that faith-based organizations can use its own private funds to  decide who it wants to hire on the basis of religion, they simply cannot discriminate in hiring  with American taxpayers’ dollars. Discrimination with federal dollars is the real issue, not  faith-based organizations providing Head Start  services. Faith-based organizations are and  will continue to be critical partners in providing  these services.  Mr. Chairman, in this new century so rich  with opportunities to right the wrongs of our  past,  let us embrace our democratic values  and put the needs of our children ahead of  partisan political interests. I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the Boustany amendment, and if passed, to vote ‘‘no’’ on final passage.  ",2005
1176,69,2005-09-22,Mr. RUSH.," Mr. Chairman, today we are debating whether or not we should repeal civil  rights provisions in Head Start reauthorization,  and allow religious organizations that use federal funding to discriminate in hiring and firing  based on an individual’s religious beliefs. In a  time when we are forcefully trying to persuade  other countries to include protections against  religious discrimination in their constitutions, it  is astounding that we are here, in the United  States Congress, trying to repeal these same  protections for our own citizens.  As a practicing ordained minister, I find the  Boustany amendment to be unnecessary, unwise, and unproductive. The Boustany amendment would allow  religious organizations  to  waive civil rights protections that nonreligious  organizations must abide by. The provisions  that currently govern Head Start have been in  place and have been working effectively  for  decades. Religious organizations operate over  5 percent of all Head Start programs, abiding  by the civil rights provisions, and there is no  need for Congress to take this unprecedented  step  that Mr. BOUSTANY is proposing. Never  before has Congress ever repealed existing  civil rights protections by adopting an amendment on the House Floor, without the benefit  of committee hearings, debate, or expert testimony.  In  fact, H.R. 2123,  the School Readiness  Act, passed  through  the Education and  the  Workforce Committee by a bipartisan, unanimous 48–0 vote. Now, some Members of  Congress are attempting to sabotage this bill  by  attaching  this  unconstitutional,  divisive  amendment  to  it. Maybe  this  is a way  for  Members who are against Head Start anyway,  to try and derail the program. Mr. BOUSTANY  knows  that Democrats will note vote  for an  amendment that allows federally funded organizations  to discriminate against any Americans on any grounds.  Republicans are trying to make us choose  between early childcare for our neediest students and civil rights protections for the rest of  our citizens. I wonder what the real motivation  is behind bringing up this amendment.  It  is  truly a shame  that Members of  this  House are playing politics with a bill that affects millions of our young children, and which  millions of Americans have come to trust and  rely on. No, Mr. Speaker, I will not vote for a  bill that repeals civil rights protections. I will  not vote for federally funded discrimination. It  is unconscionable that Members of Congress  would try to reverse the progress that we have  made on civil rights in this country. What message are we sending to the rest of the world,  including  the newly-established democracies  struggling to find a balance between religious  freedom and civil  liberties  in  their own  laws  and constitutions?  Adopting the Boustany amendment will send  our country in the wrong direction. This is just  another example of where  the Republican  Leadership wants to take our country, and I  hope all our citizens are watching carefully. I  urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the Boustany amendment.  ",2005
1177,69,2005-09-22,Mr. BOUSTANY.," Mr. Chairman, on September 22, 2005, I returned to my district to  prepare  for Hurricane Rita, which was projected to hit southwest Louisiana, and I was  unable to be present during House consideration of H.R. 2123, ‘‘School Readiness Act of  2005.’’ Had I been present, I planned to offer  an amendment  that would allow  faith-based  Head Start providers to participate in the program and maintain the character of their organization through their employment practices. I  would like to thank my colleague, Representative  for  introducing  this  amendment in my absence.  It  is critical  that  faith-based organizations  that are willing to serve their communities by  participating  in  federal  programs  are  not  forced to give up who they are to participate.  They cannot be expected to sustain their religious mission without the ability to employ individuals who share the tenets and practices  of their faith or who are dedicated to upholding  the values of the organization. These groups  should not be forced to abandon who they are  because they want to assist the community;  we lose too many good people who want to  help when we put that barrier in their way.  Now, more than ever before, we are seeing  first hand  the good work  these groups are  doing in my region of the country. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, faith-based organizations were among the first to reach out a  hand in service to those impacted by the disaster.  The 1964 Civil Rights Act makes  it clear  that faith-based groups have a federally protected right to maintain their religious nature  and character through those they hire. If we  do not include the provision to allow them to  exercise their right we are continuing to discourage potential providers, who could provide  needed  learning  experiences,  from  participating in the program.  Let me be clear, we are not talking about  discrimination—nothing in the amendment will  allow a  faith-based provider  to discriminate.  The Boehner amendment merely allows faith-  based providers to exercise their rights under  the Civil Rights Act and help their neighbors  by participating in this federal program.

Earlier this year, Afghanistan’s President  Hamid Karzai came to Washington to  ensure the American people that these  elections would be a resounding success  in the face of terrorists, and he was  right.  Even though Taliban terrorists killed  five candidates and four election workers leading up to the election and on  Sunday murdered another 15 people,  election turnout was still impressive.  Despite the danger, the Afghani people’s thirst for democracy was great.  The vote was also a major milestone  for Afghan women who have long been  oppressed. There were 580 female candidates, or 10 percent of the total.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the Afghanistan nation is strengthening and  unifying the body of its parliament, allowing the Afghanistan citizens to operate as a collective action.  AMERICA’S GOLD STAR MOTHERS  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, today I would like to recognize our Gold Star Mothers, a special  group of American women who have  lost either a son or daughter through  service to our country.  Although these mothers have experienced a parent’s greatest fear, they remain dedicated to supporting our military. By helping the men and women  who serve in our Armed Forces, they  are honoring their child’s service in a  positive way. Gold Star Mothers volunteer  in our military hospitals, show  compassion to our veterans, and care  for  the  families of  servicemembers.  Their selflessness and generosity is an  inspiration to all of us.  As the father of three sons who are  currently serving  in the military,  I  would like to express my appreciation  for their support. Gold Star Mothers  are making a difference in the lives of  thousands of people.  On Sunday, I would like to encourage  all Americans to take a moment to observe Gold Star Mothers Day in their  communities.  In conclusion, God bless our troops  and we will never forget September 11.  f  b1700  SPECIAL ORDERS  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  SODREL).

1188,76,2005-09-22,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF) is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2005
1189,76,2005-09-22,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker, last week  I introduced the Fostering Our Future  Act of 2005, a bill to help our Nation’s  foster youth by strengthening dependency  courts  and  requiring  accountability. Foster care is a critical safety  net for half a million abused and neglected American children.  It is, however, a system in need of  drastic  reform and greater  support.  Twenty percent of all foster kids will  be forced to wait over 5 years for a  safe, permanent family. Even worse, almost 20,000 older youth age out of the  system without the assistance of a permanent family every year.  Frequent foster home transfers create  turbulence  and  insecurity  that  heighten the emotional behavior and  educational challenges faced by these  youth. The doubling of the foster care  population since the early 1980s compounded this problem by creating enormous caseloads and taxing the capacity  of foster homes. The end result is that  foster kids, through no fault of their  own, are more  likely  to experience  homelessness,  unemployment,  and  other life course problems despite their  courageous resilience.  Imagine what it is like to be 8 years  old, neglected by your parents and then  taken away from them, living with a  family that is not your own, confused  by the court proceedings that govern  your future, frightened that you might  be transferred to another home and  alienated and from your peers who talk  about mom and dad. Imagine what that  feels like.  These children deserve better. They  should  be  guaranteed  physical  and  emotional  safety. They  should have  continuing  relationships with  caregivers and  loved ones. They  should  have an informed voice in the legal decisions made about their  lives. And  they should enter early adulthood prepared to live a healthy, happy, and productive life. We have a responsibility  to these children to meet these goals,  and anything less is unacceptable.  Practitioners and policy experts have  conducted thorough analyses and advanced proposals to overhaul the foster  care system. The most prominent is a  comprehensive 2004 report by the bipartisan Pew Commission, and identified  several areas where the Federal Government can  support  these kids by  strengthening the Nation’s foster care  systems.  The Pew report found that State dependency court systems are failing to  sufficiently track cases, and trained  personnel, unlike State child welfare  agencies, they did not receive Federal  funds to do so.  Interagency collaboration and performance measurement, where  they  exist, are inconsistent, both within and  between State systems, and tend to  focus  on  bureaucratic needs  rather  than outcomes.  Finally, these systems struggle to retain  qualified  dependency  attorneys  VerDate Aug 31 2005  07:24 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H22SE5.REC H22SE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005
1190,97,2005-09-22,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Madam President, I  am pleased that the Senate has approved H.R. 2744, the fiscal year 2006  appropriations  bill  providing  vital  funding for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration  and related agencies. While I may not  support every provision, this bill provides important funding to support our  Nation’s  farmers, rural communities,  and conservation programs along with  providing nutritious food for seniors,  children and those in need.  I am pleased that the Appropriations  Committee rejected a number of administration proposals  to  reduce or  eliminate important programs such as  funds  for research at our  land-grant  colleges and universities, conservation  partnerships  through  resource  conservation and development  councils,  and funds to combat Johne’s disease in  our dairy industry. All of these programs were funded at a minimum of  last year’s levels instead of receiving  drastic cuts.  After years of delay, I was encouraged  that  the Senate bill  included  funds to implement mandatory country-of-origin labeling, COOL, for meat,  vegetables and  fruits. Country-of-origin labeling is vitally important to enable our farmers to show their pride in  the quality of their products, from ginseng  to cheese  to cranberries. Wisconsin farmers are proud of their work,  and many consumers want to support  American  products—with  country-of-  origin labeling, both farmers and consumers benefit. I urge the Senate conferees to insist on funding COOL when  they meet with the House conferees to  resolve differences between  the  two  Chambers’ bills.  ALLARD The Senate bill included over $18 million for efforts to control and eradicate  chronic wasting disease, CWD, in deer  and elk. In addition to this much needed funding, I also worked with Senator  to  include a provision that  would require the Department of Agriculture  to  set minimum  national  standards for CWD control. Under the  current system there are various State  regulations but no set of basic procedures guiding the movement, handling,  testing  and  permitting  of  captive-  raised deer and elk. Our amendment,  that was included as part of the bill,  requires the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service to publish its uniform  methods and  rules  concerning CWD  within 90 days of enactment of the provision. With CWD being newly discovered in New York and West Virginia, it  is clear that this disease requires a national response. This provision is an  important step to prevent the further  spread of CWD and help deer and elk  farmers operate safely throughout the  Nation.  High fuel costs are putting a squeeze  on all Americans, but our farmers are  in a particularly vulnerable position.  While the high fuel costs are hitting  them at many levels, they have little  flexibility in whether to plant and harvest their  fields, pay to move their  products  to market or procure  fertilizer and feed. More than that, they  receive what the market dictates for  their products, so when fuel costs double or triple and they see  fuel surcharges on every one of their bills,  they can’t pass these costs on and receive a higher price  for their milk,  grain or other products. In recognition  of this difficult situation, I was proud  to cosponsor an amendment offered by  Senator SALAZARthat was included in  the bill as a first step to addressing  this problem. The amendment requires  the Department  of Agriculture  to  study the issue and issue a report on  the impact to farmers.  I also submitted an amendment to  the bill to require the Food and Drug  Administration, FDA,  to  conduct a  study on the levels of pesticides in domestic  and  imported  ginseng. With  Wisconsin ginseng being highly prized  worldwide for its quality and lack of  unsafe residues, mislabeled  imported  ginseng, often with high levels of pesticide residues, remains a problem for  our producers. This study would have  investigated  this  issue and provided  important information to focus FDA’s  enforcement activities on reducing the  amount of unsafe ginseng being passed  off as Wisconsin- or U.S.-grown and  helping growers fight back against this  unfair competition. I was disappointed  that I was blocked from having this  amendment included in the bill. Despite this setback, I will continue to  fight for better enforcement to protect  consumers  and Wisconsin’s  ginseng  growers.  ",2005
1191,97,2005-09-22,Mr.  DODD.," Madam  President,  I  thank Senator BENNETT and Senator  for their efforts as floor manKOHL agers of H.R. 2744, the Agriculture appropriations bill, and for their willingness to include in that legislation an  amendment that I offered along with  Senators  REED,  CARPER,  HARKIN,  BIDEN, and LIEBERMAN.  Our amendment, No. 1818, expresses  the sense of the Congress that the Food  and Drug Administration, FDA, should  act within 1 year to issue comprehensive  labeling guidelines  for over-the-  counter, OTC,  sunscreen products—a  so-called ‘‘final monograph.’’ The FDA  began work to develop such a monograph in 1978. In 2002, after 24 years, the  agency issued a final monograph. Unfortunately, the final sunscreen monograph failed to address one of the most  critical aspects of sunscreens—how to  measure protection against UVA rays,  which are responsible for causing skin  cancer. Because the final monograph  failed to address this key issue, the  FDA stayed it until a comprehensive  monograph could be issued in order to  avoid consumer confusion and the need  for unnecessary product relabeling.  That stay was issued nearly 4 years  ago, and the FDA has yet to issue a  comprehensive final monograph. Sunscreen manufacturers need clear guidance on product labeling in order to  provide consumers with crucial information about the protective benefits of  sunscreen  products.  Studies  have  shown that skin cancer rates continue  to rise, especially  in younger adults  and women.  Furthermore, in the face of FDA inaction, States are poised to  fill the  void, raising the specter of a patchwork of  state  labeling  requirements  that could be confusing to consumers  and unnecessarily burdensome to manufacturers. Pursuant to section 751 of  the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act, FFDCA, which was enacted  in  1997, a Federal rule on sunscreen labeling would preempt any related State  labeling requirements. But this preemption does not apply in the absence  of a Federal rule. A recent decision by  the Los Angeles Superior Court held  that, because there  is no  final FDA  monograph for sunscreens, the FFDCA  does not preempt California State labeling  and  advertising  laws.  Consequently, California State law can require specific labeling for sunscreens  sold in California.  The FFDCA expresses Congress’ view  that national uniformity of sunscreen  labels  is  important to providing all  consumers with equal access to valuable  information about the need  for  sunscreens to reduce the risk of skin  cancer. As such, under Public Law 105–  115, the Food and Drug Modernization  and Accountability Act of 1997, Congress intended the FDA, which has the  requisite scientific and medical expertise, to prescribe labels for sunscreen  products.  In March 1999, in a letter to FDA  Commissioner Jane Henney, Senator  REEDand I expressed similar concerns  about the agency’s protracted delay in  issuing  a  comprehensive  final OTC  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:19 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S22SE5.REC S22SE5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005

1198,118,2005-09-22,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President,  this  amendment would plus-up the Readjustment Counseling Service’s funding  by $10 million. RCS is the arm of VA  that operates  the Vet Centers  that  many of us know so well. Vet Centers  have  traditionally  provided  needed  counseling services to veterans of the  Vietnam War in community-based settings for over two decades.  Now, in the midst of Operations Iraqi  Freedom and Enduring Freedom, the  mission of the Vet Centers has been expanded to include outreach and counseling for service members, including  members of the Guard and Reserve,  who are returning from these conflicts.  By providing the Vet Centers with an  additional $10 million in funding, VA  would be able to hire additional professional family therapists at Vet Centers  nationwide to provide services to family members of veterans deeply affected by their service in combat. The  readjustment period can be difficult for  the entire family.  We have  all heard  the  statistics  emerging from the groups that have already come back from OIF and OEF.  Families and marriages have suffered  due to rough transitions, and many  have resulted in divorce.  These additional  funds would also  augment Vet Centers  in underserved  rural communities and would expand  the capacity for these centers to provide  readjustment  services  to  those  veterans who may struggle with obtaining access because they live in a  remote area.  Surviving family members of those  servicemen who  paid  the  ultimate  price, will  be  able  to  find  solace  through the Vet Center’s bereavement  counseling program. Vet Centers would  be able to hire more bereavement counselors to provide counseling for those  who must endure the pain of losing a  family member in combat.  Finally, I point out that in his testimony to the Committee on Veterans’  Affairs this past June, VA Secretary  Nicholson stated that only $8 million  would be required for additional services that were already being  implemented by the Vet Center program,  such as providing additional outreach  workers. We need to make sure that  these services are secure by providing  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:19 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S22SE5.REC S22SE5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005
1199,125,2005-09-22,Mr. OBAMA.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to support this important piece  of legislation. As many of you know,  the young soldiers returning from Iraq  and Afghanistan are already coming  home with post traumatic stress disorder. A recent Army study found that  one  in six soldiers  in  Iraq reported  symptoms of major depression. Some  experts predict that more than 100,000  soldiers may need some kind of mental  health  treatment when  they  come  home.  It is not only our patriotic duty to  provide these soldiers with the benefits  they deserve; it is our moral duty at  the most fundamental level. Unfortunately, PTSD is a disease that is still  all too often misunderstood, and as I  speak, there are efforts at the VA to  require those folks who suffer PTSD to  undergo additional scrutiny in the disability benefits process.  According to VA, it will review 72,000  cases in which the maximum amount  of PTSD disability benefits was awarded. The rationale for reviewing these  cases is VA’s belief that 2.5 percent of  these cases are  ‘‘potentially  fraudulent.’’ But notably, this review will entirely ignore cases in which benefits  may have been unjustly denied.  This review sends a troubling message to the brave men and women who  defended this country. Too many veterans see the VA as a bureaucracy with  the singular goal of denying services  and benefits to veterans. This decision  to reopen only approved PTSD claims  merely serves to promote that impression.  It is unconscionable for our Government to put the onus on law-abiding  veterans to affirmatively demonstrate  that they are not engaging in fraud.  The process of gathering evidence to  prove PTSD disability  is  extremely  time consuming.

1209,139,2005-09-22,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor Po’pay, a man who  through his  life and philosophy  inspired New Mexicans to unite and share  their experiences of life, happiness, and  customs, with a marble statue sculpted  by Cliff Fragua of Jemez Pueblo. It will  be  the  one-hundredth  statue  to  be  added to the National Statuary Hall  collection. The statue of this remarkable leader of the Pueblo Revolt of 1680,  is a gift from the State of New Mexico  and was unveiled in the United States  Capitol Rotunda today.  Po’pay was born in Ohkay Owingeh,  San Juan Pueblo, in 1630. He was a  deeply humble man, with deep respect  for his Pueblo’s culture, language, traditions, and customs, and a dedication  to passing these things on to future  generations.  During the seventeenth century the  Pueblo way of life was seriously threatened. Some did not want the Pueblo  people to practice their language, culture, or traditions, depriving them of  their very core. Po’pay  successfully  united  the  separate Pueblo nations.  This group of some 150 Pueblo leaders  united against those who sought to destroy their way of life and prevailed.  Po’pay led this great revolt and the  fight for respect the Pueblo people deserved.  Through his devotion and commitment to the preservation of Pueblo culture, Po’pay played an  irreplaceable  role in helping to shape our Nation’s  future. By championing the customs  and traditional ways of his ancestors,  he  strengthened  and  preserved  the  Pueblo heritage for future generations,  bridging the rich Pueblo and Spanish  cultures of the Southwest. His dedication to this cause in response to the  challenges  the  Pueblo  community  faced is a testament to the spirit of  New Mexico.  This  statue will  forever be a  reminder of his leadership and courage in  keeping the Pueblo culture alive. The  statue of Po’pay will join the figure of  the late Senator Dennis Chavez that  stands proudly outside the doors of the  old Senate Chambers. It is a privilege  for New Mexico to be represented by  two men with such vision, leadership,  and courage.  The decision to honor Po’pay was  brought to the foreground during the  tercentennial commemoration of the  Pueblo Revolt by a unified group of  Pueblo leaders. Thanks to their leadership, in November of 1996 the tribal  council of Ohkay Owingeh, San Juan  Pueblo, made the nomination official  with a resolution. In 1997, State Senator Manny Aragon and Representative  Nick Salazar  introduced Senate Bill  404, which was passed and signed by  Governor Gary Johnson on April 10.  The nine member Statuary Hall Commission was  formed  and  the  fundraising began. Cliff Fragua of Jemez  Pueblo was selected to create the statue, and by May of 2005 the block of  Tennessee Marble  took  the  form of  Po’pay. Thanks to the vision of many  Pueblo leaders, the New Mexico Statuary Hall Commission and Foundation,  and New Mexico’s citizens, Po’pay shall  forever be honored in the halls of the  United Stated Capitol.  We honor and respect Po’pay’s accomplishments as the man who made it  possible for Pueblo culture to thrive  and sustain itself. Po’pay’s contributions made New Mexico what  it  is  today, a multicultural State, rich in  culture and spirit.  f  HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH  ",2005
1210,139,2005-09-22,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise to pay tribute to the Hispanic  community. As we commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to recognize the contributions made by millions of Hispanics to our Nation. The  greatness of California  is that  it  is  truly a multicultural State and I am  honored to represent California’s Hispanic community in the U.S. Senate.  This month we celebrate a community  that believes  in  the American  goals of freedom, opportunity, and a  chance to build a better life. In pursuing these aspirations, Hispanics have  made enormous contributions to life in  the United States through business,  politics, science, culture, sports, and  entertainment. Hispanics have served  in the armed services with bravery and  courage and many have made the ultimate sacrifice in giving their lives for  the  common  good  of  our  country.  Through  their  service,  they  have  brought honor to America and their  Hispanic heritage—a rich heritage from  which all of America benefits.  Today, I rise to honor the sacrifices  that these brave Americans and their  families have made.  I also want to  honor Hispanic heroes and heroines,  such as the late Cesar Chavez. Indeed,  Hispanics are changing the way America looks at itself. Today there are 31  million Hispanics in the U.S. By 2050,  our Nation’s Hispanic population  is  projected to reach 96 million—an increase of more than 200 percent.  Hispanics are making their mark; between 1984 and 1998 Hispanic voting increased nationwide  in midterm elections by 27 percent, even as overall  voter turnout declined by 13 percent. In  my own State of California, where  nearly 11.5 million Hispanics comprise  over 32 percent of the population, Hispanics are participating and contributing to civic life in important ways.  Two of the California State  legislature’s three highest offices are occupied  by Hispanics:  Lt. Gov.  Cruz  Bustamante and Speaker of the Assembly Fabian Nun˜ez. On the local level,  the people of Los Angeles elected Antonio Villaraigosa as the first Hispanic  mayor in over a century, and 20 percent of Los Angeles’ city council seats  are held by Hispanics. The Hispanic  community has provided great leadership for California, and will provide important leadership for our country.  Hispanics are visibly successful  in  other areas as well. From Sammy Sosa  in sports to Jennifer Lopez, Andy Garcia, and Salma Hayek in the entertainment industry, Hispanics have added  greatly to the fabric of our Nation.  We must not forget the critical contributions Hispanics have made to education and  science. The  1995 Nobel  Prize Winner in Chemistry, Dr. Mario  Molina, joined the University of California, San Diego last year, and Dr.  Eduardo Macagno is the founding dean  of the Division of Biological Sciences  at the same University.  A democratic and prosperous society  should not step back from a national  commitment to provide assistance to  those who strive to achieve the American dream, despite the odds. In particular, I want to emphasize the importance of quality education for the success of Hispanic children. The University of California system alone enrolled  nearly 25,000 Hispanic undergraduate  and graduate students last year. Hispanic youths are a great  source of  strength and hope for the future of this  Nation and they should be able to participate fully in the American experience; that is the primary reason why I  have been a strong supporter of the  DREAM Act.  Mr. President, I am proud to honor  California’s Hispanic community and  to have the opportunity to ensure that  Hispanic contributions and sacrifices  do not go unnoticed.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  HONORING SHERI GARMON  ∑",2005
1211,139,2005-09-22,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, it is with  a heavy heart that I wish to announce  the death of Sheri Garmon, one of  many  Idahoans who have died  from  cancer that was likely attributable to  nuclear fallout.  Like others, Sheri spent time and energy bringing awareness of this issue as  it related to Idaho. However, Sheri,  who was fighting multiple cancers, became a charismatic spokesperson for  those suffering from the same fate.  Sheri Garmon, daughter of Don and  Millie Garmon, was born in Emmett,  ID, in 1952. When Sheri was just a baby,  just 6 months old, the National Cancer  Institute estimates that on a single  day, June 5, 1952, she received 75 rads of  iodine-131.

1222,167,2005-09-22,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, I want to express  my disappointment about a vote  that was  taken in this House last week.  The House  took up very  important,  long  overdue  legislation  to protect America’s children and keep despicable predators off our  streets.  However, an abominable amendment was  offered by a Democrat that had no business  being a part of the Children’s Safety Act.  The noble and monumental Children’s Safety Act was tainted by the Conyers amendment  that seeks to punish people for their thoughts,  specifically  if  they believe homosexuality  is  wrong.  While considering a great Republican bill  that will crack down on pedophiles, rapists and  murderers,  the self-motivated Democrats  instead took the opportunity to further their out  of touch agenda.  I voted against the Conyers amendment and  I am truly saddened that it passed.  The Children’s Safety Act  is so  important  and will do so much good in our country that  I still voted for final passage despite the inclusion of this awful, unrelated amendment.  The opportunity to vote to protect American  children from monstrous criminals could not be  declined simply because there was a blemish  on otherwise outstanding legislation.  f  RECOGNIZING RYAN E.

1223,167,2005-09-22,Mr. GRAVES.," Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause  to recognize Ryan E. Jones, son of Chris and  HON. MARK UDALL  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 22, 2005  ",2005
1224,167,2005-09-22,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to acknowledge the 50th Anniversary of  McGuckin’s Hardware Store in Boulder, Colorado. McGuckin’s  is a  landmark  in Boulder  and has long had a very special reputation for  stocking hard-to-find items.  McGuckin’s was opened  in 1955 by Bill  McGuckin, a  rugged outdoorsman and avid  fisherman. The store originally consisted of  only  four employees and  four departments  with  a  business  ethic  based  on  Bill  McGuckin’s belief in personalized service, selection, and  first-hand experience.  In 1960,  Dave Hight joined his father-in-law, Bill, as a  partner, and  together  they committed  themselves to fostering McGuckin’s well-deserved  reputation as ‘‘the Greatest Hardware Store in  the World.’’  After Mr. McGuckin’s passing in 1966, Mr.  Hight continued the excellent service and selection offered  to customers. His company  continued to grow over the next 50 years, and  today, this independently-owned business has  prospered to employ 315 individuals in all its  operations. In addition to its 60,000+ square  foot sales  floor with over 200,000  items  for  sale, there is a Design Center and a Distribution Center nearby to meet every customer’s  need. You name it, they have it. When there’s  a problem with something they sell, they fix it.  In the unlikely event they don’t have that particular something for which you were looking,  their knowledgeable, experienced staff knows  where to order it and does so with a friendly  manner and without a fuss.  Not surprisingly, McGuckin’s has developed  a loyal and devoted clientele. Boulder’s Daily  Camera readers have voted it ‘‘Best Hardware  Store,’’ ‘‘Best Locally-Owned Store’’ and ‘‘Best  Customer Service.’’ ‘‘Best Customer Service’’  is an understatement; McGuckin’s employees  are beyond comparison. They wear green and  are found in almost every aisle. You can still  find Dave Hight in the middle aisle. They give  plain, old-fashioned, perfect service with no  hovering or hard-sell. No matter which department they work in, they all know where everything in the store is located.  McGuckin’s quality service doesn’t stop with  humans either; this store welcomes pets on-  leash too. As dog-lovers on my staff will tell  you, most of Boulder’s best-behaved dogs and  puppies began  refining  their social skills by  shopping  in McGuckin’s pet supply department. Employees dressed in green will greet  customers and  their pets and will often ask  permission  to give  the dog a  treat. While  I  have never tried one, I am reliably informed by  pet owners  that  if you give permission,  the  most  ‘‘delectable  tidbits’’ come out of  those  green smock pockets. McGuckin’s  is,  therefore, not only a big hit with people working on  their week-end home improvement projects, it  is also popular with Boulder’s canine population.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in acknowledging David Hight and his employees for their commitment to uniquely serving  their customers. If you’re ever visiting Boulder,  I hope  you’ll have  the  chance  to go  to  McGuckin’s. You won’t be sorry and you won’t  find any store like it in this day and age. I congratulate David Hight and all the employees  and their families on this 50th Anniversary and  wish  them good health and happiness  in  McGuckin’s future.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF BILL AND  MARGURITE ADDISON  HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 22, 2005  ",2005
1225,167,2005-09-22,Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.," Mr. Speaker, William and Margurite Addison are a wonderful  couple who have provided a permanent home  for  five children who were part of  the State  foster care system. Although the Addisons had  thought their childrearing years were finished  when  their own biological children had become young adults (Ms. Addison has four biological children, ranging in age from 34 to 41,  and Mr. Addison has two birth children, ages  29 and 35), they opened their home to one of  Mr. Addison’s nephews, Ralph, (now age 17)  in 1992. The Addisons became approved foster parents  for Ralph  in 1994 and subsequently decided to open their home to non-relative foster children when they realized how  many children were in desperate need of out-  of-home care.  In 1998, the Addisons were approved as an  adoptive resource for Ralph and their adoption  was subsequently  finalized  that year. However, that was only the first of what ultimately  became  five adoptions.  In 1999, Malik (now  age 9) was adopted, Kevin (now age 3), was  adopted  in 2000, Warren  (now age 6) was  adopted  in 2003, and Bryleigh (now age 3)  was adopted in 2004. Except for Ralph, each  of  these children had come  to  the Addison  home via the foster care system as drug-exposed infants (none of them are related). In  addition, Warren suffers from sickle-cell anemia, as well as emotional/behavioral difficulties. Ralph has  received special education  services in school and it is likely Warren will  also need a special school setting.

1226,174,2005-09-22,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule to provide for consideration of  H.R. 250, the Manufacturing Technology Competitiveness Act. The  rule did not make  in  order an amendment  that  I submitted which  would have elevated the advisory committee,  present now and codified by H.R. 250, to a  Presidential Council on Manufacturing. The  amendment would have broadened the diversity of the Council and provided much needed  accountability to their strategic role.  If our manufacturing industry and our manufacturing jobs are truly as important as much  rhetoric suggests, we owe it to Americans in  the industry to create a council that has the  ear of our President.  As many of us know, the Council on Manufacturing has been in existence since last year  and is now solely comprised of industry representatives. My amendment would broaden  the diversity of those that sit on the panel to  include labor, research, and academia, bringing a much needed voice  to  individuals adversely affected by and who have expertise in  the current state of manufacturing.  Furthermore,  under my  amendment,  the  President’s Manufacturing Council would be  directed to develop a National Manufacturing  Strategy with clear  issues  to consider and  specific reports to be submitted to Congress.  As it stands currently, the Advisory Council  is not carrying out its responsibilities as envisioned by H.R. 250, which assigns responsibilities to the Council to review federal manufacturing R&D and to review the actions of the  Interagency Working Group on Manufacturing  R&D. The Council has accomplished neither  of these stated goals.  Perhaps most astonishing, according to the  Commerce Department staff, the Council does  not have an agenda for the coming year, nor  were they certain that such an agenda would  even be developed.  The National Council  for Advanced Manufacturing reported on the Bush Manufacturing  Initiative suggesting  that  the Council have a  more expansive role, that they have a strong  Congressional mandate, and  that  the committee be chaired by the Secretary of Commerce.  My colleagues, I believe it is clear that the  Council as it stands now does not meet these  recommendations.  We have seen drastic changes in manufacturing  jobs  in  this country,  transfer of entire  operations overseas, and communities deeply  affected by these changes.  While  there  is much disagreement  in  this  body about how to tackle the problems affiliated with  the changing climate of our workforce, I seldom hear disagreement that there  is an ongoing change  in  the U.S. manufacturing sector.  Unfortunately, this rule will not allow us to  consider the design of the Council. I urge a  ‘no’ vote on the rule so that we may have the  opportunity  to proactively address  the problems of the manufacturing industry and to fulfill  a promise to working Americans in the sector  that we value their industry and their contribution to our nation.  We will not sit idly by while our neighbors  lose their jobs and their way of life.  Vote no so that we may task this Council  with a strong mandate and a clear role.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF ANDRE LOUIS  AND THE ‘‘RIDE FOR THE AGES’’  HON. GARY L.

1227,174,2005-09-22,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in recognition of Andre Louis, a selfless and  inspirational  individual who  completed  his  ‘‘Ride for the Ages’’ on September 11, 2005.  On August 10, Mr. Louis began a 3,300 mile  journey by bicycle across the United States in  an effort to raise awareness of the importance  of maintaining physical health for senior citizens. Andre, the Psychiatric Services Coordinator at the Margaret Tietz Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Jamaica, New York, was inspired by his experiences working with aging  individuals suffering from serious health problems.  On his way from San Francisco to Jamaica,  Andre, who himself is nearing retirement age,  stopped at various American Association of  Homes and Services for the Aging facilities to  meet with and inspire staff members and patients alike. Accompanied by family members  along the way, Andre has dedicated the ‘‘Ride  for the Ages’’ to his daughter, Michele, who  survived leukemia as a result of a bone marrow transplant from her brother Jean-Daniel.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is with great pride  that  I  commend Andre Louis  for his altruism and  dedication to the health of our seniors. He is  truly a determined individual and an inspiration  to us all. I ask my colleagues in the House of  Representatives to please join me in honoring  Andre Louis for his extraordinary undertaking  and wishing him many more years of success.  f  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT L.

1228,174,2005-09-22,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize  the outstanding service of Robert L.  Goldich, a Specialist in National Defense with  the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of the Congressional Research Service.  Mr. Goldich is retiring after 33 years at CRS.  During this time, he has provided Members of  Congress with perspective and analysis on a  broad  range of  topics  in military manpower  and personnel policy, military history, Department of Defense organization, prisoner of war  (POW) and missing  in action  (MIA)  issues,  and major aspects of overall U.S. defense policy.  During his career, Mr. Goldich excelled at  working with Members of Congress and congressional staff on many issues. He is an expert on such issues as military retirement, military compensation and benefits, officer personnel management, military education and  training; as well as the draft and all-volunteer  force, military  reserve components and  the  National Guard, and U.S. defense organization  and management  including  the Goldwater-  Nichols Act and the Reserve Officer Personnel  Management Act. He received a CRS commendation for his service to Congress in 1987,  and in 1991 he received a CRS meritorious  award for his service to Congress during the  Persian Gulf War. He is the second youngest  person ever to graduate from the National War  College.  Mr. Goldich also served  twice as head of  CRS’s Military Manpower, Budget and Policy  Management Section and was responsible for  providing to Congress analytical capability on  a variety of defense issues associated with the  Department of Defense’s budget and policy  priorities. He received many accolades as a  supervisor and lead with dedication, analytical  skill, clear thinking, and fair-minded approach  in working with members of the Section. In addition to his work for Congress, Mr. Goldich’s  outside professional activities are impressive.  He was invited to participate in high level conferences, writing book reviews  for  the Army  Center of Military History, and having longtime  participatory memberships to the Inter-Agency  Seminar Group and the Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Mr.  Goldich for his many years of service and his  many contributions to congressional deliberations on defense related  issues.  I wish him  and his family all the best in the days ahead.  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:21 Sep 23, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22SE8.051 E22SEPT1 ",2005

Don’t,  in our  haste to leave here and go home for the  weekend, shrug our shoulders and say,  well,  someone will  take care of  it.  Don’t let our reticence or our reluctance to make the House come back  and do what is right cause us to turn a  deaf ear and a blind eye to the poorest  in our country.  I plead with my colleagues, let’s do  the  right  thing.  Let’s  adopt  this  amendment. The House can come back  later today. They can fix it. They can  make it right. It may be a little bit uncomfortable for them to get on an airplane and come back here, but think  about the discomfort of the poor in our  country, think about that elderly person who needs the LIHEAP program.  Think about their uncomfortableness.  They need us. Let’s not turn our backs  on them at this point in time.  ",2005
1243,4,2005-09-30,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, as the  Senator from Iowa knows, this Senator  completely supports Community Service Block Grant Programs. We both  serve on the Committee on Appropriations and serve on the subcommittee  that deals with this issue.  I tell the Senate, on these community service block grants, for every dollar that the Federal Government puts  up, more than $2 comes from outside  sources. They are not matching funds.  They put them up. They supply them.  This reduction in the House bill was  done to sort of have leverage over our  committee in conference.  The Senate bill which is carried by  the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania already has the full amount of  the request in it. All we have to do is  get that bill to conference, but it has  not been possible thus far. But when  this continuing resolution takes effect,  there will be allocated to the States  the money they need.  Beyond that, FEMA has all sorts of  money right now to assist the people  who  are  involved  in  the hurricane  areas. There is no reason to think anyone is going to be shut off in the disaster area from the community block  grant concept because FEMA will provide money to this agency if they are  short of money in this period ahead of  us because of the delay in getting the  Health and Human Services bill passed  by the Congress and sent to the President.  But what happens  if the Senator’s  amendment passes? We come to a halt  tonight.  We  have  already  reprogrammed money to the Department of  Defense from 2005 moneys in order to  carry them over until they get the  money from the Defense bill, when and  if it is passed.  We know we are in a period of delay  because of a lot of things, because of  the two major disasters, because of the  delay we have had in terms of being  able to confirm the nomination of the  Chief Justice. There has been a lot of  delay this year, and we are late. It is  not something new. We have been late  before and had continuing resolutions.  This matter the Senator has brought  up will not lead to people being denied  assistance because the States can advance their money for this period of 6  weeks, and it will be repaid when we  pass the bill. The Senate will hold the  money  for  the Community Services  Block Grants. We always have. It is  one of the things we have negotiated  with the House almost every year. The  Senator knows this. We go to conference almost every year, and  the  House has reduced this item. It is sort  of a little leverage in terms of negotiation with the Senator from Iowa, the  Senator  from Pennsylvania, both of  whom have done an excellent job with  Community Services Block Grants.  As I said, I support it. The chairman  of the committee supports it. We support the Community Services Block  Grant Program. It will be fully funded.  It has been fully funded in the bill that  is before the Senate. To delay this bill  now and delay  funding  for everyone  else because there is a little glitch here  that it could—it could—be read to be  something that is taking money, as a  practical matter, it carries the same  language that was in the continuing  resolution before when the minority  was in the majority. This is exactly  what happened before. It is the same  thing.  And it is a continuing resolution that  has to be passed. If it is not to the  President by tonight, funding stops for  everybody, not just a slight glitch in  the Community Services Block Grant.  I do not like to see people out there  who really depend upon the Federal  Government for assistance being told  somehow or other they are going to be  denied money. The money that comes  from the Federal Government is less  than a third of the money they get.  So we have a possibility of a slight  delay  in Federal money getting  to  them, but during that period, the non-  Federal money, both from States and  private sources, will meet the need. Beyond that, FEMA has money. We all  know we  gave  them  a  tremendous  amount of money to deal with those  who are in the disaster areas.  So I say to my friend from Iowa, this  is wrong. This is wrong. We will resolve  this difference with the House. We have  never  before  abandoned Community  Service Block Grants in the Senate. I  do not care which party has been in  charge over the Senate, we have supported this program. And we will. But  to threaten these people, to make it  sound as  though  somehow or other  they are going to put them out on the  street and they are not going to get  any assistance, that is wrong.  I tell the Senate, if we do not pass  this bill without amendment, not only  will the House be back here, we will be  back here for days wrangling over what  to do because we cannot get the House  back by midnight. We go into that period of all the slush that comes after  the funding runs out. And it is not an  easy sight.  We all remember the time it happened once before when the Government did shut down because of a dispute between the House and the Senate. It was resolved out at Andrews Air  Force Base about 9 days later, as I recall.  Now, at this time, after these two  disasters, is no time to put a question  on the availability of the  funds  for  every agency. If the Senator’s amendment is adopted, every agency is going  to have to say: What do we do? We  can’t spend any money from the 2006  account. They will not have this continuing resolution, a lot of them, to  spend from 2005 levels.  This  is chaos. We do not deserve  chaos in this country after the two disasters we have just come through. I say  to the Senate, it is absolutely wrong to  try to stop this continuing resolution  this year. We have troops in the field.  As I said, those of us on the Defense  Appropriations Committee have, this  last week, approved about seven different reprogrammings to make sure  funds are available tomorrow morning  for those people who need them who  are deployed overseas. So to stop these  funds, to stop this bill, would stop everything tonight.

1248,11,2005-09-30,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I am gratified that it was possible for the Senate  to consent to the adoption of amendment No.  1903,  offered  by Senator  SALAZARof Colorado. I am grateful to  Senator SALAZAR for introducing this  amendment, which will ensure  that  students attending a number of schools  receiving assistance through the Impact Aid program—including the Window Rock Unified School District located on the Navajo Nation  in Arizona—are not punished for administrative errors made by district personnel.  I am also grateful to the chairman and  ranking member of the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee  and  the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for consenting to the  inclusion of this amendment  in this  bill.  The Window Rock district is known  is a 100 percent impacted district. That  is, because the land it encompasses is  federally owned, it cannot rely on a  local property tax base to fund school  operations as most districts  in our  country can. It is important to note  that the administrative error that triggered this penalty—the loss of $1.2 million—was a one-time occurrence, and  that Senator ENZI, the chairman of the  committee with jurisdiction over this  matter plans to address that ongoing  administrative problem that has occurred here the next time Impact Aid  SALAZAR is reauthorized. Moreover, as Senator  rightly  emphasized,  the  money here is not new money but previously appropriated  funds  that had  been withheld.  There  is no question that district  must take pains to ensure that rules  and procedures are adhered to but in  this case I agree with Senator SALAZAR  that the penalty here was disproportionate and that,  in any case, punishing reservation schoolchildren is not  a particularly well-targeted penalty.  This amendment will rectify that, and  I am pleased that it will be accepted.  ",2005
1249,11,2005-09-30,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Is there  further debate on the amendment? The  question is on agreeing to the amendment.  The amendment (No. 1903) was agreed  to.  ,2005

1262,11,2005-09-30,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, yesterday, we had a hearing of the Senate  Armed Services Committee where we  had testify the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, General Myers; we had  General Casey, who is in charge of the  battles that are taking place over there  in Iraq at this time; we had General  Abizaid, and we had Secretary Rumsfeld.  About that time, we learned that, at  the behest of the ACLU, a Federal  judge  in New York by the name of  Alvin Hellerstein has ordered the Government to release more pictures of the  Abu Ghraib abuse. This is despite the  fact that General Myers said if you do  this, it will cost American lives. Apparently, Hellerstein missed  the Newsweek Koran debacle, where 15 people  were killed immediately after a bogus  report by that publication, Newsweek,  inciting  impulsive  violence  that  is  done on a case-by-case basis.  I think sooner or later we are going  to have to do something about it, try  to at least do all we can to make the  American people aware of the bias we  have in the media.  I have had occasion, since I am on  the Armed Services Committee,  to  probably be over  in Iraq more than  anyone else. On one trip, the Presiding  Officer was with me. All of us who have  been over there will remember that  every time we arrive the first thing the  troops say to us is: Why is it the American people don’t understand what we  are doing? Don’t they realize our country is under the greatest threat it has  ever had throughout its history? And  don’t they understand the resolve we  have and the fact that we know we are  risking our lives? And I say to them:  They do know it, in spite of the fact  that the media is wrong.  There is a lieutenant colonel by the  name of Tim Ryan. He was in the 1st  Calvary  in  Iraq. He actually  led a  group into Fallujah. I am going to read  one quote he made. He finally could  not take it any longer. He said:  The inaccurate picture they paint [talking  about the media] has distorted the world  view of the daily realities in Iraq. The result  is a further erosion of international support  for the United States’ efforts there, and a  strengthening of the insurgents’ resolve and  recruiting efforts while weakening our own.  Through their incomplete, uninformed and  unbalanced reporting, many members of the  media covering the war in Iraq are aiding  and abetting the enemy.  They are aiding and abetting  the  enemy. And to have this thing revived  on the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse—by  the way, I have to say this: Long before  the public was even made aware of it,  the military had gone in, taken the  necessary precautions, and had prosecuted those who were guilty. That was  done long before this came out in public.  Now, as far as the war is concerned,  I think it is very important for people  to know we are being very victorious in  the areas. It is a tough asymmetrical  type of threat, an enemy we have never  had before.  But I would suggest that on one of  the trips when I went there, we spent  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:42 Oct 01, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A30SE6.022 S30SEPT1 ",2005
1263,25,2005-09-30,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, Senator  WYDEN and I are introducing legislation today to change a provision in law  that was attendant to the emergency  supplemental passed recently dealing  with hurricane Katrina. That provision  in law increased the amount of money  that would be available to be spent on  a Government credit card from $2,500  to $250,000. That is right—$250,000 for  purchases  on  a Government  credit  card.  Here  is what a Government credit  card  looks  like.  There  are  about  390,000—somewhere  in that neighborhood—390,000 Government credit cards  in the country. I have three GAO reports that describe substantial abuse  and misuse of these Government credit  cards.  The proposal that passed this Congress attendant to the hurricane emergency relief says that on these credit  cards, the limit will go from $2,500 to  $250,000. Let me describe for a moment  what the GAO found in various investigations.  What has been charged to a Government credit card? Hiring prostitutes,  gambling,  breast-enlargement  surgery—yes,  it was  for a girlfriend of  somebody who had a Government credit card—cigars, mounting a deer head,  jewelry, wine, and the list goes on.  Now the limit goes to $250,000. We  aim to take it back to $2,500. It will  still have the emergency capabilities  that existed since 9/11 which will allow  a $15,000 limit under emergencies.  We had a hearing at which a professor from GW Law School who is an  expert in this area of Government procurement testified. Here  is what he  said  about  the  $250,000  credit  card  limit:  The potential for abuse is staggering.  Everybody knows that: ‘‘The potential for abuse is staggering.’’ If you  don’t believe it, take a look at the GAO  reports with respect to the abuse when  the limit was $2,500. Now it is $250,000  for a credit card purchase? Who  is  going to stand up for the interest of  the taxpayers?

1264,2,2005-10-17,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, again, a  significant milestone was reached this  past weekend in the recovery of the  sovereign nation of Iraq.  On my most recent trip to that country this past August, it was clear that  the constitution was the key that gets  them through the door to the next part  of their ability to govern themselves.  There are things in this country that  we take for granted, things like bank  to check, things like transfer of title of  real estate, things that are not possible  in a country that does not have a constitution, things that are not possible  in a country that does not know the  rule of law.  Mr. Speaker, in excess of 60 percent  of the people of Iraq braved the terrorists, braved the threats of violence to  go out and vote. We stand with the people of Iraq today, but mostly we stand  with our troops who made this all possible, and I salute their efforts.  f  IRAQI ELECTION IS A SHINING  EXAMPLE OF DEMOCRACY  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, Saturday’s election  in Iraq  was a shining example of democracy in  action and continued proof that the  Iraqi people are bravely determining  the fate of their nation.  After Iraqi security forces and coalition troops worked together efficiently  to provide security for the landmark  event, the day was calm and the election was conducted professionally. On  Sunday, the Chicago Tribute reported  that Iraqis said they felt safer in this  election than they did in January.  Most  importantly, millions of Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds, and Turkmen cast  their ballots  for a constitution that  will protect their rights and serve as a  blueprint  for  their  nation’s  future.  Their  strong  participation  demonstrated that Iraqis respect the constitutional process and believe in the  promise of democracy. Their success in  building a civil society  is a critical  step of the global war on terrorism,  protecting American families.  Today, I am honored to congratulate  the Iraqi National Assembly, the Iraqi  people, and Iraqi and coalition troops  on this historic accomplishment.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September 11.  f  MARINES PLAY IMPORTANT ROLE  IN IRAQ  (Mr. DREIER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2005
1265,2,2005-10-17,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues have said, the people of Iraq  have chosen ballots over bullets. I want  to  congratulate  the United  States  forces,  the  coalition  forces, and of  course the Iraqi security forces which  did a phenomenal job over this past  weekend.  I would like to share, Mr. Speaker,  with my colleagues a letter that came  from the  family of Byron Norwood,  who, you recall, was killed in the battle of Fallujah last November. His parents were in the gallery when President Bush delivered his State of the  Union message. They wrote to the Marines who are getting ready to be redeployed:  ‘‘As  you  prepare  to  deploy  once  again, we as Gold Star parents of a sergeant from your own battalion want  you to know the depth of gratitude and  support felt by Americans everywhere.  We live in a time of conflicting messages, as free speech rights are exercised by a vocal few.  ‘‘Since the battle of Fallujah last November, we have received countless letters expressing heartfelt thanks to not  only Byron but also to you as his fellow Marines. Had we not lost our son,  we would not have been aware of the  overwhelming appreciation and respect  for those of you who wear the uniform.  ‘‘Byron loved being a Marine and welcomed  the duty and honor of protecting  the United States. He also  loved his brother Marines and  said  there was nowhere he would rather be  than with them until the mission was  complete. He believed strongly in the  need to fight terrorism at its source in  order to lessen the risk of having to  face it in our own neighborhoods. We  are grateful for all of you who are willing to fight for something greater than  yourselves.  ‘‘We are grateful  for the  freedoms  that we are afforded by living in America, and we are aware that those freedoms exist only because we have men  and women in the military who, for  generations, have  fought  to protect  them. Thank you for taking your place  in the ranks of great warriors who understand the value of honor, courage,  and commitment.’’  f  RECOGNIZING KATHY LINEBERGER  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2005
1266,2,2005-10-17,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to recognize and congratulate an outstanding teacher from North Carolina’s  Fifth District, Ms. Kathy Lineberger.  Last Thursday, Ms. Lineberger, who  teaches at Ward Elementary School in  Winston-Salem, was named to USA Today’s All-USA Teacher Team. This recognition means that she is one of the  top 20 teachers in the United States.  As a reward, Ms. Lineberger will receive $2,500 to share with her school.  She plans to enrich the lives of her students by using a vast majority of her  award to purchase books for her classroom.  This is not the first national recognition bestowed to Ms. Lineberger. In  2000,  she was  named  the National  CHEM, which  stands  for Chemistry,  Health, Environment, and Me, Teacher  of the Year for writing interdisciplinary  lessons. She also won the National Science Educator for Public Understanding Award in 1998 and was the  Academically Gifted Teacher of  the  Year for Winston-Salem/Forsyth County in 2002.  Mr. Speaker, the people of the Fifth  District are fortunate to have many  dedicated and talented teachers  like  Kathy Lineberger teach our children. I  congratulate Ms. Lineberger and wish  her continued success.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2005

1275,16,2005-10-17,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for  joining us this evening.  Ethanol is certainly one of the alternatives to which we can turn. But if  there were some here on the other side,  let me just indicate what they would  probably say because, as a friend told  me a number of years ago, the thinnest  sheet of paper has two sides, and so let  us look at what they would say on the  other side.  I have here a chart which shows the  energy input for producing a million  Btus  from gasoline and  the energy  input  for producing a million Btus  from ethanol. And to get a million  Btus out of gasoline, we have to input  1.23 million, because you are not going  to get it all. You have to transport it  and refine it and you are going to lose  something in the process. But for ethanol, we have the happy consequence of  getting a lot of energy from the sun. So  this chart says that for every million  Btus you get from ethanol, it takes  only .74 million Btus of fossil energy to  produce it, and that is a good bet.  But, there are others, Dr. Pimentel,  for instance, and his colleague from the  West Coast. About 6 weeks ago I attended an all-day conference at the National Press Club, and their argument  was that if you really look at all of the  fossil fuel energy that goes into producing ethanol, you use more  fossil  fuel energy in producing ethanol than  you get out of  it.  I hope they are  wrong; but even if they are not wrong,  the energy profit ratio is not going to  be really large.  Let me look at this next chart for  just a moment, and then I am going to  come back to this one for a minute, because both of these relate to ethanol.  This is an interesting chart. What it  shows is energy profit ratios for several  fuels. This is energy profit ratio.  Now, what the gentleman was looking at was dollar profit ratio. It is really profitable dollar-wise  to produce  ethanol today because  it takes  less  money to produce it than you would  pay for an equivalent gallon of gasoline. This is the energy profit ratio,  and this is contrasted with a quality,  economic  effectiveness  in  transport,  how feasible is it to use over a wide  range of uses. Of course, the source  that tops the list is the giant oil fields.  We do not have any of those, by the  way; they are all in the Middle East.  But the energy profit ratio  is very  high: if you put in $1 you get out $60.  And they are very economically useful,  because you can make a whole lot of  things out of it. You can make pharmaceuticals out of it, you can heat your  house with it, you can run your car  with it, you can make plastics out of  it, do a whole lot of things with oil.  This  shows  the other  compounds.  Here is U.S. oil. We never were very  good, and now we are getting on down  further, tar sands and ethanol. Ethanol  is way down here at the bottom because they say there is not a big energy profit ratio. But if it is even positive, it is really good, because when  you use ethanol, it is relatively nonpolluting as compared to fossil fuels.  As the gentleman  from Minnesota  (Mr. GUTKNECHT) properly pointed out,  there is no CO2 penalty for that, because every bit of CO2you get out of it,  next year’s plant is going to absorb in  growing  it. We use oxygen, produce  CO2, the plants, happy neighbors; they  use our CO2 to produce oxygen which  we then can breath. But you must be  very careful with  the energy profit  ratio. The dollar profit ratio  is one  thing; and, today, that  is about all  economists look at. But energy profit  ratio, at the end of the day, if we really  have finite sources of these fossil fuels,  is going to be important.  Let us go back now to the previous  chart. I just want to take a quick look  at the bottom of it because this shows  something that most people have no  idea about. This is the energy that goes  into producing a bushel of corn which  you are using for your ethanol, and notice that nearly half of all of the energy that goes into producing a bushel  of corn comes from natural gas. And  the other sources are the tractor that  guides it, the seed, the phosphates, the  diesel  fuel,  the  gasoline,  the  electricity, natural gases and so forth.  But nearly half the energy comes  from natural gas which produces nitrogen, and most people have no concept  of that. Before we learned how to do  that, the only nitrogen sources we had  in the world were barnyard manures  and guano, and it was a big industry a  number of years ago. Guano, of course,  is the droppings of bats and birds over  tens of thousands of years that accumulated, and that is gone. If we wait a  couple  of  hundred  thousand more  years, there will be some more. But  ethanol  is  certainly  something we  ought to look at. It is one of a number  of things on this list and it is down  here in ethanol, and it is one of the  things we can get out of agriculture.  We will come back a little later in the  hour to talk more about agriculture.  Several other Members have joined us,  and let me let them speak in terms of  the time they appeared. I yield to the  gentleman  from  Maryland  (Mr.  GILCHREST).  ",2005

1278,23,2005-10-17,Mr. PALLONE.," The bottom line is  that this Republican majority is starting to fall apart because their policies  are not good for the American people.  Even  some  of  the Republicans  are  starting to realize it and are not willing to vote for some of the junk bills  that come to this floor with the Republican leadership.  I just mention that because I think  there is hope here. I left last Friday  thinking maybe now because of yourselves getting on the floor, maybe because Democrats are speaking out and  talking about why these Republican  initiatives are not helpful, maybe people are starting to realize it. Maybe  some Republicans are starting to realize it. That is why I admire what you  are doing because I think it is making  a difference.  ",2005
1279,23,2005-10-17,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, the  gentleman  from Florida  (Mr. MEEK)  has been resilient in pushing us to get  up to the floor once or twice a week. I  just saw a poll last week that had 60  percent of the independent voters in  the country are sick and tired of what  has been going on in Washington, D.C.  Mr. Wagner from General Motors said  D.C. better do something about health  care. We are not doing anything. What  we are doing seems like we are doing  something, but the energy bill is not  really doing anything.  The gentleman mentioned the $1.5  billion a week that we are spending in  Iraq. I want to share one thing. This is  a great article today in the Washington  Post. The first line says it feels like  the 1990s minus the good parts, all of  the scandals that were going on, but  the economy, energy costs and everything is bad.  There was a proposal made, and talking about dealing with the Chinese, we  need to offer, and that is what we are  doing as Democrats, we just need to  convince the American people that we  are offering alternatives and do have  ideas, whether it is prescription drugs  or alternative energy.  I want to share a proposal from the  National Academies and it is a combination of a variety of different things  to get our math scores up. Our math  scores  in 8th grade, we ranked 15th  internationally and in the 9th grade we  ranked  24th  internationally. We are  not going to stimulate the economy if  we do not have engineers and math and  science majors, and the 30–Something  Group is calling for a million new engineers and scientists over the next 10  years because we believe that is going  to be the greatest stimulus.  But let me share the proposal from  the  National  Academies  to  spend  money  on math  prizes  for  high  schoolers, pay raises for math teachers  and to boost Federal research funding  by 10 percent annually for 7 years. That  would cost $10 billion a year. That is it.  We are spending $1.5 billion a week in  Iraq. The American people judge, $10  billion a year on  increased Federal  funding for research and development  and targeted investments to increase  math and science scores in the United  States of America among K–12 school  kids. That is what the Democrats want  to do, versus $1.5 billion a week in Iraq,  versus hundreds of thousands and millions and trillions of dollars over the  next 10 years in tax cuts for people who  make more than $600,000 a year.  b2130  Pick what they want. Democrats, increased funding for Pell grants to lower  tuition costs. Republicans, cut taxes  for the top 1 percent. Trillions.  Democrats, fully fund No Child Left  Behind, make sure every kid who is eligible for more funding, for afterschool  tutoring, summer school, before school;  Democrats are for full funding of that.  Republicans, no. We have to give our  tax cuts to our buddies.  And that is the difference. Time and  time again and over the course of the  next year, we are just going to hammer  the differences between the two parties.  ",2005
1280,23,2005-10-17,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  reclaiming my  time,  the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. RYAN) brought up some  interesting points; and I can tell him,  as a parent myself, this issue of No  Child Left Behind, we would talk to  our Republican  leadership colleagues  and they would say, well, that was a bipartisan bill and over on the opposite  side, in the Senate, folks were having  press conferences and bill-signing ceremonies and everything.  But we believed that we were going  to see full funding of No Child Left Behind and that this Congress would go  down in history as the education Congress, and we are not even close to fulfilling our obligations. As a matter of  fact, we have about eight States that  are suing the Federal Government over  No Child Left Behind unfunded mandates. These are States. These are not  other countries. These are States here  in the United States that taxpayers  pay money.  We have a number of school districts  that say, listen, if we can opt out of it,  we want to opt out. We do not want to  opt in. That is not a federalized education program to help local communities and chambers and all the other  do-gooders in small communities and  big communities who want to make  sure they have an educated workforce.  It is not that same theory.  We have one other issue that is here.  The gentleman mentioned the issue of  the energy bill. I am glad that resurfaced because I am going to tell the  Members the reason why that is important. The energy bill came  to  this  floor, and for 90 minutes we sat and  stood here on this floor waiting for the  board to close. What we call the board  here in Congress is a voting board. For  several minutes, almost 1 hour. The  bill was defeated. And, Mr. Speaker, I  think this is where if I had a yellow  flag and I was a referee or an official on  the 40 yard line that I would actually  throw a flag. I would have thrown the  flag because the spirit of the rules were  violated because when the board opens  up and there are 15 minutes to vote,  there are 15 minutes to vote, give or  take 1 or 2 or 3. But when they say the  board is open for 15 minutes and we  will close it when we win, then that is  a violation of the spirit of the rules of  this House. And it feeds into the whole  issue of the corruption and cronyism.  I have two young children; and  if  there were a homework assignment  that was due, and my wife and I have  to sign their reading stuff and say that  it is done, but it would not be fair if  my children were to do their homework  and there were two other children in  the same classroom or  in the same  school that say, Well, I do not have to  do my homework. I will just do it two  nights from now because my father or  my mother is a chairperson of the PTA  and we have power like that. We can do  it. That would not be fair to the children who actually did their homework.  I use that analogy because I want to  make sure that the Members and the  American people understand what we  are talking about. Yes, it is a bad thing  dealing with children, but it is a horrible thing when we are talking about  national policy for the greatest country on the face of the Earth, the shining example of democracy. Now, we salute one flag. And my colleagues heard  me speak a couple of weeks ago about  those Americans; and, yes, we think  about those 2,000-plus individuals who  have fallen in this war, but for those  Americans who are still here who are  voting for representation and fair play,  they are individuals that are without  limbs now.  We have all gone to Walter Reed. We  have all gone to these hospitals in our  own communities, these VA hospitals,  watching these men and women come  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:10 Oct 18, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17OC7.047 H17OCPT1 ",2005
1281,30,2005-10-17,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Let me just  say that it is important that we realize  the time that we are in now. I think  the gentleman is 110 percent right.  I was in my district recently and I  went to New Shiloh Baptist Church.  One of my  local pastors was  celebrating his third pastoral anniversary  of the church. And I went over and worshipped with him and  some parishioners. When I was there, a couple of  folks came up to me and said, It is really something that is going on in Washington right now. Are you not shocked?  And I am, like, I am not. Oh, no, I am  not. No. Not only did I see it coming,  but some more is to come.  How do you know that? Well, I am  not a prophet, but I am your Congressman. And when we are not doing our  job as Members of Congress, not individuals. Folks make sure to keep the  district offices open, respond to constituent mail, return phone calls, this,  that and the other, not the individual  policing of our own districts, but the  policing of the Federal budget, the policing of having oversight over all the  Federal agencies. When we are not  doing that, then that means we are not  doing our job. When we are not doing  our job that the Constitution calls for  and that the rules of the House calls  for of how we do our job and conduct  our job and we violate the rules of this  House, then we have issues.  When we violate the spirit, I must  add, of the rules, then we violate this  country. When we violate the spirit of  the rules of this House and we violate  the spirit of fair play and also our oversight responsibilities through a lack of  governance or the lack of oversight,  then we will see what we see now.  Now, I am here to say that I think it  is very, very important, we have talked  and covered a lot of ground here this  evening, but I can tell you that there is  so much more to be covered. There is  so much more work to be done. I wish,  because  it gives me no pleasure to  come to the floor and to just point out  the obvious of what is not happening  and what  is happening to a certain  group of people, and guess what, that  certain group of people are the American people.  It is not like you start saying, well,  there is something happening to the  folks over in Iowa. No, it is not. It is  happening to the American people. It is  happening to your constituents. It is  happening to my constituents.  It  is  happening to the Member’s constituent  that sits right there, and the one that  was here a minute ago, and the one  that is back in their apartment and the  other that is back in their office right  now; it can either be a he or she. It is  happening to them.  So when the historians start looking  at what happened and how did we get  to the point where we are now when  someone turns the lights on here in the  Congress, I mean, the real lights, and  that ember starts to hit the floor and  they start to look and say, goodness,  how did this happen, then we want to  make sure that there were Members of  this House, need it be those Members  that put together reports in minority  committees of what is happening and  should be happening; need it be our  friends on the other side of the aisle  that are lathered up enough that will  stand up to the majority and that will  say, you know something, we are doing  this wrong and I will use my voice the  best way to use it. And I want to say as  an American, I thank you.  The gentleman talked about religion  a moment ago. I talked about this article about where we will make these offsets here in The Washington Post: $50  billion, how are we going to find it?  The  first thing mentioned  is Medicaid. The second thing mentioned is  reducing free lunch for poor children,  for Head Start and small farming programs. Yes, let us go for those. How are  we going to get there?

1351,44,2005-10-17,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President, in  May, Senator JEFFBINGAMAN and I,  with the encouragement of the Senate  Energy Committee Chairman, PETE  DOMENICI, asked  the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering and  the Institute of Medicine the following  question: What are the top 10 actions,  in priority order, that Federal policymakers could take over the next decade to help the United States keep our  advantage in science and technology?  That was our question.  To answer the question, the academies assembled a distinguished panel  of business, government, and university leaders, headed by Norm Augustine,  the  former chair of Lockheed  Martin. The panel also included three  Nobel Prize laureates. The panel took  our question seriously, and I intend to  do everything within my power to take  their recommendations seriously. Tomorrow, the Energy Committee will  take the first step in that response by  holding a hearing to hear from Mr. Augustine and the Academies. It will be  the  first  opportunity Congress will  have to hear their answer to our question.  This  hearing  is  primarily  about  brainpower  and  the  relationship  of  brainpower to good American jobs. The  United States produces almost one-  third of all the wealth in the world, in  terms of gross domestic product but  has only 5 percent of the world’s population. We are a fortunate country indeed.

1354,100,2005-10-17,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, it is with  pleasure that I rise, after 21⁄2months of  waiting,  to  introduce  the Transportation, Treasury, HUD, Judiciary, and  related agencies fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill. My invaluable partner,  the distinguished Senator from Washington,  is being held up by airline  delays, something that most of us in  this body are acquainted with, so I will  go ahead and present my opening statement and open the floor for business  and reserve her time until she is able  to get here.  This bill is the first real appropriations  product  of  a  brand-new  subcommittee that grew out of the reorganization of the Senate Appropriations  Committee from earlier this year. It is  a substantial and complex bill that will  have a significant and, we hope, positive impact on every State and community in this Nation, as it covers, among  other things, every mode of transportation, financial services, and IRS requirements, as guided by the Department of Treasury, the Federal responsibility for housing and economic development under HUD, as well as the  funding for the executive office of the  President, for the Federal judicial system, and  for other related agencies,  such as GSA, OPM, and the Postal  Service.  My view is that this is a good product, as good a product as we could have  produced given the circumstances  in  our allocation. I give tremendous credit and thanks to my friend and colleague, the ranking member, Senator  MURRAY, for her hard work, dedication,  and commitment to working with me  in a bipartisan manner to craft this  legislation. As I said, this is a brand-  new bill for us, for our staffs, and for  this body to consider. I think it is a  good bill and that is due, in no small  part, because of the participation of  Senator MURRAY and her partnership  with me in the legislative process. I  look  forward  to working with her  through conference and final passage.  We started with a budget that severely underfunded many of the important programs in this bill. These are  programs that historically have been  supported  in  large numbers by  the  Members  this  body. Thankfully,  in  most cases we have been able to restore  many of the cuts and shortfalls, and for  that we  especially  thank Chairman  and  the  ranking member,  Senator BYRD, who demonstrated their  understanding and sensitivity to the  needs of the Transportation-Treasury  appropriations subcommittee. Without  Chairman COCHRAN’s help and Senator  BYRD’s acquiescence, we would have  been unable to meet the funding needs  of most of our programs, as well as  Members’ priorities. This bill as well is  within our section 302(b) allocation of  $65.819 billion of budget authority and  $122.064 billion in outlays.  In particular, despite our fiscal limitations, we worked diligently to ensure  that transportation programs in this  bill are adequately funded. One of our  highest priorities in fashioning the bill  was to meet the Federal responsibilities to provide funding for the safety,  construction, and maintenance of our  highways,  transit  systems, and airports. Funding of our Nation’s transportation  infrastructure,  and  especially for our highway and road network, creates jobs and promotes economic growth.

1355,135,2005-10-17,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce the Border Law Enforcement Relief Act of 2005. This bill  will provide local law enforcement in  border communities with much needed  assistance in combating border-related  criminal activity. For far too long, law  enforcement agencies operating along  the border have had to incur significant costs due to the inability of the  Federal Government to secure our Nation’s borders. It is time that the Federal Government recognizes that border communities should not have to  bear this burden alone.  The bill I am introducing today is  aimed at enhancing security in the border region by giving law enforcement  agencies the manpower and resources  they need  to  combat border-related  crimes. Specifically, the bill would establish a competitive grant program  within the Department of Homeland  Security to help local law enforcement  situated along the border cover some of  the costs they incur as a result of dealing with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, stolen vehicles, and other border-related crimes, and authorizes $30  million a year to carry out the program. Funds allocated under the grant  program could be used to hire additional  personnel,  obtain  necessary  equipment, upgrade  law enforcement  technology, and cover overtime and  transportations costs.  Law  enforcement agencies  serving  communities within 100 miles of the  U.S. border with Mexico or Canada, as  well as any other agencies located outside of this geographical limit located  in an area which has been designated  by the Secretary of Homeland Security  as a ‘‘High Impact Area,’’ would be eligible to apply for the grants. Priority  in awarding grants would go to law enforcement  agencies  serving  communities with populations under 50,000.  Two-thirds of the funds would be set  aside for the six states with the highest  alien apprehension rates and one-third  for areas designated as ‘‘High Impact  Areas.’’  It is the responsibility of the Federal  Government to adequately secure the  Nation’s borders and prevent the flow  of undocumented persons and  illegal  drugs  into the country. Despite the  fact that the Border Patrol apprehends  over 1 million people each year trying  to illegally enter the United States,  the number of  illegal aliens  in the  United States  continues  to  rise as  thousands  of  individuals  enter  the  country through our porous borders.  The border region is also a major corridor  for the shipment of drugs—according  to  the El Paso  Intelligence  Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that  are sold in the United States enter the  country through the Southwest border.  By virtue of their proximity to an  international border, many of adverse  consequences of the failure of the Federal Government to adequately secure  the border fall on the border communities.  In traveling around the New  Mexico-Mexico border region, I have  heard repeatedly how drug trafficking,  kidnappings, human  smuggling,  and  the destruction of private property,  such as the tearing down ranchers’ cattle fences, are impacting our communities.  The United States shares 5,525 miles  of border with Canada and 1,989 miles  with Mexico. Many of the local law enforcement agencies located along the  border are  small,  rural departments  charged with patrolling large areas of  land with few officers and very limited  resources. Counties along the Southwest border are some of the poorest in  the country and are not in the position  to cover the additional costs associated  with  illegal  immigration, drug  trafficking,  and  other  border-related  crimes.  According to a 2001 study by the  United States-Mexico Border Counties  Coalition, local law enforcement and  criminal justice costs associated with  illegal immigration exceed $89 million  every year.

1361,149,2005-10-17,Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Vienna Woman’s Club located in  Vienna, Virginia.  The Vienna Woman’s Club is a service and  civic organization that was formed under the  name of the Vienna Hills Woman’s Club by 22  women on October 12, 1955. The  following  year,  the group became affiliated with  the  General Federation of Women’s Clubs in January of 1956, and membership was expanded  to all Vienna women. The club meets the third  Wednesday of the month, and is responsible  for numerous projects that enhance and contribute to the Vienna community.  Some  instrumental projects  the club has  participated  in  for years  include  the club’s  scholarship program and the Policeman of the  Year award. The Vienna Woman’s Club inaugurated its scholarship program in 1962, and  since  that  time has awarded approximately  $100,000  in  scholarships  to Vienna  high  school students. In 1967, the club awarded its  first Policeman of the Year award. Each year,  the club recognizes a Town police officer and  holds a banquet in his or her honor. The recipient also participates in the annual Vienna  Halloween Parade, which is enjoyed by many  Northern Virginia residents.  In addition, the club has helped to improve  the  community  by  helping  to  establish  a  branch of  the Fairfax County Library,  furnishing a room at Fairfax Hospital for a more  comfortable stay for hospital patients, and has  set up eye testing clinics for pre-school children. Some philanthropic events the club has  participated in include the Annual Harvest Bazaar and Craft Fair, to which the proceeds are  donated to the scholarship program, and contributing a generous donation  to  the Vienna  Community Center. The club members have  also worked to promote holiday cheer by acting as hostesses at  the Annual Christmas  Sing-Along held at Wolftrap Farm Park.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to commend and congratulate the Vienna Woman’s  Club on 50 years of success. They have  served the interests of their community well,  truly meriting recognition. I call upon my colleagues to join me in applauding their past accomplishments and in wishing the club continued success in the many years to come.  f  COUNCIL  OF  KHALISTAN  CALLS  ON  ALL  SIKHS  TO  SUPPORT  FREEDOM  HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 17, 2005  ",2005
1362,149,2005-10-17,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  recently,  the  Council of Khalistan issued an open letter in  which it called for all Sikhs to work for independence  for  Khalistan.  The  letter  cites  abuses against the Sikh Nation such as the  torture of Jagtar Singh Hawara, who had a  cigarette forced into his mouth in contravention of a Sikh religious tenet and was forced  to desecrate the Sikh holy scripture, the Guru  Granth Sahib. This shows  that  there  is no  freedom and no tolerance for religious minorities  in Hindu-dominated  India. And unfortunately, whichever party is in power, the imposition of Hindu theocracy continues. The latest  atrocities have occurred under  the secular  Congress Party, not the openly Hindu nationalist BJP.  It is outrageous that such atrocities against  human beings are still occurring in the twenty-  first century, Mr. Speaker. The civilized nations of the world must step in to put a stop  to this tyrannical brutality.  We must do whatever we can  to help all  people live in freedom. We can start by ending  our aid and our trade with India and by publicly demanding a free and fair vote to settle  the question of  independence  for Khalistan  and all the nations of South Asia the democratic way. Separating from India appears to  be  the only way  that  the Sikhs of Punjab,  Khalistan, the Muslims of Kashmir, the Christians of Nagaland, and so many other minority  groups will ever have a chance to live in the  freedom  that  is  their birthright as human  beings.  I would  like  to  introduce  the Council of  Khalistan’s open letter into the RECORD for the  information of my colleagues.  It goes  into  much more detail than I am able to go into  here. I urge my colleagues to read it carefully.  COUNCILOFKHALISTAN,  Washington, DC, October 12, 2005.  DEAR ALLSIKHSMUSTWORKFORTHELIBERATION  OFKHALISTAN  KHALSA JI: WAHEGURU  JI KA  KHALSA, WAHEGURU JI KI FATEH!  Recent events have underlined again the  importance  of  liberating  our  homeland,  Khalistan. All Sikhs must work toward that  goal.  Recently, the Council of Khalistan completed its highly successful annual convention.  There  was  great  enthusiasm  for  Khalistan. There have been marches in Punjab  demanding  a  free  and  sovereign  Khalistan. Over 30,000 Sikhs were present at  the raising of the Khalistan flag on the anniversary of  the Golden Temple attack  in  June. 35 Sikhs were arrested and many were  charged at that time for making speeches  and raising the flag. On Republic Day the  same thing happened. Sikhs were charged  and arrested for raising the Sikh flag and  making speeches  in support of Khalistan.  This blatant attempt to put an end to the  Khalistan movement  through  the use of  naked intimidation will not work.  Recently,  Prime  Minister  Manmohan  Singh apologized to the Sikh Nation for the  Indian government’s massacre of Sikhs in  Delhi in November 1984. Over 20,000 Sikhs  were killed in these massacres while Sikh  police were locked in their barracks and the  state television and radio issued a call for  more Sikh blood. Manmohan Singh’s apology  squarely establishes India’s guilt and it is  greatly appreciated. Now we await the apology  for Operation Bluestar and the withdrawal of all Indian occupation forces from  Punjab, Khalistan.  Captain Amarinder Singh became a hero of  the Sikh Nation by asserting Punjab’s sovereignty and preserving Punjab’s natural resource, its river water, for the use of Punjab  farmers by cancelling Punjab’s water agreements, This action is saving Punjab from the  Hindu regime’s plan to make Punjab a desert  and eliminate the Sikh Nation, the Sikh people, the Sikh culture, and the Sikh religion  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:34 Oct 18, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17OC8.002 E17OCPT1 ",2005

This award is presented each year to  an individual who has performed outstanding  and meritorious service to the community of  Altoona through personal efforts by enhancing  the dignity and worth of  its citizens. This  award is presented by the Blair County Advisory Council to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission and is now in its sixteenth  year of giving  this award. The Pennsylvania  Human Relations Commission has served the  citizens of Pennsylvania faithfully since 1955  fighting the practice or policy of discrimination  against  individuals or groups by  reason of  their race, color, familial status, creed, ancestry, age, sex, national origin or disability.  Sister DelGrosso is receiving this award in  recognition for her lifelong commitment to the  community of Altoona, but in particular for her  special efforts over the past fourteen years as  Director of the St. Vincent DePaul Soup Kitchen and Food  for Families Food Bank  in Altoona. Under Sister DelGrosso’s guidance, the  dining hall at St. Vincent DePaul’s has been  able to provide over 35,000 meals every year  to needy people in the community. Thanks in  large part  to her steadfast  leadership,  the  kitchen at St. Vincent DePaul’s enjoys support  from various segments of the community ranging from the religious to the financial and from  the public  to  the private sector. These are  people within the community of Altoona who  share different philosophies, beliefs and opinions, yet Sister DelGrosso has been able to  bring  them  together  in support of a worthy  cause.  Sister Paula has led a life filled with compassion and dignity. Born in the town of Altoona,  the daughter of Thomas and Mary  DelGrosso, Sister Paula graduated  from Altoona Area High School and Mt. Aloysius, before going on to graduate with a B.S. in Education from St. Francis University, and a Masters Degree and Supervision Certificate  in  Guidance and Counseling from Duquesne University. Her passion for education has imbued  her life as she has served in the field of education for thirty-four years, with sixteen being  spent as an elementary and secondary school  teacher and eighteen years as Assistant Superintendent of Schools for the Altoona/Johnstown Diocese.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to congratulate  Sister Paula DelGrosso for her lifelong commitment to the community of Altoona and I am  proud to call Sister Paula a constituent.  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO EMMETT C.  BURNS, JR.  HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 17, 2005  ",2005
1364,156,2005-10-17,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay special  tribute  to Emmett C. Burns, Jr.,  who is an outstanding delegate to the Maryland House of Delegates and who has been  awarded this year’s Thurgood Marshall Legacy  Award by  the Baltimore City Branch of  the  NAACP.  It is most fitting that Emmett Burns is the recipient of an award named  for our Nation’s  first African-American U.S. Supreme Court  Justice. Thurgood Marshall, who was born in  Baltimore, was one of the most important figures in our Nation’s struggle for civil rights. As  chief attorney for the NAACP, he successfully  argued the Brown v. Board of Education case  before  the Supreme Court, ending  legalized  segregation of our Nation’s schools.  Since 1995, Emmett Burns has been a leader in the Maryland House of Delegates for the  rights of all Marylanders. Most  recently, he  was instrumental in the enactment of a law to  rename Maryland’s  largest airport  the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.  As former head and lifelong member of the  Baltimore NAACP, he has been a role model  for the African-American community, providing  a strong voice for social justice and equality.  I have known Emmett Burns for many years  and  I consider him a  friend whose advice  I  seek and value.  I urge my colleagues in the U.S. House of  Representatives  to  join me  in congratulating  Del. Emmett C. Burns on being this year’s recipient of the Baltimore City NAACP Thurgood  Marshall Legacy Award.  IN RECOGNITION OF A NEW FEDERAL COURTHOUSE  IN FRESNO,  CA  HON. JIM COSTA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 17, 2005  ",2005
1365,156,2005-10-17,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize the completion of a spectacular new  United States Courthouse  in Fresno, California, that will serve the needs of the communities of the great Central San Joaquin Valley.  I am joined in this recognition by my colleagues, who also represent the City of Fresno and the communities served by this new  facility,  Representatives  DENNIS CARDOZA,  DEVINNUNESand GEORGERADANOVICH.  The new courthouse features 14 courtrooms  and  judicial chambers  for  the U.S. District  Court, the U.S. Magistrate, and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. It also includes facilities such as  a  library, conference  rooms,  jury assembly  area, public cafeteria and offices for other federal agencies and elected officials.  This unique, nine-story building  integrates  the textures, colors and materials of the surrounding natural landscape of Fresno and the  nearby Sierra Nevada mountain range.  The building began construction  in April  2002 and was completed at a cost of $116  million.  It will accommodate 232 employees,  who will serve hundreds of private citizens on  a daily basis.  Mr. Speaker, it is with the greatest pleasure  that  I  join my colleagues  in celebrating  this  momentous occasion  for  the communities of  the Central San Joaquin Valley.  f  RECOGNIZING THE FINALISTS OF  THE  DISCOVERY  CHANNEL’S  YOUNG SCIENTIST CHALLENGE  HON. SHERWOOD BOEHLERT  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 17, 2005  ",2005
1366,156,2005-10-17,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, as Chairman  of the House Committee on Science, I am an  avid supporter of programs that encourage the  youth of America to push the limits of innovation. One  such program  is  the Discovery  Channel Young Scientist Challenge.  In 1999, Discovery Communications,  Inc.,  designed  the Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge  to help address America’s  chronic underachievement  in K–12 science  and math. The annual national contest  responds  to evidence  that our students’ academic performance and interest in science declines dramatically as they become older, particularly during the middle school years.  The Discovery Channel Young Scientist  Challenge attempts to reverse that decline by  identifying and honoring America’s top middle  school students with a demonstrated ability in  leadership,  teamwork, and scientific problem  solving. More  than 9,500 middle school students have accepted the challenge and have  competed  for  the  title  of  ‘‘America’s Top  Young Scientist of  the Year.’’ Since 1999,  scholarship awards for the students have totaled more than $500,000, and challenge winners have participated in science-related trips  to far-off places, including the Roslin Institute  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:34 Oct 18, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A17OC8.024 E17OCPT1 ",2005
1367,163,2005-10-17,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing legislation, along with Ranking Member  EVANSand other distinguished Members of the  Committee, will  introduce  legislation  that will  mandate the Department of Veterans’ Affairs  to empower the Department’s Chief Information Officer with  authority  over  resources,  budget and personnel related  to  information  technology for the Department.  Since coming to Congress in 1993, I have  witnessed this Committee struggle with VA’s  inability to adequately manage its IT funding  and IT modernization efforts.  While there have been significant improvements in VA’s IT modernization efforts, the improvements have come at significant cost to  our Veterans: $600 million plus for a decade  of VETSNET—the automated compensation  and pension claims processing system  that  still has not been  implemented  in 10 years.  $342 million for CoreFLS—the failed financial  management system. $300 million for the HR  Links—the failed automated personnel system.  $485 million annually to maintain VISTA, VA’s  25-year-old medical information system.  This  legislation,  the  ‘‘Department of Veterans Affairs Information Technology Management Improvement Act’’ will ensure accountability in VA IT spending, and reorganize VA’s  IT  infrastructure  to better serve our nation’s  veterans.  HONORING GEORGE HALE  HON. MICHAEL H. MICHAUD  OFMAINE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 17, 2005  ",2005
1368,163,2005-10-17,Mr. MICHAUD.," Mr. Speaker, Maine has a  long  tradition of honoring men and women  who have made a positive impact on the community and the people around them. This is  why  I would  like  to recognize George Hale.  George has spent his  life working with and  helping others.  George  first  began working with  others  when he was in the Navy. He would then go  on to serve in Korea as a medic, working with  the sick and wounded. A Cleveland native,  George eventually  found his way  to Maine  where he has had a distinguished 50 year career doing what he loves: broadcasting. During  this career he has become an icon to a vast  number of Mainers and he has become a legend as a high school basketball announcer.  He has used his broadcasting skills  to  the  benefIt of others  too. For  the  last 15 years  George has helped host  the Muscular Dystrophy Telethons on WABI TV. He has also  done important work for the Maine Chapter of  the March of Dimes and countless communities around Maine.  For these reasons George is being honored  by the Maine Chapter of the March of Dimes  tonight for a lifetime of achievement and involvement with the community. On behalf of  the  residents of Maine’s Second Congressional District, and  for myself personally,  I  would like to congratulate George Hale on this  honor and also thank him for all the work he  has done for the people of Maine.  f  THANKING  FORMER  GOVERNOR  JAMES B. HUNT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON EDUCATION  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 17, 2005  ",2005
1369,163,2005-10-17,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, James B. Hunt—  the  four-term Governor of North Carolina,  is  not only a model public servant, a proud democrat and a long-time dear friend, he is the  rare visionary who actually knows how to implement his vision and get demonstrable results.  The ‘‘No Child Left Behind Act’’ was an historic bipartisan achievement  for our Nation.  And it was a signal accomplishment for President Bush and Members on both sides of the  aisle in Congress.  But  the  fact  is, governor Hunt was  in  the  vanguard of the movement for education reform in the States and his hard work helped  inspire the enactment of this important Federal  law.  When it comes to education, Jim Hunt not  only put North Carolina on the map, he has  helped move the Tarheel State toward the top  of the heap.  His smart start program—a public-private  partnership  in each of North Carolina’s 100  counties—helps  provide  quality  child  care,  health care and family support for each child  who needs it.  The ‘‘Judy Centers’’ in Maryland—named for  my late wife, who was a strong advocate of  early childhood education—provide many of  the same services.  Jim Hunt helped set up North Carolina’s primary  reading program. He helped  reduce  class size, and create a dropout prevention  program.  And, he established  the State’s school of  science and mathematics, the Microelectronics  Center of North Carolina, and the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.  He also helped put in place one of the most  rigorous, approaches  to measuring student  performance,  requiring mastery before promotion and graduation and providing assistance to turn around failing schools.  When it comes to education reform that gets  results, no one in America has had a more  profound impact than Jim Hunt.  He didn’t  just claim victory after signing  these initiatives into law. He demanded—and  received—results.  For example, The Rand Corporation  reported that North Carolina Public Schools improved test scores more than any other State  in the 1990s.  And, the 1997 national education goals report showed that North Carolina had the most  impressive  improvements  toward  reaching  educational goals outlined by the panel, and  made  significant  progress  in  science  and  math.  But Governor Hunt’s  contributions  have  been  felt  far beyond  the borders of North  Carolina.  They have been felt throughout the Nation.  As the founding chair of the national board  for professional teaching standards, Jim Hunt  has been a driving force in improving student  achievement by raising teaching standards.  Quite  simply,  the  national  board  helps  teachers improve their skills, so that they can  better serve their students.  Governor Hunt has always recognized that  the key  to a  first-rate education  is  first-rate  teaching.  And,  through  the national board he has  helped raise the bar, striving to give professional educators the respect and training that  they deserve.  Finally, let me say that Jim Hunt has always  understood and  focused on  the nexus between educational achievement and economic  success.  Today,  figures  from  across  the  political  spectrum—Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, Bill  Gates and the U.S. Chamber—recognize and  are talking about that nexus.  ‘‘We are living in a world,’’ said President  Clinton, ‘‘Where what you can earn is a function of what you can learn.’’  This issue, the centrality of education and  knowledge in today’s global economy, unites  all of us.  And Jim Hunt has recognized that for more  than 25 years.  A few years ago, the Raleigh News and Observer stated that, ‘‘Jim Hunt served his State  with practical accomplishment and with forceful leadership in times of crisis. Of that, he,  and we, can be proud.’’  Governor Hunt  is a  trailblazer who has  lit  the path  to personal  fulfillment and professional accomplishment  for  literally  thousands  of North Carolinians and men and women all  across this Nation.  His insight has been invaluable. His determination has been essential. And his leadership has been practical, productive and profound.

Under the previous order, the  Senate will resume consideration of  H.R. 3010, which the clerk will now report.  The assistant legislative clerk read  as follows:  A bill (H.R. 3010) making appropriations  for the Departments of Labor, Health and  Human Services, and Education, and related  agencies  for  the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for other purposes.  ",2005
1374,8,2005-10-24,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I made  an opening statement on Friday morning and I intend to yield in a moment  or two to my distinguished colleague,  the ranking member, Senator HARKIN. I  urge all Senators to come forward with  their amendments. So far staff has contacted every Senator’s office to find  out if there are amendments which the  Senator intends to file. We have been  made  aware  of  approximately  15  amendments  identified  so  far where  there is an intention to file. We have  had a fair number of other comments  from staffers of other Senators who do  not know what their Members intend  to do.  We have a very complicated bill, in  excess of $145 billion, three of the most  important Departments of the Federal  Government: Education, Health  and  Human Services, and Labor. We are in  the closing days of this session. After  the passage of this bill, we are going to  have to go to conference and resolve  many difficult matters. So it is important that this bill be completed as  early as possible.  We also have many Members who are  involved in this bill who are engaged in  the preparation of  the confirmation  hearings on Ms. Harriet Miers for the  Supreme Court of the United States.  That is weighing very heavily on my  mind, but this  is an  important bill  which comes first. Senator HARKINand  I are determined, and Senator FRIST,  the leader, as well as Senator REID, the  Democratic  leader, will back us up.  Senator REIDtook the initiative to remind  Senators  about  a  statement  which I initiated last week about going  to the 15-minute plus 5, 20 minutes  total, vote tally so we do not consume  a large amount of time, which has become the practice of the Senate.  Speaking as the manager, and I know  Senator HARKIN concurs with this—I  would ask the Senator if that is correct?  ",2005
1375,8,2005-10-24,Mr. HARKIN., Yes.  ,2005
1376,8,2005-10-24,Mr. SPECTER.," We are going to move  to enforce the time limits. The managers intend to press to file a cloture  petition tomorrow which will require  that  all  amendments  be  filed  by  Wednesday at noon and that we take  up only germane amendments.  We think these rules are the ones  which should govern the consideration  of this bill. If anybody has nongermane  amendments,  the  floor  is open  this  afternoon, and until cloture is invoked,  the germane amendments will be open  for consideration tomorrow.  I again urge our colleagues to come  forward at this time with any amendments which they desire to offer.  The distinguished Senator from Iowa  was not present  to hear my  lavish  praise about him on Friday afternoon.  He is giving me the waving-on signal.  The choice  is either  to praise him  again or relegate him to read the CONso  I choose  to  GRESSIONAL RECORD,  renew the praise.  He has been a steadfast colleague as  we have moved the work of this important subcommittee without partisanship. The gavel has changed hands from  time to time between Senator HARKIN  and me. I know that while he has said  some good things about my chairmanship, he prefers to be chairman. I do  not know why, but he has maintained  that position. In the public interest,  when the chairmanship is changed, we  use  the  expression  ‘‘a  seamless  exchange of the gavel.’’  Now I do not hand him the gavel, but  I hand him the floor seamlessly.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished, seamless, and  steadfast Senator from Iowa is recognized. ",2005

Senator SPECTER and I have worked together—now that I think back, it has  been 17 years that we have worked together, either as chairman or ranking  member on  this  subcommittee. The  chairman is absolutely right. No matter who has the gavel, we work together.  I couldn’t ask  for a better  working relationship with anyone than  I have with my friend and my chairman, Senator SPECTER of Pennsylvania.

1378,15,2005-10-24,Ms. LANDRIEU.," I know people are  going to debate about Davis-Bacon, but  I just want to tell the American people  this point: When the President issued  the order and basically said, right after  Katrina, waive all the labor laws that  allow people to be paid a fair wage, he  said he was doing that to save money.  How does one save money on a no-bid  contract? If a contract is not being put  out  for bid, how does one save any  money? All that happens is wages of  the people who need them the most at  a time when they have lost everything  are driven down. They are not asking  for charity. They are not asking for a  handout. They stood up to get a job to  work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and  still were basically under the administrative rules of waiving Davis-Bacon,  lack of oversight and lack of focus, and  have basically been asked to leave the  military base.  So  I hope that  in the  few weeks  ahead, we can get these electricians  back on the job, back to their homes,  back to their neighborhoods to rebuild,  and build some support in this Chamber and around America for paying people a decent wage. I do not think $22 is  too much. I do not expect people to rebuild Louisiana at a minimum wage or  $8 or $9 an hour without benefits.  People have to make a living. That  amounts to about $45,000 a year. Is that  too much to pay someone working 12  hours a day, 7 days a week, doing hard  and sometimes dangerous work? I don’t  think so. But evidently somebody in  Washington thinks that is too much  because,  instead  of  holding wages  steady—not asking  for union wages,  but asking for an average wage, between  union  and  nonunion, which  seems fair to me—we are undercutting  our workers. The Government should  not mandate a union wage to be paid,  but neither should we undercut our  workers. So  the prevailing wage  is  what we have come up with, to say  don’t pay union, don’t pay nonunion,  pay something in the middle, the average wage:  $18,  $20,  $22 an hour  for  skilled labor. That is not too much to  ask. But evidently it is.  Even  if people can get these  jobs  back, under the policies of this administration, they will be told: You can  work, so be happy and smile that we  are going to pay you $9 an hour, on  which you cannot even feed your family,  invest  in your pension, or send  your children to school. You should  smile and be happy you have a job.  People in Louisiana want more respect than that. They deserve more respect than that. The people along the  gulf coast are, as I have said many  times, honest, hardworking, and self-  reliant. We do not come here asking for  charity, but we do come here asking  for help out of our National Treasury  to which we have contributed so much  over 300 years of hard work and toil to  build the Nation’s only energy coast.  We are proud to do it, proud to take  the risks associated with that hard  work—building  a  port  system,  the  greatest in the North American Continent, and building commerce that allows every State and every parish and  every county in America to flourish.  Without this port system, without this  energy coast, our Nation would not be  what it is today.

The assistant legislative clerk read  as follows:  The  A bill (H.R. 1409) to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide assistance for  orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries, and for other purposes.  There being no objection, the Senate  proceeded to consider the bill.  ",2005
1381,29,2005-10-24,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, I rise to  comment on H.R. 1409, a companion  bill to S. 350, the Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children  in Developing Countries Act of 2005,  which I introduced earlier this year.  Prior to its passage, I want to address  a concern that the administration has  raised about the bill.  I want to clarify that this legislation  is in no way intended to undercut the  existing authority of the Global AIDS  Coordinator over all U.S. Government  resources  and  programs  relating  to  international HIV/AIDS. The Office of  the Global AIDS Coordinator has made  tremendous progress  in bringing  together U.S. Government resources in  addressing orphans and vulnerable children as part of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. In accordance with section 102 of Public Law  108–25,  the U.S. Leadership Against  HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria  Act of 2003, the Global AIDS Coordinator has primary responsibility  for  programming and directing funds for  all  international HIV/AIDS activities  carried out by the U.S. Government.  This legislation is not intended to  create new or separate authorities in  programming  or  funding under  the  emergency plan regarding orphans and  vulnerable children and HIV/AIDS programs, but rather provides for an advisory position to ensure that the best  approaches to addressing the needs of  this population are employed  in our  foreign HIV/AIDS programs.  I would  expect that the position created by this  new legislation would work within the  processes developed by the Office of the  Global AIDS Coordinator  to  ensure  that planning and implementation of  any orphans and vulnerable children  programs  relating  to  international  HIV/AIDS are consistent with the goals  of the emergency plan. In fact, it is  possible that this position may indeed  be within the Office of the Global AIDS  Coordinator, at the discretion of the  Secretary of State, because of the close  relationship of HIV/AIDS and its effect  on orphans and vulnerable children.  The AIDS orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for political stability, development, and human  welfare that extend far beyond the region, affecting governments and people  worldwide.

1390,1,2005-11-01,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker,  the  prospect of an avian flu pandemic has  mobilized  government  officials  and  health care professionals across  the  United States. Every year there is a  new outbreak of flu strains, with potentially serious consequences for the  elderly, children and people with compromised immune systems. In his address this morning, President Bush accurately differentiated between traditional flu viruses and the avian flu.  This specific flu strain, H5N1, is particularly virulent, with a 50 percent  mortality  rate  once  contracted. To  date, 110 people have been infected, and  60 deaths have been attributed to this  flu. The virus has been tracked from  Mongolia  and Siberia,  through  the  Ukraine and Croatia to Turkey. Avian  flu has spread to 16 countries. There is  not yet an avian pandemic  in  the  United States, but as we live in an  ever-shrinking world with all our travel, we must be prepared for its unwelcome arrival.  In this week’s edition of Newsweek,  Dr. Margaret Chan, head of preparedness  for the World Health Organization, states, ‘‘Key factors to combating  a global pandemic are early detection,  quarantines, availability of vaccines  and antiviral drugs, and the state of  hospital readiness to treat those  infected.’’  I would like to focus on one of these  key  factors  in particular, the availability of this medication. On May 4 of  this year in the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee where I serve,  hearings were held on the current state  of preparedness for the upcoming flu  season. In those hearings, health officials testified that manufacturing of  flu vaccines is an annual process beginning  in February with  the World  Health Organization and the Centers  for Disease Control publishing  their  predictions of flu strains that are most  likely to spread that winter. Manufacturing vaccines is a lengthy and complex process that leaves little margin  for error. The possibility of contamination of these biologically grown vaccines is great, and, as we saw with the  vaccine producer Chiron in 2003, could  potentially render entire productions  worthless. Fear of liability compounds  the short supply of vaccines. In the  1960s, the U.S. had more than 26 vaccine producers in this country. Today  only five companies remain. Currently,  we rely upon one vaccine producer to  make the annual flu cocktails as well  as eight other common childhood vaccinations  such  as measles, mumps,  diphtheria and meningitis. Lawsuits  make  production  unprofitable  and  risky, pushing producers away  from  vaccines and towards the more lucrative industry of antiviral medications.  This raises concern among health experts  about  resurgence  of  formerly  eradicated diseases if vaccine shortages  continue. Congress should consider offering companies  incentives to enter  the vaccine  industry and, of course,  limiting  the  liability burden. These  were  included  in  President  Bush’s  avian flu strategy this morning. The  President has asked Congress to remove the litigation burden on vaccine  manufacturers and  fund development  of new cell culture techniques. These  techniques reduce the time lag between  identification  of  a  new  pandemic  threat and development of a vaccine.  Avian flu is the current threat to our  Nation’s health, but we can be assured  it will not be the last. Therefore, increasing our vaccine capacity is necessary to our national security.  There are two antiviral medications  available that are believed to treat  avian  flu,  Tamiflu  and  Relenex.  Tamiflu  is  the more  widely  recommended medication, and our government is currently building stockpiles  of this medication in anticipation of  possible  outbreaks  in  this  country.  However, there is a danger of many individuals  building  personal Tamiflu  stockpiles. The Washington Post reported that 1.7 million prescriptions for  Tamiflu were  filled  in  the United  States in just the first 8 months of 2005,  which is three times more than last  year. Personal stockpiles pose a twofold risk. The first is that private consumers reduce the already limited supply of the drug, causing the government to have to compete to fulfill its  supply goals, and cause a shortage of  supply for public health care providers.  The second threat is from individuals  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

1397,8,2005-11-01,Mr. GUTKNECHT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise  in support of H.R. 3989, as  amended. I offer this bill together with  my  colleague  from Minnesota  (Mr.  KLINE). This bill would designate the  post office in Dennison, Minnesota, as  the Albert H. Quie Post Office Building.  Let me tell you a little bit about Al  Quie. I am privileged to know Al and  have known him for a very long time.  Al Quie was born on a farm in Wheeling  Township  in  Rice  County  near  Dennison, Minnesota, on September 8,  1923. He attended the grade schools in  Nerstrand  and  high  school  in  Northfield. He graduated from St. Olaf  College in 1950.  Mr. Quie served as a pilot  in the  United States Navy from 1943 to 1945.  He later became the owner and operator of a dairy  farm there  in Rice  County. He was the clerk of the District 43 School Board from 1949 to 1952  and a supervisor for the Rice County  Soil Conservation District  from 1950  until 1954.  Al Quie was elected to the Minnesota  State Senate in 1955, and he was elected as a Republican to the 85th Congress  by a special election to fill the vacancy  caused by the death of United States  Representative August Andresen. He  was reelected to the succeeding Congresses  for 10 consecutive terms.  In  1978, he left the Congress to run for  Governor of Minnesota where he served  from 1979 until 1983.  You cannot talk about Al Quie without talking about his wife, Gretchen, a  very special woman, a loving and tender woman; and I remember her so well  as the First Lady of the State of Minnesota.  But Al Quie is so many things. He  was a true patriot, a very committed  Christian, a loving father and husband.  He was a principled public servant; and  in many respects, he embodied all of  the qualities that we  in this House  should emulate. I think naming a post  office after him in his hometown of  Dennison, Minnesota, is a very, very  small tribute.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2005
1398,8,2005-11-01,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the  House Government Reform Committee,  I am pleased to join my colleague in  consideration of H.R. 3989, legislation  naming the postal facility in Dennison,  Minnesota, after Albert Harold Quie.  This measure, which was introduced by  Representative JOHNKLINEon October  6, 2005, and unanimously reported by  our committee on October 20, 2005, enjoys the support and cosponsorship of  the entire Minnesota delegation.  Harold Quie, a native of Minnesota,  was born on a farm, educated in the  State, and served in the U.S. Navy for  2 years. He served in the Minnesota  State Senate from 1955 to 1958, before  serving in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1958. Representative Quie was  reelected and served until 1979 when he  was elected Governor of Minnesota. He  served as Governor until 1983.  After 25 years in government as a  public  servant, Representative Quie  continued to be a man of the people. He  became a lecturer, teacher, and director, and vice president of Prison Fellowship, both in Minnesota and North  Dakota. Representative Quie  is currently retired, living in Minnesota.  Mr. Speaker,  I commend my colleague for seeking to honor the contributions  of  former Representative  and Governor Quie, and I urge swift  passage of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2005

1400,8,2005-11-01,Mr. KLINE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding me this time  and for his leadership on this bill. I  think it was Mr. GUTKNECHT’s original  idea, and I am very pleased that he had  it.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 3989, this resolution which pays  tribute to an outstanding Minnesotan  through the designation of the Albert  H. Quie Post Office. I express my appreciation  to my colleague  from Minnesota, as I said, for his leadership, for  his initiative in this bill, and for helping us pull the entire Minnesota delegation together. We have unanimous  bipartisan support for this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, Al Quie is a lifelong  Minnesotan who is guided by a strong  faith and the principle of selfless service. Residents of Minnesota’s Second  Congressional District can be proud of  this native son who was born on a farm  in Rice  County, was  educated  in  Nerstrand and Northfield, and graduated from St. Olaf College in 1950, all  institutions in the Second District of  Minnesota.

1401,15,2005-11-01,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BURTON) is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2005
1402,15,2005-11-01,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States  today made a speech before our health  agencies that I think was very timely  and very important. It dealt with the  possible outbreak of the bird flu, better  known as the avian flu, and he talked  about steps that needed to be taken to  speed up the process to create more  vaccines to protect the American public against a pandemic that could kill  tens of thousands, if not millions, of  Americans. I think if is very laudable  that he did that.  One of the things he talked about  was tort reform to protect the pharmaceutical  industry  against  liability  suits, because he said there is only one  vaccine manufacturer  in  the United  States, and that is because the vaccine  manufacturers  have  been  afraid  to  produce vaccines because they might  be sued on a class action basis. There  might be thousands of people suing  them because of damage that has been  done to them.  So if I were talking to the President  tonight, I would say, first of all, Mr.  President, I think what you said was  very good and what you proposed is  very good. There are a couple of things  that ought to be added to the mix  though, Mr. President, that I think are  very important.  First of all, we had hearings  for  about 4 years on mercury in vaccines.  It used to be one in 10,000 children were  autistic. Now it is one in 166. We had  scientists from all over the world and  doctors from all over the United States  come in and testify that one of the  leading causes of neurological problems in children and adults who are  suffering from things like Alzheimer’s  is they have been damaged by the mercury that is used as a preservative in  vaccines. It is called Thimerosal.  We need to get mercury out of all  vaccines. Until that happens, I think it  is going to be very difficult for this  body and the other body to pass legislation to protect the pharmaceutical  industries and the vaccine industries  against class action lawsuits.  So the first thing I would say to the  President was, get mercury out of all  vaccines. That is very important.  Second, make  the Vaccine  Injury  Compensation Program user friendly.  Right now, people who have had children who have been damaged are losing  their homes. They are having to mortgage everything they own to pay for  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:18 Nov 02, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K01NO7.039 H01NOPT1 ",2005
1403,22,2005-11-01,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Texas, the judge,  for sharing those thoughts with us.  I wanted to assure the judge, as he  well knows, that we intend to do something about it this week, and this is  what H.R. 4128 does. It protects private  property rights, and we will get into  that in just a few minutes.  Earlier we heard, Mr. Speaker, from  our colleague from Ohio, and the gentlewoman talked about her father in  fact who built some of these little German homes, he being of German ancestry. I am not sure that this next poster  that I have got is a picture of a home  in Ohio, for that matter even in New  London, Connecticut, but, boy, it sure  has a German look to me.  I have been to Germany a time or  two, a lovely country, and I have seen  some  residences,  some houses,  free-  standing houses, look a little bit like  that. But look at that sign in the front  yard, for sale, not by owner, but by  government, and that is what we are  talking about here. That  is exactly  what the gentlewoman from Ohio was  describing in her district, and this is  what the people, quite frankly, in New  London, Connecticut, were fighting for.  b2045  As I said a little earlier, a developer  who wants to put up a mega store, a  big box, a new luxury five-star hotel or  a  four-star  restaurant, or whatever  they want to do, expand that shopping  center I think we were hearing about  earlier, let them do it and let them buy  what property they can buy. If a price  is offered that  is attractive enough,  you will have plenty of willing sellers.  And if you have one or two that are  unwilling, for the reasons the gentlewoman was describing,  I  think  she  pointed out a gentleman 82 years old,  been married 50 years, lost his wife,  been in the home their whole married  life, let some creative architect figure  out a way to build around that home  and still have an attractive development. It can be done, no question about  that, Mr. Speaker.  This next poster, my colleagues, I  think  is the most  important of the  three. Because while I have emphasized  that under this new expanded ruling of  this activist court, this 5–4 decision,  that a person’s home, where they have  raised their children and maybe even  their  grandchildren  and  lost  their  spouse, can be taken for this expanded  so-called public use called economic development,  bigger  tax  base, more  bucks, or  the  small business  I described, the little bakery.  But look at this, at this poster, this  slide. You  recognize  it. That  is  a  church.  It could  just as well be a  mosque or a synagogue. A place of worship basically is what it is. Guess how  much taxes God pays to the local government? None. None.  So if we allow this decision to stand,  there will be plenty of  incentive to  take a small business or a home where  the property taxes are not enough. You  know, if it were a bigger home and it  had 5,000 square feet instead of 2,000  square feet, you could raise the tax  base, and if it were a business. But it is  paying some taxes. There is revenue,  hopefully a profit. These small business  owners are definitely taxed, and that  tax goes to support the local community.  So if there is an incentive to take  their property when there is a tax base,  think  about what  the  incentive  is  going to be for the local government to  take God’s property, where there is no  tax base. It is tax free. We cannot allow  that to happen, Mr. Speaker.  I know my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle understand this. I know it  from the fact that I brought a resolution to this House floor shortly after  June 23, and we had Members on both  sides of the aisle running to the voting  machine to punch that green light expressing their outrage over this decision. So it is certainly not a partisan  outrage. We are all upset about it.  This week we intend to do something  about it. Indeed, to take God’s property so we can put in some high-tax-  paying business, restaurant, hotel for  the purposes of  increasing  that  tax  base. Then you say, oh yes, but this is  for the public good because we are  going to have money to build more  parks and recreation facilities. Indeed.  Indeed.  My colleagues, I mentioned the facts  in the New London case, and I will not  go into that in any more detail, but listen to some of the arguments in that  case. The residents, the petitioners, argued the condemnation by the City of  New London constituted a violation of  the fifth amendment’s public use provision: Nor  shall private property be  taken for public use without just compensation. The judge from Texas talked  about  that. The  gentlewoman  from  Ohio and the gentlewoman from Tennessee all talked about that.  The residents argued that economic  development in and of itself does not  constitute a public use. But the City of  New London, the defendants  in this  case, argued that, hey, new jobs, increased tax revenue, that is qualification enough for taking as a public use  and, therefore, this taking did not constitute a violation of the Fifth Amendment. They also argued that they were  operating  in  accordance with Connecticut law.  Well, unfortunately, unfortunately,  Mr. Speaker, the majority, five of our  Supreme Court justices, Justice Stevens, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter,  Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer,  agreed with the City of New London,  and the majority opinion focused on a  broad, very broad interpretation of the  term public use in the Fifth Amendment.  The opinion states that there is no  way to distinguish between economic  development from other types of public  use development. The majority did not  want  to  second-guess  local  government. They did not want the State and  local government to say a particular  development project is for public use.  They are the only  final arbiters of  what is and what is not public use. I  think I can say that it was a ridiculous  majority opinion.  In  the dissenting opinion, Justice  O’Connor, Justice Renquist, God rest  his soul, Justice Scalia, and Justice  Thomas cites the majority opinion for  what it is, an abandonment of over two  centuries worth of precedent. In the  dissenting opinion, Justice O’Connor  stresses that the term public use  is  very explicit and that the Founders intended that the term public use needed  to be there. Justice O’Connor writes  that the majority’s opinion nullifies  the term public use, and now State and  local government can justify any taking of land from one individual to another to give to another private party  if it presents any economic benefit to  the tax base or any other aspect of the  community.  This, Mr. Speaker, cannot, shall not  stand. And I want to take this opportunity tonight during the remaining  time that we have to pay tribute to the  sensible chairman, who has great wisdom and a lot of common sense, the  chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and I am talking about the  gentleman  from Wisconsin  (Mr. SENSENBRENNER). He will bring  to  this  floor, probably on Thursday of this  week, H.R. 4128.  I would like to take this time to explain the provisions of that bill, because it is so very important. In this  bill, it will say that Congress’ power to  condition the use of Federal funds will  extend to prohibiting States and localities from receiving any Federal economic development funds for a specified period of time  if such entities  abuse their power of eminent domain,  even if only State and local funds are  used in that abuse of power.  H.R. 4128 also includes an express private right of action to make certain  that those suffering  injuries  from a  violation of the bill will be allowed access to a State or Federal Court to enforce its provisions. It also includes a  fee-shifting provision, and  listen  to  this, identical to those in other civil  rights  laws that allows a prevailing  property owner attorney and expert  fees as a part of the cost of bringing  the litigation to enforce the bill’s provision, as it should.  Under H.R. 4128, States and localities  will have the clear opportunity, we are  going to give them a last chance, to  cure any violation before they lose any  Federal economic development  funds  by either returning or replacing the  improperly taken property. We are giving them a chance to make amends before the hammer falls.  H.R.  4128  also  includes  carefully  crafted refinements of the definition of  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:18 Nov 02, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K01NO7.051 H01NOPT1 ",2005

What I am  going to do is, if you could, we want to  get that Web site so we can click over  and have more time so that we can  continue to talk about this issue.  I am pleased that the Members who  have been  following this  issue  for a  very long time on behalf of the American people are here. If you can give  the Web site, I would appreciate it, real  quick.  ",2005
1405,29,2005-11-01,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," You can get ahold  of  us  at  30somethingdems@mail.house.gov. We  are going to get up these facts on the  Web site, too, so you can follow them.  ",2005
1406,29,2005-11-01,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  we want  to  thank  the Democratic  Leader and the Democratic leadership  for allowing us to have this hour.  f  30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  CONAWAY). Under  the Speaker’s announced policy of January 4, 2005, the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN) is recognized for 60 minutes.  ",2005
1407,29,2005-11-01,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, we  are going to keep on rolling here. We  have so many facts to deal with.  Part of  the conversation  that we  were just engaged in is we know that  Karl Rove lied to the American people.  We know that Scooter Libby has misrepresented facts and been indicted on  five counts: one obstruction of justice,  two making false statements, and two  committing perjury, lying to Federal  agents and lying to the grand jury.  We know that the Vice President of  the United States has clearly, clearly  withheld information from the American people, that the indictment has  said that he knew all about, regarding  the Valerie Plame investigation.  b2200  ",2005
1408,29,2005-11-01,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  it  is  important to understand  that not only did the Vice President  and his chief of staff, Mr. Libby, withhold  information  from the American  people; they have made a decision to  withhold from the Senate Intelligence  Committee key documents. It was reported just this past week in a national  magazine, the National Journal, that  the Vice President and Mr. Libby overruled advice from some White House  political staffers, some White House  political staffers and lawyers, and decided to withhold crucial documents  from  the Senate  Intelligence Committee in 2004. The withheld documents  included  intelligence data  from CHENEY’s office and Libby in particular,  that they pushed to be  included  in  Powell’s speech, referring to his presentation before the United Nations.  The new information, and I am reading here,  the new  information  that  CHENEYand Libby blocked information  to the Senate Intelligence Committee  further underscores  the central  role  played by the Vice President’s office in  trying to blunt criticism that the Bush  administration  exaggerated  intelligence data to make the case to go to  war.  They withheld it from the Senate.  They withheld it from the Senate. And  because there is no conduct of vigorous  oversight either in this Chamber or in  the Senate, our democracy  is being  shrouded in this cloud of secrecy.  The gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  earlier  said,  What did we do it for? Why? Why? Why,  I guess, is going to be the question that  people will ask far into the future. If  you remember, first it was about the  weapons of mass destruction. No weapons of mass destruction. It was about  some alleged al Qaeda links, a haven  for terrorism. No al Qaeda links. Saddam Hussein despises Osama bin Laden  and vice versa because Saddam Hussein, albeit an evil individual, was a  secularist. He is not one of these fundamental Islamists. He is just a regional  thug. And then finally it was to bring  democracy to Iraq.  I think it is so ironic that we are  bringing democracy to Iraq and simultaneously eroding democracy because  of the secrecy in Washington, D.C.  What a tragedy.  ",2005
1409,29,2005-11-01,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  (Mr.  DELAHUNT) said we are eroding basic  freedoms here. And if you do not believe that, if you do not believe all of  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ)  these facts that we are giving to the  Speaker and to the American people  and to our colleagues through third-  party validators,  if you weaken the  Central Intelligence Agency, all you  have done is weaken a country. That is  all you have done.  And through the leak, through the  outing of Joe Wilson’s wife, and outing  Brewster-Jennings and Associates, the  small Boston company that was a front  company  for the CIA, you also out  every contact that this woman has established over a 20-plus-year career. All  of her contacts over 20-some years that  maybe she could go back to and elicit  and solicit information from them, she  cannot any longer.  ",2005
1410,29,2005-11-01,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Maybe  somebody  can help me, because this is a question  that the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. INSLEE) posed, but this is directed  to this specific case.  What does it tell you about an administration that will not confront a  direct challenge as former Ambassador  Joe Wilson put forward? Why not just  simply say he is wrong and we are confident that he is wrong? But, no, furtively, in the shadows, sneakily calling  reporters, we have got something. His  wife works for the CIA. Whether it was  illegal, whether this  indictment will  result in guilty, whether Karl Rove is  indicted, whether others are indicted,  the bottom line is what does it say  about the sleaze factor that exists here  in Washington when you do  it that  way?  ",2005
1411,29,2005-11-01,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I  can tell you right now, this goes far,  once again, beyond politics. This is serious business.  We have Members here who have  traveled abroad. I have. I am on the  Armed Services Committee. I am on  the Homeland Security Committee. If  you know how it was to go down to a  hotel  lobby and go to a restaurant  where you are staying there at a hotel,  you come back to a hotel after official  meetings with the government and you  do not understand what people are saying, need it be French, need it be Arabic, need it be Spanish or what have  you, now, just think for a minute. If I  were a CIA agent in a foreign land, or  someone  in a  friendly country that  works with the United States as it relates to sharing sensitive information,  how do they feel right now? How do  they  feel about America right now?  How do they feel about our executive  branch right now? And how do they feel  about the Congress? This is going to  hurt us.  The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN)  put it just as clear as it can be. It is  weakening a country when  it comes  down to getting the intelligence to protect all of us here in the United States  and our allies. And I think it is important, I think it is important, and the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. INSLEE) hit the nail straight on the head.  Like we say down in Florida, he hit the  nail straight on the head just like a  good carpenter.

1488,43,2005-11-01,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from New Hampshire.  ,2005
1489,43,2005-11-01,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, let me  echo the comments of the Senator from  North Dakota relative to his staff and  himself. They are extraordinarily professional. As he mentioned, we do have  some disagreements, but we do it in  what I think is an appropriate way. We  discuss the policy. We disagree on policy. But it is never personal, and there  is always a cooperative spirit to try to  do the business of the Senate. I greatly  admire  his  professionalism  and  his  staff’s professionalism.  I understand the Senator from North  Dakota has another 4 hours. I regret we  are not going to hear him speak for  that entire period of time because this  last hour was certainly ‘‘chartlizing’’;  not scintillating but ‘‘chartlizing.’’  The Senator has made a number of  points, some of which I actually agree  with but most of which I must say I  find inconsistent with the facts that  are on the ground. With what do I  agree? I agree with the fact we are  headed toward a fiscal problem of immense proportions primarily driven by  the fact that we have a tremendous  baby boom generation that is about to  retire. Yesterday  I  spoke  at  some  length about that. That is why we need  to initiate efforts to get under control  spending of the Federal Government,  especially in the mandatory accounts—  mandatory accounts being those accounts which people have a right to,  simply  because  of  their  situation,  whether it is a fiscal situation or personal situation. They may be a former  member of the military—veterans benefits; they may be of a certain age;  they may be of a certain income.  The most significant mandatory programs which are  facing us are, of  course, the entitlement programs benefiting retired individuals—Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The only  way you can address retired programs,  mandatory programs, is through a reconciliation bill which is what we have  before us today, a deficit reduction  bill, because you have to change the  law in order to accomplish changes in  the ways those bills are going to spend  money over the years to come.  So the Republican Congress, the leadership  and  the  membership,  has  stepped forward with an aggressive proposal to try to do that. It is the first  time in 8 years that we have seen an effort to try to put some brakes on the  rate of spending on the mandatory side  of the Federal Government.  Thirty-five billion dollars, $35 billion  original instruction, and $30 billion is  what the committees of the Senate  have reported back in deficit reduction  initiatives in this bill which is before  us today. It cannot be discounted so  casually, as the Senator from North  Dakota has. He has essentially said it  is not a deficit reduction because there  will be a bill afterward that will give  tax relief or it is not deficit reduction  because the debt goes up. The simple  fact is that those are inaccurate statements.  This bill, if you vote for it, will reduce the deficit by $39 billion in its  present form. That is a fact, a simple,  incontrovertible fact. There will be a  tax relief bill that will follow this bill.  I wish to point out that my colleague  from North Dakota—and he has openly  said this—is going to probably vote for  a lot of the amendments to that tax relief bill because they are good initiatives which need to be done. As he  mentioned,  the AMT,  as  he mentioned—I am not sure he mentioned it,  but others have mentioned the State  and local sales tax deductibility or deductibility of  certain  education  expenses which teachers incur when they  are trying to spend money on their  classroom or the savings credit—all of  these—or the R&D tax credit which  makes us more competitive as a nation. The other side of the aisle is saying all those taxes should be raised on  all those people. Are they saying that  the 8 million people who  fall under  AMT should have their taxes raised?  Are they saying people in the United  States who get to deduct their sales  tax should have their taxes raised? Are  they  saying  that  teachers who buy  crayons for the classroom should have  their taxes raised? Are they saying  that small businesses, especially those  that go out and invest in opportunity  and creativity by doing R&D expansion, should have their taxes changed  and raised? Maybe they are. Clearly, if  they are claiming that the next bill,  the tax relief bill, is a bad bill—that is  what they are claiming because that  bill is going to be made up primarily of  those initiatives.  We can get into a debate about dividends and capital gains, also.  What has generated the revenue in  this country in the last few years? We  have seen one of the most dramatic expansions in revenue in this country in  the last 20 years and rate of growth of  revenue as a result of having cut taxes  and given people more incentive to be  creative, go out and invest, create careers for people, and create economics  to create jobs.  This chart shows, as we have watched  the tax cuts put into place, that revenues have been  jumping every year.  Why? They are headed back to the historical mean where they have been traditionally. They have been jumping because people have had an incentive to  go out and invest, to create economic  activity, to take risks, to create careers, create jobs, and that is taxable  activity which is coming back to the  Federal Government.  Sure, revenues have dropped dramatically, as many of the charts the Senator from North Dakota pointed out  show. But the drop in those revenues  was a function of two events which we  had very little control over: the bursting of the bubble of the 1990s, which  was the largest bubble in the history of  world, bigger than the South Sea Bubble. It was the Internet bubble, and it  burst. Quite honestly, we should have  gone into a dramatic depression as nation as a result of that burst. But because this President had the foresight  to put into place a tax credit on the  productive side of the ledger, we did  not see that dramatic economic downturn. We saw a reduction, and that reduction dropped revenues.  We were hit with 9/11. Never before  has this Nation been hit with an event  like 9/11 where we lost thousands of  people on our soil here in the United  States. Pearl Harbor, obviously, is a  comparable. But  the  civilian  losses  were overwhelming, and the economic  loss was dramatic. We were hit with a  body blow to our economy. So that line  went down again.  We had the bursting of the bubble,  compounded by the single largest attack on our Nation certainly  since  Pearl Harbor, arguably exceeding Pearl  Harbor  in many ways, and the economic  impact  forced  the  economy  down further. That is why the economy  dropped. It wasn’t the tax cuts that  dropped the revenue. The tax cuts have  been shown to increase revenues and  will continue to increase revenues.  For the other side to take the position that anything else is happening is  wrong because the facts are clear. The  revenues are going up, and they are  jumping  dramatically  back  to  the  norm, 18 percent gross domestic product for the revenue. A lot of that is a  function of tax relief which we will be  seeing in the tax package which will be  coming here to extend those tax relief  initiatives in the next bill. But this bill  VerDate Mar 15 2010  20:22 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S01NO5.REC S01NO5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005
1490,50,2005-11-01,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from North Dakota.  ,2005
1491,50,2005-11-01,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I think  the chairman of the Budget Committee  just summed up the position of his  party when he said we have to borrow  the money because we have the debt.  That is exactly right. Their party has  put us on a fiscal course to explode the  debt. And when  the Senator  talks  about deficit reduction, which is on the  cover of the book of the matter that we  are discussing today—it says deficit reduction—it just doesn’t have any credibility because it is part of a package.  The package is the budget that was  passed earlier this year. This reconciliation process we are going through now  was authorized by that budget. That  budget didn’t reduce any deficit; it increased the deficit. Most seriously, it  exploded the debt.  Well, here it is. The budget we are  working to conclude increases the debt  by $3.4 trillion over the next 5 years.  The spending cut they have out here  right now is $39 billion. By the way,  they are about to reduce that because  the  first amendment  from our  colleagues on the other side is a spending  amendment.  But let’s look at the whole package,  the whole package that our colleagues  have offered the country, have offered  the Senate. If doesn’t reduce the deficit, it doesn’t reduce the debt, it dramatically expands the debt—not by my  calculation but by their calculation.  Here  is their calculation of the  increase in the debt of their 5-year budget proposal. They are going to run up  the debt $3.4 trillion. This spending out  here over 5 years of $39 billion basically  does not touch it.  Now, my colleague had a whole list of  possible tax cuts and said, well, maybe  we are for increasing the taxes on the  American  people,  on  those  various  items. I support extension of many of  those tax cuts, but I believe they ought  to be paid for. That is the way we used  to do business around here. We used to  have a provision we called pay-go, and  if you wanted to increase spending or  you wanted to have more tax cuts, you  could do it, but you had to pay for it.  There is an old-fashioned idea: pay for  it. Our colleagues over here don’t want  to pay for anything. They want every  tax cut, they want every spending provision—this increase in spending. They  are in control. The spending they are  complaining  about,  they  passed  it.  They control the Senate of the United  States. They control the House of Representatives. They control the White  House. Every dime of this spending  that they are complaining about, they  passed—every dime of it. The President  has not vetoed one spending bill. Every  dime of this spending they supported.  But here is what they did on the revenue side. This is what has happened to  the revenue. The revenue side of the  equation collapsed, and, yes, we have  had an upkick in the last year, absolutely. The Senator is correct. Revenue  has increased in the last year. But look  at where it is. It is way below the historical level. The result of this combination of  their  spending  increases  and their tax cuts has been to explode  the deficits. We have had in the last 3  years the largest deficits in the history  of the country. They have exploded the  debt—not by my calculation but by  their own calculation and by the historic record.  Look, when this President came in,  the debt was $5.7 trillion. In 5 years he  is going to have added $3 trillion, if  this budget plan passes. They ran up  the debt another $551 billion for the  last year alone. They are going to increase the debt of this country in the 5  years of this Presidency by $3 trillion,  and in the next 5 years they are going  to run it up another $3 trillion.  Now, facts are stubborn things. It is  very interesting that my colleague on  the other side, when he put up the possible tax cuts they are talking about,  left this one out. You didn’t see this.  You didn’t see this one mentioned, the  capital gains and dividends tax cuts.  Here is the distribution of those tax  cuts, who gets them: Those earning  over $1 million a year will get, on average, a $35,000 tax cut. Those earning  less than $50,000 a year, this is what  they get: $6—$6. That is what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  think is a fair distribution of the tax  cuts—$6  for those earning  less than  $50,000 a year, $35,000 for those earning  over $1 million a year. And one of the  ways they reduce the cost of all this is  to take from the least among us.  Go look at what the House of Representatives  is proposing by way of  their spending cuts. They are going to  cut Medicaid, they are going to cut  food stamps, the things that go to the  least among us so that they can give  additional tax cuts to those who have  the most among us.  That is not a value that I have read  in any Bible. My Bible does not say  take from the least among us to give to  the most among us. I have not seen  that in any chapter of the Bible or, for  that matter, in any holy book. Virtually  every  religion—perhaps  every  religion—has as a value that we help  the least among us. We don’t take from  the least among us to give to those  who have the most. But that is exactly  what is before us in this proposal.  Again I say to my colleagues, you  can’t separate out the first chapter of  the book they have labeled deficit reSON duction; you have to read the whole  book. You have to read all the chapters. If you read the chapters of this  book, what you find is in chapter 1,  they cut a little bit of spending, in  chapter 2 they cut even more revenue,  and in chapter 3, they explode the debt  by $781 billion. And they call it deficit  reduction? Please.  If you look at the whole book, if you  read the entire book, what you find is  they are going to increase the debt of  our country by $3 trillion over the next  5 years. And they are out here talking  about deficit reduction? No, that dog  won’t hunt.  I rise to offer an amendment with  Senator NELSONand Senator FEINGOLD  to restore some budget discipline. We  want to go back to the pay-as-you-go  rule that served this country so well in  previous years. I thank Senator NELand Senator FEINGOLD for their  leadership on this issue. I see Senator  FEINGOLDis on the floor.  Our amendment is simple. It restores  the original pay-go rules preventing  new mandatory spending and new tax  cuts unless they are paid for. My colleague talks about all the additional  tax cuts he wants. That is fine. I will  support a lot of them, but we have to  pay for them. Otherwise, we are borrowing money from China, Japan, the  Caribbean Banking Centers, and all the  rest to give tax cuts that, in many  cases, go predominantly to the wealthiest among us. What a bizarre strategy  that is.  The proposal we are making today  eliminates a loophole in the current  pay-go rule which exempts tax cuts and  spending  increases that are provided  for in the budget resolution. We don’t  have to pay for them if they are in the  budget resolution. This huge loophole  encourages  fiscally  irresponsible behavior, which is exactly how I would  characterize the budget that is before  us. It is fiscally irresponsible—fiscally  irresponsible to increase the debt by $3  trillion when we have already almost  $8 trillion of debt. If people are serious  about  fiscal discipline, this  is their  chance to prove it.  I would like to take a moment to remind my colleagues of the history of  pay-go and why it is important to reinstate the original pay-go rule.  The rule was adopted in 1990 at a  time when  the Federal Government  was facing unprecedented deficits, just  as we are today. Originally, the pay-go  rule created a 60-vote point of order  against tax cuts and mandatory spending that would increase the deficit. Tax  cuts and increased spending either had  to be paid for or face a 60-vote point of  order. Back in the nineties, the budget  discipline of pay-go helped us  turn  record deficits  into record surpluses.  But the pay-go rule we have now has  lost its teeth. What we are left with is  a pale reminder of what pay-go used to  be.  The current pay-go rule exempts all  policies assumed in every budget resolution. As a result of these changes,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  20:22 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S01NO5.REC S01NO5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005

1496,64,2005-11-01,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President, I  say to the distinguished Senator from  Michigan, I have the same document  and ask unanimous consent that be  printed in the RECORD.  Mr. President, also, there was a reference in the chairman’s remarks as to  events that went on  in the Douglas  Feith matter,  and  he  referred  to  ‘‘lawyering up.’’ There is a very clear,  easy, simple answer to that, and I ask  unanimous consent that be printed in  the RECORD, also.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the United States Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence, Feb. 12, 2004]  CHAIRMAN ROBERTS AND VICE CHAIRMAN  ROCKEFELLER ISSUESTATEMENTON INTELLIGENCECOMMITTEE’SREVIEWOFPREWAR  INTELLIGENCEINIRAQ  WASHINGTON, DC.—Senator Pat Roberts  (R–KS), Chairman, and Senator Jay Rockefeller IV (D–WV), Vice Chairman, of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today  announced that the Committee unanimously  agreed to refine the terms of reference of the  Committee’s ongoing inquiry into pre war  intelligence with regard to Iraq. The new  terms are as follows:  A. The matters set forth in the joint release of the Chairman and Vice Chairman on  June 20, 2003:  1. The quantity and quality of U.S. intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction  programs, ties to terrorist groups, Saddam  Hussein’s threat to stability and security in  the region, and his repression of his own people;  2.  the objectivity,  reasonableness,  independence, and accuracy of the  judgments  reached by the Intelligence Community;  3. whether those judgments were properly  disseminated to policy makers in the Executive Branch and Congress;  4. whether any influence was brought to  bear on anyone to shape their analysis to  support policy objectives; and  5. other issues we mutually identify in the  course of the Committee’s review;  B. the collection of intelligence on Iraq  from the end of the Gulf War to the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom;  C. whether public statements and reports  and testimony regarding Iraq by U.S. Government officials made between the Gulf War  period and the commencement of Operation  Iraqi Freedom were substantiated by intelligence information;  D. the postwar findings about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and weapons programs and links to terrorism and how they  compare with prewar assessments;  E. prewar intelligence assessments about  postwar Iraq;  F. any intelligence activities relating to  Iraq  conducted  by  the Policy  Counterterrorism Evaluation Group  (PCTEG) and  the Office of Special Plans within the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy;  and  G. the use by the Intelligence Community  of  information provided by the Iraqi National Congress (INC).  Sen. Roberts said, ‘‘Today’s agreement reflects a refinement and to a great extent a  restatement of the Committee’s ongoing review of pre-war intelligence. The resolution  adopted unanimously today illustrates the  commitment of all members to a thorough  review, to  learning the necessary  lessons  from our experience with Iraq, and to ensuring that our armed forces and policymakers  benefit from the best and most reliable intelligence that can be collected. I believe that  the report which we are currently reviewing  will have a profound impact on the future of  our Intelligence Community. My hope is that  we be able to release our initial report soon  and then continue our review as we work toward recommendations. I congratulate all  members for their willingness to work together toward these goals.’’  Sen. Rockefeller said, ‘‘This agreement reflects a difficult and lengthy process, but in  the end, we were able to reach consensus on  the need to expand the investigation into  several key areas.’’  ‘‘We will address the question of whether  intelligence was exaggerated or misused by  reviewing statements by senior policy makers to determine if those statements were  substantiated by the intelligence,’’ Rockefeller said. ‘‘We will take a closer look at the  shortfalls in our intelligence collection. We  will compare pre-war estimates to the situation in postwar Iraq, and we will pursue a  better understanding of what role the Policy  Counterterrorism Evaluation Group and the  Office of Special Plans played in pre-war intelligence. There are definitely a few outstanding  issues, but we’ve made a  lot of  progress, and it’s clear that we’re moving in  the right direction.’’  RESPONSETODEPARTMENTOFDEFENSELETTER REGARDING SENATOR ROCKEFELLER’S  STATEMENTONUNDERSECRETARYFEITH  In July 2004, officials at the Department of  Defense took exception to my characterization of the activities of the office of Under  Secretary of Defense Doug Feith. The Senate  Intelligence  Committee  has  been  investigating these activities as part of its ongoing review of prewar intelligence related to  Iraq. After much delay, we received thousands of pages of documents from the Defense Department  and  conducted  several  interviews as we have sought to determine  the nature and extent of the intelligence activities of this office. At the time of my public statements, our review of these activities  was still ongoing and as part of the second  phase of the Committee’s work on prewar intelligence.  In describing that part of our review I stated that we were seeking to determine  if  Under Secretary Feith was running a private  intelligence operation not authorized in law.  For example, Section 502 of the National Security Act of 1947 requires the heads of all  departments and agencies of the U.S. government involved in intelligence activities ‘‘to  keep the congressional oversight committees  informed.’’ This requirement relates to the  activities of any part of the government not  just  intelligence agencies. The Committee  review is intended to determine if the activities within Under Secretary Feith’s office  were unauthorized intelligence activities in  contravention of this and perhaps other legal  requirements. The Committee unanimously  agreed to review ‘‘any intelligence activities  relating to Iraq conducted by the Policy  Counterterrorism  Evaluation  Group  (PCTEG) and the Office of Special Plans  within the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy.’’ Implicit in that statement is the possibility that unauthorized intelligence activities may have taken place.  A letter from Assistant Secretary of Defense Powell Moore in July 2004 expressed  surprise at my description and asked for an  apology. I did not suggest that Mr. Feith has  broken a criminal statute. My concern, and  that expressed in the Committee’s resolution  authorizing its investigation, is that some  activities of his office may have been unauthorized. The Committee has not reached a  conclusion. And cannot reach a conclusion  without further investigation.  ",2005

1502,78,2005-11-01,Ms. STABENOW.," I thank the Chair. I  thank my colleague and esteemed leader, our ranking member on the Budget  Committee.  I  rise  this evening  to oppose  the  amendment of my friend from Oklahoma, as well as the entire budget resolution that is in front of us.  Together, America  can  do  better  than this budget and this amendment.  Basically, what the amendment is saying is, if we want to invest in education  so every child has the opportunity to  succeed in America, we wish to create  greater opportunity, it would take 67  votes. If we want to provide another  tax cut for those most blessed in this  country, those doing most well, the  best of anyone in terms of their financial  situation,  that would  take  51  votes. If we want to invest in science  and new cures for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s and diabetes, it would take 67  votes. If we wish to give to those most  blessed with resources in our country a  tax cut, it would take 51 votes.  That is the wrong set of priorities for  our country. I support tax cuts certainly. I sponsored and worked with  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  add a new tax cut for manufacturers so  if they create jobs in the United States  they have a lower tax rate than if the  jobs and business go overseas. Certainly, we agree together that the alternative minimum tax needs to be  fixed so middle-class families are not  impacted by something that was put  into play to affect only those who are  the most wealthy  from avoiding all  taxes.  We could go down the list of things  that we support on a bipartisan basis.  But where we differ is where we have  gone in this country under a failed set  of values and priorities.  And  this  amendment  only makes  that worse. We can do better than that.  Our Nation’s budget is designed to reflect the values and priorities of our  great country.  It  is essentially our  country’s values document. I believe  this budget does not honor our Nation’s  values, and it has the wrong priorities  for our country.  I believe this amendment does the  same, again, saying if we wish to invest  in the health of the country, if we wish  to help manufacturers who,  in my  great State, desperately need our help  by changing the way we finance health  care in this country, that would take 67  votes. But if we wish, instead, to provide another round of tax cuts to those  who are most blessed in this country,  that takes 51 votes. That is the wrong  set of values and the wrong set of priorities, and we can do better than that  in America.  As Americans, we believe we should  leave a better future for our children  and our grandchildren. The American  people  expect  us  to make  tough  choices, just like they do around their  kitchen tables every day, trying to balance the budget. In my home State  people are not sure if they are going to  have a job, what the pay is going to be,  are they going to have their pension,  are they going to have to pay more for  health care. They are having to make  the toughest decisions every day. They  expect us to be responsible and make  the tough decisions we need to make.  We do this because we don’t want our  children to have to pay for our debts.  That is why we make tough decisions.  Parents across the country work hard  enough to build a nest egg for their  children so they can have a better life  than we have had as their parents. We  want that. My great concern is that we  are losing that for our children. I believe we are in a fight for our way of  life in this country and nothing less.  And the budget documents in front of  us only make that worse, only add to  the race to the bottom too many of our  families are feeling.  This budget we are considering  in  two separate reconciliation bills will  actually increase the deficit, not reduce  it—increase  it  by  $31  billion.  America expects us to do better than  that. Most Americans might wonder  why are we increasing the deficit when  we already have the largest deficit in  the history of the country. We are  fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,  and we must help to pay for the rebuilding of the gulf coast for all of  those who have lost so much. Since  2001 when we had the largest surplus in  history, we have taken a fiscal U-turn,  and now we have the largest deficit in  history, putting us back in the days of  gloomy fiscal policies in the 1980s and  early 1990s.  It is important to know there was a  choice at that point, as our leader and  our side of the aisle has  indicated.  When I started  in the Budget Committee in 2001, we had the largest budget surplus in the history of the country. We had two choices. We could do  what we were proposing at the time:  take a third of that for stimulating investment in jobs, take a third of that  in tax cuts to spur the economy, a  third of that for strategic investments  to  spur  the  economy  through  education,  innovation, to also spur the  economy, and a third of that we wanted to put aside to pay down the debt  and to keep Social Security secure. Instead, what happened. Our Republican  colleagues rejected our approach, and  now we have the largest deficits in the  Nation’s history due to the fact that  all of it was put into a supply-side economics tax cut geared to the wealthiest among us at the expense of all of  the rest of America.  Mr. President, these deficits are not  free lunches. We have to pay them year  by year. And how are we paying for  them? Well, we are borrowing billions  of dollars from Japan and China. Right  now, Japan and China hold almost $1  trillion, $1 trillion of our national debt.  And it is growing each and every year.  Not only do taxpayers have to pay interest to China and Japan, our Government has refused to crack down on unfair  trade practices with  these  two  countries because we are so far in debt  to them.

Griffin was a  healthy 8 pounds at birth. His parents  are our son, John Hoereth Lugar, and  his wife, Kelly Smith Lugar, daughter  of Robert Lee Smith and Renee Routon  Smith. Griffin was born at 8:13 p.m.  and within the next hour, John’s brother, David Lugar, joined Char and me in  the hospital room to see a very healthy  newborn  baby  and  to  congratulate  John and Kelly and to share their joy  during unforgettable moments. On the  next day, Griffin met his brother, Preston Charles Lugar, who was born at  Sibley Memorial Hospital on February  20, 2004. The two boys and their parents  are now safe and healthy in their Arlington, VA residence.  Kelly and John were married on November 5, 2001, in the Washington Cathedral with Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie, former  Chaplain of the Senate, presiding. They  and their families and guests had enjoyed a rehearsal dinner in the Mansfield Room of the Capitol on the night  before the wedding. Kelly worked with  many of our colleagues during her service to the administration of President  George Bush and our former colleague,  Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, as Deputy Assistant Secretary  with responsibilities for congressional  relations. She now has a private consulting business. A graduate of  the  University of Texas, she was once a  member of the staff of Congressman  Ralph Hall of Texas. John Lugar came  with us to Washington, along with his  three brothers, 28 years ago. He graduated  from Langley High School  in  McLean, VA; Indiana University, and  received his masters of business administration degree  from Arizona State  University. He is currently a vice president with Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate services and investment management firm.  We know that you will understand  our excitement and our gratitude that  they and we have been given divine  blessing and responsibility for a glorious new chapter in our lives.∑  f  MERCER COUNTY DRUG FREE  COMMUNITY SUPPORT PROGRAM  ∑",2005
1504,85,2005-11-01,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President, I  rise  today  to  recognize  the Mercer  County Drug Free Community Support  Program. The course provides initiatives towards fighting substance abuse,  developing links between the community and its leaders in helping to educate the public, and allow young citizens  the opportunity  to help  their  peers. They have received numerous  awards for their work in helping the  citizens of Mercer County deal with  problems they may encounter daily, be  it alcohol, prescription drugs, or illegal  substances. The county has received a  prestigious national award for its efforts,  and  deserves  acknowledgment  and praise for this accomplishment.  Recognizing the importance that this  program brings to the community is  important; America’s Promise, the Alliance for Youth announced that Mercer County is the winner of a national  award to identify the 100 Best Communities  for Young People;  the award  shows the true extent of the value of  such programs as the Mercer County  drug-free  program,  helping  communities create better lives for the people  who live in areas afflicted by substance  abuse, and the problems arising from  drug abuse. The 100 Best Communities  for  Young  People  celebrates  outstanding, innovative efforts across the  country that improve the well-being of  our  young  citizens. Mercer County  truly deserved this award for its efficient and pioneering ways of dealing  with  social problems and  substance  abuse.  Mercer County has put in place community programs that help teens learn  about  problems  arising  from  drug  abuse, social misconduct, and other related  issues. One particular project  which deserves praise  is  the  ‘‘teen  court’’ in which offenders are judged by  their peers. The Mercer County Teen  Court was designed to provide youth  with  the  necessary  tools  to  demonstrate the power they have, individually  and  collectively,  to  influence  others and make positive changes in  their own lives and in their community. The teen court is especially effective in allowing teens the chance to see  what problems have arisen from their  offense, and to be given a punishment  fitting to the crime handed out by  their own peers.  As a Vista volunteer in 1964, I realized  the  importance  of  community  work in combating poverty, helping individuals  and  low-income  neighborhoods make positive changes for themselves  and  their  communities. The  Mercer County Drug Free Community  Support Program is also part of the  Creating Opportunities for Youth coalition, a group of community  leaders  who work hard creating a strategy to  address  the  problematic  behaviors  plaguing our children and youth in the  community.  The organization plays a vital role in  helping young citizens avoid the dangers of substance abuse; government  grants and awards have allowed the  program to set up successful workshops  that deal with educating youngsters  and parents alike. It is, in effect, a  leading community source for prevention and awareness of substance abuse.  The program has worked closely with  leaders and the citizens to bring together Mercer County and, as a result,  it is a good, safe place to live, work,  and raise children.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  and two withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate committees.  (The nominations received today are  printed at the end of the Senate proceedings.)  f  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION  OF  THE NATIONAL  EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO  SUDAN—PM 29  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message  from  the President  of  the United  States, together with an accompanying  report; which was referred to the Committee  on  Banking,  Housing,  and  Urban Affairs.  To the Congress of the United States:  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides  for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the  anniversary date of its declaration, the  President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a  notice stating that the emergency is to  continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice to  the Federal Register for publication,  stating that the Sudan emergency is to  continue in effect beyond November 3,  2005. The most  recent  notice  continuing this emergency was published  in the Federal Register on November 2,  2004 (69 FR 63915) .  The crisis between the United States  and Sudan constituted by the actions  and  policies  of  the Government  of  Sudan that led to the declaration of a  national emergency on November  3,  1997, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are hostile to U.S.  interests and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the  national security and foreign policy of  the United States. Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared  with respect to Sudan and maintain in  force comprehensive sanctions against  Sudan to respond to this threat.

1505,113,2005-11-01,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pride that I rise today to recognize a talented  group of students and  teachers  from Wisconsin whom I am proud to represent. From  Les Paul  to Boz Scaggs, Wisconsin has a  long history of producing diverse musicians of  international acclaim. Continuing  this  legacy,  the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater’s  Symphonic Wind Ensemble always sets a high  standard and soon it will set that standard on  a much larger stage. On November 4–6, they  will travel to England for the Royal Northern  College  of Music  International Festival  of  Winds. The ensemble will perform at one of  the most prestigious band conferences in the  world.  In being invited to the festival, the ensemble  will not only be  representing Wisconsin but  they will be  the sole  representative of  the  United States at  the  festival. The ensemble  embodies the American values of hard work  and dedication, which is a testament to their  Director, Mr. Glenn Hayes. Fittingly, Wisconsin  will recognize these students as Official Musical Ambassadors as they travel abroad.  While at  the  festival,  they will receive  the  special privilege of instruction from faculty at  the Royal Northern College. I applaud the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater’s Symphonic Wind Ensemble  for  their accomplishments and for their contributions both to Wisconsin and the United States.  f  MARTIAL ARTS DAY  HON. HEATHER WILSON  OFNEWMEXICO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 1, 2005  Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker,  the National Association of Professional Martial Artists, Project Action Foundation and martial arts schools  in my community  recently  joined  together  to bring attention  to martial  arts and the positive benefits of martial arts  training.  On this day of awareness, the martial arts  schools hosted open houses to provide exposure and bring attention to the art. Martial arts  has a reputation for introducing and reinforcing  the values of self-discipline,  focus, self-esteem, while enhancing non-violent conflict resolution, self-confidence, goal setting abilities  and strength of character creating productive  healthy people.  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons I ask you to  join me  in congratulating  those  in my home  town of Albuquerque, New Mexico who participated in this successful celebration and commend them for the positive impact martial arts  has on those who participate.  f  IN HONOR AND REMEMBRANCE OF  ANN CHUDNER  HON.

1506,113,2005-11-01,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor and remembrance of Ann Chudner, devoted wife, mother, champion of social and  civil rights, and friend and mentor to countless.  Mrs. Chudner was born and raised in New  York City where she became actively involved  in social causes when she was a young employee at Macy’s Department Store. While  there, Mrs. Chudner  joined  the union movement and  took part  in  the  first major strike  against  the  store.  Her  husband,  Irving  Chudner, was also  involved  in  the union  movement and became a union  leader with  Local 1250 at Ford’s Brook Park plant. She  moved to Cleveland with her husband, where  their focus on their son, Rick, and their dedication to causes of social justice never diminished.  Mr. and Mrs. Chudner and their son, Rick,  who has followed the activism path of his parents, direct their spirit of activism throughout  the City of Cleveland and the West Park community. Mrs. Chudner became deeply involved  in social issues ranging from fighting against  corporate  tax abatement  to working  toward  educational and recreational opportunities for  youth,  to supporting numerous candidacies.  Mr. and Mrs. Chudner were immersed in the  mayoral candidacy of Carl Stokes, helping him  to win the election as the first African American mayor of a major American city. She was  instrumental in the success of the grassroots  campaign  to  save  Cleveland’s municipal  power company  from  takeover by  the  local  monopoly private electric company when I was  mayor of Cleveland. She was instrumental in  working with Cleveland school officials to implement the Compu-Tech program, which introduced students  to computers at a young  age. Mrs. Chudner also  rallied against  the  closings of West Tech and John Adams high  schools, and was a steadfast  leader  in  the  West Park Community Council, a social action  group whose membership climbed to 300 during her tenure.  Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me  in  honor  and  remembrance  of Mrs. Ann  Chudner, whose fearless advocacy on behalf  of the people of her community was framed by  courage, heart and unwavering conviction  in  the philosophy that a unified group can affect  real change. I offer my deepest condolences  to her husband, Irving; to her son, Rick; and  to her extended family and many friends. Her  journey through life has made our world a better place, and her legacy will forever live on in  the West Park community and miles beyond.  IN HONOR OF DORIS SEPTEN  HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 1, 2005  ",2005
1507,113,2005-11-01,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition and appreciation of Doris Septen,  a dedicated employee and caring staff member of the Visiting Nurse Association of Central Jersey. It is with great admiration that I  honor Doris today for her unwavering commitment to the VNA for the past 50 years.  Doris originally came to the association as a  clerk  for a  fundraising consultant,  the Foote  System,  in 1955. Since  then, she has held  such positions as receptionist, assistant supervisor and supervisor of the Foote Department,  and senior clerk. Her warm, caring voice has  greeted callers and  reassured patients and  their families for many years.  Through her hard work and devotion, Doris  earned herself further promotions to communications operator, and customer service coordinator. Furthermore, Doris was named VNA  of Central Jersey’s first employee of the month  in 2003. These accomplishments only further  reiterate what a worthy, notable person Doris  Septen is and how indispensable she has become to her organization.  Doris  is a compassionate woman  that  is  genuinely concerned with  the well-being of  those who rely on the VNACJ. She handles  many tasks, such as tracking down nurses for  patients, helping callers on the main switchboard, and facilitating the Monmouth County  support staff council.  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join  me in recognizing Ms. Doris Septen for all she  has done for the VNACJ community, and congratulate her on reaching the milestone of 50  years of service.  f  RECOGNIZING  THE  CAMBRIDGE  HIGH SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTAL  CLUB  HON.

1508,113,2005-11-01,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, for more than  10 years, the Cambridge High School Environmental Club has performed valuable community service. Their activities have ranged from  collecting of old cell phones to be recycled to  puppet shows  that promote ecology  lessons  for children. The club’s  recent  research at  Custer State Park in the Badlands of South  Dakota is a fine example of their desire to be  active at both  the  local and national  level.  They are a diverse group of ‘‘active environmentalists’’ whose lives and goals are as varied as the projects that they have taken on.  Living together for 14 days, the club worked  as an environmental research team at Custer  State Park. The club, using the advanced protocols of a professional research  team, performed chemical  tests and  journaled about  their research at night.

1509,120,2005-11-01,Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to pay public tribute to a remarkable soldier and citizen  from my home state. Major  General Terry Tucker  recently  relinquished  command of the Fort Knox or School, bringing  to a close a 3-year tenure marked by unprecedented growth and change at one of America’s most important military installations.  Generl Tucker  joined  the Army  in 1972,  signing in at the same building at Fort Knox  where, 31 years later, he would take full installation command. Raised on a dirt farm in West  Virginia, General Tucker, with the help of an  Army scholarship was the first member of his  family  to graduate  from college. After completing his initial 4-year obligation to the Army,  General Tucker and his wife Patti went on to  fulfill a wide variety of military assignments at  home and abroad throughout their 33 years of  service to our country.  Upon his return to Fort Knox, first as Deputy  Commanding General in 2000, then as Commanding General  in 2003, General Tucker  presided over a wide scope of critical responsibilities. Along with managing on-base training, he was authorized to develop and implement  training  for  the entire United States  Mounted Force, changing the way soldiers are  trained to meet a new wartime mission. General Tucker successfully matched this training  with a strong focus on improved combat systems and equipment, such as the Abrams tank  and the Bradley IFV, to meet new and emerging threats.  During his time at Fort Knox, General Tucker’s leadership inspired officers and civilians to  be good neighbors, making Fort Knox and its  surrounding communities a better place to live  and work.  In  this capacity, General Tucker  worked hard to build partnerships with community organizations to support Fort Knox Soldiers and their families. General Tucker also  oversaw critical improvements to the Garrison  and  IMA, modernizing  facilities  to enhance  Fort Knox’s future viability.  Perhaps General Tucker’s most enduring  legacy to the citizens of my congressional district will be his  tireless promotion of Fort  Knox’s military value during Base Realignment  and Closure proceedings this year. Because  of his efforts, Fort Knox remains open, adapting to a new mission as a vital multi-functional  home to operational army forces and various  administrative commands.  It is my great privilege to recognize Major  General Terry Tucker today, before the entire  U.S. House of Representatives, for his lifelong  example of  leadership and service.  I would  like to thank him personally for his exemplary  stewardship at Fort Knox during a time of war  and  administrative  transition.  His  unique  achievements and dedication to the men and  women of the U.S. Army make him an outstanding American worthy of our collective  honor and respect.

1510,5,2005-11-14,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, these are  momentous  and  historic  times  for  America. In just 4 years, we have toppled two of the most brutal regimes in  human history and liberated 50 million  people from tyranny. Afghanistan and  Iraq are now governed by the consent  of the people under constitutions that  have been ratified by the popular vote.  Many people simply would not have believed that just several years ago.  Next month, on December 15, the  Iraqi people will vote to form a permanent government. On that day, they  will show, once more, their tremendous  courage,  boldness,  and  fortitude  in  moving their country toward full democracy and independence.  While the news media focuses on the  terrorist activity and the terrorist insurgency, by any standard of history,  Iraq and Afghanistan are making remarkable progress. Only 4 years ago,  Saddam  Hussein  and  the  Taliban  seemed like permanent, malignant fixtures in the Middle East, but today  Saddam sits in prison on trial for his  life, and the Taliban no longer rules  the Afghani people.  Meanwhile, progress is cropping up  all over the region. Again, the news  media simply does not cover it, and we  always hear excuses why that might be  the case. But if one just looks back,  they will see that Egypt has just held  its freest elections in history.  I had the opportunity to be in Lebanon about a month after  this,  in  April. But this spring, on March 14, the  Lebanese people rose up in a remarkable protest that was indeed televised  throughout the world. We all saw it.  After 30 years of occupation, Syria was  forced to withdraw. Libya has given up  its weapons of mass destruction program and  is now  cooperating with  international  inspectors. Kuwait has  granted full political rights to women,  and democracy is slowly beginning to  take root in Saudi Arabia.  All of this has been made possible by  the bravery, valor, and strength of our  men and women in uniform. They deserve our deepest respect, gratitude,  and our unwavering commitment to  the  success of  their mission. These  young people heard the call of duty and  they went to the frontlines to defend  America.  Every day, at risk to their own lives,  our soldiers are helping the Iraqis secure a democratic  future. They are  training Iraqi forces to defend and protect the Iraqi people, and real progress  is being made. The Iraqis are getting  stronger and they are getting more  skilled at the dangerous work of facing  down the terrorist enemy.  In  the  recent Tal Afar operation,  Iraqi  forces  outnumbered  coalition  forces for the first time in a major engagement. Eleven Iraqi combat battalions were independently employed in  Tal Afar, twice the number than  in  Fallujah operations this year. That is  progress.  Currently, 116 Iraqi security  forces  are conducting operations, and Iraqi civilians are gaining confidence handling  the matters there and in providing tips  and information to help defeat the insurgents in the region.  Meanwhile, Iraq continues to build  and improve its infrastructure. Again,  you don’t see it on the nightly news or  on the 24-hour coverage. Since the liberation, coalition  forces have helped  complete  over  4,000  reconstruction  projects, including 3,400 public schools,  304 water projects, 257 fire and police  stations, and 149 health facilities.  Under Saddam, Iraq’s infrastructure  was in shambles. Citizens were not allowed free access to the media or to  communicate freely with one another.  Saddam maintained his iron grip by  keeping his people fearful and totally  cut off from the outside world. But now  that has changed. Slowly but surely,  under the democratic leadership, Iraq  is  emerging  as  a modern  country.  Internet subscribers have risen  from  5,000 to 196,000. It is opening up. Light  is shining into the country and to the  people of Iraq.  Now over 4.5 million Iraqis have telephone service, and that is a fourfold increase to what it was before the war.  Under Saddam there was nothing such  as  that. There was no  independent  media. Today, Iraq has more than 100  newspapers and magazines. There are  over 40 commercial television stations  broadcasting to an eager Iraqi public.  They are hearing and seeing things for  the first times in their lives.  We hear the critics hurtle invective  and level false charges against the administration. That is disappointing. We  know some are, indeed, trying to rewrite history. We hear it on the Senate  floor and we see it on the television  news shows. This rewriting of history  is wrong. It shows, to my mind, very  little respect for the very things—the  freedom,  the democracy,  the  transparency, letting the light shine in—the  sort of things our men and women are  fighting for overseas.  At the same time that we hear this  invective and these false charges, brave  men and women—American and, as I  just mentioned, Iraqi coalition forces,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:25 Nov 15, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G14NO6.001 S14NOPT1 ",2005

1518,19,2005-11-14,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I thank  the managers,  particularly  Senator  GRAHAMand Senator LEVIN.  Veterans Day is a very special day in  our country’s history. There are a lot  of veterans who believe Veterans Day  is just plain sacred—a lot of families,  Gold Star mothers, wives for whom it  is a day set aside to memorialize the  unbelievable sacrifice of generations of  Americans who have given themselves  for our country. Veterans Day is sacred. It is a day to honor veterans, not  a day  to play attack politics. The  President, who is Commander in Chief,  should know and respect this.  Veterans Day originally marked the  11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th  month when the guns of World War I,  the war to end all wars, finally fell silent. Instead of honoring that moment,  instead of laying a wreath at the Tomb  of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington,  instead of laying out a clear plan for  success in Iraq, the President laid into  his critics with an 11th hour rhetorical  assault that I believe dishonors that  day and does a disservice to veterans  and to those serving today. He did so  even as he continued to distort the  truth about his war of choice.  Perhaps most striking of all is that  his almost desperate  sounding Veterans Day attack on those who have  told the truth about his distortion was  itself accompanied by more distortion.  Does the President really think the  many generals, former top administration officials, and Senators from his  own party who have joined over two-  thirds of the country in questioning  the President’s handling of the war in  Iraq—are  they all unpatriotic,  too?  This  is America, a place where we  thrive on healthy debate. That is something we are trying to take to Afghanistan and Iraq. It is something we are  trying to export to the rest of the  world. The President does not have a  monopoly on patriotism, and this  is  not a country where only those who  agree with him support the troops or  care about defending our country.  You can care just as much about defending our country and have just as  much support for the troops by being a  critic of policies. No matter what the  President says, asking tough questions  is not pessimism, it is patriotism. And  fighting for the right policy for our  troops sends them exactly the right  message that all of us here take very  seriously the decision to put them in  harm’s way and that our democracy is  alive and well.  Ironically, the President even used  the solemn occasion of Veterans Day to  continue his  campaign of misrepresenting  the  facts  and  throwing up  smokescreens.  His  statement  that  Democrats saw and heard the same intelligence he did is just flat-out untrue,  unless, of course, the President and the  administration did not do their job and  study the additional intelligence given  only to them and not the Congress.  As the Washington Post said on Saturday, Bush and his aides had access to  much more voluminous intelligence information than lawmakers who were  dependent on  the administration  to  provide the material. But that whole  discussion is nothing more than an effort  to distract attention  from  the  issue that matters most and can be answered most simply: Did the administration go beyond what even the flawed  intelligence would support in making  the case for war? Did they use obviously inaccurate intelligence, despite  being told clearly and repeatedly not  to? Did they use the claims of known  fabricators and rely on those claims of  known fabricators? The answer to each  and every one of these questions is yes.  The only people who are now trying to  rewrite that history are the President  and his allies.  There is no greater breach of the public trust than knowingly misleading  the country into war. In a democracy,  we simply cannot tolerate the abuse of  this trust by the Government.  To the extent this occurred in the  lead-up to the war in Iraq, those responsible must be held accountable.  That is precisely why Democrats have  been pushing the Senate Intelligence  Committee to complete a thorough and  balanced investigation into the issue.  When the President tried to pretend on  Friday  that  the  Intelligence  Committee had already determined that he  had not manipulated intelligence and  misled the American public, he had to  have known full well they have not yet  reported on that very question. That is  precisely why Democrats were forced  to shut down the Senate in secret session and go into that secret session in  order to make our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle take this issue  seriously.  When the President said his opponents were throwing out false charges,  he knew all too well that these charges  are anything but false. But the President and  the Republicans  seem  far  more interested in confusing the issue  and attacking their opponents than in  getting honest answers.  Let’s be clear, Mr. President, let’s be  clear, my fellow Americans: There is  no question that Americans were misled into the war in Iraq. Simply put,  they were told that Saddam Hussein  had weapons of mass destruction when  he did not. The issue is whether they  were misled intentionally.  Just as there is a distinction between  being wrong and being dishonest, there  is a fundamental difference between relying  on  incorrect  intelligence  and  making statements that you know are  not supported by the intelligence.  The bottom line is that the President  and his  administration  did mislead  America into war. In fact, the war in  Iraq was and remains one of the great  acts of misleading and deception  in  American history. The facts are incontrovertible.  The act of misleading was pretending  to Americans that no decision had really been made to go to war and that  they would  seriously pursue  inspections when the evidence now strongly  suggests that they had already decided  as a matter of policy to take out Saddam Hussein, were anxious to do it for  ideological reasons, and hoped that inspections, which Vice President CHENEYhad opposed and tried to prevent,  would not get in their way.  The President misled America about  his intentions and the manner in which  he would make his decision. We now  know  that his  speech  in Cincinnati  right before the authorization vote was  carefully orchestrated window dressing  where, again, he misled America by  promising, ‘‘If we have to act, we will  take every precaution that is possible,  we will plan carefully, and we will go  with our allies.’’ We did not take every  precaution possible, we did not plan—  that is evident for every American to  see—and except for Great Britain, we  did not go in with our allies.  The act of misleading was just going  through  the motions of  inspections  while it appears all the time the President just could not wait to kick Saddam Hussein out of power. The act of  misleading was pretending to Americans the real concern was weapons of  mass destruction when the evidence  suggests the real intent was to finish  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:25 Nov 15, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G14NO6.028 S14NOPT1 ",2005

1522,26,2005-11-14,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I make a  couple of points that I think are worth  making on this most important bill.  First,  I express my appreciation  to  Senator DOMENICI. He  and  I  have  worked on this bill for a long time.  When I say ‘‘this bill,’’ year after year  we work hard to put a bill together.  Some years are easier  than others.  This was not an easy year. It was a  very difficult year. We have a lot of  Senators who are not happy with what  we have been able to do, but we have  done the best we can under very trying  circumstances.  Our conference allocation is $750 million above the President’s request. Of  that amount, $600 million went to the  Corps of Engineers  for  flood control  and navigation projects. This is in relation to the post-Katrina world in which  it is certainly obvious why we needed  to do this. This is a wise investment of  our Nation’s resources. The scrutiny of  the Corps’ activities is only going to  increase in coming years. So it is imperative that they conduct themselves  in a completely open and transparent  manner moving forward.  Unfortunately, the result of placing  such a high priority on flood control is  that  important programs of the Department of Energy are  essentially  flat. This will not be an easy year for  renewable  and  energy-efficient  programs, the Office of Science, or the  critically  important  environmental  cleanups at nuclear weapons sites nationwide. We must do better in future  years. In fact, we have to find more resources for these important activities.  Secondly, this conference report  is  the  product  of  thousands  of  compromises, not hundreds. None of the  four principal subcommittee conferees  agrees with every provision contained  in this conference report, and that is  an understatement. For example, as far  as I am concerned, we are carrying a  small amount of funding and some report  language directing  the Department to set a nationwide competition  to see if there is a State out there willing to voluntarily accept a spent fuel  reprocessing facility. While I have always supported processing research as  a prudent  investment,  I have never  supported moving forward in any way  on an actual reprocessing facility for  many of the same reasons that I oppose  centralized  storage—the  danger  of  transportation outweighs the benefits.  However, I completely respect the desire of Chairman HOBSON, Chairman  DOMENICI, and Ranking Member VISCLOSKY to do something—I appreciate  and congratulate and applaud each of  them—to  change  the dynamics  surrounding what I believe is the failed  Yucca Mountain project. I have worked  with Senator DOMENICIfor many years.  He is my friend. It goes without saying  that we have difficulties in this bill,  but it is never anything personal. We  have communication that is as good as  any two Senators in this Congress. It is  a good give-and-take process. Senator  DOMENICIunderstands that legislation  is the art of compromise. We are both  realists. I have been the chairman of  this subcommittee on a number of occasions, and he has been the ranking  member. We have always worked well  together.  I thank both the House and the Senate staff for doing a tremendous job  under the most trying circumstances.  A lot of times we are at home, in the  safety and security of our homes and  we have staff members working well  into the night, into the morning, trying to come up with a product they can  submit to us that we can get through  this body. This has been a long, difficult road this year. My hat is off to  all  the House and Senate  staff  for  sticking with it and bringing forward  the recommendations that will be accepted this evening.  On the House side, thanks to Kevin  Cook, Scott Burnison, John Blazey,  Terry Tyborowski, Tracy LaTurner,  Tanya Berquam, Dixon Butler, Peder  Morebeer, and Felicia Kirksey.  On the Senate side, thanks to Scott  O’Malia,  Emily  Brunini,  Roger  Cockrell, and Nancy Olkewicz. I probably shouldn’t spend too much time on  Drew Willison, but I couldn’t spend too  much time. What he has done in working to craft this legislation, not for me,  not for Senator DOMENICI, not for the  Senate, but for the people of this country, words cannot express adequately  my appreciation for his good work. No  one—I say that without qualification  or reservation—knows this bill better  than he does. His work is something  the American people should understand  they have gotten their money’s worth  from the work he has done. It was a  tough year. It is a product we can all  be proud of.  I thank the Chair.  ",2005

1538,40,2005-11-14,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I thank  my dear friend from Virginia for his  positive comments. As always, he seeks  to build bridges and to overcome differences and to reach across the aisle.  It is typical of him, and it has been  that way since the first day I met him  many years ago.  The Levin-Reid  amendment—there  are two amendments pending—is an effort to, indeed, try to improve the situation  in Iraq, to try to change the  course for the better. There is no date  for withdrawal in our amendment. It is  not  saying  that we will withdraw  troops at any particular specific date.  We have done that because we think it  would be a mistake to set a specific  date, at least most of us do. On the  other hand, we believe it is essential  that we change course in a number of  the  directions  in order  to  improve  chances of Iraq becoming a success.  America is going to be less secure if  Iraq is a failed state. Everybody agrees  on that. The question is, How can we  improve the chances of Iraq not becoming a failed state? What could we do  here, carrying out our responsibility,  what contribution can we make here to  success in Iraq? Things are not working very well in Iraq in many ways. I  know there are people who will point  to progress  in  Iraq and, obviously,  there are things to which one could  point. But on the other hand, there are  things that are not working well, and  this  amendment  intends  to  address  those  in a constructive and positive  way.  Staying the course is not a strategy;  that is a slogan. How do we improve  the chances for success? How do we  modify our  course  so  that we  can  achieve or help the Iraqis achieve—  more accurately—a nation? And how  can we also look forward to the day  when our troops come out sooner rather than later?  This amendment looks at the year  2006 as a transition year, with Iraqi  forces taking over security functions  to a far greater extent. For that to  happen,  this amendment points out  that a number of things need to happen. First, we have to advise the Iraqis  that we are not there for an indefinite  period of time, that they must take the  steps necessary to achieve a broad-  based political settlement which is so  essential to defeating the insurgency.  Our military advisers are unanimous  on this point. There is no purely military solution unless the Iraqis come together politically. Unless they unify  politically, they will not be able to defeat the insurgents. It is a point which  must be made to the Iraqis. They cannot simply continue to squabble over  the content of a constitution. They  have to come together or else they are  not going to succeed, and we are not  going to succeed in helping them to  achieve the security they want.  We need to advise the Iraqis we are  not there indefinitely. They have to  take the steps necessary to achieve a  broad-based political settlement which  is critically important to defeating the  insurgency. We need a plan for success.  We don’t have a plan for success. I will  speak more about that in a moment.  I want to go through the amendment.  I want to point out where there is apparently agreement and where there is  disagreement and what the significance  is of both. The sense of the Senate  starts  by  saying  something  that  I  think every Member of this body would  agree with:  . . . members of the United States Armed  Forces who are serving or have served in Iraq  and their families deserve the utmost respect and  the heartfelt gratitude of  the  American people for their unwavering devotion to duty, service to the Nation, and selfless sacrifice under the most difficult circumstances.  We start with that. Our troops and  their families deserve the very best in  equipment, training, and support, but  also  in our  thinking. That doesn’t  mean there is going to be unanimity  around. People who disagree on what  the next step should be should not be  pilloried in any way or criticized as  being less American than those who  support  the  administration’s  policy  lock, stock, and barrel. There is a place  for constructive criticism, for different  points of view in a democracy. That is  what our troops have always  fought  for. That is what men and women have  died for, so that we would have an opportunity to have the kind of debate on  policy which is going on now.  First, our heartfelt gratitude to our  troops. Second, the sense of the Senate  recognizes that the Iraqi people have  made enormous sacrifices and that the  overwhelming majority of Iraqis want  to live in peace and security. There is  no disagreement on that. The alternative amendment that we will be voting on does not differ with that.  The next paragraph there is no difference on either. Both amendments  have the same language. There is no  change in our version from the Frist-  Warner version. That is:  . . . calendar 2006 should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty,  with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for  the security of a free and sovereign Iraq,  thereby  creating  the  conditions  for  the  phased redeployment of United States forces  from Iraq.  That is in paragraph 3 of the sense of  the Senate. There is no change in that  language to the Frist-Warner language.  That is paragraph (b)(3). Creating the  conditions for the phased redeployment  of U.S. forces from Iraq surely ought to  be a goal.  (4) United States military  forces should  not stay in Iraq indefinitely and the Iraqi  people should be so advised.  That is an important statement to  the Iraqi people, and it is an important  statement to our people. We should not  be staying in Iraq indefinitely. That is  the wrong message to send for a number of reasons to the Iraqi people.  What the Warner version does is, it  strikes  the word  ‘‘indefinitely’’ and  says:  United States military forces should not  stay in Iraq any longer than required and the  people of Iraq should be so advised.  The problem with that is, they could  be required forever. That is open-ended.  It is unlimited. It is the wrong message. That is a difference, and it is the  first difference.  The next paragraph, there is no difference on:  . . . the Administration should tell the leaders of all groups and political parties in Iraq  that they need to make the compromises  necessary to achieve the broad-based political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency . . . within the schedule  that they have set for themselves.  By the way, the schedule that they  have set for themselves is to appoint a  commission when  the new assembly  takes office in January, to appoint a  constitutional commission  to  review  the  constitution  and  make  recommendations  for changes within  4  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:25 Nov 15, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G14NO6.054 S14NOPT1 ",2005
1539,47,2005-11-14,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President: I would  like to pay special tribute today to a  remarkable man who has dedicated the  past 36 years of his life to the citizens  of Chubbuck, ID. Mayor John O. Cotant  entered the Chubbuck mayoral race the  night before the elections in 1969. He  won and has been mayor ever since.  Through his dedication to youth and  community  improvement,  Chubbuck  has become the thriving town of 10,000  it is today. Under his exemplary leadership, Chubbuck increased the number  of city parks from 1 to 14. He initiated  the construction of a monument to veterans of our wars and his love of sports  inspired him  to promote a  thriving  youth sports program for the city. He  brought  critical  infrastructure  improvements to the community, to position Chubbuck for the vibrant growth  it is experiencing today. John and his  wife of 59 years, Alice, are the proud  parents of 3, grandparents of 13 and  great-grandparents of 19 children. He  has been very involved in his church,  serving as Bishop, the ecclesiastical  teacher, of his LDS church congregation. At a robust 81, he says that he is  going to pursue his personal interests  of genealogy and a collection of city  memorabilia, and make a point of not  volunteering  for anything controversial. I must say I understand the sentiment. Local public servants like John  are the lifeblood of our civic community and our daily lives in rural towns  not just in Idaho, but across the Nation. As a mayor of a smaller city, you  are on duty and under the spotlight 24  hours a day. It is quite a testament to  John’s  character,  energy and  spirit  that he has served for so many years. I  congratulate him on three and a half  decades  of  community  commitment  service and wish him and Alice the  very best in the next exciting chapter  of their life together.∑  f  PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and  were referred or ordered to lie on the  table as indicated:  POM–212. A joint resolution adopted by the  Legislature of the State of California relative to the ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ military policy; to the Committee on Armed  Services.  SENATEJOINTRESOLUTIONNo. 11  Whereas, Since the 1994 codification into  law by the United States Congress, and by  the signature of the President, the policy  now known as ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t  Pursue, Don’t Harass’’ (National Defense Authorization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–160))  has led to the discharge of a great number of  lesbian and gay service members, thus ending their careers and burdening them with a  lifelong stigma; and  Whereas, The  capacity  of  the Armed  Forces of the United States to carry out its  missions, like the Global War on Terror, is  hindered when competent and qualified individuals are  involuntarily discharged  from  those forces; and  Whereas, The Armed Forces of the United  States have been forced to retain Reserve  and National Guard service members on active duty past standard deployment lengths  in order to carry out its missions during the  Global War on Terror; and  Whereas, The ability of the Armed Forces  to recruit and retain the best and brightest  Americans is hindered by excluding a section  of the population solely because of sexual  orientation; and  Whereas, Lesbian and gay service members  have served honorably throughout United  States history and continue to serve with  distinction on active duty in the Global War  on Terror, including in Operation Enduring  Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi  Freedom in Iraq; and  Whereas, These men  and women have  achieved military honors, decorations, and  promotions to the highest ranks of their respective services for their valor and service  to the people of the United States; and  Whereas, America’s allies in the war on  terror, like the United Kingdom, Australia,  and Israel, all allow lesbian and gay service  members to serve openly; and  Whereas, The Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,  the Defense  Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and other  federal departments handling national security allow their  lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender personnel to serve openly; and  Whereas, A February 2005 Government Accountability Office report shows that more  than 9,488 service members have been discharged under the ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’  policy, including at least 757 service members in ‘‘critical occupations,’’ such as counterintelligence experts, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $190 million; and  Whereas, The Department of Defense reported that 209  language specialists have  been discharged from the military under the  ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ policy, including 54  Arabic and 9 Farsi translators, vitally important positions to intelligence gathering  and in critical shortage; and  Whereas, Evidence from a study conducted  by the Center for the Study Of Sexual Minorities in the Military suggests that the  ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ policy increases gay  troops’ stress levels, lowers their morale, impairs their ability to form trusting bonds  with their peers, restricts their access to  medical care, psychological services and religious consultations, and limits their ability  to advance professionally and their willingness to join and remain in the services; and  Whereas, Every Department of Defense authorized study has shown that there is no  correlation between sexual orientation and  unit cohesion in the Armed Forces; and  Whereas, The majority of American citizens  support keeping  trained and  skilled  openly gay and lesbian service members in  the military; and  Whereas, The United States military’s  readiness to protect and defend our nation is  severely compromised because of the discriminatory ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ policy  that is arbitrarily enforced by commanders  whose personal beliefs may influence their  disciplinary actions; and  Whereas, Discharges under  ‘‘Don’t Ask,  Don’t Tell’’  are historically  fewer when  troop strength is low, as in times of war,  which denotes the tacit recognition by the  military that lesbian and gay service members are fit and capable of military service,  thereby further illustrating the arbitrary enforcement of this policy; and  Whereas, California has 26 military bases  which are home to tens of thousands of military personnel and their families, and, according to a 2004 Urban Institute study, an  estimated 137,000 lesbian and gay veterans  live in California; and  Whereas, The Legislature and courts of the  State of California have extended protections based on sexual orientation and gender  identity that affirm the equality under the  law  of  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  and  transgender citizens in order to prevent invidious discrimination; and  Whereas, In 2004 the California Legislature  passed, and the Governor signed, legislation  that protects nonfederally recognized personnel in the California State Military from  the threat of ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’; and  Whereas, Military readiness  is enhanced  when every qualified, capable American, regardless of sexual orientation, is welcomed  into our Armed Forces and has their talents  utilized in the best interest of our national  security; now, therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate of the State of California, the Assembly thereof concurring, That  the Legislature of the State of California respectfully urge the President and the Congress of the United States to adopt the Military Readiness Enhancement Act of  2005  (H.R. 1059) to end the discriminatory federal  policy of ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’; and be it  further  Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate  transmit copies of this resolution to the  President of the United States, to each Senator and Representative in the Congress of  the United States, and to the presiding officer of each house of each state legislature of  the several states.  POM–213. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to expressing opposition to the  study and construction of an international  border crossing in the Downriver area; to the  Committee  on  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation.  SENATERESOLUTIONNO. 57  Whereas, The Detroit-Windsor and Port  Huron-Sarnia border crossings of Southeast  Michigan/Southwest Ontario are the busiest  international crossings  in North America,  representing nearly 50 percent of the traffic  volume crossing the United States/Canadian  border. In 2000, American trade with Ontario  reached $243 billion, which is larger than the  total U.S. trade with Japan; and  Whereas, More than 75,000 vehicles use the  Southeast Michigan/Southwest Ontario border crossings each day. Traffic at the Michigan and Canadian ports of entry has grown 44  percent from 19.7 million vehicles in 1990 to  28.4 million vehicles in 2000. Truck traffic at  these ports has more than doubled from 2.5  million vehicles in 1990 to 5.1 million in 2000.

1543,6,2005-12-07,Mr. PEARCE.," Mr. Speaker, I move to  suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 196)  honoring the pilots of United States  commercial air carriers who volunteer  to participate  in  the Federal  flight  deck officer program.  The Clerk read as follows:  H. CON. RES. 196  Whereas after the tragic attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress enacted legislation  authorizing volunteer pilots of United States  commercial air carriers who participate in  the Federal flight deck officer program to  use lethal force to defend the flight deck of  an aircraft against acts of terrorism;  Whereas a volunteer pilot in the Federal  flight deck officer program must undergo  rigorous psychological screening and a background investigation, as well as complete an  intense training curriculum;  Whereas volunteer pilots  in the Federal  flight deck officer program provide a significant deterrent against potential acts of violence or terrorism in United States airspace,  are an essential layer of security for the Nation’s flying public, and are a key factor in  restoring  confidence  in  the Nation’s  air  transportation system;  Whereas volunteer pilots  in the Federal  flight deck officer program devote personal  time and finances to maintain a high standard of proficiency in the use of firearms and  techniques  for addressing  emergencies  in  flight; and  Whereas volunteer pilots  in the Federal  flight deck officer program, at great personal risk and with no compensation or recognition, are dedicated to the protection of  the flight deck, thereby providing an additional layer of protection to the aircraft,  passengers, and cargo from acts of terrorism,  such as the possible use of the aircraft as a  weapon of mass destruction against people  on the ground: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved by the House of Representatives (the  Senate concurring), That Congress—  (1) recognizes that volunteer pilots in the  Federal flight deck officer program are the  consummate quiet professionals and embody  what is best in our national character;  (2) applauds volunteer pilots in the Federal  flight deck officer program  for  taking a  stand against those who would seek to harm  the United States through acts of terrorism  in the air; and  (3) expresses appreciation to volunteer pilots in the Federal flight deck officer program on behalf of all citizens of the United  States for the ongoing contribution of these  pilots to the security of the Nation and its  air transportation system.

1547,6,2005-12-07,Mr. PEARCE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 196 recognizes and applauds the  volunteer pilots in the Federal Flight  Deck Officer program. It is an opportunity to show our appreciation  for  those brave pilots who are committed  to protecting Americans against another act of terrorism not only at huge  personal risk but with no compensation or recognition.  I appreciate Chairman MICA’s leadership in establishing and supporting this  program. I am proud to represent the  district where the Federal flight deck  officer training occurs. Chairman MICA  visited this program with me last year.  These are superb assets at Artesia, New  Mexico, which  include  two  727s all  lined  up  and  allow  real  simulated  training for the Federal flight deck officers. I also toured the facility with  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff just in the last month.  We should speak for a grateful Nation for the selfless contribution these  pilots make  to providing a critical  layer of protection to the aircraft, passengers, and cargo from acts of terrorism.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. MICA) control the remainder of my  time and that he be allowed to yield  time to other Members  in consideration of this resolution.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman MICA for introducing this resolution honoring the pilots who participate in this Federal Flight Deck Officer program. As the ranking member of  the Aviation Subcommittee and a cosponsor of this resolution,  I believe  these volunteer pilots deserve to be  honored and recognized for their continued and dedicated service.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 4311, which  would reauthorize a crucial judicial security measure. Under the Ethics in  Government Act,  judges  and  other  high-level  judicial  branch  officials  must file annual disclosure reports. In  the  105th Congress, we enacted  the  Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, which allows the Judicial Conference to redact statutorily  required information in a financial disclosure report where the release of that  information could endanger the filer or  his or her family. This provision was  extended for 4 years in the 107th Congress and is due to expire on December  31 of this year.  H.R. 4311 would permanently extend  this important component of Federal  judicial security. This legislation was  recently passed on the House floor on  November 9 by a vote of 375–45 as a provision of H.R. 1751; but since the other  body has not taken up that bill, I have  introduced this freestanding measure.  Judges  today  face  a  number  of  threats from convicted criminals seeking revenge against those who have  presided over their trial to defendants  seeking to influence a judge during a  trial. In some cases, Federal judges and  their  families have been  subject  to  more than just threats, as has been  demonstrated by the murder of Judge  Joan Lefkow’s husband and  elderly  mother in their own home by a former  plaintiff in Chicago earlier this year.  Since the authority was enacted in  1998 and renewed in 2001, Federal judges  have been able to request the temporary redaction of some or all of the  information on their disclosure forms.  The Marshals Service must agree that  the  information on  their disclosure  forms could be used to harm the judge  or his or her family in order for it to be  redacted.  Disclosure  information might seem  to some to be an unlikely source of  useful information to someone looking  to harm a judge. That is a flawed assumption. For example, the fact that a  judge’s daughter has received a scholarship from a particular college must  be reported on that judge’s disclosure  form. This  information can then be  used to  identify the  location of the  judge’s daughter.  Under this existing authority, judges  are still required to make semi-annual  disclosures and are only allowed to redact information during the time in  which a threat exists. Once the threat  ends, the  information  is once again  made public. The GAO undertook an  audit of  this authority  in  2004 and  found minimal issues.  As a strong proponent of government  openness and oversight, I recognize the  impact of redaction authority. However,  I  also  recognize  that  judges  should not be forced to put their lives  on the line or those of their families  simply by doing their jobs. This fair  and impartial administration of justice  requires freedom from fear and intimidation. This legislation helps protect  judges and their families from fear of  reprisal.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2005
1555,13,2005-12-07,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support of H.R. 4311. This bill  protects judges against certain security threats. The September 11 tragedy  and events thereafter have only heightened the security concerns that make  this legislation necessary.  H.R. 4311 permanently extends the  ability of judges to request redaction of  their financial disclosure reports. The  current redaction authority sunsets at  the end of this year. Thus it is imperative that we act quickly to get this bill  to the Senate where we hope it will  pass before the end of the year so that  the legislation can be enacted.  The redaction authority for judges is  appropriately limited and thus should  not raise concerns about undue restrictions on public access to financial disclosure reports. A judge’s report may  only be redacted if the Judicial Conference and the U.S. Marshals Service  both find that revealing the personal  and sensitive information could endanger  that  particular  judge. Furthermore, the report can only be redacted  to the extent necessary to protect the  judge and only for so long as a danger  exists.  The redaction authority has not been  abused to date. Of over 2,000 judges filing reports in 2000, only 6 percent had  their  reports  redacted  in any way.  Typically, the information redacted is  limited to such things as a spouse’s  place of work, location of a judge’s second home and things of that nature. It  is obvious how a person of ill will could  misuse  that  information  to harm a  judge or the judge’s family.  This law is tightly drawn, and it requires the Judicial Conference, in concert with the Department of Justice, to  file an annual  report detailing  the  number and circumstances of all of the  redactions. This  statutory  reporting  requirement enables Congress to monitor for any abuse of the redaction authority, so I would urge my colleagues  to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation.  b1130  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman  from New York  (Ms.  SLAUGHTER).  ",2005
1556,13,2005-12-07,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding me  this time.  This is a critically important piece of  legislation that everyone in the House  should  support without  reservation.  H.R. 4311, which amends the 1978 Ethics  in Government Act, will make permanent an expiring provision which protects the safety of our Nation’s judges  as well as the integrity of our judicial  system.  And I know that everyone here remembers, as Mr. SENSENBRENNER just  reminded us, the horrifying murders of  a Chicago judge’s family members this  past summer. These crimes were committed by an individual, who was angered by a ruling on his case. He went  to the judge’s home to confront her  and, while there, shot her husband and  mother in cold blood.  The bill we have before us will allow  judges who have been threatened to  withhold certain personal information  from public record, information, such  as their home address, that has been  used in the past for the most tragic of  ends.  And  I want  to  emphasize  that  I  strongly support the bill and I commend the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee for bringing it to the floor  today. No one here wishes to avoid our  responsibility to protect those men and  women who form the bedrock of our  legal system, nor do any of us desire to  in any way detract from the significance of this bill.  However, Mr. Speaker, I believe that  this bill does not go far enough. My  conscience compels me to pause here  and remind my friends on the other  side of the aisle that we are discussing  a reform to the Ethics in Government  Act, which should be extended to really  talk about ethics in government, a vitally  important piece of  legislation  which, when it was passed, confirmed  the national commitment to the creation and preservation of the government as good and as ethical as the people it serves.  I, therefore, cannot let this moment  pass without speaking of what has become a standing source of shame for  this body and for this Nation: the collapse of ethical conduct within our  House. Mr. Speaker, I have no choice  but to speak of the topic here and now  because this is the last time the House  will address the subject of ethics this  year.  Ethics reform has not made the Republican leadership’s December agenda, just like it has not made the cut all  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:07 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A07DE7.007 H07DEPT1 ",2005

1559,27,2005-12-07,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, part of  our war against terror is putting our  economic house in order, and this bill  is essential  to achieving  that goal.  Businesses and real estate and development tell me in New York City now  that it is absolutely impossible to get  insurance until this bill passes.  After 9/11, of all the aid that my colleagues gave which helped New York,  in my opinion the absolute most important act was passing TRIA, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. We were  not able to build anything or to move  forward in any way until the insurance  package was in place. So this bill today  is tremendously important.  There are many important features  in it. I would like to particularly point  out that the House bill adds group life  insurance, since it is not only property  that is at risk in a terrorist attack but  also human lives.  Secondly, the bill creates a commission of private sector experts to come  forward with long-term private sector  solutions. It gives the private sector  the responsibility to develop a private  sector solution  for Congress to consider.  It also has a third year as a transition for a long-term solution that the  commission will hopefully come  forward with. Without the benefits and  the flexibility provided in the House  bill, I am afraid that in 2 years we will  be at the same place we are now, having no new outside government thinking and no ability to implement new  ideas or accommodate marketplace developments.  I urge my colleagues to support this;  and I congratulate the  leadership of  Congress, the leadership of the committee, Mr. OXLEY, who did a fantastic  job on this. I regret that he will not be  running for reelection again. He has  been a tremendous leader along with  Ranking Member FRANK.  I hope that the features that are in  the House bill will be preserved in the  committee report.  ",2005

1561,27,2005-12-07,Mrs. KELLY.," Mr. Chairman, I know  that the amendment that we put into  the bill that was authored by the gentlewoman  from  Florida  (Ms.  WASSERMANSCHULTZ) that prevents restrictions from being put on lawful foreign  travel  and  prohibits  excessive  rates on foreign travel was not the subject of a hearing in our committee. I  would like to explore the possibility of  working with the chairman on possibly  having a hearing about that to see the  extent of what actually is occurring  with regard to restrictions on travel to  different countries.  I would be interested in the chairman’s response to that. While I fully  support travel to Israel, I do not know  how many other countries this might  be affecting.  ",2005
1562,27,2005-12-07,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlewoman for her inquiry, and  clearly the committee on the point  that she mentioned did not have hearings on the amendment offered, but I  think it may be ripe for further exploration by the committee because the  gentlewoman raises some  interesting  issues  regarding  foreign  travel, particularly as it relates to life insurance  policies.  I thank the gentlewoman for her interest and expertise.  ",2005
1563,27,2005-12-07,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker, this  has been a difficult time, because so  many of us over the last year have desired to move this legislation along.  But I would be remiss if I did not take  this occasion to perhaps illuminate an  example for this entire Congress as represented by the financial services industry.  I would have to say, without doing an  in-depth  study,  that  the Financial  Services Committee of the House of  Representatives has proven that even  in the 109th Congress we can have bipartisan activity of an extraordinary  amount, and that to a large extent is  due to the incredibly good leadership of  our gentleman  friend,  the chairman  from Ohio, and the ranking member,  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  (Mr. FRANK). I also would be remiss if  I did not suggest a strong and hard effort by our friend, the subcommittee  chairman, Mr. BAKERof Louisiana.  Perhaps the  full House could take  note that in pressing times of need for  legislation that can be contentious and  has philosophical differences of great  order, both sides of the aisle on this  piece of legislation, and so many more  in this session of Congress, have come  together to perform the people’s work;  and I think the congratulations to a  large extent for that effort go to the  gentleman  from Ohio, the chairman,  ",2005

I think  that first we should salute the hard  work of Chairman OXLEYand Ranking  Member FRANK, as well as the hard  work of Subcommittee Chairman RICHARDBAKER, who just so eloquently explained why this legislation is so important not only to New York in the  aftermath of 9/11 but to every city in  the country that finds themselves in  the plight of terrorism and the reinsurance markets.  This is an opportunity for us to continue where the free market will not be  able to indemnify building owners as  we look at this across the country. I  think that the authors of this legislation, as the House passes this  later  today, give us a real opportunity to  move  forward with a  2-year opportunity to help the marketplace, the  building owners who are affected by  the need for coverage of this exposure,  while also recognizing that the  free  marketplace is not able to absorb this  without the governmental mechanism  that has been outlined as the intent of  the bill.  So I wholeheartedly support it. It is  something that will affect the buildings and the marketplace throughout  the country, and certainly my State is  one where it is vitally needed in order  to have coverage for the markets.

And this is not the first time that that  has occurred, and I am sure it will not  be the last when it comes to the results  that come out of this committee.  As outgoing Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once said, ‘‘Free  markets presume peaceful societies.’’  The infinite risks associated with terrorism have demonstrated their potential to destabilize our markets, so I  rise to express my full support for the  version  of TRIA  before  the House  today.  I want to thank Chairman OXLEY,  Ranking Member FRANK, Representative BAKER, and Representative KANfor their stalwart leadership on  this issue.

1569,34,2005-12-07,Mr. REYNOLDS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Speaker, the year 1969 saw examples of the best and worst of what the  Federal Government can do. On one  hand,  the  Department  of  Defense  reachers invented the Internet, which  has opened up a world of knowledge to  anyone with access to a computer.  On the other hand, in 1969, Congress  controlled by the other side of the  aisle, created the original version of  the AMT. But while the Internet has  continually evolved, the AMT structure has not.  It has now become a stealth tax,  sneaking up on unsuspecting middle  class taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, many of  us here today on both sides of the aisle  would likely support AMT relief that  goes far beyond what is included in this  bill.  But the legislation before us today is  a crucial  first step. I urge my colleagues to come together on a strong  bipartisan basis to protect the middle  class against stealth tax increases from  the AMT.  ",2005
1570,34,2005-12-07,Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today in support of the Stealth Tax Relief  Act. The AMT is not just a stealth tax, it is a  sneaky tax. It is a parallel tax system where  normal rules of income and deductions don’t  apply—you lose most of your deductions and  your children become a liability!  The bill we are debating today, the Stealth  Tax Relief Act, will keep the AMT from hitting  millions of additional middle class Americans.  However, we are just holding back the tide of  the AMT that in 2008 will swamp the tax system and actually collect more money than the  underlying income tax system.  We need to repeal the AMT. But until we  can repeal  it, we must hold harmless  those  Americans whose  taxes are being raised  in  the next year.  But even before we  repeal  the AMT we  need  to be sure  that  those Americans who  have pre-paid future tax liability under AMT be  able to use the pre-paid tax credits that they  have accumulated. Unfortunately,  there are  thousands of Americans who have pre-paid future  tax  liability  through  the AMT but have  never been able  to use  their credits. These  credits amount to an interest free loan to the  Federal government.  Some Americans have been floating an interest free loan to the government for years  and years. This is just plain wrong. To add insult to injury, many of these Americans have  had  to  take out second mortgages on  their  homes and are paying interest on those loans  to give the government an interest free loan!  Some families raided their retirement plans or  their children’s education savings in order to  give the government an interest free loan.  I have a bill, the AMT Credit Fairness Act  that would correct  this  inequity and would  allow Americans to use their pre-paid tax credits. Unfortunately, the AMT Credit Fairness Act  is not part of the Stealth Tax Relief Act that  we will pass today but I will continue to work  for its enactment.  ",2005
1571,34,2005-12-07,Mr. LINDER.," Mr. Speaker, I am a co-sponsor of this legislation and I rise in strong support of H.R. 4096, the Stealth Tax Relief Act.  A couple of years ago, I got a call from my  daughter who asked, ‘‘What is the AMT and  why is it sneaking up on people like me?’’  As  a  proponent  of  tax  reform,  I  hear  phrases  like  that every day describing  the  AMT as part of ‘‘a tax code so out of control  that now it is sneaking up on the middle class  and threatening it with an unintended stealth  tax.’’ And while that phrase might indicate that  the code is an animate entity, it is also a fact  that ‘‘the AMT, since its enactment in 1969,  has been significantly modified  in 1971,  in  1976, in 1977, in 1978, in 1982, in 1986, in  1990, in 1993, and in 2001.’’  These facts send a clear reminder that we  have created a complex, convoluted monster  of a tax code that is constantly being amended with special provisions  targeted  to  treat  Americans differently. The  intentional harm  that the current code is causing in terms of  lost economic growth is bad enough. Now it  appears we have to worry about the unintentional harm the code inflicts as well.  The AMT  is a case study of our chaotic  code—it forces Americans to perform two tax  calculations, using two completely different set  of rules, and it’s so difficult to understand that  most taxpayers have to hire someone to figure  it out. And the reason we have the AMT is because  the code  is used  to promote various  goals  through preferential  tax  treatment. Because people were taking advantage of those  incentives, and reducing  their  income  taxes,  the AMT was created to make sure wealthy  people didn’t reduce  their  income  taxes  too  much. Now,  it  threatens  the entire middle  class.  Mr. Speaker,  I support every effort  to  improve this tax system and I strongly support  Mr. REYNOLDS’ bill to extend AMT relief for millions of U.S. taxpayers for an additional year.  But the AMT is just a symptom of a twisted  tax code that is now so broken that it routinely  results in these kinds of unintended tax consequences  and  undermines  hardworking  American workers every day.  ",2005
1572,34,2005-12-07,Mr. HERGER.," Mr. Speaker, because of time  constraints during Floor debate, I was unable  to present my full remarks in support of H.R.  4096,  the Stealth Tax Relief Act of 2005.  I  would like to request that the following comments be published  in  RECORD for Wednesday, December 7, so my  remarks in support of H.R. 4096 are reflected  in the RECORD in their entirety:  the CONGRESSIONAL  Mr. Speaker, without today’s legislation,  the number of Americans ensnared by the  Alternative Minimum Tax is estimated to  grow to an astounding 21 million in 2006.  The problem is so great that the Treasury  Department estimates that by 2013, an AMT  repeal would be more expensive than a repeal  of the income tax.  In my own northern California congressional district, in one particular area, nearly  3,000 constituents face a significantly higher  tax burden because of this onerous tax.  In February of 1986, a levee broke on the  Yuba River causing a flood that submerged  the community, resulting in millions of dollars in damages.  Now, after nearly 20 years of legal battles,  a court has found the state liable and ordered it to pay damages to flood victims in  the amount of $428 million.  Unfortunately, because  individual claimants have to add back attorney fees as AMT  taxable income, the flood victims may end  up paying some form of tax on 100 percent of  their award, even though this is money they  never saw.  This is double taxation, and it is unfair.  The attorneys have already paid income tax  on the amount they earned through representation.  Mr. Speaker, it is unfair that these flood  victims—who have waited so long to be justly compensated—now should be subject to  the AMT.  The AMT is sorely in need of fundamental  reform. It’s time once and for all to do away  with this middle class tax trap. I urge my  colleagues to vote for the Reynolds extension before us.  ",2005
1573,34,2005-12-07,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today in support of the Stealth Tax Relief  Act, H.R. 4096, a  temporary  fix  to a much  larger, more overhanging problem, the Alternative Minimum Tax  (AMT). Originally  intended to ensure wealthy taxpayers paid their  fair share, the AMT has become a tax on the  middle-class. Without adjustments for inflation  like the federal income tax, the AMT targets a  growing number of people each year. Taxpayers in states with high property taxes and  high local and state income taxes, in states  like my home state of Connecticut, are most  hard-hit by the AMT. In fact, Connecticut faces  the third highest AMT tax liability in the nation.  H.R. 4096 will pass the House today and  again, the House will evade its responsibility  to find a real solution to the AMT attack on the  middle-class  for another year. The Majority  seems to find plenty of time to cut social programs, increase the deficit, and afford estate,  capital gains, and dividends  tax cuts  to  the  wealthiest among us, while consistently dragging their feet to fix a tax that targets 17 million working middle-class  families. According  to  the Treasury Department,  the Joint Committee on Taxation, and  the Congressional  Budget Office, the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003  have, in fact, tripled the size of the AMT problem.  The American public deserves better. Last  month, I supported a Democratic proposal in  the House Ways and Means Committee that  would have totally eliminated the AMT for all  families with incomes under $200,000. Unfortunately,  this measure was  rejected along  party  lines.  I am also a cosponsor of H.R.  2950, the Individual Tax Simplification Act that  would among other  things, repeal  the AMT.  However, to date, the bill has received no attention by the House Ways and Means Committee. And now today, I am disappointed that  the Majority brought the underlying bill to the  floor under the suspension calendar, a procedure which blocked the opportunity to offer an  amendment to fully repeal the AMT.  Americans need real solutions  to address  these problems, not band-aids and bumper  sticker slogans.

1574,48,2005-12-07,Mr. JEFFERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  First, I would like to thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. MCCRERY)  for joining me in introducing this important piece of legislation. I also want  to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. THOMAS, and our ranking  member, Mr. RANGEL, for their efforts  in bringing this bill to the floor. I also  would be remiss if I failed to thank  both the Republican and Democratic  staff of the committee  for their extraordinary bipartisan effort  to put  this tax relief package together.  And I want to do something which is  a little bit out of order, and that is to  thank someone who is not properly a  Member of this body, our mayor of New  Orleans, Ray Nagin, who is here with  us today. He has, as much as anyone,  pushed this House and this Senate and  our Congress and our President  to  make sure that our region is not forgotten; and I want to thank him for his  presence here in the Chamber.  Mr. Speaker, the Gulf Opportunity  Zone Act of 2005 provides much needed  aid and comfort to the victims of hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma across  the gulf coast and provides a much-  needed shot in the arm to the many  thousands of businesses that have been  shuttered, suffered serious damage, or  have seen their customer bases erode  significantly or disappear in the wake  of horrible storms.  The economy of the gulf coast and  particularly that of my home State of  Louisiana  has  been  severely  compromised by the ravages of two terrible  storms. One of our Nation’s largest and  most economically  important cities,  the city of New Orleans, was evacuated  and commercially shuttered for most  of the fall. Even today, as New Orleans  slowly regains her footing, most of her  citizens remain in a hurricane-forced  exile as the city’s businesses struggle  to rebuild and to make a fresh start  with a significantly diminished customer base, extraordinary costs of repair and  reconstruction, and a distressed infrastructure.  Mr. Speaker,  the  cities,  parishes  across  the gulf coast, and counties  across the gulf coast are struggling to  recover from a deluge that laid them  low. My constituents and those of my  gulf coast colleagues, however, are a  resilient people. They have confronted  natural disasters before, and they have  emerged triumphant and stronger still.  I have every confidence that the same  is true today. With the right tools in  their tool box, New Orleanians and our  neighbors  in Louisiana, Mississippi,  Alabama, and Florida will rebuild and  recover  and  a  brighter  future will  emerge.  Today, Mr. Speaker, with the passage  of this important piece of legislation,  we provide the entrepreneurs of the  gulf coast a sturdy set of tools with  which to jump-start our recovery. We  also address an unprecedented housing  crisis with unprecedented resources to  rebuild  and  rehouse  the  thousands  whose homes are damaged or destroyed  by these vicious storms.  We also are keenly aware of the financial crisis that the States, our cities, our parishes are confronting. In  order to ease those burdens, this bill  also provides several important tools  to give our hometowns access to the  capital they need to survive  in the  short term and thrive over the long  run: $500 million in tax credit bonds to  meet debt service needs, $3 billion in  partially guaranteed general obligation  bonds, and $7.75 billion in private activity bond authority. I am confident that  by properly leveraging these tools, the  States,  our  cities,  parishes,  school  boards and others will emerge from the  hurricane stronger than before they  struck.  Mr. Speaker, with the passage of this  act, businesses in New Orleans and surrounding parishes will enjoy tremendous tax advantages for the next few  years that should give them the boost  they need to survive and a little leg up  to get ahead over the longer term: expanded section 179 expensing for small  businesses;  bonus  depreciation;  expenses  for  demolition  and  clean-up  costs, including brownfields clean-up;  an enhanced rehabilitation tax credits;  and increased net operating loss carry-  back among others.  By affording these tools to be combined with effective economic planning, the House today greatly enhances  the opportunity for a great, but shattered, community to rebuild, not just  to recover, but to become more survivable, more sustainable, more equitable,  and more prosperous over some time,  but all at once.  Mr. Speaker, the efforts of my colleagues in providing the relief we need  in the gulf coast have been unparalleled to any I have witnessed during  my tenure in Congress. For that I am  extraordinarily grateful. However, we  still have a long way to go before we  achieve the full recovery that I know  we all want. I look forward to working  with each of you in the coming weeks  and months as we rise to the challenge  of ensuring that, like the Phoenix of  myth and fable, New Orleans rises from  the devastation of Hurricane Katrina  as a bright shining model of American  ingenuity and opportunity.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2005

Katrina’s  track came across Florida, got into the  gulf, and actually affected my district  on its way through Florida, but in a  very slight manner. When it got into  the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico,  it grew into a category 5 storm and  just wreaked devastation on the New  Orleans/southern Mississippi area.  I support this bill and all it does. But  then this was followed by two other  storms, Rita and Wilma. Wilma, of  course, came across Florida, and  in  Broward County delivered  the most  powerful winds that we have seen in  over 40 years. And Palm Beach County,  as well as Dade County. And coming  across the State the way it did from  the gulf to the Atlantic made it most  unusual as far as the power that it  gained, or retained, coming across the  Florida Everglades.  We have been damaged in Florida as  well. But of course our devastation and  our problems are overshadowed by the  tragedy of Katrina in Louisiana and  Mississippi.  This bill is a reasonable bill. It sets  forth incentives and some relief in the  Tax Code because of the devastation  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:26 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07DE7.078 H07DEPT1 ",2005

1578,62,2005-12-07,Mr. DREIER.,  I yield  tleman from Florida.  ,2005
1579,62,2005-12-07,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  add another provision there, that over  the last 3 years, hourly wages have increased in the United States by 8 percent. So a lot of this stuff we have  heard is absolutely false.  ",2005
1580,62,2005-12-07,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my friend for that contribution, showing, as I said, that the standard of living in the United States of America is  strong.  And the President has put it very  well: we are never going to be satisfied  until every American who wants a job  has a job. We must continue to do everything possible to ensure that that  happens, and that again is what this  agreement is about.  Ninety-four percent of the world’s  consumers are outside of our borders,  Mr. Speaker. So I believe we must do  everything we can to pry open those  markets, because the world has access  to the U.S. consumer market, and that  is a good thing; but what we need to do  is gain more and more access to their  markets.  So this is a win-win all the way down  the line. This is a continuation of what  we have seen of the DRCAFTA agreement, the NAFTA agreement, and others that are creating great opportunity  for U.S. workers and consumers alike.  And I want to say in conclusion that  I am very, very grateful that through  this agreement we are getting us back  to this notion of bipartisanship, because it is not a Republican or Democratic  issue. Trade  is an  issue that  should see the support of Republicans  and Democrats. We are happy to provide the lead, but every Democrat who  wants to jump on board in support of  the cause of free trade is more than  welcome, and I am happy the Democrats are understanding  the critical  importance of this effort.  ",2005
1581,62,2005-12-07,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker,  let me  just remind my colleagues that we are  talking about a free trade agreement  with Bahrain, a country whose size is  about the same as the city of Austin,  Texas, and of course a very important  country within the Middle East.  Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. MEEKS).  Mr. MEEKS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Bahrain Free Trade Agreement. This  agreement  is  good  for  the United  States, and it is good for Bahrain. It  has real trade benefits. But beyond  that, it will strengthen relations with  one of our most steadfast friends in the  Middle East. Progress made on labor  and economic reforms can stand as a  model for future trade agreements with  the Middle East.  The Ways and Means Committee’s bipartisan approval of the U.S.-Bahrain  Free Trade Agreement is symbolic of  the cooperative and supportive relationship that exists between the two  countries. This agreement will bring  benefits to both countries, strengthen  economic ties, and promote social, political,  and  economic  opportunities.  The Bahrainis have taken difficult, but  important, progressive steps that will  elevate standards in Bahrain and help  promote stability in the Middle East.  Bahrain has been a steadfast American ally through World War II, the  gulf war, and the war on terrorism.  Bahrain has implemented multiple substantive  reforms over  the past  few  years, including the adoption of a new  constitution to transform the country  from a hereditary emirate to a constitutional monarchy, the creation of a  bicameral  legislature,  and  granting  suffrage to all citizens over 18 years of  age. In addition, Bahrain has made significant improvements to its labor laws  and has dismantled  its Arab League  boycott of Israel.  My friends, globalization is here. And  as Tom Friedman indicated, yes, indeed, the world is flat. We have made  sure that we are more interdependent  upon one another; and it is good to be  interdependent,  because  with  that  interdependence, we as a Nation begin  to depend on others in this world. The  world is much smaller than it was just  40 years ago. As we become dependent  upon one another, raising the standards of living all over this world, we  then  indeed  ensure  a  safer United  States of America and a more harmonized world.  I say let us vote for this. It is good  for America, it is good for Bahrain, and  it is good for the Middle East.  ",2005

1584,62,2005-12-07,Mr. HENSARLING.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding me  this time.  Mr. Speaker, again we have an opportunity to stand up for American families. Again, we have an opportunity to  stand up for free trade and pass the  U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement.  This is a simple matter. Free trade  delivers a greater choice of goods and  services  to American  consumers  at  lower prices. That means families can  buy more using less of their paychecks.  More trade means more competition,  and competition has always helped the  consumer. We have over 200 years of  history to prove that.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, over the past  few years, prices have dropped for a  wide array of goods and services which  are produced around the world, such as  video equipment and toys. Yet we pay  a lot more for products that do not effectively compete with foreign companies,  for example, prescription drugs  and cable television. Again, competition works. Trade works.

1589,83,2005-12-07,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the gentlewoman  from North  Carolina and I thank her for taking the  time this week to look at how workers  continue educating themselves and preparing and participating in a changing  economy, a changing job market.  I mentioned the diversity of experience that comes to this body and what  goes into looking at these policies and  how we remain competitive, what we  need to do to be competitive and the  decisions we make, how tax and government budgeting and  spending affects  the  budget. The  gentlewoman  from North Carolina spent her time in  education. Ms. FOXXcame to us after  working at post-secondary education  and looking for avenues to best encourage  individuals  to  become  lifelong  learners, to continue  improving and  honing those skills so that they were  productive in the job market, and I  thank her for her leadership.  I thank her for the time spent with  the President and with the North Carolinians this weekend as they were able  to showcase their facility and showcase  what they are doing to be a leader in  being competitive in a global economy.  At this time, I would like to recognize the gentleman  from Texas  (Mr.  HENSARLING) who has worked tirelessly  not only on budgeting and not only on  looking at how we budget, but looking  at what happens with tax policy and  the  ramifications  that  that  has  throughout our economy, both for our  large businesses, our small businesses  and for our families. We appreciate the  leadership that he has brought to the  budgeting issue, looking at both sides  of that ledger, your inflows and your  outflows.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING).  ",2005
1590,83,2005-12-07,Mr. HENSARLING.," Mr. Speaker,  I  certainly thank the gentlewoman for  yielding and certainly appreciate her  leadership in this body on helping promote policies that promote economic  growth in jobs and being a true leader  in trying to help reform government  programs that too often take away  from family programs because they are  wasteful, they are duplicative, they are  inefficient, there is no accountability.  She is one of the true leaders in Congress on these issues.  Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of good  news  that Americans have  tonight.  Clearly, this Nation faces a number of  challenges and we know about them,  and  families are  still  struggling  to  meet high energy costs. Yet this Republican Congress has been bold in enacting new energy legislation to help  address that.  Families still have challenges in the  high cost of health care, but this Republican Congress is doing things to  help bring down the costs, particularly  for small businesses and to make it  easier to see a doctor in America as opposed to sue a doctor in America.  But although we still face a number  of challenges, as we have  just have  come away  from our great Thanksgiving holiday, we need to remember  the things that we need to give thanks  for and all the good things that are  happening in America.  One of the things that I do not think  a sufficient number of Americans appreciate is just how great this economy  is today. It is absolutely amazing, Mr.  Speaker, that this economy, not this  government, not this government but  the economy, men and women all over  the Nation, rolling up their sleeves and  risking capital, have gone out and created over  4 million new  jobs  since  President Bush’s economic growth program was enacted by this Republican  Congress.  b1930  That is over 4 million new taxpaying  jobs, jobs with a future, jobs that allow  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:26 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00083 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07DE7.145 H07DEPT1 ",2005
1591,90,2005-12-07,Mr. DELAHUNT.,"  If the gentleman  will yield for a moment. You know,  how about building some roads here in  the United States? How about rehabilitating schools and constructing new  schools with  taxpayer  dollars  generated at the Federal level.  Rather  than  doing  that  for  the  United States here, what about our fellow citizens who were ravaged and are  expressing frustration ever every single  day in the national media in the aftermath of Katrina, and Rita, and other  natural disasters, who are  living  in  cars. What  about  doing  something  here, Mr. President,  for Americans,  rather than assuming the cost of nation building in Iraq?  ",2005
1592,90,2005-12-07,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," I think the President needs to recognize, and I am not  saying this facetiously, he is not the  President of Iraq. He is the President  of the United States of America. And I  do not say that to be flippant. I say  that because this President’s sole focus  throughout his first term and into the  second term has been Iraq.  And to give a speech today as Ford  announces that they are cutting 30,000  jobs in the United States of America,  as Delphi is in bankruptcy, as General  Motors is having great difficulty competing, he is giving a speech on the  Iraqi economy. It is like we are having  a bad dream. I mean, come on. At some  point, should not someone around the  President or somebody in this Congress  tug him on the shirt sleeve and say,  hey, Mr. President, we need you. We  need your help. This country needs a  domestic economic policy.  Borrowing money from the Chinese  to subsidize tax cuts for the top 1 percent is not a domestic agenda  ",2005
1593,90,2005-12-07,Mr. DELAHUNT.," At a minimum, the  American  people  deserve  a  debate.  They deserve a debate. They deserve a  debate about the implications, not just  in terms of our national security, but  the implications for the economic future particularly of your generation,  by virtue of the costs that are being  borne by American taxpayers, let alone  my sons and daughters and your generation with their blood in Iraq.  I mean, from what we can infer, since  the American taxpayer is bearing almost the entire burden of nation building in Iraq, let us have a debate about  the concept of nation building as a key  critical ingredient in the foreign policy  espoused by this White House and embraced by this Republican Congress.  Because that, I would suggest, Mr.  Speaker, is a marked transformation in  traditional Republican principles. We  have heard, even in the course of the  campaign  in 2000 and  from previous  Presidential campaigns, a denigration  of nation building in terms of our foreign policy. And yet, what we have  done is we have embarked upon a nation building exercise as part of our  foreign policy, as part of our  international relations. It is being borne by  the American taxpayer.  ",2005
1594,90,2005-12-07,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," The problem with  this whole situation, this whole scenario, is that as we are spending $1.5  billion a week in Iraq, and we are borrowing money from the Chinese, over  $1 trillion in the last 4 years, not investing in the United States, not investing in education, not investing in  research and development, not fixing  our health care  issue, we are weakening ourselves as a country.  Now we all as Americans want to say  we want to be good to other countries.  We want to be helpful to other countries. But  if you are not strong at  home, what good really are you to the  rest of the world? We need a strong  America, because  if America  is not  strong, you are going to see a communist China rear its ugly head.  And  talk  about having  a  debate  about an issue. It was in today’s paper  and on the news last night and today.  Osama bin Laden. There is a name we  have not heard for a while. Osama bin  Laden is still alive leading the jihad.  Why are we not having the discussion  about where is Osama bin Laden? This  is the man who coordinated and organized the attack against the United  States on 9/11. And we are having this  huge debate about Iraq and what we  should do and when we should leave  and how  it  should go. What about  Osama bin Laden?  ",2005

You know, as an American I  must say, gentlemen, that politically  we could just say, well, let us go home.  Let us not come  to  the  floor, Mr.  Speaker, and share with the Members  about what they are not doing and  what we should do.

That is making sure that first responders can talk to one another, which we  learned  from  9/11,  that  firefighters  could not talk to police officers, police  officers could not talk to firefighters,  they could not talk to the port authority, they could not talk to others as it  relates to helping Americans get out of  those buildings.

In the 1990s he was convicted of fraud,  and they put him in anyway because he  was the friend of the proper person he  needed to be friends with. That is cronyism, and the whole process of not  being able to administer the public dollars in an efficient and effective fashion is incompetence.  The American taxpayers work very  hard and they send the money down to  us, and they trust us to spend that  money in a way that will benefit the  government and the safety and security of the United States. To put $87  million in the hands of a crook is not  only incompetent, but it is wrong and  it highlights their inability to govern.  They control the House and the Senate and the White House. They have  been in charge for years of all three  branches. They have had the opportunity to implement their Republican  agenda on taxes, on poverty, on college  tuition, on  foreign policy, on everything. It has been a miserable failure  across the board.  Quite frankly, I think it is an insult  to the American people because we do  not live under a dictatorship. We live  in a democracy, a representative government. America has  always  been  great, as Leader PELOSIwas saying  today to the 30 Something Group this  morning, because we have these high  expectations of what the government  should do and what the government  should be. I am tired of this body taking advantage of the busyness of the  American people.  Why is it that just because they can  get away with it they do it? That is not  right because America cannot lead the  world if it is not strong here at home,  and these constant tax cuts  for the  wealthy and cutting billions of dollars  out of college tuition, Mr. Speaker,  how are we supposed to invest in the  country?  ",2005
1601,104,2005-12-07,Mr. DELAHUNT.," When  you  talk  about corruption, I have a question for  the administration, and it will go unanswered. I dare say the fact that it  will go unanswered is a demonstration  that our own democracy is not functioning as it should and that we are  putting our democratic  institutions,  particularly this institution, at risk of  erosion, because we are not allowed to  ask questions that the American people want answers to.  Let me give you one question. Ahmed  Chalabi is the deputy prime minister of  this interim government. He is an individual who was convicted  in a Jordanian court for embezzlement of some  $100 million. He became a darling, if  you will, of the neo-conservative movement in this country. It is alleged that  he  provided  false  intelligence  that  served those that were advocating the  invasion in Iraq.  Later, it was reported in the news  that Mr. Chalabi was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation;  that  there was  in  Iraq a  search of his personal residence because he was suspected of providing intelligence that put American military  personnel at risk to Iran; that he was a  double agent for the Iranian government. Yet several weeks ago, he  is  meeting with the Vice President in this  country and is going around here in  Washington.  Please, will someone tell us what  happened? Was there any validity to  those allegations?  ",2005
1602,104,2005-12-07,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Well, he could  not go to the Jordanian embassy when  he was here in Washington because if  he went to the Jordanian embassy they  would have arrested him on the spot.  The embassy is Jordanian ground, just  like our embassy is in Jordan, because  they have a warrant for his arrest. But  better yet, we are doing business with,  again, a culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence, period.  One thing I also wanted to say, we  are talking about a redeployment, i.e.,  how we are going to have an exit strategy. There are people that are running  in a December 15 election that will be  seated  in March, and guess what  is  some of the platform. We want our own  independence. There was actually a  call  for the U.S. to give their exit  strategy. They are ready to go.  So we are saying that we are there on  behalf of democracy. Now they have a  form of democracy. They are going to  have it in March, and we are still saying they are not ready. Now we are in  judgment of them saying they are not  ready, but we are saying we want them  to have a democracy. Just imagine if  someone was to come over here to help  us and say, well, we are not going to  leave until we think you are ready to  govern your own country.  It goes against the very logic and  principles even in our own Constitution  saying that we want to help democratize other areas, and then when it  comes down to it, U.S. cities are suffering and  the money  that we are  spending over there. When their government is seated and one of the actions of business there was we want to  govern our own country, we can take  care of our own problems, better yet,  we are going to tell them, no, we cannot, and once again, Mr. MURTHA is  talking about redeploying our troops  to Kuwait and some other area in case  there is a threat as it relates to terrorism of the U.S., of the United States  of America, the flag that we all salute,  Mr. Speaker. Then our troops will go in  and make sure.  But if there is some sort of war or  conflict  between  different  factions  within  Iraq,  that  is an  Iraqi  issue.  When did that become our responsibility? We are not the Congress of the  world, and the President  is not the  commander-in-chief  of  the  world.  There was not a ballot box over in Iraq  outside with absentee ballots of our  troops sending their votes in.  So I think it is important, as we look  at how we are going to deal with the  gulf States, how are we going to deal  with health care, how are we going to  make sure that small businesses are  able to provide on behalf of their employees, how are we going make sure  that U.S. companies are going to be  able to stand for their pensions that  folks signed up for, worked 15 years to  find out when the golden 20 or 25 happens that it is not going to be there for  them?  b2300  How are we going to continue to  break our promise to veterans when we  told them what we would do when they  retire  or  they  become  veterans  of  health care? We are breaking our promises.  So to talk about the Iraqis and complete victory, I want to have complete  victory as it relates to veterans; I want  to have a complete victory as it relates  to  providing  health  care,  ",2005

1613,111,2005-12-07,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Mr. Speaker, as  the House stands poised to consider and pass  H.R. 2017,  the Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization Act of 2005 (TVRA), I want to express my strong support for this legislation. I  am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 2017. I  want to take this opportunity to recognize the  efforts of Survivors of Torture,  International  (SURVIVORS)  in my district of San Diego,  California. SURVIVORS  is an  independent,  nonprofit organization dedicated to caring for  survivors of politically-motivated  torture and  their families who live in San Diego County.  San Diego is home to the busiest land border crossing in the world. According to conservative  estimates  based  on  International  Red Cross Red Crescent Societies’ extrapolations of the percentage of torture survivors  among refugees from countries where the use  of systematic torture is documented, approximately 11,000  torture survivors are  living  in  San Diego County today. They are from countries where  the use of systematic  torture  is  documented,  including  countries  in Africa,  Southeast Asia,  the Middle East, and Latin  America.  Since 1997, SURVIVORS has helped more  than 500 torture survivors from more than 40  countries  to  recover  from  their  traumas  through a holistic program including medical,  dental, psychiatric, psychological,  legal and  social services. SURVIVORS empowers  torture survivors to reclaim the strength and vitality that were stolen from them by brutal dictators and governments. The specialized care  SURVIVORS provides  these vulnerable  individuals helps  them  to become self-sufficient  and healthy members of their families and of  our community. SURVIVORS currently serves  approximately 200 survivors of  torture and  their families in San Diego County.  Mr. Speaker, SURVIVORS works with refugees, asylees, asylum seekers, and  immigrants who are survivors of torture. By working  with this large population in San Diego County, SURVIVORS  is strengthening  the nation:  many of its clients move to other communities  in the United States after receiving the care  and services necessary to successfully build a  new  life here. As SURVIVORS continues  to  work in the community, it receives an increasing number of referrals and requests for services each year. There is also a need to continue making services even more comprehensive.  The  professional  background  of  SURVIVORS’ clients  include: business,  religious,  government, and farm leaders; university students and educators;  journalists; physicians  and nurses. They are  talented,  trained, productive people who feel destroyed. Torturers  today are able to create conditions which effectively break down the victim’s personality,  identity, and his/her ability  to  live a  full  life  later. At SURVIVORS  and  groups  like  it  across the nation, these individuals find help  to begin reclaiming their lives.  The significant majority of SURVIVORS clients in San Diego suffer from Post-Traumatic  Stress Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, or  both. The worst consequences of torture are  psychological  ‘‘sequelae.’’ These are normal  yet disabling reactions for ordinary people who  have endured the extreme trauma of torture.  People are referred to programs like SURVIVORS through a variety of sources, including:  religious  and  community-based  social  service organizations, refugee resettlement organizations,  immigration  attorneys,  public  health care providers, schools,  individuals  in  the community, and other torture survivors.  Mr. Speaker, the TVRA provides funds for  torture treatment centers in the U.S. through  the Office of Refugee Resettlement  (ORR).  Currently, 27 programs  in 17 states receive  assistance through ORR. The treatment provided by these programs enables survivors of  torture to recover their lives and become productive members of their communities. Many  of these centers also train mainstream organizations and personnel. This increases the ability of health care providers, schools and other  institutions to provide for the special needs of  torture victims and contribute to the prevention  of torture.  Since 2000, SURVIVORS has received the  bulk of its funding from TVRA through ORR;  and almost two-thirds of SURVIVORS’ current  financial support  is  funded  through an ORR  grant. TVRA provides funds for foreign treatment centers  through  the U.S. Agency  for  International Development (USAID).  In some  cases, direct investment by the U.S. in torture  rehabilitation centers provides important political support and protection, especially when  the local embassy, Members of Congress and  other American  leaders visit  these centers.  SURVIVORS also receives funding to provide  technical assistance and build the capacity of  NGOs in Mexico that provide services to survivors of torture.  Mr. Speaker, TVRA also authorizes a contribution to the United Nations Voluntary Fund  for Victims of Torture (UNVFVT). Funding from  the U.N. helps many centers feel more secure  in the dangerous work of aiding torture survivors that a regime has identified as its enemies. The UNVFVT  supports nearly 200  treatment programs spanning 70 countries, including nearly all U.S. centers. This funding is  also vital to groups like SURVIVORS for direct  programs.  In conclusion Mr. Speaker, the TVRA is a  vital piece of legislation which funds essential  services for survivors of torture throughout the  53rd District of California and San Diego  County, and enhances the standing and reputation by exporting America’s values  in  the  form of support for foreign treatment centers.  I strongly urge my colleagues  to  join me  in  supporting this bill that is so important to so  many.  f  HONORING RETIRING CONCORD  TOWN COUNCILMAN JOHN ALLAN  HON.

1614,111,2005-12-07,Mr. HIGGINS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  honor John Allan, whose service as a member  of the Concord Town Board will come to an  end on December 31, 2005.  Councilman Allan is a man dedicated to effective public service for the residents of the  Town of Concord. Few public officials  love  their hometown the way John Allan does, and  his public acts have always had the intention  of making life in the town of Concord better for  those fortunate enough to live there.  While John’s most recent run for public office has proven unsuccessful,  it  is a virtual  certainty  that he will  remain active  in  local  civic affairs. That is a good thing, for the town  of Concord is better for the active public service of individuals like John Allan.  I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for offering me  this opportunity  to honor  the public  service of retiring Concord Councilman John  Allan, and I hope that you will join me in offering to Mr. Allan the House’s best wishes of  good luck and Godspeed in all of his future  endeavors.  f  U.S. MARINE LANCE CORPORAL  DAVID A.

1615,111,2005-12-07,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor and remembrance of United States Marine Corporal David A. Mendez Ruiz of Cleveland, Ohio, who bravely, honorably and selflessly heeded the call to duty and made the  ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country.  Family, friends and service to others framed  Corporal Ruiz’s young life. He gained personal  strength and faith from those who knew him  best and loved him most, especially his father  and mother, Maximiliano and Miriam; sisters  and brothers, Sandra, Byron, Laura, Mynor,  Zucely, Edgar and Nydia; grandmother, Elvia  Ruiz; and his fifteen nieces and nephews.  Corporal Ruiz was born in Guatemala City,  Guatemala, on May 26, 1985. In 1991, at the  age of six, Corporal Ruiz and his family immigrated  to  the United States and settled  in  Cleveland, Ohio. He quickly assimilated  to  American culture; his easygoing nature and  generous heart easily drew others to him.

OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 7, 2005  ",2005
1617,118,2005-12-07,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker,  today’s actions are a shameful disservice both  to our  soldiers  in  Iraq and  to Americans here at  home. Republicans are denying the Nation an  open debate on the war in Iraq. On tonight’s  agenda,  the Republicans not only have  replaced Mr. MURTHA’s resolution on  Iraq with  H.R. 571, a perversion of the Murtha Resolution  that Representative HUNTER introduced,  and which in no way conveys the sentiment of  Representative MURTHA’s proposal. They also  have had the temerity to characterize it as a  ‘‘Democratic proposal.’’  Representative MURTHA’s Resolution states  that, ‘‘The deployment of U.S. forces in Iraq,  by direction of Congress, is hereby terminated  and  the  forces are  to be redeployed at  the  earliest practicable date.’’ It also provides for  deploying a contingency capability outside of  Iraq, and requires America to pursue security  and stability  in  Iraq  through diplomacy. The  Republican  legislation contains none of  this  language.  I am a member of the ‘‘Out of Iraq Caucus’’  because I believe we should bring our troops  home from Iraq as soon as practicably possible, as does Representative MURTHA. The  citizens of this country deserve to have a true  floor debate on why this is right and on how  best to do it. Then their Representatives owe  them an up or down vote on this issue. Mr.  MURTHA’s speech should open serious hearings on the issue, followed by extensive debate on our policy in Iraq.  Mr. Speaker,  to paraphrase FDR: Tonight  it’s clear that the only thing the Bush White  House has to fear is public debate itself.  It is the height of hypocrisy for the Republican leadership to schedule a sudden, strait-  jacketed mini-debate and vote on their version  of Mr. MURTHA’s resolution. To understand this  hypocrisy its necessary to put their deceit in  context.  The House Majority Leadership has consistently refused  to allow  the House  to debate  H.J. Res. 55, an earlier bill offered by 63  House members  in a bipartisan  fashion.  It  would require the President to set forth a plan  for withdrawal from Iraq and to begin to implement it next fall. The Republican Leadership  has stonewalled efforts to have this bill considered in committee and brought to the Floor for  consideration. They have forced us to employ  the parliamentary  last  resort of  filing a discharge petition, in order to force the Leadership to let us debate H.J. Res. 55. The issue  before the House at this point is not even the  merits of that resolution. Instead, it is preservation of the basic democratic process and the  ability of the public to hear debate on the most  pressing issue facing this country.  Now, in a 180 degree reversal, the Leadership suddenly wants an abbreviated debate on  our policy for ending President Bush’s disaster  in  Iraq. Why  this bizarre  turn-around, Mr.  Speaker? The answer is simple. Mr. MURTHA,  the Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday struck fear  in the Leadership and the White House with  his statement of plain truths. Because of his  stature in this body, the gentlemen from Pennsylvania, with that single speech, shredded the  White House’s defense of its flawed policies.  Until now, the President and Vice President  have relied on questioning  the patriotism of  their critics on Iraq. They have hidden behind  the claim that—any critics of their war do not  support our  troops and do not  respect our  troops’ sacrifices. They have  repeated  that  outrageous mantra over and over, most disgracefully in President Bush’s remarks on Veterans Day.  Those false claims to discredit critics were  demolished  in one stroke by Mr. MURTHA’s  statement. The White House knows full well:  that  there  is no more patriotic Member of  this House,  that  there  troops more,  that there is no Member who has supported  our troops more, and  that there is no Member who has served in  our military more bravely than ",2005
1618,118,2005-12-07,Mr. MURTHA.,"  The White House political spinners also realize that the American people are disgusted  when attacks on a patriot like Mr. MURTHAare  made by elected officials in the White House  who sought to evade military service in time of  war. So now they resort to this sleazy tactic.  They pretend to have the Nation consider the  issues raised by Mr. MURTHA’s candid analysis, but in reality they seek to sweep those  powerful remarks under the rug.  Then  they will pretend  that  the Congress  has seriously considered the tragic issues of  is no Member who  loves our  life and death and claim  that  this steam-  rollered vote reflects the fully-informed, considered opinion of our constituents. That’s nonsense.  This is a disgrace to the House, and more  important, it’s a disgrace to all that our men  and women in Iraq are fighting and dying for.  The American people and our soldiers deserve better  than  this cheap  trick. To  those  across  the aisle who want  to prevent  the  American people from learning the awful truths  about Iraq and who seek to stifle real national  debate, there is only one thing to say: ‘‘Shame  on you.’’  Mr. HUNTER’s charade should be defeated.  f  S.  136; TITLE  III—REDWOOD NATIONAL  PARK  BOUNDARY  ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2005  HON. MIKE THOMPSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 7, 2005  ",2005
1619,118,2005-12-07,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to thank Senator FEINSTEINand Chairman POMBO for their support of my legislation  to adjust the boundary of Redwood National  Park to include the State of California’s recent  Mill Creek acquisition. This  legislation  is  included as Title III in S. 136—The Rancho Corral de Tierra Golden Gate National Recreation  Area Boundary Adjustment Act.  In 1994, the National Park Service and the  California Department of Parks and Recreation  established an historic framework for cooperative management of  the  four redwood parks  included in the boundary of Redwood National  Park. Now officially known as Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP), this partnership  is viewed as a nation-wide model of  interagncy  cooperative management  effort.  Prior to the cooperative agreement, there were  inefficiencies, duplication of effort, management and operational conflicts and confusion  for the visitor. Now the park appears to the  visitor and the traveling public as a seamless  park unit. A Redwood National and State Park  general management plan was adopted  in  2000 that guides the future management and  protection  of  these  parks.  The  proposed  boundary  revision will enable  the  two park  systems to extend the unique RNSP partnership to the Mill Creek acquisition.  The Mill Creek acquisition is contiguous to  the existing boundary of RNSP. It is bordered  to  the west by Del Norte Redwoods State  Park,  to  the north by Jedediah Smith State  Park and to the east, by Six Rivers National  Forest, Smith River Recreation Area. My legislation adjusts the RNSP boundary to include  the State acquisition of  the Mill Creek and  Rock Creek watersheds.  The California Department of Parks and  Recreation acquired the approximately 25,000  acres of redwood forest in Del Norte County in  2002. The addition of this land protected two  important watersheds  that  link  the Pacific  Coast with  the  inland mountains. The Mill  Creek and Rock Creek watersheds are important coho salmon  rearing  tributaries  to  the  Smith River, California’s largest remaining un-  dammed river. Protecting and restoring habitat  for coho salmon in these areas will help increase salmon populations along the Northern  California and Southern Oregon Coasts.

1620,125,2005-12-07,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker,  today  is  the 64th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl  Harbor, the infamous day in 1941 that led us  into World War II. It is appropriate that I rise  today to honor the military retirees’ grassroots  organization known as the Class Act Group.  After nearly ten years of citizen advocacy, urging Congress  to  fully restore  their promised  military health care benefits, this noble group  of warriors has decided to call it a day and  close its offices.  CAG’s  roots date back  to July 16, 1996,  when attorney George E. Day filed a law suit  in Federal Court in Pensacola, Florida on behalf of retired Air Force Colonels William O.  Schism and Robert Reinlie. The suit alleged  breach of contract with military retirees over  the age of 65 years by the failure of the U.S.  to provide  the military medical care  it had  promised.  But George Day is not just any lawyer. Col.  George ‘‘Bud’’ Day (Retired) is a veteran of  more  than 30 years service  in  the Armed  Forces of the United States. He joined the Marine Corps in 1942 and served 30 months in  the South Pacific as a noncommissioned officer. He received an appointment as a Second  Lieutenant in the National Guard in 1950. He  was called to active duty in the Air Force in  1951. He served two tours in the Far East as  a fighter-bomber pilot during the Korean War.  In April 1967, Colonel Day was assigned to  the 31st Tac Fighter Wing at Tuy Hoa Air  Base, Republic of Vietnam. Shot down over  North Vietnam on August 26, 1967, he spent  67 months as a Prisoner of War. Colonel Day  was the only POW to escape from prison in  North Vietnam and then to be recaptured by  the Viet Cong in the South. He is also credited  with living through the first ‘‘no chute’’ bailout  from a burning jet fighter in England in 1955.  Colonel Day holds every significant combat  award. He is the nation’s most highly decorated officer since General Douglass MacArthur. He holds nearly seventy military decorations and awards of which more  than  fifty  are for combat. Most notable are the Medal of  Honor, the Air Force Cross, the Distinguished  Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Legion of  Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air  Medal with nine Oak Leaf Clusters, the Bronze  Star for Valor with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the  Bronze Star, the Purple Heart with three Clusters and  the POW ribbon. He wears  twelve  Campaign Battle Stars.  So, Mr. Speaker, Col. Day’s  long, distinguished record shows that he was a fighter in  the field defending his comrades and country  and, I can attest, he has been just as determined a fighter in the courtroom, too. He recruited his own army of grassroots soldiers  who, in town meetings and over the Internet,  gathered  together  to exercise  their constitutional freedoms to fight for their rights, just as  Thomas  Jefferson,  John Adams, Benjamin  Franklin and all the Founding Fathers imagined they would.  The CAG suit filed in 1996 was based on  the  fact  that agents of  the Federal Government—including military recruiters, active duty  members of the uniformed services, and other  government officials—routinely promised  that  the government would provide lifetime health  care to military retirees and their dependents  if they served a career of at least 20 years in  uniformed service.  The promise of lifetime care was made and  fulfilled  for generations, but until 1956 Congress had never passed a statute that specified what level of care would be provided. On  December 7, 1956 a new law took effect with  a provision  that provided  for health care at  military facilities on a ‘‘space available’’ basis.  This new law had the practical effect of defining and  limiting  the Federal Government’s  commitment to military retiree health care, by  conditioning such care on space availability.  In other words, after 1956, health care that  had been promised and routinely delivered for  years was no  longer assured. As military  bases began to close and downsize, the availability of health care became more and more  limited. Subsequent laws completely removed  Medicare-eligible military retirees from the military health care system.  The 1956  law  ‘‘changed  the  rules  in  the  middle of the game’’ for military retirees who  entered  the  service prior  to December 7,  1956. When they agreed to enter the service,  they had promises—a verbal contract—of lifetime health care  that routinely were  fulfilled.  When they left the service 20 or more years  later, they lived under a new set of rules. In  short, the health care rug was pulled out from  under them.  On November 18, 2002, a Federal Appeals  Court ruled that only Congress can authorize  the  level of health care  the government will  provide to military retirees; therefore, promises  made by military recruiters or government officials were not binding. On June 2, 2003, the  Supreme Court  declined  to  consider Col.  Day’s appeal of the ruling, putting an end to  the law suit.  Although the Appeals Court did not rule in  favor of  the plaintiffs,  the  language of  the  Court ruling was very clear that the plaintiffs  had won a moral victory:  Accordingly, we must affirm the district  court’s judgment and can do no more than  hope Congress will make good on the promises recruiters made in good faith to plaintiffs and others of the World War II and  Korean War era—from  1941  to  1956,  when Congress enacted its first health  care insurance act for military members, excluding older retirees. . . .  We cannot readily imagine more sympathetic plaintiffs than the retired officers of  the World War II and Korean War era involved in this case. They served their country for at least 20 years with the understanding that when they retired they and  their  dependents would  receive  full  free  health care  for  life. The promise of such  health care was made in good faith and relied upon. Again, however, because no authority existed to make such promises in the  first place, and because Congress has never  ratified or acquiesced to this promise, we  have no alternative but to uphold the judgment against the retirees’ breach-of-contract  claim. . . .  Perhaps Congress will consider using its  legal power to address the moral claims  raised by Schism and Reinlie on their own  behalf, and indirectly for other affected retirees.  Mr. Speaker, CAG  and  the  nationwide  grassroots group did in fact win a substantial  legislative  victory.  In  2000, Congress  responded  to an  intense national grassroots  campaign waged by military retirees by enacting Tricare  for Life  (TFL), which provides  health care to Medicare-eligible military retirees (generally age 65 or older). TFL did not  go all the way to fulfill the government’s promise of lifetime health care for our Nation’s warriors, but it was a substantial step forward in  that effort.  The military retirees grassroots group also  actively encouraged Congress to address the  unfulfilled health care needs of many younger  military  retirees who  find  they are not well  served by  the military health care system  known as Tricare Standard, a plan for retirees  who do not live near military bases that could  otherwise  provide  their  promised military  health care.  Mr. Speaker,  the men and women at  the  core of the Class Act Group have grown old  serving  their country. They were heroes  in  World War II, Korea and Vietnam. And they  were heroes in the courtroom and in the halls  of government fighting for their rights.  They have  fought  the good  fight, but as  good soldiers they know when it is time to regroup. Even with  the advent of TFL  these  grassroots warriors kept  fighting  for  full restoration of their promised health care. But they  know  that budget battles  in Congress have  gotten  tougher,  that  new  generations  of  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:11 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A07DE8.074 E07DEPT1 ",2005

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker,  Republican  fiscal  policies  continue to spread tidings of economic  joy to families throughout our country.  Yesterday, the U.S. Labor Department reported that consumer prices  plummeted last month by 0.6 percent,  the largest decrease since 1949. Energy  prices alone have dropped by 8 percent.  These strong economic indicators are  only a sample of gifts created by low  taxes and decreased government regulations.  Additionally,  4.5 million new  jobs  have been created. More Americans are  working than ever before in our Nation’s history. The unemployment rate  is lower than the average of the past  three decades. The economy grew at 4.3  percent over the last 10 quarters. Tax  receipts  increased by $247 billion  in  just 1 year after the Bush tax cuts, the  largest  increase  ever.  Home  sales  reached a record high in October. Productivity soared in the last quarter by  4.7 percent, reducing fears of inflation.  We will continue to enact economic  policies to help all Americans.  In conclusion, God bless our troops.  We will never forget September 11 and  the courageous Iraqi voters.  f  RESOLUTIONS REGARDING WAR IN  IRAQ  (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2005
1623,2,2005-12-16,Mr. KUCINICH.,"  Today,  the U.S.  House will debate a so-called Victory  in Iraq resolution, and vote on whether  or not  the continued U.S. military  presence in Iraq is desirable by the U.S.  Government.  Today, Congressman RONPAULand I  have a resolution that expresses the  sense of Congress that the new permanent Council of Representatives of Iraq  should debate and vote on whether the  continued U.S. military presence  in  Iraq is desired by the Government of  Iraq.  According to the Iraq constitution,  the Iraq federal government has exclusive power over foreign policy and negotiation, national defense policy, and  the Council of Representatives specifically has the responsibility of creating  new  law and certifying treaties and  international agreements.  The continued U.S. military presence  in Iraq is a matter for the elected Government of Iraq, a sovereign nation, to  decide. If we define victory as Iraq’s  self-determination, then we ought to  encourage Iraq to make its own decision about further U.S. occupation. But  if victory is just a cover for endless  U.S. occupation of Iraq, then that is  just not going to be acceptable to the  American people or to people of the  world.  f  IMMIGRATION REFORM  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2005
1624,2,2005-12-16,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, during the  decade I served as a member of the  North Carolina Senate and during my  first term in the United States Congress, I have found that few things are  as  important or  represent as many  problems as illegal immigration.  The terrorist attacks on our homeland highlighted the potential disastrous effects of the porous borders and  the need to bolster border security. Illegal immigration also has many other  far-reaching  and  dangerous  effects.  That is why I am pleased to cosponsor  H.R. 4437, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism,  and  Illegal  Immigration  Control Act of 2005. This  important  piece of legislation will strengthen our  borders, crack down on those who hire  illegal aliens, increase the punishment  for those who smuggle people into our  country  illegally and allow  for  the  swift deportation of illegal aliens.  I sympathize with those who wish to  live in America. We are indeed a nation  of  immigrants, but also a nation of  laws. Immigration laws exist to provide the steps for safe and legal entry  into our country. Controlling  illegal  immigration begins with the enforcement of current laws and the elimination of incentives to immigrate illegally.  Please  4437.  in supporting H.R.  join me  f  THURMAN BARNES  (Mr. GINGREY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2005
1625,2,2005-12-16,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to congratulate Mr. Thurman  Barnes of LaGrange, Georgia, on receiving his GED at age 96. In fact, Mr.  Barnes is believed to be the oldest person ever to receive a GED, attesting to  the fact that an education is important  and fulfilling no matter what your age.  Eighty years ago, Mr. Barnes failed a  Latin class. As so often happens in life,  before he could make up his course  work, his attention was turned to his  job, marriage, and family obligations.  But throughout his life, the thought of  that  elusive  high  school  diploma  stayed with him.  Eight  decades  later, Mr.  Barnes  began taking classes at West Georgia  Technical College. This past Monday,  he passed the GED examination with  flying colors. When asked what subject  was easiest for him, Mr. Barnes replied,  ‘‘Social studies, because I have lived  through most everything in the last 100  years.’’  Mr. Speaker, it takes a lot of character and tenacity to hold on to the  dream of graduating high school for 80  years. I want to thank Mr. Barnes, his  family, West Georgia Technical College, and the Georgia Adult Literacy  Program for reminding us of the importance of rising to the challenges of life,  regardless of age.  f  MATTHEW SCOTT  (Mr. LARSEN of Washington asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",2005
1626,2,2005-12-16,Mr. LARSEN  of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to honor the heroism of a man named Matthew Scott,  who nearly 9 years ago performed an  act of uncommon courage that saved  the life of a young woman in my congressional district.  In August  of  1997,  a  15-year-old  woman and her friend were driving on  a narrow, windy road near a dangerous  area called Deception Pass. Unable to  see the road, Leslie, the driver, drove  off a 185-foot cliff  into the  freezing  ocean below. Her passenger managed to  jump to safety from the truck before it  went over the edge. At the same time,  Matthew Scott, a young Naval Chief  Petty Officer, was driving by the location when he spotted a busted guardrail and a group of people pointing to  the waters below.  Matthew  scaled  down  the  treacherous, dark cliff with only a small  flashlight to guide him. At the bottom  of his 185-foot descent, he swam 30  yards out  in strong tides and  frigid  water to rescue Leslie who had suffered  a broken back, leg, and arm. Because of  his selfless, courageous heroics, Leslie  is now a 24-year-old mother and a manager of a local coffee shop.  Matthew has continued to dedicate  his life to one of military service and is  now a lieutenant studying for his MBA  at the Naval Post Graduate School in  California.

I first say to my friend from Texas  (Mr. DOGGETT) that this notion that we  are going to stay just as long as President Bush wants us to stay and not a  day longer, well, actually, what President Bush has said is that we will stay  as  long as necessary and not a day  longer. And that was part of the initial  strategy  that was  launched on his  speech on the 26th of February 2003.  And  it  is very, very clear that the  President of Iraq has said that any  kind of artificial timetable would, in  fact, jeopardize the prospect of democracy.  ",2005

1630,9,2005-12-16,Mr. DOGGETT., Has the President or  your resolution been willing to declare  that it rejects the idea of permanent  bases in Iraq?  ,2005
1631,9,2005-12-16,Mr. DREIER.," Reclaiming my time, I  will say that the President has said in  that speech that we will remain in Iraq  as  long as necessary and not 1 day  longer. That is very clear to me, and so  it is obvious.  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 2  minutes to the very, very able fighter  for  freedom, our great  friend  from  Springdale, South Carolina (Mr. WILSON).  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I am here today in support of  the rule and the underlying resolution,  in very strong support. I am here as a  Member of Congress. I am here as a 31-  year veteran of the Army Reserves and  the National Guard.  I am also proud to be the father of a  son who served for a year in Iraq. I  know firsthand of the progress that is  being made there, along with other  Members of Congress.  We should be proud that Chairman  HUNTER, his son served in the Marines  for a year in Mosul. Mr. SKELTONhad a  son serve in Afghanistan in the war on  terrorism. Mr. TAYLORof North Carolina, Mr. AKINof Missouri, Mr. KLINEof  Minnesota, Ms. ROS-LEHTINENof Florida, and Mr. SAXTONof New Jersey, all  of us have had family members who  have participated in the global war on  terror, and we are so proud of their  successes.  Additionally, I would tell you that I  disagree  with  Democratic  Leader  PELOSI. I believe that her position is  wrong. I believe that proposing a withdrawal is giving your game plan ahead  of time. You do not do it in football;  you do not do it in politics. And you do  not do it in a time of war. It is my view  that we should understand that war is  unpredictable.  Of all times, this week 61 years ago  we found out the unpredictability of  war and that is the Battle of Bulge.  Tens of thousands of German troops secretly were  located  in the Ardennes  Forest, attacked our troops in Luxembourg,  in Belgium, and  in Germany  itself, and we  lost 17,000 Americans.  This could not be projected, this surprise attack.  We need to be prepared. So I am very  proud that  indeed progress  is being  made.  Our President has a wonderful plan of  developing the Iraqi Security Forces,  developing the Iraqi economy and the  political situation, as we saw yesterday  with the historic turnout of millions of  Iraqis to build a civil society. And the  bottom line is, it protects the American people.  This  is exactly what America did  after World War  II, developing  the  democratic society of Japan which now  is one of our great allies. We have the  same potential  to protect American  families now.  b1015  ",2005
1632,9,2005-12-16,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 11⁄2minutes.  Mr. Speaker, the resolution we are  debating today is an H. Res. resolution.  Basically, this is just a sense of the  Congress. It is largely symbolic.  One of the complaints that many of  us on this side of the aisle, and I know  some of the people on the Republican  side have as well, is that we kind of  skirt around the real issue, which is  what the policy is. Staying as long as  it is going to take, that is not a policy.  That is a sound bite.  The President does not know where  we are going  in Iraq. He has given  speeches that have been heavy on rhetoric, but not particularly big on specifics.  If we want to do something helpful  here, bring a binding bill to the floor  here that sets out our policy, and let us  have it out. Let us have the debate. Let  us talk about what our policy should  be in Iraq. Let us come back next week  or let us come back for a week in January and have this debate. Let us discuss what, in fact, our policy should be  in Iraq. We are not doing that. This is  all symbolic.  Notwithstanding  the  fact  that we  have  160,000  troops over  there,  that  over 2,100 Americans have died over  there, and 15,000 Americans have been  wounded, tens of thousands of Iraqis  have been killed, we have yet to have a  real policy debate on this House floor  about what course we should take in  Iraq. That is what we want. That is  what we are hoping for. I do not think  that is unreasonable.  To bring a largely symbolic resolution to the floor and tuck in it this  kind of policy statement, give us an  hour during the debate on the resolution to talk about everything, that is  not the way we should be doing business around here.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. INSLEE).  (Mr. INSLEE asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2005
1633,9,2005-12-16,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, the odds  of success in Iraq are not enhanced by  Congress continuing to act as a rubber  stamp for President Bush. We need a  change in strategic vision in Iraq.  This resolution says that setting a  timetable  somehow  is a Communist  plot, but, in fact, the President himself  set  timetables  in  Iraq when he  set  timetables to have transitional elections  in Iraq. He set timetables  for  elections because it focused the Iraqis  to demand performance, and that  is  what we should do in setting a timetable to transition to Iraqis true sovereignty for three reasons.  Reason number one, we should no  longer provide a crutch for an indefinite period of time to the Iraqi politicians. We need to focus their minds on  making the compromises that are necessary if a real government is going to  be followed. We cannot fall into the  trap of enabling Iraqi politicians to  continue their bickering. They need a  solution.  Number two, people say a timetable  will encourage more violence. Let me  ask you this: If there is a young unemployed man who is angry about foreign  troops marching on his neighborhood,  what do you think will make him more  angry and more likely to plant an IED,  the fact that we tell him we are going  to leave in a year or so, or tell him we  are going to stay there as  long as  George Bush says so? We need to tell  them that we are going to come home.  The third reason we ought to think  about this is that in our briefings we  have received, we have been told that  the Iraqi military will be fully trained  by next December 2006, and it is realistic, it is commonsense, it is a measure to focus the Iraqi politicians on the  necessity of seeking compromise, to  say that we should begin transitioning  next year and substantially conclude  by December 2006.  During that time I have one message  for the administration. They need to do  a better job arming the Iraqi military  forces. They need radios, they need  Humvees, they need logistics. We cannot allow that force to fall apart. We  need to defeat this resolution.  ",2005

1635,9,2005-12-16,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 30 seconds, and I do so to simply  focus on the issue that is constantly  raised here, and that is, the notion that  we somehow  impose closed rules on  every piece of legislation.  There have been 113 rules considered  on the House floor in the first session  of the 109th Congress. With the exception of those rules which by statute or  simple  resolutions  or  appropriation  continuing resolutions, 10 percent of  those 113 rules have been closed rules.

1636,16,2005-12-16,Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Florida.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas  (Ms. JACKSON-  LEE).  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding me this time.  Might I just say that I have started  this debate by suggesting that everyone who comes to this floor comes with  good  intentions and certainly comes  charged with the responsibility of securing the borders. Again, there is no  divide amongst Americans about the  importance of securing the homeland.  And,  frankly,  the eloquence of Mr.  HASTINGSon reminding us of our original roots that the Statue of Liberty  represents  to  this Nation,  that we  come  from many walks of  life. And  some have, as we well know, come to  this Nation in fishing boats or walked  across various lands or may have flown  here, and some of us came  in slave  boats. But we are all Americans now,  and we should be united around the  concept of security. But we should not  be united around the concept of divisiveness.  So when you poll Americans or ask  constituents in the district, they again  want comprehensive  immigration reform because so many of them, short of  our Native Americans, can track their  history  from places away  from this  soil.  So I would ask my good friends why  they would put a rule in that does not  bring the diversity of this Congress,  four Democratic amendments as opposed to a wide diversity of  issues.  Why, for example, do they insist on  forcing  local governments  into utilizing hard-pressed resources for doing  the Federal Government’s work, immigration work? That is our work to do.  Why do they insist on forcing law enforcement to take precious resources  away  from  protecting  children  and  going after bank robbers and making  sure the crime statistics go down by  arresting hotel maids in hotels?  And it is important to recognize that  they  have  amendments  that would  take away the very essence of the Constitution, which abides and believes in  due process and the right to access the  courts. We cannot dictate what the  courts will say, but I think if you will  ask any American, they would find it  faulty that they do not allow people to  petition to go into the courts.  What about those babies who have  come here at 6 months old, and you  criminalize them when they are 17-  year-old honor  students and  simply  want  to  be  part  of  the American  Dream?  So this legislation is missing because  Americans understand the concept of  earned access to legalization. Get the  criminals out of here. We join you in  that. Arrest the criminals. Arrest the  drug dealers. Arrest the people that are  not doing what they should do. But  those who are working hard, paying  taxes, should have an opportunity to be  able to be part of this great American  dream.  And, Mr. Speaker, what about the  soldiers on the battle  line who are  seeking citizenship, but have undocumented relatives, offering their lives  for Americans and the undocumented  relatives which they seek to bring into  status, are now criminalized and arrested  and  incarcerated  simply  for  their presence in the United States?  So I hope, as we proceed, we will find  ways to defeat these amendments. And  I ask that we defeat the underlying  bill.  ",2005

1638,16,2005-12-16,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  this  time.  Today is not a red letter day for this  great and storied institution. Rather  than doing what we know has to be  done regarding immigration reform, we  are simply punting the ball to the Senate, hoping that they will have the  courage to act in ways that we cannot.  Many of us here wanted an amendment that would be made in order that  would allow for a temporary worker  program to be established. That was  not allowed. In doing so, in not allowing that, we are simply ensuring that  we play a diminished role in the eventual bill that will pass this body.  If the denial of this amendment was  unfortunate, the removal of language  in the manager’s amendment that simply references the role that a temporary worker program would play in  enhancing border  security  is  simply  baffling. Every member of the Republican  leadership and virtually every  Member of  this  institution has  expressed the need to have a temporary  worker program at some point in order  to secure the border. Yet some said  they would vote against the legislation  if it was included here. Gratefully, the  Senate will not need a ‘‘sense of the  Congress’’  resolution  to  understand  what they have to do, and that is to include a temporary worker program.  The elephant in the middle of the  room, of  course,  is  the  11 million  illegals who are here. Without a temporary worker program, we will continue to turn a blind eye to their existence, to pretend that they are not here.  Nobody in this body, not one, is advocating that we round up and deport  those who are here illegally now, but  unless we have a program for them to  go into, we simply will not enforce the  law. And that is the dirty little secret  here. We ought to at least be honest  with our constituents in this regard.  There are some who will vote against  the  rule  and underlying  legislation  with the hope that we will later do  something more comprehensive. Some  will vote for the rule and underlying  legislation with resignation that all we  are capable of doing is to send this legislative vehicle, however flawed, to the  Senate with the hope that they will act  with the maturity that we lack.  One would be justified in either approach.  Mr. Speaker, today is not a red-letter day for  this great and storied institution. Rather than  do what we know must be done regarding immigration reform, we are punting  the ball  to  the Senate—hoping  that  they will have  the  courage to act in ways that we cannot.  Many of us  in  this body asked  for an  amendment made  in order  that would make  this legislation comprehensive, in other words,  an amendment  that would provide  for enhanced border security, increased interior enforcement, and would provide a legal framework for foreign workers to enter the country  and then return home.  It  is unfortunate  that  this amendment was  not made  in order.  In doing so we ensured  that this body will play a diminished role, at  best, moving ahead immigration reform.  If the denial of this amendment was unfortunate,  the  removal of  language  in  the manager’s amendment  that  references  the  role  that a temporary worker program will play in  enhancing border security, is simply baffling.  Every member of  the Republican  leadership  has expressed support for a temporary worker  program, as has an overwhelming majority of  this body, yet the language was removed after  threats from a few that the inclusion of any  reference  to a  temporary worker program  would guarantee their ‘‘no’’ vote against this  legislation.  Gratefully, the Senate doesn’t need to see  ‘‘sense of the Congress’’ language on a temporary worker plan  from  the House  to add  such a provision  to  their  legislation. They  know that such a plan is a necessary part of  securing the border.  The elephant in the middle of the room is  the 11 million illegal aliens who have already  entered  the  country. Without  a  temporary  worker program we will continue  to  turn a  blind eye to their existence. We’ll pretend they  aren’t here.  Nobody in this body is advocating that we  round up and deport all of those who are here  illegally. It’s no wonder. It would be the equivalent to rounding up the entire population of  the State of Ohio and sending them back to  their home country. Yet that is what ‘‘enforcing  the current law’’ would require.  We in this body know that, Mr. Speaker. But  unfortunately we don’t want to admit it to our  constituents. George Washington  once  famously said ‘‘If to please the people we do  what we ourselves disprove, how will we then  defend our work?’’ That is the question for us  today.  There are some who will vote against this  rule and underlying legislation in the hope that  we will later do something more comprehensive.

Res. 612) expressing the commitment of the House of Representatives to achieving victory in Iraq, and  ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 612  Whereas the Iraqi election of December 15,  2005, the first to take place under the newly  ratified  Iraqi Constitution,  represented a  crucial success  in the establishment of a  democratic, constitutional order in Iraq; and  Whereas Iraqis, who by the millions defied  terrorist threats to vote, were protected by  Iraqi security forces with the help of United  States and Coalition forces: Now, therefore,  be it  Resolved, That—  (1) the House of Representatives is committed to achieving victory in Iraq;  (2) the Iraqi election of December 15, 2005,  was a crucial victory for the Iraqi people and  Iraq’s new democracy, and a defeat for the  terrorists who seek to destroy that democracy;  (3) the House of Representatives encourages all Americans to express solidarity with  the Iraqi people as they take another step  toward their goal of a free, open, and democratic society;  (4) the successful Iraqi election of December 15, 2005, required the presence of United  States Armed Forces, United States–trained  Iraqi forces, and Coalition forces;  (5) the continued presence of United States  Armed Forces in Iraq will be required only  until Iraqi forces can stand up so our forces  can stand down, and no longer than is required for that purpose;  (6) setting an artificial timetable for the  withdrawal of United States Armed Forces  from Iraq, or immediately terminating their  deployment  in Iraq and redeploying them  elsewhere in the region, is fundamentally inconsistent with achieving victory in Iraq;  (7) the House of Representatives recognizes  and honors the tremendous sacrifices made  by the members of the United States Armed  Forces and their families, along with the  members of Iraqi and Coalition forces; and  (8)  the House  of Representatives  has  unshakable confidence that, with the support of the American people and the Congress, United States Armed Forces, along  with Iraqi and Coalition forces, shall achieve  victory in Iraq.

1644,30,2005-12-16,Mr.  KINGSTON.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentlewoman for the time  and really wanted to stand in support  of the resolution and believe that the  resolution is a good one and that yesterday in this week’s election speaks  volumes for all the work that we have  accomplished.  I want to speak more importantly in  memory and honor of Sergeant Daniel  Clay, who was killed when the marines  were attacked in Fallujah on December  1. His dad, Mr. Bud Clay, wrote the  President a letter and said that ‘‘I am  writing  to  tell you how proud and  thankful we, his parents and family,  are of you and what you are trying to  do to protect us all. This was Dan’s  second tour in Iraq and he knew and  said that his being there was to protect  us.  ‘‘I want to encourage you. I hear in  your  speeches  about  ‘staying  the  course.’ I also know that many’’ of you  are against this war and you must get  weary of fighting to try to do what is  right. ‘‘We and many others are praying for you to see this through, as Lincoln said ‘that these might not have  died in vain.’’’  I also have the actual  letter that  Daniel Clay wrote his  family to be  opened in the event of his death, and I  think it would be in his honor to read  it. This is of course by a very young  man:  ‘‘Mom, Dad, Kristie, Jodie, Kimberly,  Robert, Katy, Richard, and my Lisa.  ‘‘Boy do I love each and every one of  you. This letter being read means that  I have been deemed worthy of being  with Christ. With Mama Jo, Mama  Clay, Jennifer, all those we have been  without for our time during the race.  This is not a bad thing. It is what we  hope for. The secret is out. He lives and  His promises are real! It is not faith  that supports this but fact and I now  am part of the promise. Here is notice!  Wake up! All that we hope for is real.  Not a hope but real.  ‘‘But here  is  something  tangible.  What we have done in Iraq is worth my  sacrifice. Why? Because  it was our  duty. That sounds simple. But all of us  have a duty. Duty is defined as a God-  given task. Without duty life is worthless. It holds no type of fulfillment.  The simple  fact that our bodies are  built for work has to lead us to the  conclusion that God, who made us, put  us together to do His work. His work is  different for each of us. Mom, yours  was to be the glue of our family, to be  a pillar for those women, all women  around you. Dad, yours was to train us  and build us, like a platoon sergeant,  to  better  serve Him. Kristie, Kim,  Katy, you are the  fire team  leaders  who support your squad leaders, Jodie,  Robert and Richard. Lisa, you too. You  are my XO and you did a hell of a job.  You all have your duties. Be thankful  that God in His wisdom gives us work.  Mine was to ensure that you did not  have to experience what it takes to  protect what we have as a family. This  I am so thankful  for. I know what  honor is. It is not a word to be thrown  around. It has been our honor to protect and serve all of you. I faced death  with the secure knowledge that you  would not have to. This is as close to  Christ-like I can be. That emulation is  where all honor lies . . . I thank you  for making it worthwhile.  ‘‘As a marine this  is not the  last  chapter. I have the privilege of being  one who has finished the race. I have  been in the company of heroes. I now  am counted among them. Never falter!  Don’t hesitate to honor and support  those of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting.  ‘‘Now here are my final wishes. Do  not cry! To do so is to not realize what  we have placed all our hope and faith  in. We should not fear. We should not  be sad. Be thankful. Be so thankful. All  we hoped  for  is true. Celebrate! My  race is over. My time in the war zone is  over. My trials are done. A short time  separates all of us from His reality. So  laugh. Enjoy the moments and your  duty. God is wonderful.  ‘‘I love each and every one of you.  ‘‘Spread the word. Christ lives and He  is real.  ‘‘Semper Fidelis.  ‘‘Sergeant Daniel Clay.’’  Daniel Clay is like so many others  who have  fought to make yesterday  possible, and yesterday is certainly not  a conclusion but let us hope a beginning of a new and significant chapter  in Iraq where the military sacrifices  become smaller and the political engagement becomes greater.  One thing I have learned and loved  about this House is the fact that we are  using politics as a substitute for civil  war. Let us hope that Iraq learns that  lesson and that 200 years  from now  they will look back at yesterday as one  of their first most significant days in  democracy.  ",2005
1645,30,2005-12-16,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI),  the distinguished Democratic leader.  ",2005
1646,30,2005-12-16,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  commend  the gentleman  from California (Mr. LANTOS), our ranking Democrat on the International Relations  Committee, for his leadership to make  our country safer, our military stronger, and to bring stability to the region.  While we may not always agree on the  approach to take, Mr. LANTOS strove  very hard for a bipartisan resolution,  and I want to just read from the resolution that he would put forth in the  spirit of congratulating the people of  Iraq.  He said: ‘‘Resolved, That the House  of Representatives congratulates the  people of Iraq on the three national  elections conducted in Iraq in 2005.’’  Imagine, in January, in October, and  now in December, three times courageously they went to the polls, and his  resolution spells that out.  His resolution would encourage ‘‘all  Americans to express support for the  people  of  Iraq  in  their  efforts  to  achieve a free, open, and democratic  society,’’ and again,  throughout his  resolution he makes that point.  And he expresses ‘‘thanks and admiration to the members of the United  States Armed Forces and the armed  forces of other nations in Iraq, including the members of the security forces  of Iraq, whose heroism permitted the  Iraqi people to vote safely.’’  That is the spirit of the resolution  that we should be voting on today, one  that brings us together, that is clear to  the Iraqi people that their courage is  an example to the world.  But, sadly, this Congress is not an example of democracy to the world when  instead of using an occasion to unify,  once again, the Republican majority  brings to the floor a resolution rejecting the good offers of the gentleman  from California (Mr. LANTOS) to come  together in a bipartisan way and uses  what should be a cause for celebration  as instead a means to denounce those  who disagree, not very democratic, and  also to insist that if you want to congratulate the people of Iraq, you must  support the status quo.  More of the same in Iraq is not making the American people safer. More of  the same in Iraq is not making our  military stronger. More of the same in  Iraq is not bringing stability to the region.  So I think you will see Democrats  united in congratulating the people of  Iraq, commending our men and women  in the armed services, and supporting  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:45 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H16DE5.REC H16DE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005
1647,37,2005-12-16,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, the majority  brings to the House floor today a resolution  wrapped in a process that is offensive to the  very essence of democracy. This  resolution  provides a dictated take-it-or-leave-it vote without  the  opportunity  for  our  side  to  offer  amendments expressing differing views of the  elections in Iraq and the U.S. presence there.  The substance of  this resolution has all  the  appearance and wording of a campaign slogan.  While applauding the beginnings of democracy in Iraq, the majority has stifled democracy  at home by denying Democrats  the opportunity to offer our own resolution for consideration and an up-or-down vote on it.  Certainly, Democrats and Republicans congratulate the Iraqi people who drafted and by  vote ratified  their own constitution, and who  voted  this week  in defiance of  radical elements who sought  to deter  the  Iraqi people  from voting.  It is appropriate for the House to congratulate the Iraqi people on this step toward democratic governance, and we share the view that  this election and  the continued  training of  Iraq’s security forces will make it possible for  the United States to redeploy our troops and  leave Iraqis in charge of their own destiny.  That is as far as this House should go in expressing support for the Iraqi democratic process. However, this resolution goes further. It  raises  the strawman of  ‘‘achieving victory  in  Iraq’’ and it is critical of ‘‘setting an artificial  timetable  for  the withdrawal of U.S. Armed  Forces from Iraq, or immediately terminating  their deployment in Iraq,’’ policies that House  Democrats have not proposed. Nor does this  resolution define what is meant by ‘‘victory in  Iraq.’’  I want to express my support for the Iraqi  people and  this  further step  toward democracy, but I will oppose this resolution because  I  find  it offensive  that  the majority has advanced a resolution that pretends to celebrate  democracy by adding divisive and partisan  language that is clearly designed for use in a  domestic political campaign.  ",2005
1648,37,2005-12-16,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday, millions  of Iraqis went out and voted for a new, national parliament, and I applaud them for doing  so. I also commend the men and women of  the U.S. Armed Forces, who helped the Iraqi  people vote in safety. Our troops are doing a  difficult job in Iraq.  I do not favor immediate withdrawal. Opposition to immediate withdrawal is not a substitute for a clear and detailed American strategy in Iraq, nor is blindly staying the course.  What is needed is coming to terms with what  the course should be—a plan regarding completion of our presence in Iraq.  Last month, the Senate adopted an amendment  to  the Defense bill  that  requires  the  President to submit such a plan to Congress,  an amendment  I strongly support.  Indeed,  I  favor the more rigorous version of the amendment that was offered in the other body. In addition to requiring the Administration to provide  Congress with a detailed strategy in Iraq with  measurable benchmarks,  the Administration  would also provide Congress with estimated  dates  for  the phased  redeployment of U.S.  forces from Iraq as each condition is met.  Unfortunately,  the  resolution  before  the  House  is  transparently political. The House  should reject it.  ",2005
1649,37,2005-12-16,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker,  I  strongly object to the procedures under which  this  resolution  is  being  debated.  I  voted  against those procedures because the House  should have been able to have a full and free  debate and  to consider possible changes  in  the resolution.  For example, Representative LANTOS proposed that we congratulate the Iraqi people on  three national elections conducted in Iraq this  year, encourage all Americans to express support for the people of Iraq, and express thanks  to  the members of  the U.S. armed  forces  whose heroism permitted the Iraqi people to  vote  safely  in  yesterday’s  elections. That  would have been something all Members of  the House could support,  if  the Republican  leadership had permitted  that  to be considered.  Still, I will vote for the resolution that is now  before us, for several reasons.  First,  the  resolution calls yesterday’s parliamentary elections a ‘‘crucial victory for the  Iraqi people and  Iraq’s new democracy.’’  I  couldn’t agree more.  Reports are still coming  in and we won’t  know the results for some time, but it’s clear  that the day was a success in terms of high  turnout and low levels of violence. To the extent that increased Sunni participation means  a greater political role for Sunnis in the new  parliament, we could see weakened support  for  the  insurgency. And  the  Iraqi  people  should be commended  for  their courage  in  coming out to vote—not once, but three times  this year.  The resolution  then goes on  to call  for a  commitment  to  victory  in  Iraq, although  it  doesn’t define ‘‘victory.’’ I strongly suspect this  language was added, not so much to send a  positive message to our soldiers or the Iraqi  people so much as it was designed to bolster  President Bush’s  recent  speeches  in  Iraq  where the word ‘‘victory’’ looms large.  Unlike American success in World War II,  ‘‘victory’’ in Iraq cannot be measured by military success alone. This was achieved when  our troops toppled Saddam Hussein’s regime  in 2003. What we can hope for in Iraq is that  a responsible withdrawal of American  forces  can be linked to measurable benchmarks of  political stability. This means that Iraqi security  forces must be capable of providing  for  the  safety of Iraqis. It means that Iraq’s cities and  infrastructure are rebuilt and its citizens have  access to electricity and clean water. A successful withdrawal strategy means that America will no longer bear the brunt of the burden—that the U.N., other international organizations, our allies, and countries in the region  will step up to assist with the nation-building  mission in Iraq.  A successful outcome  in  Iraq  is essential  because failure in this part of the world could  lead to wider war, greater terrorism and a disaster for our national security. To be frank, it  is not so much ‘‘victory’’ that ought to concern  us so much as a need to avoid ‘‘failure.’’  Unfortunately, whether we can avoid a failure in Iraq is a question that is not completely  in our hands because only  the  Iraqis  themselves can  find  the will necessary  to  live  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:45 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H16DE5.REC H16DE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005

1663,72,2005-12-16,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, and I  want  to commend  the gentlewoman  from New York for offering it.  One can ask all 435 Members of the  House of Representatives what is the  principal  area  of  constituent  complaints that caseworkers in our local  offices deal with, and they will all say  immigration complaints, because the  immigration service legacy, as well as  the component parts that it has been  split into, has not been dealing with  these issues properly.  This is an issue that deals with immigration benefits that legal aliens are  entitled to receive. And it seems to me  that if we are the welcoming country  to legal aliens that we claim to be, we  ought  to  deal with  their  petitions  promptly and professionally. That  is  not being done, and we owe it to our  present constituents and  future constituents, as many of these people are  eligible for permanent resident status  and will eventually become citizens of  the United States, to solve the problems of the backlog in dealing with immigration benefits.  The Government Accountability Office is about to issue a report that will  deal with the effects of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to  reduce  the  immigration  application  backlog that has plagued the system  for years. This report will confirm that  this new agency, created under  the  Homeland Security Act  and  transformed from the old Immigration and  Naturalization Service, has made significant strides in reducing application  backlogs since its creation in 2003.  Nevertheless, more progress needs to  be made. The current backlog stands at  about 1 million applications for immigration benefits. Although this figure  was reduced from over 3 million applications when  the new  agency was  formed, much of this came from definitional changes which I have publicly  questioned. We must do more to challenge the Department of Homeland Security to improve. This will mean a  more professional and prompt resolution of dealing with the documents  that  legal  immigrants need to  integrate themselves into American society.

1665,72,2005-12-16,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding to me an  additional minute.  To follow up, I support very strongly  the Vela´zquez amendment, and I am  glad that the chairman and the majority support it as well. It is very important. But as I look at the bill, I find an  issue that will take a higher precedence than the problem of the backlog  in terms of our constituents and  in  terms of our congressional offices and I  think will put that far in the background in terms of things that most  bother them, because under the Alien  Smuggling and Related Offenses provision of the bill that we will be asked to  vote on, anyone who assists, encourages, directs, or induces a person to reside in or to attempt to reside in or remain in the United States, knowing or  in reckless disregard of the fact that  such person is an alien who lacks lawful authority to reside or remain in the  United States, is subject to penalties of  up to 5 years in jail if it is not for commercial purposes. If it is for commercial purposes, understandably, it would  be tougher sentences.  So when a person calls my district office and talks to my congressional staff  and says, I was here on a temporary  visa, the date passed, I have an immigration petition pending, is there anything I can do? if my office assists that  person or suggests that person go see a  lawyer and perhaps  if my assistant  does not call the Department of Homeland Security and tell them to pick  that person up, my staffer, potentially,  is subject to criminal penalties. Congressional staff do not have congressional  immunity. That means  I am  going to have to do all the casework in  my district office. I think we need a  little correction of the base bill in this  particular area of alien smuggling. We  are sweeping very widely here.  With that, I urge adoption of this  amendment.  ",2005

1668,79,2005-12-16,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 6  minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. RANGEL), the distinguished  ranking member  of  the Ways  and  Means Committee.  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2005
1669,79,2005-12-16,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  there  certainly was a lot of emotion in the  speech given by the chairman; but I  suspect in this time of the year where  so many people are concerned about  our sick, our poor and our disabled,  that rather than being moved by the  rhetoric of the Republicans, we might  take a deep breath and find out who is  on our side as Democrats.  I know that the poor and the aged  and disabled do not have much of a political voice, but somehow in this holiday season the spiritual leaders probably understand this a  little better  than some of us. These are the charitable  organizations  that  reach  out,  Catholic Charities, the Jewish Council  Against Poverty, the Protestant Council. Each and every day they run soup  kitchens and try to assist people, especially mothers that have no one in the  household to assist them  in raising  their children.  Any specialist will tell you, if you do  not give a kid the right start, you do  not give  them a chance  to get  to  school, and cut  the  resources  from  under him to get an education, it is not  just why can they not do it my way or  why did he not get an inheritance. It is  a question of where do these kids end  up.  They first end up not paying much  taxes since they do not have the talents to get a job; but worse than that,  in New York we spend $84,000 for every  kid who gets in trouble who finds himself on Ryker’s Island, and I do not  think you have to be a health specialist to know that when you cut the  ability of people to get access to health  care, they do not necessarily die right  away. More often than not, they end up  at the most expensive of expenditures,  and that is in our hospitals.  I do not know what the poor and the  disabled have ever done to the majority  or, indeed, what the moral majority,  why they would wait until Christmastime to show just how mean they can  get. Even if they cannot control this  meanness, why would they do it at a  time when they have given hundreds of  billions of dollars of tax cuts to the  very wealthy?  I am not that good spiritually, but  know my friends on the other side of  the aisle that are so concerned with  the Bible and biblical phrases, there is  one thing somewhere, and  I do not  know all of the facts as is properly recorded, but it deals with a bunch of  rich people that could not get in heaven because they had not treated the  lesser of Jesus’ brothers and sisters the  way he would want. I have never seen a  more classic example of the violation  of that spirit than what I have seen in  the last couple of weeks on this floor.  So you can raise your voice all you  want, you can scream about spending,  but it just seems to me that there are  no religious leaders that I can think of  that feel they have an obligation to  take care of those people who are in  the hospital, who are hungry, who are  without clothes, who are without food,  and certainly  the children who are  really the least powerful of all, if you  had to do it, why do you not just do  what you do in conference and come  out and say that we authorized it? But  to have this heavy blow at a time when  you are reducing the taxes on the very  rich is not only wrong, but it smacks of  being immoral.  This is the wrong thing to do. This is  the wrong time to do it, and it is something that I am confident is not in accord with the moral teachings or the  spiritual beliefs of anyone in this body.  What you are doing is saying that  you have to cut spending. Why can Iraq  not get on that list of not wanting to  spend? Why can we not just slow down  the rebuilding of Baghdad and rebuild  the health of some of our people and  the schools of some of our people? Why  can we not invest in Americans and  make them the most productive people  that we can make? Why do you pick on  the most vulnerable in Medicare, which  the other side is probably going to hit  as badly as we hit Medicaid?  What are these programs? The programs are listed as SSI. What does it  mean, you have to be blind, disabled or  aged? Medicare, you have to be old and  sick? Medicaid, you have to be poor  and sick? The programs are designed to  bring the moneys to the mothers who  have been abandoned or just for children, and the other one is education.  Is there anyone that you missed, the  sick, the poor, the young? Is there anyone else that you want to include that  programs should be cut? I might also  add, with capital gains tax cuts and  corporate dividend tax cuts, is there  anyone that is rich that you missed in  terms of not giving a tax cut?  What a  combination package you  have given to the American people and  what a time to do it. So whether you  call it Christmas or holiday seasons or  Chanukah  or whether  you  call  it  Kwanzaa, you sure picked the right  time to hit the wrong people at this  time of the year.  ",2005

1672,79,2005-12-16,Mr. MCHENRY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my colleague from Florida for yielding  me this time.  Ladies and gentlemen, I say Merry  Christmas to you. We are presenting  you a budget that the American people  can be proud of. To the Democrats, I  say, happy holidays. But I will tell you,  ladies and gentlemen of the House, my  colleagues, what we are doing here is  right for the American people.  My colleague from New York asks,  have we touched everyone in America?  Well, yes. If you live in a $2 million  house, you will not qualify for aid to  the poor. Under this budget, we pass  that reform; that if you live in a million dollar house, if you live in a $2  million house, if, heaven forbid, you  live in a $10 million house, you would  not be eligible for Medicare. You would  not be eligible for the government paying for your nursing home. That is the  type of reform that we have in this  budget. It is the right thing to do.  Beyond that, if you are a student in  college today, if you are a student in  college today, you will be eligible for  that student loan next year under this  budget. You will be eligible for that  same loan you got today. The only difference would be that the Federal Government would not be paying that loan  giver, that company that provides the  loan, we would not be paying them 9.5  percent interest. We would go back to  a market-based interest, which we all  know is somewhere around 5 percent  today. That alone would save $13 billion over 5 years.  So,  ladies  and  gentlemen  of  the  House, if you vote for this motion to  instruct, you are voting against reform; you are voting against savings;  you are voting against positive changes  that will help more Americans. And it  is the right thing to do.  Look, Mr. Speaker, this motion to instruct is something that Mr. Grinch  would be proud of. So, ladies and gentlemen, I bid you merry Christmas, and  ask that you vote against this motion  to instruct and vote for our conservative, realistic, reform-based budget.  Merry Christmas to all.

Maybe the gentleman who was just in  the well preceding me is proud of this  budget. I noticed he talked about student loans and how the students will  get the same loan they got this year.  They may get that loan, but it is going  to cost them more. In fact, what we see  in the estimates are that this budget  bill will raise the average cost to those  students or those families who are paying off those loans. The average student who borrows $17,500, and that is  what, unfortunately, the average student borrows  today,  this will  raise  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:45 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H16DE5.REC H16DE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005

1679,93,2005-12-16,Mr. SHADEGG.," Mr. Chairman, let me  begin  by  thanking  again Chairman  SENSENBRENNER for his hard work on  this legislation. I think it is important  to this country. I appreciate the openness of the debate. I also want to thank  the gentleman  from New York  (Mr.  KING), the chairman of the Homeland  Security Committee, for his work.  This  amendment  adds  two  laws,  human  smuggling  and human  trafficking, to the list of specified unlawful  activity under the Federal money laundering statute.  Mr. Chairman, under  today’s  law,  human  smuggling  and human  trafficking rings are highly sophisticated  and organized crime operations. According  to  testimony  here  in  the  United States Congress before the subcommittee of my colleague, the gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. SOUDER),  these organizations are a complete one-  stop operation.  They recruit customers from deep inside countries outside of the United  States. They arrange transportation to  the United States border. They provide  housing at the border. They then conduct the illegal aliens across the country where prearranged vehicles meet  them and transport them to a nearby  large city, often a city such as Tucson  in my State of Arizona or Phoenix or  Los Angeles.  They also provide transportation in  these cities and housing, and then they  provide travel from those cities to the  interior of this country, perhaps to  Chicago or Philadelphia or New York.  Once the illegal arrives at one of those  cities, they are met by yet another  agent of this sophisticated organization who provides transportation to a  safe house where they are met. They  are again provided housing, and they  are provided the kind of documents  that we just talked about, a fraudulent  Social  Security  card,  a  fraudulent  green card or some other documentation which will enable them to get a  job.  Often they advertise, what city do  you want to go to? What kind of job do  you want to find? Then these sophisticated operations  find  them employment in the area they are interested in.  An integral part of these sophisticated  human smuggling operations and the  human trafficking operations is money  laundering. They money  launder the  proceeds of these crimes. Yet unfortunately, at the present time, neither  human trafficking nor human smuggling, which victimize people outside of  this country and bring them here and  enslave them in some instances, neither of those crimes are predicates for  our Federal money laundering statute.  b2000  That is to say one can engage in that  crime, but that key statute of money  laundering cannot be used to get after  those people. Mr. Chairman, this simply adds those two statutes so that we  say clearly when we want to get after  these smugglers who are smuggling or  trafficking  human  beings  into  this  country, we can use our sophisticated  statutes,  including our money  laundering statute, to get at these individuals.  ",2005

1681,93,2005-12-16,Mr. SHADEGG., I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.  (Mr. SENSENBRENNER asked and  was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ,2005
1682,93,2005-12-16,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.  International  traffickers and smugglers of  human beings are the most barbaric of immigration violators. They force women and children into sexual slavery and aliens into indentured servitude. They place their human cargo  in extremely dangerous circumstances and  often abandon them and leave them to die in  the rugged terrain along much of our southwestern border.  This amendment ensures that Federal authorities can use all the powerful tools of our  money laundering statutes against the money  laundering activities  that  these persons engage in as part of their criminal enterprises.  If we can make it more difficult for them to  launder their profits, and we can more easily  seize their profits, we will be much better able  to combat this scourge. Just as money laundering by drug dealers and organized crime  demands a powerful response by law enforcement, so does money  laundering by human  traffickers and smugglers.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  ",2005
1683,93,2005-12-16,Mr.  SHADEGG.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for his support,  and I reserve the balance of my time.  The  Acting  CHAIRMAN  (Mr.  CULBERSON). Who claims time in opposition to the gentleman’s amendment?  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Chairman, I rise to claim the time in  opposition, though I will not oppose  this amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Texas  will control the time in opposition to  the amendment.  There was no objection.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.  I rise in support of this amendment,  which would add human trafficking,  human smuggling to the list of predicate acts under  the Federal money  laundering statute.  Let me just say that what Mr. SHADEGGhas just articulated is a plague on  our  society across America.  I have  worked  extensively on human  trafficking issues and see them often repeated  in  our  own  jurisdictions  in  Texas.  It  is  actually  20th-century  human bondage. And the tragedy  is  that many of  these  individuals are  women, young women, who are forced  to come to the United States and are  abused and utilized not only in areas of  prostitution but also areas of hard  work where they are not able to receive adequate compensation.  According to the State Department,  the State Department estimates between 15,000 and 20,000 people are trafficked  into the United States every  year. Worldwide  there  are  approximately 600,000 to 800,000 people trafficked  across  international  borders  every year. Victims of human  trafficking are often forced into prostitution, hard labor, child soldiering, and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:45 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00093 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H16DE5.REC H16DE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005

I respect the gentleman  from  Wisconsin’s and the gentlewoman from  Texas’ opposition to my amendment,  and you have done a great job. The  chairman does a great job in what you  do as well. But, unfortunately, we disagree on this issue.  Simply put, this bill will not be complete without my amendment in it. Our  cities and towns that lie far away from  the border need these resources to have  the same protection of law that border  towns receive.  In my State of Oklahoma, it is estimated that 40 percent of the immigrant  population is illegal. I would just like  to give you an example of what goes on  in our district and the people out in  the middle of the United States and  other places.  We had a van pulled over in my community as happens dozens of times, but  the van had 18 illegals in it. Our local  law enforcement did its job, pulled that  van over about 2 o’clock in the morning, it had five juveniles in it, 18 people,  five  juveniles under the age of  nine, but no adult or guardians. The  adults that were driving and in the van  were drinking.  They found amounts of drugs in their  pockets. They were on an admitted  smuggling load to Chicago, and the juveniles were in there. Sometimes these  juveniles, I hope they were just working in a sweat shop even though that is  bad, sometimes they are subjected to  child pornography and those kinds of  things. But our local law enforcement  did its job, called their local Immigration Customs Office, which is in Oklahoma City, and asked them, Here is the  situation. What do you want us to do?  And our local Immigration Office, do  you know what they said? Let them go.  Well, no constituent in my district  that was driving without insurance and  drinking or something like that which  is wrong was pulled over, they would be  arrested. We let them go. We need to  stop doing  this. This  is absolutely  crazy. And it should not just apply to  border towns. This  is happening all  across our country, and I am standing  up  for  the  constituents across  this  country. It is very important.  ",2005

1688,107,2005-12-16,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for his effort at pulling  together this bill. Reforming immigration in this  Nation—and reinforcing the borders, as I have  advocated for over a year and a half—is a difficult proposition.  However,  the gentleman  from Wisconsin  and those that are in support of this bill do not  seem to understand the complexities of border  and  immigration policy. The bill before us  today would do little to solve the immigration  problem, and it is not what we need to reform  immigration policy and  to reinforce our borders.  Any effort by Congress to truly reform immigration and protect our borders must address  the  root  causes of  illegal  immigration. As  President Bush has stated, people come  to  the country to do the jobs Americans do not  want to do. We must understand that it is our  labor market that draws them to the U.S., and  we must address how the U.S. could absorb  the economic blow of losing this part of our  labor market that keeps prices artificially low  for consumers. Are businesses ready to pay  high wages to agriculture workers? Are Americans ready to absorb that cost and pay higher  prices for their produce?  An honest policy discussion  is needed  to  address  the complete problem—our broken  immigration system and the needs of our labor  market.  Although my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle claim this bill will secure our borders,  it does nothing of the sort. Nothing in this bill  guarantees funding for detention facilities, Border Patrol agents, immigration judges or prosecutors.  The single most important thing we can do  in Congress  is  invest  in homeland security.  However, our experience has been this: Numerous Members of Congress put forth ideas  about how to fix border security, but funding  these ideas has been impossible.  Let’s use 2005 as an example. One year  ago,  the  9/11  Commission  did  what  Congress’s current majority could not do: It investigated the events leading up to the attacks  on the United States, and made solid suggestions to the Nation about how the Government  could prevent similar attacks in the future.  On the issues of Border Patrol agents and  detention beds, the 9/11 Commission said the  very least the United States needed to do was  add 2,000 agents annually—for 10 years—and  8,000  detention  beds  annually. Congress  agreed, and passed the bill overwhelmingly.  How did the President and Congress react  when it came time to pay for it all? The President’s budget proposed  funding 200 Border  Patrol agents this year—that’s 1,800 short of  the least we should do—and 1,900 detention  beds—that’s  6,100  short  of  the  least we  should do.  Congress acted a  little better, passing an  emergency spending bill and a spending bill  for homeland security that netted us a total of  1,500 Border Patrol agents—still 500 short of  9/11  Commission  recommendations—and  4,250 detention beds—still 3,750 short of 9/11  Commission recommendations.  We are playing a shell game with our border  security and, by extension, our national security. On the one hand, every single elected official is for more border security. Yet, the leadership in Congress does not have the political  courage to pay for it.  This is what always hangs us up. There’s  no money and no political will to change the  equation.  The American people deserve an honest  debate on how to protect our homeland. All of  us in Congress understand the world changed  after September 11. For that reason, we must  put forth a solution to bring out of the shadows  the 8  to 11 million people who are  in  this  country now, paying  taxes and doing hard  labor and have an honest discussion, absent  the politics.  ",2005
1689,107,2005-12-16,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Chairman, the Congress has been negligent in dealing with the  challenge of border security, homeland security and immigration policy reform. We must do  what  is necessary  to protect our homeland  and implement comprehensive immigration reform. It is time to address these issues in a  meaningful way.  Unfortunately,  this  legislation  fails  to meet  the test. This bill does contain some important  provisions  that will enhance border security.  Indeed, the bill that emerged from the Homeland Security Committee was one that I could  basically support. Unfortunately, the Judiciary  Committee put politics over policy and added  a number of highly objectionable provisions.  Some of these provisions will turn a number of  well-intentioned and law abiding citizens into  criminals and felons. Other provisions penalize  many individuals who have come to this country lawfully but have, through no fault of their  own,  become  ensnared  in  a  bureaucratic  snafu with  the Citizenship and  Immigration  Services where if someone misses a deadline  by a day in changing their visa category they  can be prosecuted  for unlawful presence.  Moreover, visitors  from other countries who  are here on tourist visas but cannot return to  their country within  the visa  timeframe because of a natural disaster or the outbreak of  civil war will be made into criminals.  This bill is also flawed in a number of other  respects. First, it creates the dangerous illusion that we are addressing the most pressing  homeland security issues, when we are not.

1690,149,2005-12-16,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to express my support for the  motion to instruct conferees on H.R.  1815, the DOD authorization bill that  was offered earlier today by the distinguished ranking member of the Armed  Services Committee (Mr. SKELTON).  Mr. Speaker, for over 3 years now,  the Congress has failed to oversee the  administration’s policy regarding the  detention of enemy combatants. We  know very  little about  the criteria  used to designate an American as an  enemy combatant, even less about the  due process afforded foreign nationals  in Guantanamo and almost nothing  about the reported existence of clandestine detention facilities operated by  the U.S. Government.  The motion that passed the House  overwhelmingly  today  instructs  the  conferees to insist on a Senate-passed  provision that would require the DNI  to submit to Congress a report on any  clandestine prison or detention prison  currently or formerly operated by the  U.S. Government, regardless of  location, where the detainees in the global  war on terrorism are or were being  held.  The conferees should retain this important provision in the Defense Authorization Bill.  f  REPORT  ON  RESOLUTION  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF  MOTIONS  TO  SUSPEND  THE  RULES  Mr. SESSIONS, from the Committee  on Rules, submitted a privileged report  (Rept.

DOC.  NO. 109–76)  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message  from  the President  of  the United  States; which was read and, together  with the accompanying papers, without  objection, referred to the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence and  ordered to be printed:  To the Congress of the United States:  The robust and effective sharing of  terrorism information is vital to protecting Americans and the Homeland  from terrorist attacks. To ensure that  we succeed in this mission, my Administration is working to implement the  Information  Sharing  Environment  (ISE) called for by section 1016 of the  Intelligence Reform  and  Terrorism  Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA). The  ISE is intended to enable the Federal  Government and our State, local, tribal, and private sector partners to share  appropriate  information  relating  to  terrorists,  their  threats, plans, networks,  supporters,  and  capabilities  while, at the same time, respecting the  information privacy and other  legal  rights of all Americans.  Today, I issued a set of guidelines  and requirements that represent a significant step in the establishment of  the ISE. These guidelines and requirements, which are consistent with the  provisions of section 1016(d) of IRTPA,  are set forth in a memorandum to the  heads of executive departments and  agencies. The guidelines and requirements also address collateral  issues  that are essential to any meaningful  progress on  information  sharing.  In  sum, these guidelines will:  Clarify roles and authorities across  executive departments and agencies;  Implement  common  standards and  architectures  to  further  facilitate  timely and effective information sharing;  Improve  the Federal Government’s  terrorism  information  sharing  relationships with State, local, and tribal  governments, the private sector, and  foreign allies;  Revamp  antiquated  classification  and marking systems, as they relate to  sensitive but unclassified information;  Ensure that information privacy and  other  legal rights of Americans are  protected in the development and implementation of the ISE; and  Ensure that departments and agencies promote a culture of information  sharing  by  assigning  personnel  and  dedicating resources to terrorism information sharing.  The guidelines build on the strong  commitment that my Administration  and the Congress have already made to  strengthening information sharing, as  evidenced by Executive Orders 13311 of  July 27, 2003, and 13388 of October 25,  2005, section 892 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the USA PATRIOT  Act, and sections 1011 and 1016 of the  IRTPA. While much work has been  done by  executive departments and  agencies, more is required to fully develop and implement the ISE.  To lead this national effort, I designated the Program Manager (PM) responsible  for  information  sharing  across the Federal Government, and directed that the PM and his office be  part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and that the  L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:45 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00149 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H16DE5.REC H16DE5         ",2005

1693,156,2005-12-16,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Thank you, Mr.  Speaker. And again, I appreciate the  privilege to address you, Mr. Speaker,  and in turn, address the House of Representatives.  This has been a huge week here on  the floor of the House of Representatives. We processed a lot of legislation  this week. Much of it has been legislation that has been in the works for a  number of years. And I think what I  will try to do is maybe unravel this  coming backwards across the way we  passed it and work my way back into  the legislation a little bit.  But I want to take up first the immigration reform and point out that in  this debate that we heard today in this  resolution that came  forward, which  was H. Res. 612, the continuous message  from the other side was about  being anti-immigrant, anti-immigrant.  But  it confuses  the difference between an immigrant and an illegal immigrant. In fact, I know of no one in  this Congress that is anti-immigrant. I  know of many Members of this Congress that are pro the rule of law.  And that is the distinction that we  need to draw the line with. And I take  us back to where would be if we went  back even 10 years, but say go back 25  years, in a time when we did not have  very much illegal immigration. It was  a smaller percentage of our overall  population; it was smaller in numbers,  smaller in percentage, and it was not a  very significant problem. It was something that was somewhat manageable  back then.  And back in that period of time, if we  had been able to control our borders  and watched as we needed more employees in certain sectors of the economy, we would have seen a number of  things happen that would have resolved  this need that we keep hearing from  business about labor.  They say that if we deported all of  the illegals, our economy would collapse, and we cannot get along without  them when perhaps 4 percent of our  workforce  in America  is an  illegal  workforce. And if we lose 4 percent and  retain 96 percent, I cannot believe that  this resilient country could not find a  way to bounce back from that and accommodate the difference.  So I take us back 25 years and ask,  what would we do if we respected the  rule of law? What would we do if we  had borders that were controlled? How  would we adjust to demands in a growing economy  if  illegal  labor, cheap  labor that pours in from overseas just  were not available?  What if the United States of America, instead of being a large portion of  an entire continent, what if we were an  island? What if you drew the line on  the 49th parallel on the north and our  southern border on the south and envisioned the United States sitting out  alone where illegal labor does not flow  across our borders just because of the  jobs magnet but in fact has to find an  expensive way of transportation to get  across a broad ocean?  b2330  Think, for example, of a country like  Australia that finds itself in that kind  of a circumstance. I take you back to a  policy that they had up until 1971. Actually, they did not have a very good  name for it. They called it White Australia, and some would be embarrassed  about the name for that now. But that  was the phrase that they used to describe their immigration policy, which  is they were advancing the idea of European descendents populating the continent of Australia.  In fact, I graduated from high school  in 1967, and I remember during those  years that I was in college, I saw advertisements come from Australia saying  this is a great place to move to. We  really need you to come down here.  There  is a wealth of opportunity  in  Australia. And I thought about it. And  so that advertisement that was there  was because they needed more people  to grow their economy.  In about 1971, they gave up on this  mission  to  some  degree,  and  they  changed their policy to allow immigrants to come in from Southeast Asia.  Now, how does this work politically?  We can learn from these lessons here in  the United States of America, and that  is that it was big business that wanted  the labor to come in, and it was labor  unions that wanted to keep the labor  out because they understood something  in Australia as far as back as 1971 that  there was a law of supply and demand.  That law of supply and demand seems  to be missing from the rationale of the  people who oppose enforcement of our  rule of law with regard to immigration.  They do not seem to understand that  when we have an oversupply of labor,  that drives the price down and that  labor  is a commodity,  like where  I  come from, corn and beans or cattle  and hogs, or gold or oil if you come  from another part of the world, or currency. It fluctuates in the marketplace  according to supply and demand.

1697,177,2005-12-16,Mr.  INHOFE.," Mr. President,  I  returned 2 days ago from Iraq. There was  an article in yesterday’s Hill magazine  that was erroneous—there will be a  correction printed—where  they  inaccurately stated the number of times I  have been over to Iraq. It has actually  been 10 times. I have been doing this  not because I am a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, but because I believe it is our constitutional  responsibility to see firsthand that our  guys over there are getting the equipment they need to prosecute the war,  and they have been.  I want to share with you what happened the first of this week because  even though the vote took place yesterday, on Thursday, the vote for the  Iraqi  security  forces  actually  took  place on Monday and Tuesday. We had  a chance to go up there and visit with  them.  The interesting point is, we saw this  coming. There have been a lot of politicians coming back and talking about  how bad things are over there. I can’t  figure out where they get their information because as we have been approaching these elections over the last  few months, we have noticed the IED  incidents have been down 30 percent  and suicide bombs have been down 70  percent.  There is a road that goes from where  we get off the C–130s to go into the  Green Zone. Mr. President, you have  been there. We were averaging about 10  terrorist incidents on that road each  week up until June. We haven’t had  one since June. So we see all these  good things are happening, and then  the unexpected quality of the training  we are getting for the Iraqi security  forces. These guys right now—and I  think this is significant because people  keep asking, What is the exit strategy?  I can tell you what I believe. One Senator believes we are going to be out.  Right now there are 214,000 Iraqi soldiers who are trained and equipped. At  the end of this month, while we are  drawing down—we are drawing down  probably  15,000  to  20,000  of  ours  troops—they are going to increase to  220,000. By the end of 2006, it is anticipated they will be at 300,000. The goal  is to get 10 divisions of Iraqi security  forces. Ten divisions of Iraqi security  forces equal 325,000 troops. That will  happen by July of 2007.  In terms of the way we are  functioning now, we will be out of there,  but  there will  still be  some  troops  there. We still have troops in Kosovo  and in Bosnia, but the heavy lifting  will be over. They will be taking care  of themselves.  I see the incredible courage of these  people. Up in Fallujah 3 nights ago, I  had all of the Iraqi security forces that  had voted that day come in. They were  all rejoicing, and I said to them—this  is kind of  funny.  I  said  to  them,  through an  interpreter: When  is  it  going to be that you are going to be  able to be on your own without our  support? Is that going to be in the near  future?  And they said: No, no—which broke  my heart when I heard this. Then I  found out, in the Iraqi language, ‘‘yes’’  means  ‘‘na’am.’’ So they are saying,  ‘‘Yes, yes,’’ and when they shake their  head this way, it also means  ‘‘yes.’’  Anyway, a little advice in case that  happens to anyone.  These people are ready. They are so  proud of the level of training they have  had. Keep in mind, this is in the Sunni  triangle. These are the Sunnis who are  supposed to dislike us.  Several weeks ago, I was there and I  met General Mahdi, who is in charge of  the Iraqi security forces in Fallujah.  He had been in charge—under Saddam  Hussein he was a brigade commander.  He hated Americans until he started  working with the Marines. He said he  learned to love the Marines so much  that when they rotated them out, they  all got together and they cried. That  guy right now, General Mahdi, is now  over the eastern one-third of the entire  city of Baghdad. We do not have our  military there. It is all under Iraqi security. We have half of the city under  security now. It is going to be up to 75  percent in a very short period of time.  I think, when we see the successes—  and even if that were not true, if one  stops and realizes the bloody regime of  Saddam Hussein, yes, the targets for  the terrorists right now are not Americans, they are Iraqis, and they are killing some of the Iraqis, but when one  stops and puts it on a chart, during the  10 years that Saddam Hussein had his  bloody regime, on a monthly basis he  was torturing to death more people  than the terrorists are killing today.  When one looks at the way that they  have done it, the forms of torture, include gouging out of eyes, severe beatings, electric shocks—there is a testimonial here about a 3-month-old baby  girl who was taken, and they gouged  her eyes out  in  front of the  father,  smashed her head and broke it open  against a concrete wall.  There is a lot of talk on the other  side of this issue about prisoner abuse.  We do not have prisoner abuse. The  documentation  is  right  here  about  what  they do with  their prisoners.  They will put them  in shredders. If  they are lucky, they will shred their  head first. If they are unlucky, they  will put their  feet  in there. This  is  what has been happening over there,  but it is all over now, and they are in  charge of their own destiny.  I have enjoyed so much visiting with  the members of Parliament who were  going to be up for election. This would  have been on Wednesday, and  they  were going to be up the next day. One  lady was quite outspoken and quite  negative in terms of what her people  were saying to her. I said: Did it ever  occur to you 5 years ago that there  would be an opportunity for a woman  to serve in Parliament, let alone to  talk the way you are talking? She  stopped and said: You know, I think  that is right.  So we are seeing such a change now  in  the attitudes. The polls  look  so  good. The polls are showing that 70 percent of the people in Iraq are appreciative of the Americans being there.  They want them to stay and get out  when they are able to stand up on their  own.  I met with the election commission,  and to handle the election the way  they did was totally unprecedented. We  could  never  have  predicted  how  smoothly things would go. We talked  to the people, and I want to particularly pay tribute to IFES, the International Foundation of Electrical Systems. They have done a great job. They  had people on the ground, and they  have truly been able to conduct an  election that  is actually comparable  and better than many other mature  countries, maturing  democracies.  It  has been a great success. I am rejoicing  with all the people of Iraq today and  with the people of America.  Lastly, I pay tribute to the brave  people of Iraq who for the third time  this year have gone to the polls  in  record number to vote for a brighter  and more democratic future in Iraq.  The early reports indicate that across  the 18 provinces of Iraq, Iraqis again  turned out in massive numbers to vote  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:03 Dec 17, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A16DE6.002 S16DEPT1 ",2005
1698,184,2005-12-16,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, shortly,  we will complete legislative business  and adjourn for the year. Senators will  leave to spend the holidays with our  families. Senators will travel to the  comfort of our homes.  But there are still those in the gulf  region who do not have homes.  Hurricane Katrina struck almost 4  months ago. We cannot, in good conscience, conclude our action  for the  year without passing tax relief for the  gulf region.  The legislation before us today is a  good bill. We must pass it today.  In September,  I was pleased  that  Congress  could  come  together  and  quickly pass emergency tax relief for  victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Prior to passing that legislation, I  promised that I would work with my  colleagues to draft a long-term tax relief package. And that is what we did.  We worked to create legislation that  would help rebuild homes and businesses. We worked to create legislation  that would pump money  into  local  economies. And we worked to create  legislation that would help distressed  working families.  We must come together again. We  must pass this legislation today.  On November 18th, the Senate passed  the tax reconciliation bill. We included  Hurricane tax relief. We included Alternative Minimum Tax relief. And we  included more than a dozen important  tax provisions that expire on December  31st, including the Work Opportunity  Tax Credit and the Research and Development Tax Credit.  With the help of many, Chairman  GRASSLEYand I fit all of that legislation within  the  constraints  of  the  budget resolution’s instructions.  But the House did not take up our  bill. Instead, the House passed hurricane relief and Alternative Minimum  Tax relief outside of the budget reconciliation process. Then the next day,  the House passed a tax reconciliation  bill.  Why did the House need three bills to  achieve what the Senate succeeded in  passing in one bill?  The reason is simple. The reason is  the capital gains and dividends tax cut.  I am disappointed in the House. I am  disappointed that Congress could not  pass all the important tax relief that  the Senate did in one bill.  And that is why we have the legislation before us today, the House hurricane tax relief bill.  The  amendment  that  Chairman  and I have crafted to this  bill recognizes that to revitalize the  gulf region, the region must have a  strong economy. We must encourage  individuals to return. And that means  that there must be jobs for them to return to. This  legislation gives businesses help to create those jobs.  We would provide bonus depreciation.  We would increase small business expensing limits. We would also provide  new authority for tax-favored private  activity and mortgage bonds.  We would also extend to victims of  Hurricanes Rita and Wilma some of the  tax relief that we provided to victims  of Hurricane Katrina  in September.  This  includes penalty-free early tax-  free withdrawals  from pensions and  IRAs. We would allow victims to fully  deduct casualty losses. And we would  remove the cap on allowable corporate  charitable contributions made  in response to the hurricanes.  And thanks to the hard work and persistence of  the good Senators  from  Florida and Texas, we have been able  to forge an agreement to provide extra  low-income housing benefits  for  the  Rita and Wilma hurricane zones. My  good friend from Florida, Senator NELSON, has made the convincing case that  these devastated areas need more assistance with low-income housing, and  I am pleased to say this bill will be providing that very help.  The substitute that Senator GRASSLEYand I offer today provides $8 billion  GRASSLEY in tax relief for the gulf region. We  take the House bill, but we provide additional tax relief for employers and  students to encourage people to return  to the gulf region.  One item of particular importance to  me is tax relief to employers who continued to pay their workers after the  hurricanes struck. Employers located  in the Katrina, Rita, and Wilma disaster zones will be able to take up to a  $2,400 tax credit on wages paid to employees during the period the business  was shut down. These business owners  have tapped into their savings to help  out their workers. They deserve tax relief. We provided this relief in our first  bill, but it was limited to small employers. I have always felt and argued  strongly that any employer that helps  out their workers while the business is  shut down deserves this assistance. I  am very pleased that we were able to  eliminate this cap, and extend this relief for the Rita and Wilma zones as  well.  Another priority  item  for me  is a  provision to encourage students to return to the gulf region. Many colleges  and universities were  forced to shut  down after Hurricane Katrina and students have been scattered across the  country. To encourage these students,  and new students as well, to come back  to the gulf region, we double the Hope  Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax  credits.  Students  from  around  the  country would be able to take a credit  up  to  $4,000  for  tuition,  room and  board, books, and  fees  for attending  college in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. I was very pleased that  we could include this benefit in our  Senate version and that we have retained it in this substitute. I think it  will be extremely valuable to the colleges and universities who have really  suffered from this hurricane.  One further priority item for me is  the additional $1 billion in new markets  tax  credit  authority  for  the  Katrina zone. I fought to get this credit in our Senate version because I am  convinced  this program works. The  program provides access to capital for  small businesses through established  community development entities. Entities with a significant mission of rebuilding in the hurricane zone may access  these additional  tax credits  in  order to help these struggling businesses rebuild. These businesses may  not be able to utilize some of the other  tax benefits in the bill, but access to  capital will help many of them stay in  business and stay in the zone.  One last item that I would like to  highlight is an employer credit for providing housing for workers and their  families. My good  friend  from Louisiana, Senator LANDRIEU, offered this  provision during our floor debate last  month. And if I could just take a moment to point out to our colleagues the  tremendous work she has done on this  bill. She has truly been our compass  during these negotiations and has been  essential in conveying the true plight  of her constituents.

1700,198,2005-12-16,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, permit  me to interject very briefly just to correct some of the misstatements which  have been made that crop up again and  again. This bill is not understood. This  bill is not understood by Senators who  are making  representations  on  the  floor which are not correct. I don’t suggest they are doing it deliberately, but  they don’t know the bill.  The argument has been made that  the recipient of a national security letter has to tell the FBI the identity of  his lawyer. That is simply not true.  The conference report reads:  In no circumstance shall a person be required to inform the Director of the FBI or  such designee that the person intends to consult an attorney to obtain legal advice or  legal assistance.  The  representation  is made  here  again and again that in section 215,  there does not have to be a connection  to a terrorism investigation or someone suspected of being a terrorist. The  conference report does add a provision  to the three criteria for foreign power,  but the court has to make a determination on a factual showing that there is  a terrorism investigation that does involve foreigners and that records are  sought from another person, albeit not  identified with one of the three criteria, in order to carry on the investigation.  Again and again, the essence of the  protection of civil rights traditionally  has been that you interpose an impartial magistrate between the policeman  and the citizen, and that protection is  given under section 215.  The argument has been made repeatedly that under the national security  letter, there is no review. That is simply not the case. The recipient goes to  a  lawyer who can challenge the national security letter in court and have  it quashed, eliminated, dispensed with,  on a showing that it is unreasonable.  If you get to the national security  issue, then it is different with respect  to a bad-faith showing. There is judicial  review beforehand on  the very  broad  term  of  being  unreasonable,  which is a hallmark of American law in  auto accident cases and antitrust cases  every time you turn around. The reasonable standard is traditional under  our law.  I yield to the Senator from Arizona,  who has requested 2 minutes, and he  can take whatever time he chooses.  ",2005

1702,198,2005-12-16,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President,  I  compliment  the Senator  from Pennsylvania on a job exceedingly well done in  trying to find a way that we can reauthorize the PATRIOT Act, with very  emotional feelings on all sides of the  issue and working through very difficult  compromises,  especially  after  the conference committee in which it  would appear to me—and I think even  our  colleagues who oppose  the bill  would agree—the end result is probably  about 80 percent Senate product and  about 20 percent House product.  This is a defining moment. There are  no more compromises to be made, no  more extensions of time. The bill is  what it is now, and it is very unfair and  unrealistic to expect that either the  House of Representatives would concede to the Senate position 100 percent  or that the President would do so after  what he has now said. As a result, we  are going to have an opportunity to  vote yes or no.  One of my colleagues said this is not  a partisan issue. If 90-plus percent of  the Democrats vote against cloture and  90-plus percent of the Republicans vote  for cloture, it is hard to argue that is  not partisan. It is true that this should  not be a partisan  issue, but having  worked through it to the extent we  have, and having had the very strong  support  in the House of Representatives with over I think it was 44 Democrats in the House of Representatives  voting for reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, it seems to me that the  Senate would do well to also try to act  here in a more bipartisan way and not  to have a partisan vote.  We need to reauthorize the PATRIOT  Act. It is the tool for our law enforcement and intelligence agencies to help  protect us from terrorists. Just as we  send our men and women into battle  with good training and equipment, we  have to do the same thing with law enforcement and our intelligence agencies. If we deny them the key tool, the  PATRIOT Act, they are not going to be  able to do their job to protect us. And  there is no more time to stretch this  out with maybes or  let’s negotiate  more, and so on. This act will expire on  December 31. My colleagues either vote  yes to reauthorize it or no, not to reauthorize it. There is no middle ground.  I will say this as directly and seriously as I can. I doubt there is anyone  in  this Chamber  today who would  argue with  the proposition  that we  needed to tear down the wall between  the law enforcement and intelligence  agencies. The PATRIOT Act does that.  The wall goes right back up again on  January 1. Is that what we want? God  help us if there is some kind of terrorist attack when we are not protected by the PATRIOT Act and the  act could have enabled our law enforcement or our intelligence people to help  protect us. We will have to answer for  that if we don’t vote to extend the PATRIOT Act.  I implore my colleagues to put partisanship aside, to consider the  fact  that not everybody can get 100 percent  of what they want, to recognize that  the House of Representatives has made  a tremendous concession to us, whether you talk about the period of time,  the  section  215 concessions, and, of  course, the sunset concessions.  I  found  it very difficult myself to  sign  the  conference  report because,  frankly, we had made it so difficult for  law enforcement to do  its  job with  some of the compromises that were  made, but they were made in order to  achieve a consensus on which we could  vote. Now we find that consensus in  jeopardy.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to  think very carefully about what  they are about to do.  If they vote  against cloture,  they are voting  to  allow the PATRIOT Act to expire. We  will not have that tool available for  law enforcement and intelligence agencies to protect us from terrorists. Is  that what you want?  I daresay the  American people will hold us accountable if anything happens and we are  not able to reauthorize the PATRIOT  Act.  ",2005

1704,198,2005-12-16,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, before  the Senator from Arizona sits down, I  wish to ask him a question to further  elaborate upon a point he has made.  The President has said that he is not  going to sign an extension of 3 months  or, by  implication, any extension of  time. So if the conference report is not  adopted so the President can sign it,  there will be no PATRIOT Act in effect  after December 31.  The Senator from Arizona has talked  about the wall.  The Senator was on the Intelligence  Committee the day he came to the Senate. He was elected in 1994. I chaired  the  Intelligence  Committee  of  the  104th Congress. He has been on it. He  has been on Judiciary. He has been a  leader on this measure. As the Senator  said, he had trouble signing the conference report. By the way, I thank  him for signing the conference report.  Without his signature, we could not  have filed it.  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:03 Dec 17, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G16DE6.027 S16DEPT1 ",2005

Without Lula Davis’ help and people  such as Marty and other  folks who  guide us through how we get things  done, none of us would be in the same  place, as well as the Parliamentarians,  the clerks, and others.

We  met to share ideas on an agenda for  New Jersey and America and I followed  his progress closely. I was impressed by  what I saw in JON’s service in the Senate, where he has earned respect and  affection. JONcame from great success  in the world of finance and industry,  but he is able to communicate with ordinary people, as well.  Some people arrive here and immediately head for the headlines. But that  isn’t JONCORZINE’s style. JONis a committed ‘‘workhorse,’’ who works long  hours with high intensity. He doesn’t  have a lot of flash, but he is very effective.  He came to Washington for one reason: to serve the people of New Jersey.  Now, with some sorrow on my part, he  is leaving us here for the same reason:  to help New Jersey even more directly.  Even before the terrorist attacks on  9/11, work had been done to strengthen  security at our chemical plants.

1708,212,2005-12-16,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. President, I want  to  share my  thoughts  about  JON  CORZINE. He had a great record at Goldman Sachs. I didn’t really know he was  a farm boy. That is something Senator  DURBINadded to the mix. I think I had  heard that but had forgotten it. He was  successful in the financial world in an  extraordinary way. He was a marine.  Of course, every marine I have known  has been shaped by that, and I believe  Senator Zell Miller wrote a book saying that everything he ever needed to  know he learned in the Marine Corps,  or something to that effect.  JONCORZINEhas been an active Member of the Senate. I remember the time  we spent together in Montgomery, AL,  on a civil rights trip. We were at the  church  that Martin  Luther  King  preached in on Dexter Avenue, the Dexter Avenue Church. We had a discussion at that time about Rosa Parks,  whom we have just honored and who  recently passed away. At that very  site, Martin Luther King led the efforts  of the bus boycott that ended the concept that a person must go to the back  of the bus because of the color of their  skin. JONCORZINEdidn’t have to go to  Montgomery, but he was interested in  those issues and he believed strongly in  equality and civil rights.  Senator CORZINE has been a strong  advocate for the Democratic Party and  its principles, heading  its campaign  committee. We didn’t agree on those  issues, but he was always courteous  and professional. I cannot remember a  single harsh word that we have had. In  fact, I cannot remember him having a  harsh word with any other Senators.  I have enjoyed the opportunity to  know JONCORZINEand to gain respect  for him. I wish him every success as  Governor of the  important State of  New Jersey. That will be a challenge,  but he has the gift and ability necessary to be successful in that job.  ",2005
1709,212,2005-12-16,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to congratulate and bid farewell  to my  friend  and  colleague,  JON  CORZINE.  Our world has changed quite drastically since JON first joined the Senate. It has been an honor to work with  him on the many issues we were forced  to confront following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We will  miss JON’s leadership and determination on behalf of his constituents in  New Jersey and the American people.  While JONhas served in the Senate  for a relatively short period of time, he  leaves an important legacy of leadership on issues ranging from protecting  our homeland to crafting  legislation  that stabilized our financial markets.  Rarely in this body does one Senator  see the enactment one of their first  bills introduced as a freshman Member.  But JONdid just that when he called  for mandatory Federal  standards  to  protect our Nation’s chemical plants  and saw that become law.  When the entire corporate and financial community was rocked by pervasive accounting scandals, JONwas instrumental  in crafting extraordinary  changes to accounting oversight that  stabilized confidence  in our markets  when they were teetering. He recognized that Americans were at risk, and  he worked tirelessly on their behalf, a  legacy that will last well past his last  day here in the Capitol.  JONalso brought to the Senate an appreciation  of  open  and  accountable  Government. He saw security and accountability as going hand in hand, a  way for citizens to know what their  chosen representatives are doing to ensure the health and safety of their own  neighborhoods and  communities. He  recognized  the need  to balance  the  ever-changing need for security with  the everlasting principles of openness  that make our democracy the strongest in the world. I was pleased to work  with him to protect the Freedom of Information Act which the current administration has sought to weaken at  every turn of the road.  As further testament to JON’s leadership and determination, he will certainly be remembered for his work to  secure an end to the terrible genocide  that the world has witnessed in western Sudan. As the ranking member of  the Foreign Operations Subcommittee,  I can personally attest that JONrepeatedly brought the reality of this terrible  tragedy to the attention of all of us. He  knew that the solution would not be  Democratic or Republican. Instead, he  reached across the aisle, demanded a  call for action, and spoke eloquently  for those without a voice.  I will miss my friend JONCORZINE  here in the Senate. I have enjoyed the  time we shared working together  in  this body. Marcelle and I wish him all  the best as he moves on to the new and  exciting challenges that await him in  Trenton. His service to the American  people in the United States Senate has  been selfless. His departure is a loss for  the United States Senate but a great  gain for the citizens of New Jersey.  ",2005

1718,226,2005-12-16,Mr. BURR.," Mr. President, we will  learn tonight that being No. 1 doesn’t  mean that you win, and being the largest doesn’t mean you are the best. In  fact, North Carolina pork chops are  better than Iowa pork chops, and North  Carolina football is, in most cases, as  good if not better than Iowa football.  I commend the Northern Iowa Panthers. They have had a miraculous season. They deserve to be in the championship game based on how they performed in the second half of the season.  Appalachian State was ranked fifth  by the Sporting News and fourth by  ESPN/USA Today  in the I-AA polls.  Appalachian has a record of 11–3, and  they have reached the I-AA semifinals  now for the third time. They did it in  1987, 2000, and now in 2005. But they  have never reached the championship  game until this year.  This  is a magical year  for Appalachian State. Over 10,000 of my constituents will make the trek today to  Chattanooga, TN, for tonight’s football  game. I remind my good friend, Senator HARKIN, that almost all of the  tickets turned back in by the Northern  Iowa  Panthers were  purchased  by  North Carolina constituents who will  be at that game.  Appalachian State advanced to the  championship game with a 29–23 victory over rival Furman University. Appalachian took the lead with 2 minutes  17 seconds left, with an 11-play, 67-yard  drive led by backup quarterback Trey  Elder, who was filling in for a starting  quarterback Ritchie Williams. They  held  off  a  last-minute  threat  and  picked up a fumble by Furman and ran  it back to Furman’s 1-yard line, where  that game ended.  Two of the team’s three losses were  to I-A teams—Kansas University and  the  tenth-ranked LSU Tigers. The  Charlotte Observer named the Mountaineers the most successful college  football program in the State over the  past 20 years.  Among their famous alumni are Dallas  Cowboys  linebacker  Dexter  Coakley,  and  former  Redskins  runningback John Settles.  Coach Jerry Moore is the winningest  coach in Southern Conference history,  with a string of 16 winning seasons in  17 years, with a record of 139–67. This is  his 13th playoff appearance as a head  coach.  Coach Moore  perfected  his  coaching skills as an assistant under  our colleague in the House, Congressman Tom Osborne.  When Appalachian wins  tonight’s  showdown, it will be the first time a  university  from  the State of North  Carolina has ever won a national football championship.  Senator HARKINdoesn’t need to take  my word for it or the sports reporters  or the commentators opining on the  success of Coach Moore and his Mountaineers. Senator HARKINneeds to go  no further than his own backyard to  find someone who can attest to Jerry  Moore’s ability to prepare the Mountaineers for tonight’s game. That is because Coach Moore counts as one of his  closest friends a man synonymous with  Iowa football—former Hawkeyes head  coach, Hayden Fry, with whom Jerry  Moore started his coaching career at  SMU.  Mr. President, Appalachian  State  University was started as a teachers  college in 1899. Its enrollment is slightly over 14,000 students. It is the sixth  largest State university in our university system in North Carolina. It has  one of the highest graduation rates of  student athlete football players in the  State, and a few years ago it ranked  only behind Duke in that distinction.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Northern Iowa Panthers. I congratulate  Chancellor  Peacock  and  Coach Moore but, more importantly,  these two teams who have reached the  final championship game tonight.

1719,233,2005-12-16,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, I  applaud the sponsors of this bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women  Act for their tireless leadership in the  campaign to end the abuse of women.  In particular, I thank them for their  foresight  in  incorporating the International Marriage Broker Regulation  Act of 2005 ‘‘IMBRA’’ as one of its subtitles. This important piece of legislation, which I introduce with Senator  MARIACANTWELL in the Senate, is intended to address Congress’ concerns  about a significant and growing problem:  the high  incidence  of  violent  abuse of foreign women brought to this  country  as  fiance´es  or  spouses  by  American  men  whom  they  meet  through  for-profit  international marriage  brokers  ‘‘IMBs,’’  commonly  known as ‘‘mail-order bride’’ agencies.  After learning from the Tahirih Justice Center and other front-line experts  about  the  terrible circumstances  in  which many of these women find themselves, I convened a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  in  July 2004 to call attention to the abuse  and exploitation of women and their  children through this industry. Since it  comes as a great surprise to many people that such agencies actually exist in  the modem day, that are legal in this  country, and that they are on the rise,  not the decline, I want to share some  further background that will explain  why it is so important that Congress  has acted today to compel the industry  and its clients to clean up their act.  First, this is an increasing problem.  The IMB industry has exploded in recent years, greatly facilitated by the  Internet. According to statistics from  the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  Services, an  estimated one-third  to  one-half of all foreign fiance´es admitted  to  the U.S. each year—9,500  to  14,500 women in 2004 alone—and many  thousand more admitted foreign wives,  have met  their American husbands  through IMBs. The number of foreign  fiance´es admitted to  the U.S. more  than doubled between 1998 and 2002, and  continues to climb.  Second, the  industry bears significant responsibility for women’s vulnerability to abuse, and has done little if  anything on its own initiative to safeguard them. Over a half-decade ago,  the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service concluded in a report to  Congress that,  ‘‘with the burgeoning  number of unregulated  international  matchmaking organizations and  clients using their services, the potential  for abuse  in mail-order marriages  is  considerable.’’ The INS study further  noted  that American men who use  IMBs tend to seek relationships with  women whom they feel they can control. Moreover,  the marketing  and  business practices of IMBs also heighten the risk of abuse by feeding this perception. Agencies often advertise the  women they recruit as being submissive to male clients, who might pay up  to several thousand dollars to gain access to those women. Other industry  practices,  from  ‘‘satisfaction guarantees’’ or ‘‘shopping cart’’ features on  agency web sites to so-called ‘‘romance  tours’’ overseas that virtually line up  several hundred women recruits for inspection by a dozen male clients during  a single ‘‘mixer,’’ make perfectly clear  that the woman is the commodity provided for the male client’s consumption. An  inevitable  and  dangerous  sense of ownership by the men in their  costly investments can develop. Several  highly  publicized murders  of  women by husbands whom they met  through IMBs highlight a growing nationwide trend of abuse. A 2003 survey  conducted by the Tahirih Justice Center found that over 50 percent of programs providing legal services to battered  immigrant women  nationwide  had served women battered by men  whom they had met through IMBs.  Third, women who are recruited by  IMBs are at a tremendous  informational disadvantage that a brutal predator can exploit. These foreign fiance´es  and spouses often are unable to obtain  reliable information about the criminal  and marital  histories  of  their  American fiance´es and spouses, and are  unaware of the  legal rights and resources available to victims of domestic violence in the U.S. An all-too-common result is that women from across  the globe are  exploited across  this  country, as a brief memorandum from  the Tahirih Justice Center explains,  and which I will have printed in the  CONGRESSIONALRECORD.  The information requirements established by this subtitle are designed to  require  disclosure  of  the kinds  of  criminal convictions in the background  of a petitioning American  fiance´ or  spouse that indicate he could be prone  to domestic violence. This will enable a  foreign woman to make an informed  decision about coming to this country  for marriage to an American man, in  advance, with her safety and that of  her children in mind. The provisions of  this subtitle would also provide her  with information about where she can  turn  for help,  including vital safety  nets and social services available to domestic violence and sexual assault victims, if she experiences abuse at the  fiance´ hands  of  her American  or  spouse.  A  simple  but  incredibly  powerful  premise drives these provisions: that  this  information can help a woman  help herself, help her save herself or  her child from becoming the next victim of a predatory abuser. Through  this information and other safeguards,  this  important  legislation will help  prevent those intent on doing women  harm from perverting and subverting  both the institution of marriage and  the immigration process to find new  victims overseas.  So again, I thank my colleagues for  their inclusion of these vital protections, and thank them, too, on behalf  of the women and children whom they  have spared today from tragedies tomorrow.  I ask unaminous consent the memorandum be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  ILLUSTRATIVECASES OFWOMEN ANDTHEIR  CHILDRENEXPLOITEDANDABUSEDTHROUGH  THE INTERNATIONALMARRIAGEBROKER INDUSTRY  Alabama:  Thomas  Robert  Lane  was  charged with the murder of his estranged  Filipina wife, Teresa Lane. Teresa’s body  was discovered in a bathtub filled with running water. Authorities found evidence that  Lane drowned his wife by pinning her under  the water with his foot. A forensic physician  determined that Teresa was also subjected to  blunt force trauma. During the couple’s separation, Lane had been trying to arrange to  marry yet another woman from the Philippines.  California:  Marilyn  Carroll  married  Steffan Carroll in the Philippines in 1988.  One year later, he traveled to Thailand to  marry another young woman, Preeya. Before  marrying his second wife, Carroll assured her  that it was legal in California to have two  wives. The bigamous marriage ended when  Marilyn called the police to report that Carroll had sexually assaulted her—restraining  her with thumbcuffs and other devices during the attack. Carroll was charged with  bigamy and false imprisonment.  Georgia: Shortly after Katerina Sheridan,  a young woman from Siberia, married Frank  Sheridan, he kept her a virtual prisoner, forbidding her to keep her own set of house  keys, and taking away her visa, passport,  and birth certificate. Later, he also took  away her cell phone and cut all the phone  lines in the house. He flew into violent rages,  on one occasion beating Katerina and dragging her around the house by her legs. After  several such  incidents, Katerina told him  that she wanted to go back to Russia. In retaliation, Sheridan stabbed himself and then  accused her of doing it to get her thrown in  jail. Later, Katerina managed to make it to  a women’s shelter, but Sheridan stalked her  relentlessly and tried to get her detained and  deported. When police went to arrest Frank  for aggravated stalking, they discovered he  was  in Russia  looking  for a new bride.  Months later, when an officer went to arrest  Sheridan for another stalking-related crime,  he shot the officer. The deputy returned fire  and killed Sheridan.  Hawaii: The mutilated body of a young  Filipina woman, Helen Mendoza Krug, was  found  in a garbage dumpster behind her  high-rise apartment building. The murder  was committed in front of her 2-year-old son  by her husband, Robert Krug, whom she had  met through an IMB. Krug was sentenced to  life in prison.  Kentucky: ‘‘Dina’’ corresponded with her  husband ‘‘Paul,’’ an anesthesiologist, for several months before she agreed to marry him  when he visited her and her family in Ethiopia. When she came to the United States,  however, Paul took Dina’s money and passport, brought her to a motel (the first of  five), and kept her drugged and imprisoned  for weeks while he subjected her to horrific  physical, sexual, and mental abuse. Paul also  threatened Dina that she, not Paul, would be  arrested and jailed if she reported him to the  police. Only when Paul left to attend a conference for a few days did she regain enough  consciousness and strength to drag herself to  the motel office for help. Paul killed himself  before he could be prosecuted. Dina received  protection under US trafficking laws.  Minnesota: Soon after ‘‘Medina,’’ a Ukrainian college professor, married ‘‘Thomas,’’ a  well-respected doctor, Thomas turned controlling and violent.

The issue is on  the anti-Semitic statements made by  the  President  of  Iran,  Mr.  Ahmadinejad, who said, among other  things, that the state of Israel should  be wiped off the face of the Earth. We  have been working cooperatively to try  to get  this  resolution cleared, condemning  those  statements. We had  some concerns raised with the resolution which I will discuss in more detail.

1721,254,2005-12-16,Mr. SMITH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to speak about the need for hate  crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator KENNEDY and  I  introduce hate  crimes legislation that would add new  categories to current hate crimes law,  sending a signal that violence of any  kind  is unacceptable  in our society.  Likewise, each Congress I have come to  the floor to highlight a separate hate  crime that has occurred in our country.  On January 30, 1999, a 23-year-old disabled man was lured into an apartment  in Keansburg, NJ. He was than subjected to three hours of torture at the  hands of nine men and women. According to police, the abusers knew the  man from their neighborhood, and ridiculed him constantly because of his  disability.  I believe that the Government’s first  duty is to defend its citizens, to defend  them against the harms that come out  of hate. The Local Law Enforcement  Enhancement Act is a symbol that can  become substance. I believe that by  passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and  minds as well.  f  CAREGIVERS  ",2005
1722,254,2005-12-16,Mr. OBAMA.," Mr. President, across  the country there are more than 6 million children living in households headed by a grandparent or other relative.  Regardless of the reason children enter  relative—care the death of a parent,  neglect, abuse, military deployment, or  poverty—it is never, ever the fault of  the child. I commend grandparents and  other relatives who step  forward to  care  for these children, keeping the  children out of foster care while providing  safe,  stable homes, often at  great personal sacrifice.  In my state of Illinois, 9 percent of  the children live with nonparent relatives. Grandparents and other relative  caregivers  often  provide  the  best  chance for a loving and stable childhood for the children in their care, but  their hard work and dedication often  goes unnoticed. Today I offer my formal acknowledgement and deepest appreciation for the ongoing service of  these caregivers to our country and our  Nation’s most valuable asset—our children.  There are still far too many barriers  preventing grandparent- and other relative-caregivers  from  accessing  the  services they need. For example, even  though grandparent-caregivers are eligible  for many  housing  programs  through  the Department of Housing  and Urban Development, HUD officials  on the ground often unwittingly exclude  grandparents  from  accessing  housing because of confusion over the  relevant laws. For this reason, I recently worked with my colleague Senator STABENOWto obtain $4 million in  new funding for grandparent-caregiver  housing demonstration projects.  I look forward to working with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  improve  access  to  services  for  grandparent- and other relative-headed  households. My grandparents played a  central  role  in my upbringing, and  without them I would not be standing  before you today. I am certain that the  same can be said of thousands of children and adults in Illinois and across  the country. It is time that we recognize the contributions of these worthy  relative-caregivers, and grant them the  access to Federal services that they deserve.  f  CONFIRMATION OF SUSAN BODINE  ",2005

1724,261,2005-12-16,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President,  I  would like to take a moment and honor  a man who has influenced the lives of  so many students  for more than 35  years.  A band director since 1969, Dr. Isaac  Greggs has taken the half time show  for Southern University to a different  level, electrifying audiences with the  band’s energetic and precise performances. However,  these  performances  could not have happened without a lot  of hard work. Dr. Greggs’ practices are  legendary for being gruelling, but they  paid off in the end.  In many ways, Dr. Greggs’ practices  are a metaphor for his life—when one  demonstrates discipline and effort, one  can succeed anywhere.  This motto certainly proved true for  Dr. Greggs’ band. Under his direction,  the band performed around the world,  including for three United States Presidential  inaugurations,  four  Sugar  Bowls, and five Super Bowls. The band  has also appeared at the Astro Dome,  Superdome, Yankee Stadium, and the  Oakland Stadium Coliseum. For  six  weeks, the band played at Radio City  Music Hall, and they have also made  appearances on television shows such  as the Bob Hope Show, Jim Nabors  Show, Almost Anything Goes Show,  Perry Como Show, Henry, The Fonz,  Winkler Show, and the Telly Savalas  Show.  In addition to the talent Dr. Greggs  has brought as a band leader, he is also  an accomplished musician and  song  writer and is the author of Southern  University’s  fight  song  and  alma  mater. He is an honorary member of  both Louisiana’s House of Representatives and State Senate, and has won  several major music festival awards for  the marching division. Dr. Greggs has  conducted honor bands throughout the  country, and on behalf of Southern  University he was presented with a special trophy by the National Football  League for his band’s outstanding performance at a Super Bowl.  Dr. Greggs’ leadership is not limited  to the sporting field. As president of  the Louisiana College Band Directors  Association, founder and president of  the Lakeside Music Mart and School of  Music,  and State Chairman  of  the  L.I.A.L.O. Band Festival, Dr. Greggs  has proved his  leadership skills and  shown his commitment to the arts.  Dr. Greggs was presented with the  Key of Life Award at the 31st NAACP  Image Awards. The Key of Life Award  was  created  in  honor  of musician  Stevie Wonder and is presented to an  individual or group who exemplifies  Wonder’s  ‘‘inner vision.’’ The award  also recognizes extraordinary achievements  in  the areas of civil  rights,  human rights, and community. It  is  clear through all of his career, Dr.  Greggs exemplified these attributes.  Dr. Greggs’ power to move people  through music is an amazing gift. If  one is lucky in life, one improves the  life of one’s own children. However, Dr.  Greggs has improved the lives of thousands and has left an indelible mark on  African-American students and fans.∑  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  which were referred to the appropriate  committees.  (The nominations received today are  printed at the end of the Senate proceedings.)  f  REPORT OF GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS RELATIVE TO  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE  INFORMATION SHARING ENVIRONMENT  CALLED FOR BY SECTION 1016 OF  THE  INTELLIGENCE  REFORM  AND  TERRORISM  PREVENTION  ACT OF 2004—PM 34  The Presiding Officer laid before the  Senate the following message from the  President of  the United States,  together with an accompanying report;  which was referred to the Select Committee on Intelligence:  To the Congress of the United States  The robust and effective sharing of  terrorism information is vital to protecting Americans and the Homeland  from terrorist attacks. To ensure that  we succeed in this mission, my Administration is working to implement the  Information  Sharing  Environment  (ISE) called for by section 1016 of the  Intelligence Reform  and  Terrorism  Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA). The  ISE is intended to enable the Federal  Government and our State, local, tribal, and private sector partners to share  appropriate  information  relating  to  terrorists,  their  threats, plans, networks,  supporters,  and  capabilities  while, at the same time, respecting the  information privacy and other  legal  rights of all Americans.  Today, I issued a set of guidelines  and requirements that represent a significant step in the establishment of  the ISE. These guidelines and requirements, which are consistent with the  provisions of section 1016(d) of IRTPA,  are set forth in a memorandum to the  heads of executive departments and  agencies. The guidelines and requirements also address collateral  issues  that are essential to any meaningful  progress on  information  sharing.  In  sum, these guidelines will:  Clarify roles and authorities across  executive departments and agencies;  Implement  common  standards and  architectures  to  further  facilitate  timely and effective information sharing;  Improve  the Federal Government’s  terrorism  information  sharing  relationships with State, local, and tribal  governments, the private sector, and  foreign allies;  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:07 Dec 17, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G16DE6.096 S16DEPT1 ",2005
1725,275,2005-12-16,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  to re-introduce the Fair Contracts for  Growers Act of 2005. This bill would  simply give farmers a choice of venues  to resolve disputes associated with agricultural contracts. This  legislation  would  not  prohibit  arbitration.  Instead, it would ensure that the decision  to arbitrate is truly voluntary and that  the rights and remedies provided for by  our  judicial  system are not waived  under coercion.  I certainly recognize that arbitration  has tremendous benefits. It can often  be less costly than other dispute settlement means. It can also remove some  of  the workload  from our Nation’s  overburdened court system. For these  reasons, arbitration must be an option—but it should not be a coerced option.  Mandatory arbitration  clauses are  used in a growing number of agricultural  contracts  between  individual  farmers and processors. These provisions limit a farmer’s ability to resolve  a dispute with the company, even when  a violation of Federal or State law is  suspected. Rather than having the option to pursue a claim in court, disputes are required to go through an arbitration process that puts the farmer  at a severe disadvantage. Such disputes  often involve instances of discrimination, fraud, or negligent misrepresentation. The effect of these violations for  the  individual  farmer can be bankruptcy and financial ruin, and mandatory arbitration clauses make it impossible  for  farmers to seek redress  in  court.  When a farmer chooses arbitration,  the farmer is waving rights to access to  the courts and the constitutional right  to a jury trial. Certain standardized  court rules are also waived, such as the  right to discovery. This is important  because  the  farmer must prove his  case, the company has the relevant information, and the farmer can not prevail unless he can compel disclosure of  relevant information.  Examples of farmers’ concerns that  have gone unaddressed due to limitations on dispute resolution options include; mis-weighed animals, bad feed  cases, wrongful  termination of contracts, diseased swine or birds provided  by the company, fraud and misrepresentation to induce a grower to enter a  contract, and retaliation by companies  against farmers who join producer associations.

1726,289,2005-12-16,Mr. CORZINE.," Mr. President, I rise  to  in  support  of  the End Racial  Profiling Act a bill being introduced  today by Senators FEINGOLD, OBAMA  and myself. This bill addresses an issue  that is critical to the people of my  home State of New Jersey and to all  Americans.  I start by recognizing two of my colleagues with whom I have been working to address the problem of racial  profiling. Senator RUSSFEINGOLDhas  been a tremendous leader on this issue  he held the first Senate hearings on racial profiling in 2001, and he and his  staff have worked tirelessly to elevate  the importance of this issue as a matter of civil rights. I also want to recognize Senator OBAMAhe has been a constant champion of efforts to combat racial profiling. Senator OBAMAtook the  lead  in writing one of the Nation’s  most innovative pieces of legislation  on the collection of racial profiling  data when he was in the Illinois State  Senate, and he has been equally committed to the issue since joining the  U.S. Senate. Both Senators FEINGOLD  and OBAMAhave worked tirelessly to  make the bill we are introducing today  a reality.  Racial profiling is anathema to the  principles on which our Nation was  founded,  sowing division within our  communities and striking at the heart  of our democratic values.  Stopping people on our highways, our  streets, and at our borders because of  the color of their skin is simply wrong,  and it is incompatible with the fundamental American belief in fairness, justice, and equal protection under the  law.  Every American is entitled to equal  protection under  the  law. Our Constitution tolerates nothing less, and we  should demand nothing less.  There is no equal protection there is  no equal  justice  if  law enforcement  agencies engage in policies and practices that are premised on a theory  that the way to stop crime is to go  after minorities on  the hunch  that  they are more likely to be criminals.  Let me add that not only is racial  profiling wrong, it is simply not an effective law enforcement tool. There is  no evidence that stopping people of  color adds up to catching the  ‘‘bad  guys.’’  In  fact,  empirical  evidence  shows  that singling out Black motorists or  Hispanic motorists  for  stops  and  searches doesn’t lead to a higher percentage of arrests because minority  motorists are no more likely to break  the law than white motorists.  What is more, the practice of racial  profiling actually undermines public  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:54 Dec 17, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00120 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A16DE6.165 S16DEPT1 ",2005
1727,338,2005-12-16,Mr. KENNEDY.,"  The observance is dedicated to eradicating violence, hunger, poverty and  suffering, and to establish greater trust  and fellowship among nations and families everywhere. Global Family Day  encourages  families to reach out to  each other on the first of January of  each year. It is a day for sharing the  idea and condition of peace, and the observance can take a concrete form such  as sharing a meal or helping the needy.  The idea of Global Family Day originates from young supporters. In 1999,  ninety nine children from Hine Middle  School in the District of Columbia visited Capitol Hill, asking Congress to  dedicate one day each year to a day of  peace and sharing.  In the  following  year, the  footsteps of these  intrepid  young thinkers were followed by children  from Brent Elementary School,  also  from the District of Columbia.  Children  from Stuart-Hobson Middle  School also visited members of Congress on Capitol Hill.  The 106th Congress agreed with them,  and in the year 2000, adopted a resolution similar to the one I am submitting  today. However, with the onrush of  events after the tragedy of September  11, 2001, a proclamation was not issued.  Thus, there was little public knowledge  that we have this important tool for  peace, despite the  international support from the United Nations General  Assembly. We can remedy that today  by  showing our  support  for Global  Family Day.  Many Americans are troubled by our  deteriorating image in the world, by  the dangers of terrorism and by the  suffering of others, both at home and  abroad. Yet they feel helpless to do  anything about it. Global Family Day  offers a potential solution. The observance of Global Family Day can lead to  greater  understanding  among  faith  groups, people of different races and  economic classes. Global Family Day  provides a way in which every man,  woman and child in the United States  can help reduce suffering at home, repair our damaged image abroad, and  help us remember that in the end, all  peoples belong to the same family.  f  SENATE  CONCURRENT  RESOLUTION  73—URGING  THE  PRESIDENT TO  ISSUE A PROCLAMATION FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF  AN AMERICAN JEWISH HISTORY  MONTH  Mr. SPECTER  submitted  the  following  concurrent  resolution; which  was referred to the Committee on the  Judiciary:  S.

1728,338,2005-12-16,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, this  year marked the 350th anniversary of  Jewish life in America. The occasion  has been commemorated with festivities and celebrations across the entire  country. As this special year draws to  a close, I am submitting a resolution  urging the President to establish permanent recognition of the contributions the Jewish culture has made to  life in America by annually issuing a  proclamation for the observance of an  American Jewish History Month.  Each year, we remember the achievements and contributions made by African-Americans and women to our Nation’s development by designating February  as African American History  Month and March as Women’s History  Month. Similarly,  Jewish American  History Month would celebrate the legacy of the American Jewish experience  and observe the many contributions  Jewish-Americans have made  in the  areas of medicine, the arts, science,  and technology.  American  society  is  comprised of  many cultures. Americans are proud of  our history of acceptance and understanding. By  establishing  a Jewish  American History Month, we will  present an additional opportunity to  raise our Nation’s cultural awareness  and celebrate our diversity.  An  identical  resolution was  introduced in the House by Congresswoman  WASSERMANSCHULTZ, where it was cosponsored by 250 Members and passed  unanimously.  I hope that the Senate will join our  colleagues in the House by agreeing to  this resolution, urging the President to  annually issue a proclamation for the  observance of an American Jewish History Month.  f  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND  PROPOSED  BAUCUS,  SA 2680.
