1,House,109,0.221,29,2005-01-06,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, the Ohio recount requested by the other party, has been  completed and has been verified.  In  every area of Ohio, bipartisan county  boards have verified the integrity of  these election results. This is the true  message  to  the world:  our  system  works with integrity.  We keep hearing that Ohio’s vote was  rigged in some way. But this is not  plausible when you have a system of 88  separate  bipartisan  county  election  boards. In Ohio, our boards take great  pride  in their administration of the  election laws.  I urge the Congress to accept the  votes cast today by the State of Ohio  for President Bush.  ",2005
2,House,109,-0.438,29,2005-01-06,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  ask to address the House for 5 minutes.  The SPEAKER. The gentleman from  Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2005
3,House,109,-0.35,29,2005-01-06,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, Ohio  symbolizes that the Help America Vote  Act fell short of the lofty goals set by  this  Congress. Ohio’s  Secretary  of  State, Kenneth Blackwell, a Republican, in a State in which all statewide  offices are controlled by Republicans  and, in our State legislature, Republicans outnumber Democrats two to  one in both chambers, our Secretary of  State repeatedly took actions to make  it more difficult for as many Ohioans  as possible to have their votes fairly  cast and accurately recorded.  No national standards were set for  voting equipment because the Bush administration appointed members of the  Election Assistance  Commission  so  late that their confirmation was nearly  a  full year  later  than  required by  HAVA itself. They had no time to recommend  standards until  it was  too  late, and those standards are still not  in place today.  The Ohio Secretary of State tried to  force county boards of elections to buy  equipment that his own reports showed  to be flawed. Federal dollars that this  Congress appropriated  to help modernize elections became stuck in Ohio  between the Secretary of State’s office  and local boards of elections who were  often in deep disagreement as to which  machine standards were trustworthy.  Just  prior  to  election, Secretary  Blackwell continued to frustrate the  enfranchisement of Ohioans with actions  ranging  from  specifying paper  weight standards for voter registration  forms that even his own office could  not meet, and then fighting the availability of provisional ballots right up  until 3 p.m. on Election Day. In fact,  people who had requested absentee ballots and had not received them were  denied provisional ballots until a Federal court ruling that was issued at 3  p.m. on Election Day, after who knows  how many Ohioans were denied ballots  that they were prepared to cast for the  candidates of their choice.  No one can change the outcome of  this election; but believe me, hundreds  of thousands of Ohioans do have questions about the way that this election  was handled  in Ohio,  in a State  in  which the winning margin was only  118,000 votes. Implementing the actual  intent of HAVA and amending it where  necessary deserve the  full  investigation of  this  109th Congress, and  it  ought to be our first order of business.  I commend the gentlewoman  from  Ohio (Mrs. JONES) of Cleveland who experienced these abuses in her area for  bringing this to national attention. We  are very proud of her. We are very  proud of the Members who have chosen  to join her. I would ask my Republican  colleagues,  starting with  the Committee on House Administration,  to  join us in this effort to make HAVA  really work as we approach the elections of 2006.  ",2005

5,House,109,0.559,29,2005-01-06,Mr. HAYWORTH.," Mr. Speaker, I seek  to be recognized for 5 minutes.  The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes  the  gentleman  from  Arizona  (Mr.  HAYWORTH) for 5 minutes.  (Mr. HAYWORTH  asked  and was  given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2005
6,House,109,-0.556,36,2005-01-06,Ms. WOOLSEY.," I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentlewoman  from  California  (Ms. WOOLSEY)  for  yielding, and I thank the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Mrs. JONES).  Mr. Speaker, this is a sacred debate.  This is not a frivolous time in our history. This is about avoiding the suppression of votes. Might I say when the  people of Ukraine rose up against their  flawed election, they understood what  democracy is all about.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to object to the  votes in Ohio. I rise under the Constitution of the United States in Article 4, 14 and 15. I argue the point that  we have an inconsistent election, and I  argue the point that we believe in democracy. The equal protection and due  clauses of the 14th amendment of the  Constitution operate  to protect  the  rights of citizens to vote for the candidate of their choice.  Furthermore, the well-settled case on  this  issue, Reynolds v. Sims, states  that ‘‘the right to vote freely for the  candidate of one’s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any  restrictions on that right strike at the  heart of representative government.’’  How would Members  like to be  in  Ohio and be told that the election was  on November 3, 2004, instead of November  2,  2004? The Constitution’s due  process  clause  requires  fundamental  fairness and that a State election official not employ vote-counting procedures that are so flawed.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that the American people value the value of one vote,  one person, and all votes counted.  Mr. Speaker, I support the objection made  as to counting the votes of the Electoral College from the State of Ohio in the name of the  American people, the United States Constitution, in the name of procedural due process,  and  in  the name of democracy. The Equal  Protection and Due Process Clauses of  the  14th Amendment of the Constitution operate  to protect the rights of citizens to vote for the  candidate of  their choice. Furthermore,  the  well-settled case on  this  issue, Reynolds v.  Sims states that ‘‘the right to vote freely for  the candidate of one’s choice  is of  the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.’’  This is a sacred debate that is in no way  frivolous use of the time of the Congress or of  the tax dollars of the American people. Nor is  this debate one that aims to overturn the 2004  presidential election. On the contrary, this debate is being made at the request and at the  behest of the American people.  I will cast a protest vote today not only in  the name of the integrity of the Ohio voting  process but for the democratic process that is  seriously flawed and that must be fixed.  The Court in that case also enunciated that  ‘‘undeniably  the Constitution of  the United  States protects the rights of all qualified citizens  to vote,  in state as well as  in  federal  elections . . . It has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified voters have a constitutionally protected  right  to vote,  . . . and  to  have their votes counted.’’  Moreover,  under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause, all methods prescribed by a legislature to preserve the right to vote must be effected and not thwarted as stated in Bush v.  Gore  in 2000. Reynolds and  its progeny of  cases added that votes that are cast must actually be counted under the Equal Protection  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—applicable to the individual States.  In addition, Mr. Speaker, the Constitution’s  Due Process Clause  requires  ‘‘fundamental  fairness,’’ or that a state official not conduct an  election or apply  vote-counting procedures  that are so flawed as to amount to a denial of  voters’ rights to have their voices heard and  their votes count. The First Circuit  federal  Court in 2001 held that where ‘‘organic failures  in a state or local election process threaten to  work patent and  fundamental unfairness, a  . . . claim  lies  for a violation of substantive  due process.’’  As we look to reauthorize relevant sections  of the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA), it would  be an indictment of the election process itself  if we fail to ask pointed questions as to the integrity of the Ohio election in 2004. This challenge is an absolute must relative to America’s  standing and reputation as a real democracy  and as a center that promotes the sanctity of  the right to vote.  Today’s challenge  in Joint Session  forum  aims to ensure the maintenance of the integrity of the voting process. I support my colleagues in challenging the mechanics of the  Electoral College vote certification for its procedural value. This challenge  represent our  collective exhaustion of legal remedies on behalf of the American people—our constituents,  for without this act, their voice remains muted.  What my colleagues and I stand to achieve  today is to raise the awareness of the American people as to the legitimacy of the democratic process and the absolute value of the  notion of ‘‘One person, One vote’’. Our collective efforts may not net a different result  in  terms of the recent presidential election; but  can and will affect future elections. On a global scale as the standard bearers of democracy  this challenge can serve to provide a shining  example of hope to the emerging democracies  in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The exhaustion of all  remedies available  when there is any doubt as to the legitimacy  of the overall process is one of the basic tenants upon which  this country was  founded.  The duty to doggedly pursue a task to its ultimate conclusion is as applicable to the recent  gubernatorial race in the State of Washington  as it is in the democratic elections taking place  for the first time in the Ukraine. In Washington  State, candidate Dino Rossi declared victory  after only a partial recount. However, after a  full and  fair  recount,  it was correctly determined that the Democratic candidate Chrisine  Gregoire was the victor. A rush to judgment is  never prudent. The  transparency of process  and convincing evidence of the true and correct outcome will preserve this institution we  call democracy.  In  the Ukraine, a new election was held  when majority supporters protested and complained of fraud in the election that resulted in  the  surprising  defeat  of  opposition  leader  Viktor Yushchenko. The second vote held revealed that Yushchenko had actually won by  a significant margin. What underscores  the  critical nature of  full and  fair recounts when  there is doubt as to legitimacy is the fact that  while  the  first  flawed  election  rendered  Yushchenko a loser by three (3) percentage  points, the revote rendered him a winner by  eight percentage points. This is clear and convincing evidence. This is democracy.  Mr. Speaker, election processes, like legislation, are imperfect; therefore, we must use  every opportunity and  resource available  to  bring them closer to legitimacy and a truly representative nature. All evidence of voting irregularity and failure of votes to be counted is relevant and important to the achievement of this  goal. This is democracy.  The hearings that we have held as a body  within the House Judiciary Committee and the  hard work that officials such as my colleague  from Ohio, Ms. TUBBSJONEShas done leading  up to November 4 and well through its aftermath have yielded  factual  findings  that suggest the existence of ample grounds on which  to challenge the electors from Ohio as being  unlawfully  appointed. Our  fact-finding  has  shown possible violation of 3 U.S.C. Section  5—which states that all controversies regarding the appointment of electors should be resolved six days prior to the meeting of electors  (or December 7, 2004 for purposes of the current election) in order for a state’s electors to  be binding on Congress when  it meets on  January 6, 2005, to declare the results of the  2004 election.  Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell and  others appear  to have  intentionally delayed  the initial certification of the electors until December 6, rendering a recount impossible by  December 7—let alone by the December 13  meeting of Ohio’s electors.  Today’s debate is very important to document  the serious election  improprieties  that  occurred in Ohio and in other voter precincts  around America. Some of  the  incidents  that  occurred include:  Insufficient resources allocated to poor and  minority precincts, which resulted in unusually  long lines which resulted in long waiting time;  Lack of a verified  ‘‘paper  trail’’ relating  to  electronic voting machines, thus failing the test  of transparency;  Reports of Ohioans being told, incorrectly,  that the presidential election was to take place  on Wednesday, November 3, 2004, as opposed to Tuesday, November 2;  Denial of provisional ballots to voters;  Voter intimidation;  Voting machine errors or tampering;  Improper purging of eligible votes;  Fraudulent phone calls, fliers, and bulletins  on official-looking letterhead;  Questionable vote  recount  in Ohio, about  which the case Yost v. David Cobb, et al. is  currently under litigation.  The American people deserve to have their  voice heard and  to have  their  fundamental  rights advocated.  During  this past pre-election period,  I had  the privilege of working closely with my constituents and with very efficient  legal minds  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:19 Dec 01, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 J:\CRONLINE\TYPESE~1\H06JA5.REC H06JA5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2005
7,House,109,-0.413,43,2005-01-06,Mr. MEEKS of New York.," Mr. Speaker, although I will not file an objection to the counting of Ohio’s electoral votes, I rise today to acknowledge the voting discrepancies and irregularities that occurred in the State of Ohio in  this past presidential election.  As  is evident  in my colleague JOHNCONYERS’s voting  rights status  report, Ohio has  failed to provide the opportunity for its citizens  to have equal access and opportunity to cast  their vote and have that vote accurately counted.  Many voters were denied provisional ballots  and  some  eligible  voters were  improperly  purged. Others were given erroneous information as to where and when they could vote.  The State provided  insufficient  resources  to  minority precincts, resulting in long lines that  caused delays up to 10 hours, forcing some  voters to have to leave those lines to tend to  personal obligations.  There were rampant  incidents of voter  intimidation, deceptive phone calls and fraudulent fliers on official looking letterhead.  The lack of a verifiable paper trail by some  of the electronic voting machines contributed  to a questionable vote count.  Clearly, Ohio’s election officials,  including  Secretary of State Blackwell, have questions  to answer regarding these disturbing irregularities.  How can we encourage free and fair elections in Iraq, a country that may soon become  a fledgling democracy, when we can’t ensure  free and  fair elections  in America after 200  years of democracy.  As a Member of Congress it is my duty to  uphold the right of the people to have free and  fair elections of their government officials. It is  my hope that this Congress will work together  in the coming months to enact real election reform that will restore America’s confidence in  the electoral process.  ",2005
8,House,109,-0.502,43,2005-01-06,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank Representative TUBBSJONESand Senator BOXER  and Representative JOHNCONYERS for forcing  this institution, and thus our Nation, to debate  the quality of our democratic voting process  and to consider whether it meets the expectations of its people.  If we are to form a more perfect union, we  must dedicate ourselves  to  forming a more  perfect voting process.  Four years ago,  this Nation shuddered at  the weakness  of  our  ballot  process,  and  vowed to improve it.  But in some respects, it was weakened further.  The ballot was weakened when votes were  allowed to be cast without a printed record.  The ballot was weakened when  the vote  took so  long  that voters had  to choose between voting and missing a day’s work.  The ballot was weakened when provisional  ballots were not honored.  We must confront  the  fact  that electronic  voting machines that do not provide a ‘‘print  our’’ are a black hole.  We can do better. Our ATM machines give  receipts in return for cash. It is clearly not a  JOHN technological barrier to provide a receipt in return for a vote.  This is America. We are the incubator for  democratic evolution. We are a beacon to the  free world. Ohio had special problems  this  time, but they are problems we can fix, and  when we fix them in Ohio, we will have made  the progress in 2005 that we failed to make  over the last 4 years.  I am voting to support this challenge to the  certification of Ohio’s vote as a legitimate and  constructive beginning to a more perfect democracy and a more perfect union.  ",2005
9,House,109,-0.281,43,2005-01-06,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today, not with  the hope of overturning an  election, but with  the hope of overturning a  system  that has  for  too  long  failed  to guarantee every American their most basic right,  the right to vote.  Our very democracy was  founded on  the  essential right of citizens to have a voice in  their government. As Members of Congress  we are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the  United States, which  includes  the 13th and  19th Amendments, and I am quite frankly saddened that such a debate today breaks down  along party lines. Each and every one of us as  Americans should stand to defend this right, to  protect  and  guarantee  that  every  citizen,  black, white, male, female, Democrat or Republican, has the opportunity to cast a vote.  As representatives we should not fear the  will of the people; we should not fear a debate  here on the floor of the House seeking to shed  light on and improve our voting system, rather  we must fear any threat to our right to vote.  We must  take seriously any allegation  that  would deprive any citizen of  this  right,  let  alone the serious and widespread allegations  that are being make in Ohio.  The debate today is not about the election  of George W. Bush, rather it is about the integrity and  the  future of our voting system.  Today we are challenging ourselves to do better. We are challenging ourselves to examine  our voting system, to get to the bottom of what  went wrong in Ohio and around the Nation on  Election Day. We need to hold hearings. We  need to conduct an investigation and we need  to pass legislation that puts in place specific  federal protections  for our  federal elections,  especially in the areas of auditing electronic  voting machines and casting and counting provisional ballots. We must be willing to hold the  same light on our election system that we hold  on nations such as Afghanistan, Ukraine, and  Iraq. How can we serve as a model for democracy, when our own citizens lack faith in  our democracy?  That is what today is about, restoring faith  in our system. This can not be accomplished  by simply accepting the status quo and allowing opportunities such as today to pass without objection. The only way to change an injustice is to stand against it. Mr. Speaker, this  is why I rise today. We must not accept the  status quo,  rather we must challenge ourselves  to do better. This  is what we do as  Americans and this is what I am challenging  us to do today.  ",2005
10,Senate,109,0.31,64,2005-01-06,Mr. BOND., I move to lay that motion  on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was  agreed to.  f  MAKING MINORITY PARTY  APPOINTMENTS TO COMMITTEES  ,2005
11,Senate,109,-0.276,64,2005-01-06,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I send a  resolution to the desk.  ",2005
12,Senate,109,-0.319,71,2005-01-06,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr.  President,  although there were voting irregularities  in Ohio, I will not vote in support of  the objection. I do respect the result of  the recent Presidential election, but I  do not  respect  the process. Several  thousand voters believe they were discouraged or even prevented from voting, and several thousand who did vote  believe that their votes were not correctly reported. The inequitable allocation of voting machines, the lack of instruction for the review of provisional  ballots, and the questionable activities  surrounding the recount of the electronic ballots call  into question the  final results in Ohio. However, I am unconvinced that it would have made a  difference in the final outcome of this  Presidential election.  I had hoped that we would not have  the electoral college votes called into  question again. After the 2000 Presidential election, we worked together to  pass election reform  legislation, the  Help America Vote Act. That legislation set Federal requirements for provisional ballots and for voter information, registration, and  identification.  Unfortunately, that legislation has not  yet been fully implemented and does  not go far enough.  I would like to work with my colleagues craft legislation to ensure that  all of our citizens are encouraged to  vote and participate in our democratic  process. Our citizens must believe their  vote will count. At a time when we are  risking lives of our service men and  women to spread democracy throughout the world, we cannot ignore the  threats to the democratic process here  at home. I do not relish the vote I am  forced to cast today, but I as I do, I  look forward to being able to cast future votes on Federal election reform  to ensure that we are not in this position again.  ",2005
13,Senate,109,-0.256,71,2005-01-06,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President, serious allegations have been raised about voting  irregularities in Ohio during the 2004  presidential  election.  I  agree with  many of my colleagues that these allegations must be  investigated to the  fullest extent possible because every  eligible citizen  in  this nation must  have an equal opportunity to exercise  the constitutional right to cast a vote  in Federal elections. That said, I do not  believe there is anything to be gained  by sustaining the objection to the ballot certification with  regard  to  the  state of Ohio. Senator JOHNKERRYhas  already  conceded  the  election  and  there are no pending  investigations  that will  result  in  sufficient votes  being changed so as to alter the outcome of this election.  However, the last two elections have  revealed  a  glaring need  for us  to  rethink how we conduct elections in  our Nation. With more and more voters  needing to cast their ballots on Election Day, we need to build on the  movement which  already  exists  to  make it easier for Americans to cast  their ballots by providing alternatives  to voting on  just one election day.  Twenty-six states, including my own  state of Wisconsin, now permit any  registered voter to vote by absentee  ballot. Twenty three states permit in-  person early voting at election offices  or at other  satellite  locations. The  state of Oregon now conducts statewide  elections completely by mail. These innovations are critical if we are to conduct fair elections for it has become  unreasonable to expect that a nation of  294 million people can line up at the  same time and cast their ballots at the  same time. And if we continue to try to  do so, we will encounter even more reports of broken machines and  long  lines in the rain and registration errors  that create barriers to voting.  That is why I have been a long-time  advocate of moving our federal election  day from the first Tuesday after the  first Monday in November to the first  weekend in November. Holding our federal elections on a weekend will create  more opportunities for voters to cast  their ballots and will help end the gridlock at the polling places which threaten to undermine our elections. I look  forward to introducing legislation to  this end in the 109th Congress and I  urge my colleagues to join me in this  effort.  ",2005
14,Senate,109,-0.291,71,2005-01-06,Ms. CANTWELL.," Mr. President, we  meet  in historic session today. The  twelfth amendment to the Constitution  sets forth the requirements for casting  electoral  votes  and  counting  those  votes in Congress. The electors are required to meet, cast and certify their  ballots and transmit them to the Vice  President in his capacity as President  of the Senate.  With the exception of objections to  the electoral votes from the State of  Florida in the 2000 election, objections  to an entire slate of votes from a State  have been rare. But we have had one  today, which gives us the opportunity  to discuss and debate a very important  issue for our country and for the citizens of my State—the issue of whether  we have ensured that every vote  is  counted.  I will vote to uphold the outcome of  this most recent election.  However, I think we have more work  to do in the area of election reform,  CONYERS and I think the discussion we are having today is appropriate and overdue.  In 2001, I supported the passage of the  Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act.  That law was designed to protect voting rights and ensure the integrity of  the electoral system in our nation. I  did so because I feel that making certain that each citizen’s vote is counted  and promoting public trust and confidence in our election process is crucial.  The job is far from over. We may  need to have additional hearings and  we may need to take additional legislative action. There have been troubling  reports from this most recent election.  Representative JOHN and  the minority staff of the House Judiciary Committee have conducted their  own hearings and investigations of instances of voter disenfranchisement,  flawed or corrupted voting machinery,  and  inappropriate  procedures  for  counting and recounting votes in Ohio.  They have produced a compelling report itemizing and analyzing the irregularities.  A 2-hour debate on the matter, when  people across the country waited in 4, 6  and 12-hour lines to vote all over this  country in November, is the least we  can do.  The debate we are having focuses attention on  legitimate concerns  that  have been raised regarding the Ohio  vote and count, and on broader concerns about America’s inconsistent and  sometimes  flawed  election processes  which vary so radically from State to  State that genuine equal protection  concerns arise.  I will certify the election results, because I don’t think we should sacrifice  the greater good of the continuity of  Government at this time. We need to  govern. But, what we should be doing is  using this debate to get this Congress,  and this country, talking about the  steps that must be taken to ensure  that American elections provide a true  representation of the people’s will.  ",2005
15,Senate,109,-0.374,71,2005-01-06,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, while I  was pleased at the  large number of  Americans who turned out to vote in  last year’s Presidential election, I am  deeply concerned about the many credible allegations of voting irregularities  that surfaced in the weeks following  the election.  I cannot, however, support an objection to the certification of Ohio’s electoral votes. Although I believe this debate is worthwhile, I am not persuaded  that the alleged fraud was sufficient to  change the outcome of either the Electoral College or the popular vote.

16,Senate,109,0.364,85,2005-01-06,Mr. TALENT.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  salute  the  citizens  of  Warrensburg, MO,  in  celebration of  their 150th anniversary as an  incorporated town.  The town of Warrensburg was incorporated in 1855 as a community proud  of its heritage and loyal to the ideals,  traditions and institutions that have  contributed to the success and growth  of the city.  Warrensburg prides itself as being a  self-contained city with a vibrant employment  base,  excellent  education  system,  active  cultural  scene,  and  many civic events and activities  for  residents to enjoy.  Warrensburg  serves as  the county  seat for Johnson County, and is currently home to 17,075 residents who are  served by an excellent school system  which has been accredited with Distinction in Performance by the Missouri State Board of Education. The  Warrensburg School System has also  been named a Gold Medal School, ranking them among the Nation’s top 18  percent of schools.  The community  is also the proud  home of Central Missouri State University, which has provided quality postsecondary education for more than 130  years. This comprehensive university  annually serves nearly 14,000 students  from all over the State, Nation, and  world, and offers more than 150 areas of  study at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  The city’s heartland work ethic and  community pride make it a great place  to do business, with several local companies which have grown into national  and international prominence aided by  the exceptional workforce and affordable business climate. Warrensburg is  home of EnerSys, G.E. Transportation  Systems, ThyssenKrupp Stahl Company, Swisher Mower, Bomag Paving  Products, and the world headquarters  of both Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity  and Carlyle Van Lines.  Warrensburg is also proud of its rich  diversity, with over 35 different languages spoken within the Warrensburg  School District, and over 30 faith communities gathering  for worship and  service each week.  Warrensburg  is  also  the  boyhood  home of John William ‘‘Blind’’ Boone,  the  legendary ragtime composer and  piano player; home of the first gasoline-powered,  push  lawn mower  invented by Leonard Goodall; the original self-propelled mower and the zero-  turning radius riding lawn mower both  invented by Max Swisher, who remains  a Warrensburg  resident; and Errett  Lobban Cord, inventor of Cord Automobiles.  Finally, Warrensburg  is  also  the  hometown of Old Drum, the hunting  dog for which Senator George Graham  Vest’s ‘‘Eulogy on the Dog’’ was delivered, coining the idea that ‘‘man’s best  friend is his dog.’’  I am honored to share Warrensburg’s  proud history and its sesquicentennial  anniversary as a town with my colleagues,  and  I wish  the  people  of  Warrensburg all the best for the future.∑  f  JOHN SACKETT RETIREMENT  ∑",2005
17,Senate,109,0.509,85,2005-01-06,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President,  after  years of faithful service and dedication  to his work at Argonne National Lab, a  friend  and  respected  Idahoan, John  Sackett, is retiring to pursue a quieter  life with his family. John served in a  number of positions in the Lab over the  past 34 years, the most recent being director or Argonne National Lab West  located at Idaho National Environment  and  Engineering  Lab  in  southeast  Idaho. He has earned international recognition and respect for his work in  the areas of nuclear safety and advanced reactor design.  I have had the privilege of working  with John the entire time I have served  in Congress. Over the past 12 years, I  have witnessed his steady leadership,  commitment to the goals of the Lab  and DOE. John and I share a fervent  belief in the role of nuclear energy and  research  in economic,  technological,  security and energy sectors.  Perhaps what is most remarkable is  that despite the tremendous demands  of his work at Argonne, he finds the  time to give back to his community,  serving on numerous medical and economic boards and councils in eastern  Idaho as well as on the advisory boards  of both the University of Idaho and  Idaho State University.  Argonne National Lab’s loss is certainly John’s family’s gain, as well as  the gain of any organization in which  he decides to invest his retirement energy. He has my best wishes in his retirement.∑  f  HONORING DAVID L. DAY ON HIS  RETIREMENT  ∑",2005
18,Senate,109,0.323,85,2005-01-06,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President, I  rise today to honor David L. Day on his  retirement from 35 years of public service as the Deputy Engineer for Programs and Project Management with  the Nashville District, U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers. During his 35 years  of Federal service, 33 with the Corps of  Engineers, from 1969 to present, Dave  held a clear vision and achieved a remarkable string of successes  in  furthering the mission of the Nashville  District and the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers. Dave has earned a reputation of being honest, fair, and professional with his coworkers. He began his  career with the Nashville District in  October 1998 when he was selected as  the Deputy District Engineer for Programs and Project Management and is  the senior civilian for the district with  more than 800 employees and a $140  million annual operating budget. The  district provides Federal engineering,  planning, construction, project management,  real  estate,  and  environmental services. His responsibilities included budgeting, planning, and executing Civil Works and  Interagency  and  International Services programs  under the project management business process.  Dave Day has distinguished himself  as a leader in many ways during his  tenure. He continuously has encouraged a culture of professional improvement,  fostering team  leadership and  activity to meet district goals, while at  the same time, taking care of the people with whom he works. Dave had a  strong, positive impact on the morale  of the district’s Planning, Programs,  and Project Management Division employees as well as Project Delivery  Team members. He always made time  to recognize deserving individuals or  discuss any problem that arose. His  genuine concern for every member of  his team was reflected  in his many  messages, letters, awards, and hallway  greetings.  Dave oversaw the operation of the  Account Executive Program, which the  Nashville District uses to establish and  strengthen  relationships  with  customers and find ways to meet regional  and national needs. He also led the effort to partner, both formally and informally, with the States of Tennessee  and Kentucky, Tennessee Valley Authority, TVA, Southeastern Power Association, SEPA, Tennessee River Valley Authority, TRVA, Tenn-Tom Waterways, Metro Nashville, and other  VerDate Mar 15 2010  20:26 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S06JA5.REC S06JA5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005
19,,109,0.688,106,2005-01-06,Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker,  it is with profound sorrow that I rise to recognize  the  loss of a New Jersey citizen who  served with dignity and honor as a soldier in  Iraq. I join his family, friends and members of  his community in mourning this great loss.  On Saturday, January 1, LCpl. Brian P.  Parrello, 19, of West Milford, NJ, was killed in  Al Anbar Province, Iraq as a result of hostile  fire. Lance Corporal Parrello was assigned to  Small Craft Company, Headquarters Battalion,  2nd Marine Division,  II Marine Expeditionary  Force, Camp Lejeune, NC. Parrello was attached  to a Marine Swift Boat unit  that patrolled the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.  A  resident of West Milford, New Jersey,  Parrello attended West Milford High School  where he was a member of both the football  and hockey teams. Following high school, he  was so deeply affected by the attack on the  World Trade Center and Pentagon  that he  proudly enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. His  teachers, coaches and peers have called him  a real leader and a role model, someone who  always gave 150 percent, a person who led by  example and with a big heart.  This loss causes us to reflect on the bravery  demonstrated by our men and women in uniform as they carry out their obligations in the  face of danger. When their Nation called them  to duty to preserve freedom and the security  of our neighbors, they answered without hesitation.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is my sincere privilege  to  recognize the life of a proud soldier and heroic  representative of  the State of New Jersey.  LCpl Brian P. Parrello was an honorable defender of liberty and he deserves our gratitude  and respect.  We  remember  those who have  fallen not  only as soldiers, but also as patriots who  made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.  May we keep their loved ones in our thoughts  and prayers as  they struggle  to endure  this  difficult period and mourn the heroes America  has lost.  f  ARTICLE HONORING CORPORAL  KEVIN JOHN ‘‘JACK’’ DEMPSEY  HON.

As a son and brother he  was loving and protective. He has a great  love for animals. Our mom took us to every  zoo and animal park she could find. Even as  a Marine, he showed that love. There was a  stray dog at Camp LeJeune that Jack used  to feed and take care of.  Jack is loved by many people. He had a  great smile and an even greater laugh. He  was a sweet kid who always wanted to do  something great with his life. My brother  was a wonderful man who accomplished  many great things. He excelled in the Marines and felt he was truly part of a brotherhood. My mother and I are incredibly proud  that he was able to do this for himself and  his country. We love him dearly and this loss  is tremendous to us. But we are extremely  proud of the man he became. He was a sweet  soul with the courage of a tiger. My brother  Jack made the ultimate sacrifice to protect  all of us. Honor him well.  f  40TH ANNIVERSARY OF PADRON  CIGARS  HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2005  Mr. MARIO DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr.  Speaker, 2004 marked the 40th anniversary of  the founding of Padron Cigars and I rise to  honor and congratulate them on this wonderful  achievement.  Padron Cigars was founded on September  8, 1964 by  the Padron brothers—Jose Orlando and Rodolfo. Throughout  the  last 40  years, the Padron family has worked to grow  their business and continue providing new  products  to  their  loyal customers  throughout  the world.  Of course, the success of Padron Cigars did  not come without significant challenges over  the years. In fact, their factory in Nicaragua  was destroyed as a result of civil war.  Through endless commitment and  leadership, Padron Cigars was able to survive and  grow, despite  the  serious  challenges  they  faced.  Today, Padron Cigars continues their commitment to quality through their consistent approach  to  the  lengthy process of manufacturing cigars. In fact, they claim: ‘‘Our primary  mission is the exceptional quality of our product, not the quantity produced.’’  Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Padron Cigars is clearly an industry leader that has epitomized the success of small family businesses  throughout America. The  success  story of  Padron Cigars is nothing short of the American Dream and I ask my colleagues to join  me in congratulating the Padron family on this  anniversary.  f  LEGISLATION ON EXCHANGE OF  LAND FOR A SCHOOL ON ST.

22,,109,-0.438,113,2005-01-06,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the memory of Congressman ROBERT  MATSUI. BOBMATSUIwas one of those elected  officials who earned the right to be called a  ‘‘statesman.’’ He was a force for compassion,  competence and integrity—as well as a wonderful human being whom I was honored to  call my  friend.  I extend my heartfelt sympathies to his loving wife and family.  Mr. Speaker, BOBMATSUIembodied America’s promise, demonstrating how a citizen of  humble beginnings could rise to the heights of  American governance. BOBalso reminded us  of our country’s sins. During the Second World  War, BOB’s  family was  interned  in  the Tule  Lake internment camp. This time of curtailed  liberties and rampant xenophobia is one of the  darker moments of American history.  Mr. Speaker,  internment  left an  indelible  mark on BOBMATSUI’s  family. BOB’s mother  contracted German measles at Tule Lake, and  as a result, BOB’s sister was born blind.  The experience also deeply affected BOB,  inspiring him to use his platform in Congress  to  reclaim  the dignity of  those wrongly  interned. BOBworked tirelessly to enact the Japanese American Redress Act,  in which  the  government formally apologized for internment  and offered compensation.  Mr. Speaker, James Baldwin once said, ‘‘I  love America more than any other country in  the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist  on the right to criticize her perpetually.’’ BOB  loved America in just this spirit. When  John F. Kennedy told Americans to ask what  they could do for their country, BOBpledged to  become a public servant. He served diligently  for 26 years.  Mr. Speaker, we will miss BOB’s leadership  as  the new Congress wades  through  the  murky waters of Social Security policy. Our  Democratic House Leader, Congresswoman  NANCYPELOSI, was quite accurate when she  noted that ‘‘America’s seniors have lost their  MATSUI best friend in the Congress.’’ I would add only  that so have this nation’s children and all of us  who seek balanced, progressive solutions to  the challenges at the center of people’s lives.  f  EXPRESSING  SORROW  OF  THE  HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE  HONORABLE ROBERT T.

Congressman  served the people of California and his nation  in the House of Representatives for 26 years.  BOBgave our country and Congress years  of his knowledge and dedication to fighting for  civil rights after beginning his life in 1942 in a  detention camp  for Japanese-Americans. He  embraced his heritage as well as  the hardships Asian Americans faced and channeled it  to positive change to make our nation formally  apologized  for  the  interment  of  Japanese  Americans and provide financial compensation  to the survivors.  BOBwas a true inspiration: as a Member,  he was a vital member of  the Democratic  Party and worked to make his Party stronger  but never  let his dedicated  ties  refrain him  from working with his Republican colleagues;  as an American, he listened to President Kennedy to give to his country a life of service  and commitment to making life better for all  Americans; and as an Asian American, he  served as a role model to young Asian Americans that the impossible is never that far away  and that they too can become active in government to serve the American people.  Mr. Speaker, BOBMATSUI’s loss will leave a  large void to this chamber. Our prayers and  thoughts are with his wife Doris and his son  Brian.  f  EXPRESSING  SORROW  OF  THE  HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE  HONORABLE ROBERT T.

26,House,109,-0.487,5,2005-01-25,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  want  to  thank  the gentleman  from  California for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I represent an area in  Chicago known as Ukrainian Village,  and last fall, I was privileged to visit  Ukraine with my friends from the Self-  Reliance Credit Union  to  celebrate  Ukrainian independence and to assist  with the development of credit unions  in that country.  I left impressed with the passion and  commitment  of  the  people  of  the  Ukraine to the development of democracy  in  their homeland. They have  been rewarded with a massive victory  for  their notions of  the democratic  process.  I congratulate President Yushchenko  on his election as President of Ukraine  and commend all of the diverse forces  who assisted in bringing about this triumph of the democratic process.  Ukraine is emerging as a vigorous  and forward-looking member of the European community, recognized for stepping away from nuclear weapons, and  acknowledged for a flourishing, developing economy.  I trust that relations between the  Ukraine and the United States will  continue to strengthen. The elections  in the Ukraine mark a kind of fork in  the road for U.S. foreign policy. We can  move down the road toward mutually  beneficial relations with Russia and all  of the former Soviet republics and allies in Eastern Europe, or we can return to the kind of relationships which  characterized the Cold War.  I believe our choice ought to be clear:  strong and peaceful relationships, rejecting all interference in the internal  affairs of other states; mutually beneficial relationships based on fair trade;  strict observance of international law;  cultural and scientific cooperation; and  people-to-people interaction.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I commend the  people  of  the  Ukraine  for  demonstrating what democracy can and  should really mean, and that is rule by  the people.  ",2005
27,House,109,-0.328,5,2005-01-25,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank the gentleman from California  (Mr. LANTOS) and the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. HYDE) for their leadership  on bringing this resolution forward. It  is a very important moment in the history of the Ukraine.  I also want to congratulate my colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. SMITH) for his leadership on the  Helsinki Commission that has consistently raised the issue of fair and transparent elections among the member  states for the Organization of Security  and Cooperation in Europe.  I  want  to  congratulate  Viktor  Yushchenko  and  the  people  of  the  Ukraine on the fair and transparent  run-off elections on December 26. What  is very noteworthy is just 5 weeks earlier, that country had a run-off election that was marked by widespread  fraud.  After that election on November 21,  something happened  in the Ukraine.  The spirit of democracy that we have  seen in so many of the former republics  of the Soviet Union finally made its  way to the Ukraine. The support from  the United States was instrumental in  bringing  about  a  change  in  the  Ukraine. The support within the OSCE  in  insisting  that  its member  states  comply with requirements of the fair  and transparent elections also helped.  The will of the people prevailed.  All of us remember what happened in  Independence Square in Kiev known as  the  Orange  Revolution.  It  gave  strength to their country to seek freedom and fair elections. It gave strength  to their institutions, and on December  3, the Supreme Court ruled the November 21 election invalid.  Now the Ukraine has  followed the  lead  of  the  former Soviet  republic  Georgia in their Revolution of Roses to  bring about a fair election process, but,  Mr. Speaker,  there  is a hard  task  ahead. They have to overcome the dual  legacy of corruption and disregard for  the rule of law.  I know I speak for every person of  this Chamber that if Ukraine follows  the path of democracy and respect for  human rights, as they showed in this  past election, they will have this body,  they will have this Nation on their side  as they fight to develop a democratic  system within their country.  I applaud this resolution. I strongly  support it. I urge my colleagues to support it.

28,House,109,-0.343,12,2005-01-25,Ms. SCHWARTZ of Pennsylvania.,"  Madam Speaker, I rise with profound  gratitude to the people of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District  for  electing me to represent them in Congress. As the daughter of a Holocaust  survivor, I am honored that my first  opportunity  to  speak on  the House  floor  is on an  issue so close to my  heart.  My colleagues, the gentleman from  California (Mr. LANTOS) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), I  and so many others stand today in remembrance of the 6 million Jews who  lost  their  lives  during  the Second  World War, many of whom were our  aunts and uncles, mothers and fathers,  friends and loved ones.  My mother, Renee Perl, was one of  the many who  fled their homeland.  Forced to start anew at the young age  of 14, she left Austria alone, spending  time in Holland and England before arriving in Philadelphia at the age of 16  in 1941. Once arriving on the shores of  America, my mother,  like  so many  Jews, was hesitant to tell her story,  hoping that by trying to forget about  the war, the violence, the dislocation,  the fear she could move on. Yet once in  the United States, those who survived  the Holocaust could not hide  their  gratitude and love for this country, relishing  the opportunity and  freedom  granted to them as new Americans. My  own love and respect for our country  and my belief in our responsibility to  each other stems in great part from  this strong sense of patriotism.  Elie Wiesel once said, ‘‘We should all  respect the uniqueness, the originality,  the specificity in one another.’’ It was  leaders like Mr. Wiesel who inspired  Jews to acknowledge the importance of  remembering, of telling the stories, so  as to never  let a Holocaust happen  again.  My colleagues, what makes our country great is we respect differences: ethnic, religious, race, gender, geographic  and political; that we have a government that reflects and embraces our  Nation’s broad diversity; and that we,  as a community, are afforded opportunities to recall the good and the dark  times in our shared history.  Madam Speaker, I am tremendously  grateful  for being able to share my  family’s story, to know my mother  would be proud to know that we were  not only paying tribute to those who  suffered tremendous pain and hardship,  but to recall the Jewish people’s great  spirit to survive, continued  faith  in  God, and unwavering belief in freedom  and democracy.

29,House,109,-0.345,26,2005-01-25,Mr. HIGGINS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in strong support of H. Res. 39 offered by the  gentleman from California, commending countries and organizations  for marking  the 60th  anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and  urging a strengthening of the fight against racism, intolerance, bigotry, prejudice, discrimination, and anti-Semitism. I thank my colleague,  Mr. LANTOS, for bringing this important resolution to the floor today.  The lessons of January 27, 1945 are forever  with us. That day and the many days of liberation afterwards showed us of the fight which  exists to make sure that the world strengthens  its efforts to fight against any form of discrimination.  There  is great danger  in being  inactive  about the threat of anti-Semitism. It was anti-  Semitism that was responsible for the horrors  of the Holocaust, for the death of over 6 million Jews, and for the slaughter of over 1.1  million people at Auschwitz.  Sadly, even  though we have reached  the  60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz,  anti-Semitism in Europe has been on the rise.  Once again, we witness evil propaganda,  physical attacks against Jews, the burning of  Jewish sites and  the desecration of synagogues. We must not stand aside and ignore  this grave escalation of anti-Semitic violence  and hatred.  We also saw the shadow of this anti-Semitism yesterday at the special session of the  United Nations’ General Assembly. Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and  foreign ministers from Israel and a number of  European  countries  spoke  to many empty  seats in the General Assembly chamber while  they delivered powerful and often moving addresses about  intolerance and genocide. Of  the 191 members of  the General Assembly,  only 138 agreed with the proposal by the U.S.  to hold the special day of commemoration. We  must wonder why, after all these years, there  are over 50 countries which did not agree to  this most basic proposal to recognize a day  which will forever be etched in our minds.  Any government whose people exhibit any  act of anti-Semitism must provide security and  safety to their Jewish communities, must prosecute and punish perpetrators of anti-Semitic  violence, and must cultivate a climate in which  all  forms of anti-Semitism and discrimination  are rejected.  Mass violence,  the abuse of  fundamental  human rights, and the mistreatment of human  beings as a result of discrimination are ugly  faces of our humanity. Apart from the Holocaust,  the genocides  in Turkey, Cambodia,  Tibet, and Bosnia, the killing of the Tutsi in  Rwanda, the slaying of thousands in Sudan,  and  the deaths of millions during  the  Irish  Famine, are all instances of oppression and  prejudice succeeding  throughout our history.  The complacency and inaction of governments  around  the world, standing silently by while  discrimination grows, is inexcusable.  Today must be used as a day of education,  since without education, there can be no real  change. Teachers throughout the world must  have  the  support of  their governments  to  teach their students the lessons of the Holocaust and of all discrimination. Our grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and generations  to come must be made to understand that racial, ethnic, and religious intolerance and prejudice can lead to the genocide carried out in  camps such as Auschwitz, and these intolerances will never have a place  in our world  again.

31,House,109,0.16,33,2005-01-25,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr.  Speaker,  yesterday,  100,000  human  rights advocates endured the numbing  cold and snow in a great witness for  life here in our Nation’s Capital. Their  presence on behalf of those who have  no voice of their own was truly inspiring. It was gratifying beyond words to  see so many teenagers full of idealism  and  full of compassion and  love  for  their littlest brothers and sisters and  for all human life that is at risk.  Indeed, Mr. Speaker,  the  pro-life  movement is the greatest human rights  movement on Earth.  b1945  ",2005

47,Senate,109,-0.395,68,2005-01-25,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, the President’s nomination of Dr. Condoleezza  Rice to be Secretary of State presents  the Senate with a difficult decision. Dr.  Rice will bring an impressive set of  public policy and academic credentials  to the job of Secretary of State. Her  personal story  is  inspiring. Nonetheless, Dr. Rice’s record on Iraq gives me  great concern.  In her public statements, she clearly  overstated and exaggerated the intelligence concerning Iraq before the war  in order to support the President’s decision  to  initiate military  action  against Iraq. Since the Iraq effort has  run into great difficulty, she has also  attempted to revise history as to why  we went into Iraq.  I approach this issue as the ranking  member of the Armed Services Committee and as a member of the Intelligence Committee. Both committees  have devoted a great deal of time over  the last 2 years to issues concerning  Iraq, including the Intelligence Committee  inquiry  into  prewar  intelligence.  These inquiries indicated major problems with the intelligence on Iraq and  how it was exaggerated or misused to  make the case to the American people  of  the need  to  initiate  an  attack  against Iraq. Dr. Rice is a major player  in that effort—a frequent and highly  visible public voice.  Dr. Rice is not directly responsible  for the  intelligence  failures prior to  the Iraq war. The intelligence community’s many failures are catalogued in  the 500-page report of the Senate Intelligence Committee. But Dr. Rice is responsible for her own distortions and  exaggerations of the intelligence which  was provided to her.  Here are a few of those exaggerations  and distortions.  One of the most well known was the  allegation that Iraq was trying to obtain uranium from Africa, which was  cited to demonstrate that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. But our intelligence community  did not believe it was true, and took  numerous actions to make its concerns  known—even urging the British not to  publish the allegation in September of  2002.  So how did it happen that President  Bush in his January 28, 2003, State of  the Union speech said that ‘‘The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa’’?  When the CIA saw a draft of the  President’s Cincinnati speech for October 7, 2002, it asked the White House to  delete  the allegation  that  Iraq had  been seeking uranium from Africa, and  the White House did remove the reference entirely.  On October 5, 2002, the CIA sent a  memo explaining its views to Steven  Hadley, Dr. Rice’s deputy. It sent another memo to Dr. Rice and to Mr.  Hadley on October 6, again expressing  doubt about the reports of Iraq’s attempt to get uranium from Africa.  Finally, George Tenet, the Director  of Central Intelligence himself, personally called Mr. Hadley to urge that the  uranium allegation be removed  from  the speech—which it was.  This was not just some routine staff  action or a low-level CIA analyst who  called the National Security Council.  It was a memorandum from the CIA to  Dr. Rice, and the Director of Central  Intelligence himself who  called Dr.  Rice’s deputy to make it clear what his  concerns were and to request the removal of the allegation.  Yet just 31⁄2months later the White  House put the African uranium allegation back into a draft of the State of  the Union speech. That draft made no  mention of the British. It was a reference like the one that was removed  from  the Cincinnati  speech  a  few  months before. It asserted in that draft  what purported to be the view of the  U.S. Government—that Iraq had been  trying to obtain uranium from Africa.  According to Director Tenet, shortly  before the speech was delivered, the  CIA received portions of the draft of  the State of the Union to review, including the allegation about uranium  from Africa. A senior CIA staff member  called the National Security Council  staff to repeat his concerns about the  allegation.  Instead of  removing  the  text from the speech, the National Security Council and the White House  changed the text to make reference to  the British view, suggesting, of course,  that the United States believed the  British view to be accurate.  That formula was highly deceptive.  The only reason to say the  ‘‘British  have  learned’’  that Saddam Hussein  was seeking uranium from Africa was  to create the impression that we believed it.  But our intelligence community did  not believe  it. Indeed, they had attempted to dissuade the British from  publishing  the  allegation  in  September, and  they  successfully made  several high-level  interventions with  the White House in October to have the  allegation  removed  from  the President’s Cincinnati speech. Concerning  the British report, Director Tenet said  the CIA ‘‘differed with the British on  the reliability of the uranium reporting.’’  What was the role of Dr. Rice in all  of this? I asked her in my questions for  the record whether she was aware the  intelligence  community  had  doubts  about the credibility of the reports,  and if not, how she could not know,  given all of the activity prior to the  President’s  October  7  Cincinnati  speech, including the memo to her.  In response, Dr. Rice said, ‘‘I do not  recall  reading or  receiving  the CIA  memo,’’ and  ‘‘I do not recall  Intelligence Community concerns about the  credibility of reports about Iraq’s attempts to obtain uranium from Africa  either at the time of the Cincinnati  speech  or  the State  of  the Union  speech.’’  Frankly,  I am  surprised and disappointed that the National Security  Adviser would not remember an issue  of this magnitude.  However, it was not only the President who made that allegation, Dr.  Rice made it herself in an op-ed in the  New York Times on January 23, 2003, 5  days before the State of the Union  speech, and 31⁄2months after the same  allegation had been removed from the  Cincinnati speech at the CIA’s request.  She wrote that Iraq’s declaration to  the U.N. ‘‘fails to account for or explain Iraq’s efforts to get uranium from  abroad.’’  Another question I asked Dr. Rice for  the record was whether, prior to the  January  2003  State  of  the Union  speech, she had discussed with Steven  Hadley, her Deputy, the choice of wording in that portion of the speech and  whether she was aware that the language had been changed to refer to the  British rather than stating it as the  U.S. Government’s view.  In her  response she said: Yes, I did discuss with Stephen Hadley concerns the intelligence community had about  protecting sources and methods regarding reports on Iraq’s attempts to procure uranium  from Africa. These concerns were addressed  by citing a foreign government service. I do  not recall any discussion of concerns about  the credibility of the report. However, the CIA requested on three  separate occasions that the reference  in the Cincinnati speech be removed  entirely because the CIA had doubts  about the credibility of the reports.  In Dr. Rice’s answers to my questions, while she failed to remember all  the direct interventions by the CIA to  have the uranium allegation removed  from the President’s Cincinnati speech,  including a CIA memo to her, she instead relied on a single sentence from  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:04 Jan 26, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A25JA6.007 S25PT1 ",2005

49,Senate,109,0.239,96,2005-01-25,Mr. VOINOVICH.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to join Chairman LUGARand  other members of the Foreign Relations Committee to express my strong  support  for  the  nomination  of  Condoleezza Rice to serve as our next  Secretary of State.  Dr. Rice has the qualifications, the  educational background, and professional experience to serve as an outstanding Secretary of State. She is an  academic expert of the former Soviet  Union, earning her doctorate before the  age of 30, and rising to serve as provost  of Stanford University before turning  40. Her experience as provost at Stanford University allowed her to have  substantial management experience.  In addition to her experience in academia, Dr. Rice is an experienced professional  in  the  national  security  arena. She served as Director of Soviet  and Eastern European Affairs at the  National Security Council under the  administration of President George H.  W. Bush and most recently as the National Security Adviser to President  George W. Bush.  Dr. Rice brings a great deal of talent,  skill, and intellect to the table. As our  country continues to confront global  challenges  in  Iraq, Afghanistan, and  other parts of the world, it is essential  our Secretary of State have the stature, skill, and ability to help protect  our national security interests and promote the President’s vision of freedom  and democracy abroad that he so eloquently communicated in his inaugural  address.  This Senator from Ohio shares the  President’s vision. This vision must be  successful so our children and grandchildren are able to live in a country  free from the fear of terrorism.

50,Senate,109,-0.328,110,2005-01-25,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to reflect on an important and  meaningful anniversary that is being  commemorated worldwide this week.  Two days from now, January 27, 2005,  will mark 60 years since the liberation  of Auschwitz, the concentration and  death camp at which over 1.1 million  innocent men, women, and children  were murdered at the hands of the  Nazis.  As many of my colleagues know, I  have long felt a very deep and personal  connection to the tragedy of the Holocaust. My father, who would later serve  two terms in this body, was the Executive Trial Counsel at the Nuremberg  trials of Nazi war criminals.  He left this country for Nuremberg  when I was only 11⁄2years old, and he  spent the next two years poring over  documents and conducting interviews  that  revealed  to him  the  shocking,  staggering process by which over 6 million people were systematically killed.  He  found himself  face to  face with  many of the men who had planned and  carried out Hitler’s ‘‘Final Solution.’’  He  found himself asking, wondering  how so many human beings many of  whom had loving families of their own,  had been educated in universities, had  enjoyed the fine arts how could they  possibly conceive and execute a mass  murder on an unimaginable scale? How  was it that only a tiny sliver of a minority in Europe stood up against a  plan to wipe out that continent’s entire Jewish population, as well as Gypsies, the disabled, and homosexuals?  And how was it that the United States  and its allies failed to act in time to  save millions of innocent lives?  When my father came home from Europe, he didn’t have answers to those  questions. Indeed, we have continued  asking these questions for the past six  decades. What my father did bring back  from Nuremberg was an unyielding and  firm  conviction  to  teach what  he  learned to as many people as he could,  beginning with the members of his own  family. From an early age, I can remember  learning  from my  father  names  of  people  like  Goebbels,  Mengele, and Eichmann, and places  like Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Treblinka.  As an Irish Catholic boy growing up  in Connecticut, my early education in  the history of the Holocaust was something of an anomaly. Fortunately, this  is no longer the case today. Yet there  are still communities, here in America,  and even more so around the world,  where far too little is known about the  Holocaust. More shockingly still, there  are those individuals and groups which  question or deny the very existence of  the Holocaust a charge that is often  interwoven with the very same poisonous anti-Semitism that led to this  human tragedy.  On this anniversary, therefore, it is  critical not only to remember those  who perished, but to redouble our efforts to enhance and increase awareness of the Holocaust. This is particularly  important  today, as each day  there remain  fewer and  fewer  living  witnesses to the Holocaust those who  themselves wore the yellow star and  still have prisoner numbers tattooed on  their arms.  In the effort to keep the memory of  the Holocaust alive, we have an invaluable resource located just a few minutes from here, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. That museum  represents a steadfast commitment by  our Nation to ensure that the Holocaust will never, ever fade away into  the mist of history. I  imagine that  most, if not all, of my colleagues have  already visited the museum. I would  certainly urge any of my colleagues  who might not have done so to visit,  and to encourage their staffs and their  constituents who visit our Nation’s  Capital to do the same.  Finally, it is crucial that on this anniversary, we take meaningful steps to  address acts of genocide in our own  time. Today, in the Darfur province of  Sudan, tens of thousands have already  died as a result of a murderous ethnic  cleansing  campaign  by  the  government-supported Janjaweed militias. It  is estimated that as many as 350,000  could die in the coming months if action is not taken. Certainly, the sheer  magnitude of the events in Darfur does  not approach that of the Holocaust. On  a  fundamental  level,  however,  the  world is facing the same choice we did  over 60 years go: do we respond to heinous crimes against humanity, or do  we ignore a growing tragedy until it is  far, far too late? This is the challenge  that confronts us today, as we commemorate the liberation of Auschwitz  and the other Nazi death camps to ensure that the cry of ‘‘never again’’ does  not ring tragically hollow.  In closing, Mr. President,  I would  like to note that in addition to the anniversary that we are commemorating  this week, today’s date marks a special  occasion in the Jewish calendar. Today  is the holiday of Tu B’Shvat, the traditional New Year for trees. It heralds  the coming of the spring, and is an occasion for celebrating renewal, transition, and hope. It is my hope that as  Americans and people around the world  reflect on the 60th anniversary of liberation, we can seize this solemn occasion to look towards the future, and to  plant new seeds of hope, tolerance, and  justice among all of humankind.

In early 1945, as American and  British armies closed in on the Third  Reich from the west, Soviet forces were  on the march through Poland. On January 27, they came to a place called  Auschwitz.  In the Nazi death industry, Auschwitz was its most productive factory. It  is estimated that some one and a half  million were murdered there. The victims were Poles, Slavs, Russians, Gypsies, but the majority were Jews. They  died from disease, starvation, exposure  and exhaustion, on the gallows and in  front of the firing squads, but mostly  they were marched into the gas chambers.

52,Senate,109,-0.266,166,2005-01-25,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, I am  proud to introduce the ‘‘Ojito Wilderness Act’’. This bill was passed in various forms by both the Senate and the  House of Representatives in the 108th  Congress. I am pleased that the senior  Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, is cosponsoring this bill.  The support for this proposal truly is  impressive. It has been  formally endorsed by the Governor of New Mexico;  the local Sandoval County Commission  and the neighboring Bernalillo County  Commission;  the  Albuquerque  City  Council; New Mexico House of Representatives Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman James  Roger Madalena; the Governors of the  Pueblos of Zia, Santa Ana, Santo Domingo, Cochiti, Tesuque, San Ildefonso,  Pojoaque, Nambe, Santa Clara, San  Juan, Sandia, Laguna, Acoma, Isleta,  Picuris, and Taos; the National Congress of American Indians; the Hopi  Tribe; The Wilderness Society; the New  Mexico Wilderness Alliance; the Coalition for New Mexico Wilderness, on behalf of more than 375 businesses and organizations; the Rio Grande Chapter of  the Sierra Club; the National Parks  Conservation Association;  the Albuquerque Convention and Visitors Bureau; 1000 Friends of New Mexico; and  numerous individuals.  The Ojito provides a unique wilderness area that is important not only to  its local stewards, but also to the nearby residents of Albuquerque and Santa  Fe, as well as visitors from across the  country. It is an outdoor geology laboratory,  offering  a  spectacular  and  unique opportunity to view from a single location the juxtaposition of the  southwestern margin  of  the Rocky  Mountains, the Colorado Plateau, and  the Rio Grande Rift, along with the  volcanic necks of the Rio Puerco Fault.  Its rugged terrain offers a rewarding  challenge to hikers, backpackers, and  photographers.  It  shelters  ancient  Puebloan ruins and an endemic endangered plant, solitude and inspiration.  Designating Ojito as a wilderness area  ensures that the beauty of this special  place will be protected and enjoyed for  years to come.  I have made a number of changes to  this bill in order clarify a number of  issues and to facilitate its enactment,  and  I hope that  it will be enacted  quickly.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of the bill I have introduced today  be printed in RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows: S. 156  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

Mr. Rosenberg  died January 11, 2005, at the age of 84.  A graduate of Milwaukee’s Riverside High  School, Jack Rosenberg went on to serve in  the armed forces in WWII before settling into  a long and successful business career. He led  several corporate entities, and retired in 1995  after  overseeing  the  national  franchise  of  TeleCheck for over 18 years.  Throughout his life Jack maintained a strong  commitment to improving life in the City of Milwaukee. He had a great variety of  interests  and he never hesitated to offer hands-on leadership when needed. His  concern  for  the  needs of low income families is evident in his  work with the COA Youth and Family Center.  He  received  the Grand Avenue Leadership  Award in recognition of his efforts to provide  work opportunities and cultural experiences for  people with disabilities. Several noted small  businesses benefited from a loan fund he endowed with the Wisconsin Women’s Business  Initiative Corporation.  His financial contributions to productive non-  profit organizations working  in  the areas of  arts, civil liberties, entrepreneurship, and education are too numerous to list.  It saddens me to note the passing of such  a committed and distinguished individual. I am  pleased to have this opportunity to recognize  Jack  for  these profound contributions  to so  many  individuals, as well as  the entire Milwaukee community.  f  CONGRATULATING THE ST.

56,,109,0.433,194,2005-01-25,Mr. GRAVES.," Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause  to recognize Ryan Gary Frazer, a very special  young man who has exemplified  the  finest  qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 45, and in earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Ryan  is currently a senior at Central High School in Saint  Joseph, Missouri, and is the son of Gary and  Sandy Frazer.  Ryan began his scouting career as a Tiger  Cub Scout before advancing to Webelo Scout.  After  completing Cub Scouts, Ryan  rose  through the ranks of the Boy Scouts, achieving  the  ranks of Tenderfoot, Second Class  Scout, First Class Scout, Star Scout, Life  Scout, and now Eagle Scout. Ryan served his  troop in numerous leadership positions, including Librarian, Historian, Scribe, and Patrol  Leader. Along the way, Ryan earned 24 merit  badges  and  several  awards  including  the  Arrow of Light Award and the 50 Miler Award  on  three separate occasions  for Adventure  Trips  to Wyoming, Mississippi, and Philmont  Scout Ranch in New Mexico. Ryan is also a  member of the Tribe of Mic–O–Say, where he  holds the name ‘‘Ice Badger.’’  For his Eagle Scout project, Ryan  led a  team of volunteers  that  renovated  the children’s playground area at Ashland United  Methodist Church in Saint Joseph. The playground area is an integral part of Church life,  as it sits in the center of the Ashland United  Methodist’s courtyard; the playground is used  by children attending numerous church classes and activities. Ryan and his  team spent  over 100 hours completing this project.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  commending Ryan Gary Frazer for his accomplishments with  the Boy Scouts of America  and for his efforts put forth in achieving the  highest distinction of Eagle Scout.  FILIPINO VETERANS’ EQUITY ACT  INTRODUCTION  HON. RANDY ‘‘DUKE’’ CUNNINGHAM  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 25, 2005  ",2005
57,,109,0.411,194,2005-01-25,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  introduce the Filipino Veterans Equity Act, bipartisan legislation which would grant full recognition of the service and sacrifices of a key  group of veterans and return to them the benefits promised  to  them by  the U.S. government.  On  July  26,  1941, President Roosevelt  issued a military order, calling members of the  Philippine Commonwealth Army into the service of  the United States Forces of  the Far  East, under the command of then Lieutenant  General Douglas MacArthur.  From 1941 to 1945, over 100,000 Filipinos  of the Philippine Commonwealth Army fought  alongside the allies to reclaim the Philippine  Islands from Japan. A second group of Filipino  veterans, the New Philippine Scouts (or ‘‘Special Philippine Scouts’’) enlisted under U.S.  Armed Forces  command  after October  6,  1945. Regrettably, instead of fulfilling promises  made and providing equal benefits  in return  for  their service, Congress enacted  the Rescission Act of 1946. The Rescission Act limited Filipino veterans’ eligibility for service-connected disability pensions, death benefits, and  other benefits provided to U.S. Armed Forces  veterans.  Correcting  this  inequity  is  long overdue.  There are  less  than 50,000 survivors of  the  total estimated 300,000 Filipino veterans who  served during World War  II. Approximately  20,000 of these survivors are not receiving the  full benefits they earned. By 2010, the VA estimates  there will only be a  total of 20,000  World War II Filipino veterans in all categories.  I urge my colleagues to join me in moving this  legislation forward in the 109th Congress, and  working with me  to provide  these deserving  veterans the benefits they deserve.  f  HONORING DONALD A.

Major General Matheson’s life-long dedication to military  service will  forever remind us of  the  importance of courage and dedication, even in trying times.  Born  in Seattle, Major General Matheson  and his  family moved  to Monterey  in 1920.  After graduating from UCLA, he was commissioned as a second  lieutenant  in  the U.S.  Army. During World War  II, Major General  Matheson participated in D–Day at Normandy,  the liberation of Holland, the storm of Hitler’s  ‘‘Eagle Nest’’ and  the defense of Bastogne.  The heroics of his unit were  forever  immortalized by historian Stephen Ambrose  in  the  1992 novel ‘‘Band of Brothers.’’  During  the Korean War, Major General  Matheson continued to play key roles in major  military operations, such as  the amphibious  landings at Inchon and Wonsan. In the Vietnam War, he commanded the 1st Brigade of  the 101st Airborne Division and participated in  the Tet Offensive. Major General Matheson  continued his military career in Korea in the  late 1960s by commanding  the 2nd  Infantry  Division along the demilitarized zone.  Mr. Speaker,  I wish  to  remember Major  General Matheson for his distinguished career.  His contribution  to our country  is  immeasurable. MG Salve H. Matheson has left a legacy of leadership and service to his community that will not soon be forgotten. While he  will be sorely missed, his life will continue to  inspire those he touched.  f  HONORING WILLIAM SAFIRE  HON.

This  week marks the last of his columns on the Op-  Ed page of the New York Times, closing out  one of  the most  respected,  thoughtful and  longest-running series of commentaries in the  history of American media.  Bill Safire has worn many hats throughout  his career, starting out as a radio and  television producer,  then as a U.S. Army correspondent, and later as a speechwriter and  political strategist in the Nixon Administration.  Bill Safire is best known, though, for his column which  first appeared  in  the New York  Times in 1973. Even among the all-star line-  up at  the Times, Bill Safire’s  star  shines  brightly, as he stands out among the Nation’s  most celebrated and thought-provoking writers  in the newspaper business.  While we might find ourselves on opposite  sides of a policy or political debate, I have always enjoyed  reading Bill Safire’s opinions.  I’ve also looked forward to his Sunday column,  ‘‘On Language,’’ in the Times’ Magazine which  has spun off into 10 books and ranked him  among  the world’s most widely  read commentators on English grammar, etymology and  usage.  I am sure  that Bill’s wife, Helene, will be  glad to have him around more often and to  spend more time with their two children and  granddaughter. While the rest of us will miss  his words of wisdom, his  thoughtful  insight,  and the discussion prompted by his opinions,  we can still look forward to his ‘‘On Language’’  column each Sunday, and hopefully, well into  the future.  Mr. Speaker, I wish the best of luck to Bill  and  his  family  during  his  retirement  and  throughout his future endeavors, including his  ongoing written works and as chair of  the  Dana Foundation, a philanthropic organization  promoting science, health, and education, particularly  in  the area of brain  research. Bill  Safire’s voice  in America’s commentary will  not be easily replaced, and I am among the  many devoted  readers who will miss him  dearly.  f  IN HONOR OF CHARLIE J.  FABYANSKI  HON.

Mr. Fabyanski was honored at a dinner  dance for the Richard A. Rutkowski Association’s 26th anniversary gala on January 15,  2005, in Bayonne, New Jersey.  Mr. Fabyanski has  served  the Bayonne  community in a variety of capacities. For more  than ten years, he has worked as the institutional  representative  of St. Andrew’s Boy  Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Sea Scouts. He has  also graciously volunteered his  time at  the  Special Olympics  of Hudson County,  the  Windmill Center, the Highways programs, and  as an usher at church.  A  leader  in  many  organizations,  Mr.  Fabyanski has been a trustee of Hudson Milestone, president of the Hudson Ability Bowling  League, treasurer of the Bayonne Friends of  the Handicapped, secretary of St. Andrew’s  Holy Name Society, and past president of his  parish’s seniors’ group.  Mr. Fabyanski’s honorable service has extended well beyond the Bayonne community.  A veteran of World War II, he bravely served  his country as an army sergeant and fought in  the infamous battles of Normandy and St. Lo.  As a licensed state engineer, he worked for  25 years as a supervisor of air conditioning  and refrigeration at the former Military Ocean  Terminal. Mr. Fabyanski graduated  from  the  Lincoln Technical  Institute and  is  the proud  parent of two sons and two grandchildren.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Charlie J.

His  deep commitment to serving others is well respected and his work has positively impacted  the lives of those in his community.  IN HONOR OF MEL VERCOE  HON.

Mayor  Coceano, who was known as the ‘‘Matriarch of  Miramar,’’ died at the age of 81. She was a  remarkable leader in many ways, a proactive  and energetic public servant and a Mayor with  an open door policy who spoke her mind on  the dais.  Mayor Coceano  first became  involved  in  politics after a hurricane damaged her back  yard in 1960 and she couldn’t find the mayor  at the time for help. She fought the city and  her developer before running for the commission in 1966, a bid she lost.  She ran again in 1977 and won. She became one of Broward County’s most recognizable and outspoken politicians during her 22  years  in public office. During her  tenure as  Miramar’s Mayor, Coceano oversaw landmark  changes as the city grew from a sleepy bedroom community with cow pastures and vast  tracts of empty land to a Broward boomtown,  home to WTVJ–NBC 6 and a host of national  companies.  Her accomplishments  included weakening  her own job, using a city manager to run the  city and raising money in the 1980s to build  the youth center that now bares her named.

65,,109,0.229,215,2005-01-25,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to the  Rotary Club of Brandywine as they celebrate  their 50th anniversary  in  the State of Delaware.  While serving as the Vice President of the  Phoenix Steel Corporation, Otis Zwissler chartered the Rotary Club of Brandywine on March  8, 1955. Over its 50-year history, the Rotary  Club has raised more than $500,000 dollars to  benefit numerous service projects, both locally  and internationally. During this time, the Rotary Club has engaged in efforts to eradicate  polio, and has been  involved  in numerous  community  food drives. The Rotary Club of  Brandywine recently aided in the construction  of the Can-Do Playground, which will enable  disabled children to join with the rest of their  friends in a common play area. In addition, the  Rotary Club has hosted many well-known  guest speakers over the years, including the  former United States Secretary of Housing  and Urban Development and  first Cuban-  American ever elected  to  the United States  Senate, Senator Mel Martinez; all of the current and several previous members of  the  Delaware federal delegation; the current Governor of Delaware, as well as many previous  Governors; and the President of Rotary International.  The 46 members of  the Rotary Club of  Brandywine are part of the Delaware Eastern  Shore of Maryland Rotary District. This district  contains 2,000 Rotarians, and is one of over  31,000 worldwide  clubs  in  160  countries.  Globally, over 1.2 million people take part in  Rotary Club activities.  The Rotary Club of Brandywine’s accomplishments and service to the State of Delaware deserve  to be recognized and  I commend the club on their great efforts to support  others in our community. I look forward to the  Rotary Club of Brandywine’s continued success. Its contribution in Delaware should serve  as an example to us all.  f  H.R. 304—AIRCRAFT CARRIER END-  STRENGTH ACT  HON.

66,,109,0.333,215,2005-01-25,Mr. CRENSHAW.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to introduce H.R. 304—the Aircraft Carrier End  Strength Act. Recently, in a last ditch effort to  reach OMB budgetary goals, the Department  of  the Defense approved drastic cuts  in  the  Navy’s Fiscal Year 2006 budget. Only one of  these cuts is both operationally unsound AND  irreversible  . . .  that  is  the reduction  in  the  Navy’s fleet of aircraft carriers from twelve to  eleven.  This decision was not made by the military  and policy experts who are now working on  the 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR).  This irreversible decision was made by budget  crunchers looking to reduce the budget topline  without considering all of the operational impacts. Congress has worked hard to re-build  our national defense architecture and now is  not the time to retreat. That is why I have introduced legislation, H.R. 304, which will ensure that the Navy maintains their current minimum requirement of twelve aircraft carriers.  Just  last year,  the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Vern Clark, stated;  ‘‘Aircraft  carrier force levels have been set at 12 ships  as a result of fiscal constraints; however, real-  world experience and analysis indicate that a  carrier  force  level of 15 ships  is necessary  . . .’’ And in 2001, then-Vice Admiral Timothy  J. Keating stated, ‘‘The United States needs  15 carriers to provide continuous combat-credible sovereign presence  in each area of responsibility. . . . The United States accepts a  risk by leaving areas of the world uncovered  at times.’’  Over  the  last  few  years, Congress has  heard a consistent message from the Department of Defense—the important tactical missions accomplished  in Afghanistan and  Iraq  would not have been possible without our fleet  of aircraft carriers. Aircraft carriers are in constant demand all over the globe and there is  no technology that will allow them to be in two  places at the same time. In the face of terrorist threats and other dangers that this nation is facing and with the proven operational  need of aircraft carriers, now is not the time  for  the Navy  to contemplate decreasing  the  number of aircraft carriers available for our national security strategy.  Please support H.R. 304—the Aircraft Carrier End-Strength Act.  VerDate Aug 04 2004  06:09 Jan 26, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A25JA8.108 E25PT1 ",2005
67,Senate,109,-0.45,5,2005-02-03,Mrs. BOXER.," The President’s solution to Social Security is to borrow,  borrow, borrow,  throwing us deeper  into debt. I will tell you, this is not  going to happen under our watch.  I will show you one more chart very  quickly.  The plan the President has talked  about a lot results in benefit cuts of 45  percent. The average yearly payment  for a widow would only be $5,700. Who  can live on that? Certainly not those of  us here or those in the White House.  Widows would be 35-percent below the  poverty  line  if  the President’s plan  goes into effect.  We think Social Security Plus is a  place we can start. Keep Social Security  and  strengthen  it,  as Ronald  Reagan did. We can work together to  do that for our young people. I think  we can solve this problem and keep one  of the greatest programs ever known in  the history of our country.  I thank the Senator from Maryland.  ",2005

We are going to continue our debate  with the other Democratic women.  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?  ",2005
69,Senate,109,-0.325,5,2005-02-03,Ms. STABENOW.," Mr. President,  I  thank the dean of our women in the  Senate, the woman who was first and  blazed the way for all of us, the distinguished  Senator  from Maryland.  I  thank her so much for her leadership  on this and other issues.  Our dean has said so many times,  honor thy father and thy mother. They  are not just important words in the  Bible, but they are important words to  live by. This debate about Social Security certainly reflects our values  in  honoring our fathers and our mothers.  So I thank her for that.  I rise with my colleagues to speak  today about  the greatest American  success story of our time, Social Security. Prior to Social Security, 50 percent of our retirees lived in poverty.  Today, it is 10 percent. If that is not a  great American success story, I don’t  know what is.  We are here unified to say that we  want to keep that success story by  keeping the ‘‘security’’ in Social Security. That is what this is about. We  join in advocating for additional ways  for people to save. I know my 20-something-year-old  children are  tired of  hearing from me about the fact that  they need to be putting dollars aside  for the future and not just rely on Social Security.  There are ways we can come  together.  I was,  frankly, disappointed  last evening that we did not hear more  from the President about ways we can  come together to be able to develop  those opportunities  for  everyone  to  create wealth and retirement security.  But we don’t do that by undermining  the ‘‘security’’ of Social Security. Social Security represents the best of  who we are, the best in American values. Our belief is that if you work hard  and you play by the rules, you earn retirement security. We pay into that,  all of us together pay into this insurance policy called Social Security. We  deserve a basic quality of life and dignity in older years. Everyone does. And  that comes from a joint community effort called Social Security, into which  we all pay.  I think it is also important to look at  the fact that Social Security is not  just about tomorrow. It is an insurance  policy, whether you are a 25-year-old  like my daughter who is starting a career or you are a 78-year-old like my  mother, whom I can barely keep up  with, and who  is  in her retirement  years. The fact is, Social Security is  there for both of them. Heaven forbid  that something were to happen to one  of my children and they become permanently disabled. But Social Security  would be there as a disability policy.  When they have children, if something  were to happen and they would no  longer be able to care for their children, Social Security steps in as a life  insurance policy.  Think about it. This great American  success story is a retirement policy, a  life insurance policy, and a disability  policy. We all do this together. That is  what the ‘‘I’’ in FICA means. It is an  insurance system.  We want to build upon that just as  Federal employees are able to build  upon  that with  thrift  savings, and  there are others, such as 401(k)s, and so  on.  By the way, that is on top of Social  Security—not in the place of Social Security.  But we stand here today, particularly  because we know this insurance plan is  of particular importance to women in  the country. In fact, 60 percent of all  Social Security recipients are women;  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:47 Dec 28, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\S03FE5.REC S03FE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2005
70,Senate,109,0.363,12,2005-02-03,Mrs. DOLE.," Mr. President, we must  do everything possible  to  show our  military men and women and  their  families how much we appreciate and  honor their service. Last week I was  proud to cosponsor  legislation  introduced by Senators ALLEN, SESSIONSand  reaffirming  the  commitment of this Congress to our military  men and women and their  families.  This effort has received my strongest  support, and thanks to the endorsement of the Leadership and the work  over the past years by many of my  other colleagues, an increase in financial support to the families of men and  women killed in combat could soon be  a reality.  When a soldier pays the ultimate sacrifice, no amount of money can ease  the grief of his or her family, but a significant increase in the benefits paid to  our military families sends a strong  message of our gratitude and support.  Currently, when a service member is  killed in combat, the family receives  only $12,420. This is simply unacceptable. We are a strong, prosperous Nation, a Nation that honors and respects  our sons and daughters in the Armed  Services. We can and must do better to  provide for the families of those who’ve  lost their lives. The current proposal to  increase what is called the ‘‘death gratuity’’ to $100,000 is most certainly a  step in the right direction.  This increase, retroactive to October  2001, is critically important not only to  the families who lose loved ones, but to  soldiers currently serving or those who  are considering enlisting. It sends the  message that we value their service,  and should something happen to them,  their families will be generously cared  for.

Schubert, of the 1st Battalion 3rd Marine  Regiment, was killed on January 26,  2005 when his helicopter crashed during  a sandstorm near Ar Rutbah, Iraq. The  helicopter carried Corporal Schubert  and  thirty other Marines who were  part of a security mission to aid in the  safe conduct of  the national democratic elections last Sunday. He is survived  by  his  mother,  Cheryl  Winklepeck, a sister, Elizabeth Householder, and a brother, Matt. Corporal  Schubert died one day before his 23rd  birthday.  A native of Cherokee, IA, Cpl. Schubert attended Washington High School  and went on to continue his studies at  Kirkwood Community College  in the  fall of 2001. Just weeks after the terrorist attacks on September 11, Nathan  Schubert enlisted in the Marines to fulfill what he saw as his patriotic duty.  Describing Corporal Schubert  as  a  friendly, likable, and patriotic young  man, his brother noted that he ‘‘lived  life to the fullest.’’  I ask all of my colleagues in this  body and all Americans to remember  with respect, admiration, and gratitude  this courageous Marine who made the  ultimate sacrifice in the name of the  principles we value most as Americans:  freedom, democracy, and justice. Corporal Schubert died honorably while  supporting and defending these values  by aiding the birth and development of  democracy in Iraq. He is to be commended for his bravery as he joins the  honorable ranks of those Americans  who have gone before him in service of  their country.

76,Senate,109,0.257,75,2005-02-03,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I rise  today with my  colleague,  Senator  BINGAMAN, to introduce legislation to  address a serious problem in the State  of New Mexico. State case  law currently holds that the State of New  Mexico does not have jurisdiction to  prosecute crimes that occur on privately held  land within the exterior  boundaries of a Pueblo. Federal case  law holds that the Federal Government  does not have jurisdiction to prosecute  crimes that occur on these lands. Read  in tandem, these court decisions lead  to  the  result  that neither Federal,  State nor tribal law-enforcement officials have jurisdiction on thousands of  acres of privately owned lands within  the boundaries of Indian pueblos. As a  result, in recent years there have been  stabbings,  criminal  sexual-contact  cases, and aggravated battery charges  that have stalled in court over jurisdiction questions.  The prospect of having lands in my  State where anyone can commit any  crime and not be prosecuted for it is  untenable and something that needs to  be fixed. The legislation I am introducing today clearly outlines who is responsible  for  trying  these cases by  clarifying when a crime should be prosecuted  in Federal,  tribal, or State  court. At the same time, the bill honors tribal sovereignty.  If we do not address this problem, it  will only worsen. This legislation culminates a lot of work among the New  Mexico delegation, the pueblos, and the  State. It is a necessary bill. It is a good  bill. And I hope that my colleagues will  act quickly to clarify jurisdiction over  these lands.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 279  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

Frederick Douglass was  an  American who devoted his life to enacting permanent and positive change  for all Americans by advocating the  abolition of slavery and equal rights  for women.  Born into slavery in 1818 and abandoned by his mother, Frederick Douglass rose above a debilitating situation  to become one of America’s greatest  abolitionists and orators. He escaped  slavery when he was 20 years old by  disguising himself  as  a  sailor. Mr.  Douglass traveled north and settled in  New Bedford, MA where he discovered  the profound impact his oratory and  literary talents had on others.  Always believing in himself and taking advantage of every opportunity he  could, Frederick Douglass set an example for all Americans by working toward  a  greater  purpose  and  racial  equality. He became a respected advisor to President Lincoln, he traveled  extensively in Europe to speak about  his experience in America, and he inspired those he encountered to fight for  better lives for African Americans and  women.

79,Senate,109,0.338,34,2005-02-14,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President, football is a staple in our communities—  bringing families and friends together  and helping to build connections and  affiliations. Fantasy football has taken  the game one step further and individuals can now draft their own team and  compete weekly for the championship.  Fans live and die with their team—  they  sport  their  colors,  sing  their  chants, and collect team memorabilia.  Personally, I have a Pittsburgh Steelers’ ‘‘Terrible Towel’’ behind my desk.  Most significantly, football gives us a  chance to be a part of something bigger  than ourselves.  To that end, I was proud to be a  Pennsylvanian this football season and  to join with others to cheer on the  Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia  Eagles. Both teams had an outstanding  season and did not let their fans down.  The Pittsburgh Steelers, my hometown team, had an incredible season.  This was a historic year for the Black  and Gold having secured the most wins  in Steelers history, the most wins by a  rookie quarterback, and  the  largest  home attendance for a Steelers season.  They also made an appearance in the  AFC championship game.  The Eagles had quite an impressive  year as well, capturing the NFC Championship  and  playing  in  the Super  Bowl.  A day before the big game, Eagles  head coach Andy Reid shared his feelings on being a part of the Super Bowl:  ‘‘This is what it is all about. You want  your football team to have an opportunity  to play  in  the Super Bowl.  You’re here and you’re ready to go. I  think every head coach has that goal.  We’re lucky enough for it to be a reality.’’  The Super Bowl is the pinnacle of  every football season, and it is impressive that the Eagles made it that far.  As I watched the game, it was remarkable to hear the chants of thousands of  Eagles fans in Jacksonville shouting,  ‘‘Fly Eagles Fly’’  and witness  the  amount of support for the Philadelphia  team.  The Eagles had an outstanding Super  Bowl game, and despite the outcome of  the game, should be proud of their efforts. I join the thousands of Eagles  fans and Pennsylvanians in saying that  I was proud to have the Eagles representing Pennsylvania  in the Super  Bowl for the first time since 1981.  What a tremendous season it was to  have both Pennsylvania teams make it  to their respective conference championships. The spirit and enthusiasm of  the fans and the determination of the  players on the field this season was an  incredible sight to behold. I look forward to next season, when both teams  have another chance to represent their  respective Pennsylvania cities and win  big for their fans.  f  LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT  OF 2005  ",2005
80,Senate,109,0.262,34,2005-02-14,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  commemorate  the  life  of  CAPT Frank Albert Manson, an outstanding Virginian who  served  his  country with valor during World War II  and the Korean War. While Captain  Manson passed from this earth on January 20, he has left an exceptional legacy through his humanitarian vision,  his insightful observation of naval conflict, and especially in the hearts of his  loving wife, three children, and ten  grandchildren. His daughter Jennifer  Joy Wilson was a longtime member of  my staff and remains a valued advisor.  Born  in Oklahoma  in  1920, Frank  Manson earned a bachelor of science in  education  from Northeastern Oklahoma State University  in 1941. Following 2 years of teaching at the high-  school level, he attended officer candidate school at Cornell University and  gained his commission for the United  States Navy.  Like many other brave young men  who answered the call of duty in World  War II, then-Lieutenant Manson was  sent to combat in the Pacific Theater.  Appointed as the communications officer on the USS Laffey DD724, he was responsible for providing the media with  the detailed accounts that followed the  Laffey’s triumphant efforts of April 16,  1945. On that fateful day, the ship and  its resilient crew outlasted an attack  of at least twenty-two Japanese aircraft, the worst offensive endured by  any United States ship that remained  afloat. While bombs strafed its deck  and as many as eight planes crashed  into  the  ship,  the Laffey  responded  with courage befitting an American  vessel. Eight planes were shot down,  and another six were harmed despite  the extensive damage inflicted by the  enemy  forces upon  ‘‘the  ship  that  would not die.’’ During his briefing  with reporters covering the war, the  young officer recounted the infamous  words of the Laffey’s commanding officer, LCDR Julius T.

81,Senate,109,-0.351,41,2005-02-14,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, over the  past several years, among the most  challenging issues for this Congress has  been reform of the Nation’s energy policy.  Despite rising fuel costs and growing  dependence on  imported oil, despite  evidence of global warming and concerns about the quality of our air and  water, despite all the recent advances  in  renewable energy  technology, we  hobble along on an energy policy that  is more than a decade out of date.  Fortunately, there are several initiatives in energy policy on which there is  wide bipartisan support.  Perhaps the best example of an idea  on which there is solid agreement is  the importance of developing our hydrogen economy.  Hydrogen has the potential to transform completely the way we think of  transportation, with vehicles that consume no foreign oil, spew no smog, no  toxic emissions, and zero greenhouse  gases. But only if we make it the right  way.  You see, to get energy out of hydrogen, first you have to make it. And the  way we make it is going to make all  the difference to our energy future.  Right now, the main way we make  hydrogen is from natural gas.  Natural gas is a clean-burning fuel,  but its price is volatile. And as a fossil  fuel, it is a finite resource and releases  carbon dioxide and other greenhouse  gases when burned.  Ultimately, we hope to form hydrogen  from pollution-free water, using  wind or solar energy to extract the hydrogen—the H2—from the H2O. But this  technology  is still too expensive to  make a significant contribution to our  energy needs today.  Thanks to research at some of the  country’s leading institutions, including those in my state of Iowa, a cost-effective technology is now available to  produce hydrogen from another clean,  renewable energy source: one that we  grow right here at home.  Hydrogen can now be formed from  ethanol made entirely from corn and  other  agricultural  products  grown  right here on American farms.  Ethanol is an increasingly important  source of fuel. It is made from corn and  other agricultural products from farms  throughout the Midwest and increasingly in other parts of the country. It  is manufactured  in plants  scattered  across rural America, and has become  one of the most important value-added  enterprises for our rural economies.  Today, ethanol is made from corn, as  well as from crop residues, stalks, and  other low-cost biomass.  By blending  ethanol  into  conventional gasoline we reduce our dependence  on  foreign  oil,  support  rural  economies, and make a cleaner-burning  fuel. But even blended fuel produces  some pollution, and we still depend on  imported oil for the gasoline component.  A vital next step is to begin using  ethanol to make hydrogen. Hydrogen  from ethanol produces little in the way  of pollution. Whatever carbon dioxide  is released gets absorbed by next year’s  crop as it grows; and it’s possibly the  most economical way to make renewable hydrogen for the foreseeable future.  Imagine  hydrogen  ‘‘Made  in  the  USA’’ from crops ‘‘Grown in the USA’’  with generating facilities in rural communities in desperate need of jobs and  economic growth.  So why aren’t all of our cars being  converted to run on renewable farm-  based hydrogen? As we all know, the  fuel cells needed to convert that hydrogen efficiently into usable energy are  still years  from being commercially  ready.  However, hydrogen-powered internal  combustion  hybrid  electric  engines  have been developed that can achieve  over 90 percent of the environmental  benefits and 100 percent of the reduced  oil import benefits of fuel cells, and  this technology is ready for demonstration right now.  American businesses are  ready  to  show the world that hydrogen can be  produced  from clean,  farm-based renewable sources, and that renewable  hydrogen can be used as a fuel for our  cars and trucks.  As we debate the bigger picture of  our Nation’s energy policy, we have the  opportunity to make a small investment with huge potential.  Now is the time for a renewable hydrogen  transportation demonstration  program.  I am introducing the Renewable Hydrogen Passenger Vehicle Act of 2005 to  provide a testing ground for renewable  farm-based  hydrogen  transportation  technology. We need to get renewable  hydrogen production out into fueling  stations, where it can be put through  its paces, analyzed and improved for  the day when fuel cells arrive, so we  can supply our fuel cells with clean, renewable hydrogen right from day one.  This bill would authorize $5 million  over three years to develop and demonstrate the cost-effective operation of  a  small  hydrogen-from-ethanol  reformer and a fleet of at least 10 internal combustion hybrid electric vehicles  converted to run on that hydrogen.  The program would allow investors,  manufacturers  and  entrepreneurs  to  see first-hand that clean renewable hydrogen can be cost-effectively produced  from farm-based fuels; that the technology to run our vehicles on renewable hydrogen is here and ready to deploy; and that renewable hydrogen is  ready for the day that fuel cell vehicles  arrive in local showrooms.  The  successful  demonstration will  help stimulate development of hydrogen fueling systems at existing gasoline fueling stations to convert ethanol  to hydrogen onsite,  thereby  significantly accelerating  the adoption of  super-clean domestic renewable hydrogen as an alternative to gasoline made  from imported oil.  It includes monitoring of emissions  and fuel economy data, quick start-up  and rapid deployment—all for a tiny  fraction of the funds already being invested in fuel cell research.  This is not a large or costly initiative, but it is one that has the potential to take us a big step towards a  clean, renewable hydrogen-based economy. I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 373  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Renewable  Hydrogen Passenger Vehicle Act of 2005’’.  SEC.  2.  RENEWABLE HYDROGEN  TRANSPORTATION  DEMONSTRATION  PROGRAM.  (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—  (1) reductions in local air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil imports resulting from the introduction of vehicles with  gasoline-powered internal combustion hybrid  electric engines will be only temporary, as  improved fuel economy of the hybrid vehicles is offset by increases in vehicle miles  traveled;  (2) direct substitution of farm-based renewable fuels for gasoline in gasoline-powered  internal combustion hybrid electric engines  will result in further reductions in local air  pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil  imports;  (3)  for permanent reductions  in criteria  pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil  imports, Congress should establish as a national goal the development of renewable hydrogen as a clean effective energy carrier;  (4) the development of vehicles powered by  hydrogen derived from domestic renewable  resources such as ethanol, energy crops, agricultural waste, landfill gas, municipal solid  waste, wind power, and  solar electricity,  will—  (A) substantially and permanently reduce  local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions;  (B)  improve the energy security of the  United States; and  (C) create domestic jobs;  (5) notwithstanding paragraph (4), as of the  date of enactment of this Act, the fuel cell  technology required to make the most efficient use of renewable hydrogen is too costly  and has not achieved the reliability necessary for consumer acceptance in the near  term;  (6) in the near term (before affordable and  reliable fuel cell vehicles are developed), hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine  hybrid electric vehicles have been developed  that can achieve more than 90 percent of the  environmental benefits and 100 percent of  the oil import reduction benefits of fuel cell  vehicles;  (7) in addition to robust research and development for fuel cell vehicles, a program  to develop and demonstrate renewable hydrogen production and distribution  technology is justified;  (8) reforming ethanol at a vehicle fueling  station may be the least costly method of  producing renewable hydrogen;  (9) a low cost renewable hydrogen vehicle  demonstration program that will yield valuable information regarding an interim transition strategy of using hydrogen-powered  internal combustion engine hybrid electric  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:58 Jan 08, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\S14FE5.REC S14FE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005
82,,109,-0.302,55,2005-02-14,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today because February brings to mind a time  of year dedicated  to hearts  in  the  form of  chocolates,  cards,  candies  and  sweet  mementoes. Very little attention, however, is  given to the health and the condition of the actual heart these candies and mementoes symbolize: the human heart of a loved one. It is  imperative that we pause during this season to  recognize the importance of cardiac health in  our children, families, and loved ones.  There are nearly one million adults and children  living with Congenital Heart Defects  (CHD)  in  the United States alone, and his  number continues  to  rise as nearly 40,000  children are diagnosed each year. Despite  these figures, very little recognition is given to  the victims and families of those suffering from  CHD. Many of the children born with CHD are  not diagnosed until days or even months after  birth. This lack of detection endangers those  who live without knowledge of their illness.  Among the many infants affected, the symptoms drastically range in severity and medical  costs. Some children are barely affected by  their defect, requiring nothing more than occasional monitoring. However,  there are also  families placed under the heavy emotional and  financial burden of a severe heart defect that  requires lifelong medical attention. The cost of  multiple  open  heart  surgeries,  drugs,  and  raised insurance premiums becomes a special  problem for low income families. Numerous organizations provide these families with support  and financial aid to protect their loved ones,  but these groups are only able to help a small  percentage of people due to the lack of national recognition of CHD.  Raising a national consciousness about the  defects and their effects will provide hope and  comfort  for  those who have struggled with  heart defects.  Jeanne  Imperati,  the  loving  mother of a child with a heart defect, had the  foresight in 1999 to begin a campaign focused  on spreading awareness through a Congenital  Heart Defects Awareness Day on February  14. On a day already dedicated to hearts, it is  a simple and meaningful endeavor to remind  the nation of this worthwhile cause. More attention can be given to the regularity of the  defects and  research about  their possible  cause. Creating a network of informed people  throughout the nation is a simple way to provide support for survivors and their families.  While we go about the tradition of honoring  loved ones this Valentine’s Day, let’s also give  our support  to  those affected by Congenital  Heart Defects and their cause. Awareness is  the  first step  toward saving  lives and protecting those whom we love.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 14, 2005  ",2005
83,House,109,0.348,3,2005-03-10,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I very much appreciate my colleague from California yielding me a  moment. DORISknows that Bob and I  were very, very dear friends. We came  to the Congress together. At that time  we talked a lot about our hometown,  for the Matsui family knows that Arlene and I consider in many ways Sacramento to be really our second home.  It was our privilege to spend a decade  there working in the legislature on behalf of public affairs; and the reputation of the Matsui family went well  ahead of their service here. Bob served  as a member of the board of supervisors  and was a fabulous local leader.  In turn, his tragic loss was a shock to  all of us, but clearly the voice expressed by that vote by the people in  that district that surrounds and  includes Sacramento is a reflection of  the fact that their people know and  deeply believe that DORIS is the person  to reflect the view and the future that  Bob would have for the country.  DORIS, I want you to know that we do  not just welcome you to the family  today but it is very important for you  and I to know that we will continue to  work together on behalf of California  and our  second home; and,  indeed,  there are wonderful things as well as  great things in the future that need to  be done.  So welcome, God bless you, Godspeed.  ",2005
84,House,109,-0.631,3,2005-03-10,Mr. STARK.," And now, Mr. Speaker,  with a final note that the California  Democratic delegation of 33 members  is now 55 percent nonmale, I want to  introduce our newest Member, the Honorable DORISMATSUI.  f  HASTERT,  MAIDEN SPEECH BY THE  HONORABLE DORIS O. MATSUI  (Ms. MATSUI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2005
85,House,109,-0.434,3,2005-03-10,Ms. MATSUI.,"  Speaker  Leader PELOSI, Chairman LEWIS and  Mr. STARK, thank you very much and  all  the  distinguished Members  and  friends here  for welcoming me here  today.  As I look around this Chamber, I see  so many of you who have been my  friends throughout these years. And  now today I have the honor of calling  you my colleagues. The last time I was  here in this Chamber was December 23.  Obviously, the House was out of session  then. But Bob was so excited because  he was going to bring Anna on the floor  to witness his swearing in for his 14th  term. So that morning of the 23rd we  decided to do a practice run, and we  brought Anna here on the floor of this  awe-inspiring Chamber to get her used  to it. After that, we went back to his  office and we just happened to take a  picture of Anna sitting on her grandfather’s  lap behind a desk with the  Capitol behind. The next day, Bob fell  ill and was hospitalized. And he tried  so hard to get well, because he wanted  to be here with his colleagues and with  Anna.  As you all know, he loved this body.  He loved coming to work here. And he  loved all of you. But he did not win  that battle. In the days since, I spent a  lot of time talking with the people of  Sacramento, and I have come to appreciate even more what Bob maintained  all along,  that his  commitment  to  equality, his dedication  to ensuring  dignity to the elderly, his work to  make Sacramento even a better place  to live and work and to raise a family,  and his driving desire to make America  stronger  for each successive generation, those things were not about him  at all. They were about us. They were  about our future.  And so I take this oath today with a  heart both heavy and hopeful that we  can all work together to build that better future. The challenges facing the  people of Sacramento did not end with  my husband’s service. I know that Bob  made all of you aware, in some cases  painfully aware, how  important  the  issue of flood control is to Sacramento.  For many, many years, probably a couple of decades, my husband bent your  ears on that. You will not be surprised  to hear that that pain in your ear is  not going to go away until we get it  done.  This is truly the people’s House, and  that is why Bob loved it so. And I realize as I was talking and listening to the  people of Sacramento how important it  is to connect with the people. As I was  talking with  them  in  the  grocery  stores and the coffee shops, at the service stations, I heard from many people.  Bob’s high school teacher came up to  me one day and said, DORIS, please,  please make sure that Social Security  is secure. I ran into a young mother at  the grocery store who stopped me as I  was picking up a can of peas and said,  Mrs. MATSUI, I lost my husband a year  ago, and I need those Social Security  benefits for my son and myself.  When I was in a coffee shop, a young  man rolled over to me and said, Mrs.  MATSUI, I really need those disability  benefits, because I don’t want to have  to depend on my parents. I talked to  the hardware store owner and I  listened really hard because he wants to  provide health care benefits for his employees, but finds it to be very difficult.  Social Security, health care, the war  in Iraq, these are all local issues. We  happen to talk about them here, but  they are all local issues. And on these  issues and so many more, I look forward to working with all of you to find  common ground and achieve common  good.  I mentioned  earlier  the photo of  Anna sitting on her grandfather’s lap.  One of our other family treasures is a  photo of Brian here at age 6 witnessing  his father’s first swearing in. He sat  right there. He is sitting there now. He  is sitting there with his own daughter,  Anna. Seeing him  there and  seeing  Anna is a reminder that despite tragedy and heartbreak, life indeed does go  on. And I know that somewhere Bob is  looking down and  smiling, knowing  that Anna was here on the floor having  watched her grandmother being sworn  in.  Life does go on. And so it is with  Bob’s example and Anna’s inspiration  of  future generations and with  the  hopes and dreams of the people of Sacramento, I take this honor and I have  taken this oath to join you today as a  colleague. And I truly, truly appreciate  being here.  Thank you so very much.  f  PERMISSION FOR COMMITTEE ON  APPROPRIATIONS  TO  HAVE  UNTIL  MIDNIGHT,  FRIDAY,  MARCH 11, 2005, TO FILE PRIVILEGED REPORT ON EMERGENCY  SUPPLEMENTAL  APPROPRIATIONS BILL, 2005  ",2005
86,House,109,-0.45,3,2005-03-10,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, reserving  the right to object, I would just ask the  gentleman if he could explain what the  schedule is for consideration of the bill  both in the Rules Committee and on  the floor, and I yield to the gentleman  from California for that purpose.  ",2005
87,House,109,0.259,10,2005-03-10,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.  ",2005
88,House,109,-0.366,10,2005-03-10,Mr. PASCRELL.," Mr. Speaker, in a  letter that went from Suzanne Novak  on behalf of the Brennan Center for  Justice at NYU to the gentleman from  Alaska  (Mr. YOUNG),  the  honorary  chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. OBERSTAR), ranking member, she wrote in  that letter in support of the Federal  Government  supporting  States  and  being very specific about the bidding  laws in contracting to respond to the  collusion or the possibilities of collusion that have existed, I can assure my  colleagues, not only in the State of  New Jersey.  She wrote this: ‘‘Several recent scandals regarding government contracting  in New Jersey prompted New Jersey to  establish a criterion of responsibility  for government contracting which prohibited  the State  from  contracting  with an entity that has contributed to  a candidate for or holder of the office  of Governor, or to any State or county  political party committee, within certain time frames. The executive ‘‘order  of  the Governor’’  ‘‘explicitly  stated  that ‘the growing infusion of funds donated by business entities into the political process at all level of government has generated widespread cynicism among the public that special interest groups are ‘‘buying’’ favors from  elected officeholders.’’’  Mr. Speaker, the courts have recognized that contributions from government contractors present a severe risk  of engendering corruption, the appearance of corruption and, thus, have generally upheld pay-to-play contribution  bans, and this is what this amendment  is all about. It is a bipartisan amendment to reform government, to help  government clean up its act. We have  similar  laws on  the Federal books  about  contracting  and  bidding. We  want to remove cynicism from the public about when the government does  business that there is proper conditions  that will be implemented to make sure  that it is done according to the law.  Blount v. the SEC was a perfect example. The Securities and Exchange  Commission made it very clear that if  you were going to do some bonding  work, that if you give a political contribution  to  the  entity  beforehand,  that is rather suspect. So let us remove  that possibility. There is no doubt, if  we do not allow the States to do what  the Federal Government has on the  books, how are we going to  justify  that?  This is a win-win situation. Neither  party is the source of corruption and  neither party is privy to virtue; let us  accept that. Let us also accept that  this is a bipartisan amendment, introduced in good faith, so that each of the  parties, if you will, look good. Not only  talk the talk but take that extra step  to clean up their own acts. How can we  in this House not permit or allow each  of the States to provide  for cleaner  governments?  This is reality. The Federal law, the  court cases have backed up this effort.  There is no reason under the sun. This  is bipartisan. It will help both parties  and it will reduce the cynicism that exists in many, many areas of the public.  So, Mr. Speaker, this great H.R. 3,  the Transportation Equity Act, we  have worked on it a long time. I have  saluted both the Chair, as well as the  ranking member. I have not heard one  cogent argument as to why we should  not pass and allow States to reform  their own act and clean up their own  acts.  One criticism I heard is that this is  going to open up a Pandora’s box. The  Federal Government has rules on the  books already. Are we going to tell the  Federal Government, you have opened  up a Pandora’s box because you are  trying to implement clean-government  rules? That  is absurd. Give me one  legal  reason why  this  amendment  should not only be in order, which it is,  but it should not be both sides of the  aisle  supportive. Give me one good  legal reason.  ",2005
89,House,109,-0.297,10,2005-03-10,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take this opportunity to express my support for  the rule, H. Res. 144, to the TEA–LU, H.R. 3,  bill, which makes in order the Pascrell/Menendez/LoBiondo Pay-to-Play amendment. The  OBERSTAR).  consideration of this amendment is crucial to  restoring the integrity of New Jersey’s government and to protecting federal funds allocated  to the State.  New Jersey government and politics are  long overdue  for a cleansing. For  too  long,  New Jersey taxpayers have paid a corruption  tax—the cost of decisions made  to benefit  campaign donors rather than taxpayers. At the  present time, the New Jersey legislature is attempting to restore its integrity by barring companies, who have made political contributions  to a state government or political party official,  from receiving state contracts worth more than  $17,500. This  is a critical component of  the  State’s reform package and must be enacted  and maintained for genuine change to occur in  New Jersey.  Standing in the way of New Jersey’s cleansing  is  the US Department of Transportation,  USDOT, who has cited concerns  that our  State’s pay-to-play reform would illegally stifle  competition  for government contracts. New  Jersey has challenged the USDOT’s decision  in the court. Currently, the case is pending.  To weed out the corruption that has plagued  our State and resulted in our citizens mistrust  of  their government,  the Pascrell/Menendez/  LoBiondo amendment is essential. Consideration and subsequently  the passage of  this  amendment are imperative for New Jersey to  attain real ethical reform.  Again, I commend the Rules Committee for  declaring  the  Pascrell/Menendez/LoBiondo  Pay-to-Play amendment  in order  today and  urge its adoption.  ",2005
90,House,109,0.57,38,2005-03-10,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I intend to ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment, but before I do, I would like to  engage  the  gentleman  from Alaska  (Chairman YOUNG) in a brief colloquy  on this issue.  Mr.  Chairman,  in  1998  Congress  passed TEA–21. And as enacted, TEA–21  contained  congressional  intent  and  guidance language to the United States  Department of Transportation to implement design-build contracting rules.  But, Mr. Chairman, the final rules did  not mirror Congress’  intent  in  the  slightest.  H.R. 3, as introduced and passed by  the committee, included section 1501 on  design-build, and I thank the chairman,  the  ranking member, and  the  committee  staff  for  recognizing  the  level of importance that design-build  holds  in the reauthorization debate.  However, the language currently in the  bill does not repair conflicts in the law.  My concern is that the Federal Government has been slow to respond to  initiatives at the State level that advance  those  goals. Current Federal  rules dampen the efficiency of design-  build with a complicated procurement  process, taking the wind out of the  sails of innovation.  Federal processes still favor a consecutive approach to project development,  requiring  separate  environmental review, design and construction  contracts.  This  causes  unnecessary  delay, added  cost and  reduced  efficiencies in delivering critical transportation projects.  I want to work with the committee  in conference to repair the design-build  law so States can benefit from its intended efficiency.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Alaska has visited my State, and I am  grateful for that. The gentleman has  heard from our constituents and our  commissioners and our governor. This  is necessary to take our work to the  next level. Sure we talk about changing funding formulas, but that alone is  not enough to satisfy everyone, and we  all know that. All I am asking for is a  chance to show that we can be innovative in using the limited funds that we  receive.  ",2005

92,House,109,0.505,38,2005-03-10,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Chairman, I offer an  amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk  will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 5 offered by Mr. ISSA:  At the end of section 1208 of the bill, insert  the following:  (d) SENSEOFCONGRESS.—It is the sense of  Congress that the Secretary and the States  should provide additional incentives (including the use of high occupancy vehicle lanes  on State and Interstate highways) for the  purchase and use of hybrid and other fuel efficient vehicles, which have been proven to  minimize air emissions and decrease consumption of fossil fuels.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to  House Resolution 144, the gentleman  from California (Mr. ISSA) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from California (Mr. ISSA).  ",2005
93,House,109,-0.347,38,2005-03-10,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in support of the Issa amendment.  Quite simply, the increased use of fuel efficient vehicles is a boon to our country.  Hybrid  vehicles benefit our environment.  Our cities and  towns are being choked by  smog. The  increased use of hybrid vehicles  would reduce this problem.  Hybrid vehicles also benefit our economy.  The Ford Escape Hybrid is assembled in my  home State of Missouri. Sales for the Escape  hybrid have been so strong that this plant cannot keep up with demand. This plant provides  thousands of good paying  jobs here  in  the  United States.  I assure you that is you ask the workers in  that plant if they support increased incentives  for the purchase of hybrid vehicles, their answer would be a resounding ‘‘yes.’’  Finally, vehicles that reduce our use of gasoline mean greater energy security  for our  country, and less U.S. dollars going to countries with hostile regimes.  The increased use of hybrid vehicles is truly  a win-win-win situation and  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  ",2005
94,House,109,-0.553,45,2005-03-10,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Chairman,  I  claim time in opposition to the amendment, and I yield myself such time as  I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. SHADEGG) raises a very serious matter, modifying the Congestion  Management and Air Quality Improvement provisions in current law and the  formula.  The manner in which the gentleman  proposes to do this  is a  little more  complicated than I think is appropriate  to resolve in amendment form on the  floor. But I, in cooperation with the  chairman of the  full committee, believe we can work this out with the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SHADEGG)  as we proceed to conference.  If the gentleman is inclined to withdraw the amendment, having given a  very thoughtful discussion of it, I believe as we did last year in the effort to  reach a bill which we ultimately did  not, not for this reason but for other  reasons, that we can work this matter  out.  ",2005

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  gentleman’s amendment. I believe that  the Federal government and the Congress need to be part of the solution to  cities around the country that are in  non-attainment status.  This amendment is a good step in  providing relief for cities such as Columbus, Georgia, in Muskogee County,  part of my 11th Congressional District,  that only recently has been designated  non-attainment, and it is non-attainment of  this PM–2.5  that  the gentleman  from Arizona  (Mr. SHADEGG)  was just talking about, these tiny 2.5  or below microparticulate matter.  We can save for another day, I guess,  the  debate  over  particulate matter  non-attainment  and  whether  cities  such as Columbus should be designated  as such. But today, I would like to say  thank you to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SHADEGG) for offering this  amendment that will allow funding to  be provided to these cities.  I  understand  the  gentleman may  withdraw the amendment. I appreciate  the ranking member being willing to  work with him on trying to resolve  this. But on behalf of the people of  Muskogee County and the City Columbus and Phoenix City, Alabama, as  well, I think this is a good idea and I  commend the amendment.  ",2005

98,House,109,-0.408,52,2005-03-10,Mr. WEINER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today to  thank the leadership of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee  for  their hard work  shepherding through TEA–LU, a bill that I will  support despite its flaws. The Department of  Transportation studied the Nation’s infrastructure and prescribed a $375 billion solution. In  the 108th Congress, I joined the leadership in  endorsing the original version of this bill, which  filled that prescription. Unfortunately, the administration is unwilling to come up with the  support necessary to ensure that we are able  to maintain and  improve  the Nation’s  infrastructure, and threatened to veto any bill that  authorized more than $283.9 billion. As a result, we are today considering a bill that does  not do nearly enough to improve the quality of  life for individuals living in New York City and  around the country. I look forward to working  with the Committee leadership to see that this  bill is improved in conference.  Mr. Chairman, as  this bill moves  to conference, I want to highlight four issues that are  of particular import to me and my constituents.  It is my hope that the conferees will include  these improvements in the conference report.  First, this bill should ensure that resources  are devoted by formula to states that require  improvements. The minimum guarantee program shifts funding from states that have the  greatest  need—like  New  York—to  other  States. Each year, New York provides $20 billion more  to Washington  than  it gets back.  New Yorkers ought not be punished for our efforts to conserve fuel, as any expansion of the  minimum guarantee program would do.  Second, this bill shortchanges New York on  transit funding. Despite having almost half of  the Nation’s  transit  ridership, New York’s  share of transit funding leaves much to be desired. Transit  funding  should better  reflect  need.  Third, I hope that conferees will ensure that  States starved for a consistent funding stream  for ferries and waterborne transportation can  count on funding from the Ferry Boat Discretionary Fund. I am acutely aware of how much  a guaranteed stream of funding would mean  to improve both congestion and homeland security all across the country, and particularly in  New York City, where roads are clogged on a  normal day, and  ferry  transportation would  provide not only congestion relief but another  way to ensure escape from Manhattan in the  case of a terrorist attack. At a minimum, New  York should receive $5 million per year. I hope  conferees will work with me and other Members who represent districts that would benefit  from a guaranteed ferry funding stream.  Fourth, I hope that conferees will work with  me  to ensure  that  the generous  funding we  have provided for Senior transportation in this  bill is put to its best use. I believe that establishing a center for best practices and a technical assistance  center, would provide an  enormous service to this nation’s elderly population.

In particular, I would like to thank both the  Democratic and Republican staff of the Transportation Committee, both of whom worked  tirelessly on this piece of legislation, and who  deserve  the entire House’s  thanks.  In particular, I would like to thank Ken House, Clyde  Woodle,  Eric  Vanschyndle,  Ward  McCarragher,  Kathleen  Zern,  David  Heymsfeld,  Dara  Schleiker,  and  Sheila  Lockwood of Mr. OBERSTAR’s staff. Additionally, I would like to thank Jim Tymon of Mr.  YOUNG’s staff for his willingness to work with  me on the issue of Ferry Transportation.  I would also  like  to  thank Tom Kearney,  Tom Herritt and their colleagues at the Albany  Office of the Federal Highway Administration,  Nancy Ross, Fred Neveu, Ron Epstein and  their colleagues at the New York State Department of Transportation, and Andra Horsch and  David Woloch and their colleagues at the New  York City Department of Transportation.

104,House,109,0.591,73,2005-03-10,Mr. CONAWAY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for those kind remarks.  And I actually chose the office that  you vacated, so that, as my  initial  start in this chamber, I would have the  good vibrations that you left behind on  your good start in this body.  I want to make a few points, some of  which play off of the ones that you  have already made. Unfortunately, we  got off on what I think is the wrong  foot when we began to call this situation a crisis. We in America have a relatively short attention span, and crisis  means something is going to happen in  the next 15 minutes or certainly by tomorrow. So that was probably an ill  word to use, and we spent an inordinate  amount  of  time  arguing  over  that  word.  I am a CPA by background, 30-plus  years of business experience. And as I  look at what I believe to be the very  compelling arguments and facts that  you present, then that leads me to believe that we do have something we  ought to deal with, and that we ought  to deal with that today and not continue to put that off.  Now, is the time to fix this problem.  You have already mentioned that, each  year that we delay in this fix, it adds  an additional $600 billion of unfunded  benefits and liabilities to our problem.  So, in your family, my family, my  business, the clients that I have, if we  had circumstances where we had cash  flow deficits and I went to the Chairman and the CEO and I said, you know  you are going to bring in less money  than you are spending this year, do not  worry about it, it will be okay, let us  just do not fix it, wait 3 or 4 years from  now.  b1645  Well, that is nonsense. Nobody does  that in the real world, and we should  not be about doing that here in Congress.  So I think the facts compel us to see  the problem, see the issue that needs to  be done and also compel us to say, we  should be the ones who fix it. If you  agree with the facts that we have a  system that is no longer sustainable,  there is a great adage that I picked up  in one of the briefings that we had  early  in November that said, things  that cannot be sustained will not be  sustained.  It  is  a  pretty  straightforward  statement. That  is  exactly  what we have here. We have something  that will not sustain itself.  When it originally came into being in  1935, it could clearly sustain itself. The  more callous of some would look at  that system and say, that is nothing  more than a pyramid scheme where  you collect from all these people and  give it out to a few.  In this instance, it is a legitimized  pyramid scheme, but as every pyramid  scheme in history it runs out of gas.  The facts compel us to say that this  system that we have got is running out  of gas.  We hear the phrase PAYGO bandied  about this body and in committees a  great deal with some passion and disdain. This was an original PAYGO system, pay as you go. The monies you  bring in are paid out to beneficiaries. I  do not think it applies to Social Security and here is why. PAYGO means in  this circumstances you pay, and if I am  retired, I go. PAYGO ought to mean  the folks incurring the bills ought to  pay the bills. So I do not think the  term PAYGO really applies to Social  Security.  The next thing is once you have this  issue in front of us, let us take a step  back and put ourselves back 75 years  ago when  it was conceived and the  leadership at that point in time, the  wonderful  leadership  it was, clearly  thought a lifetime benefit, a Social Security stream of cash flow that you  cannot outlive, was an important public policy arrangement.  I do not hear anybody on either side  of the aisle hinting that this is not still  really a good public policy  for our  country  to have.  I have  counseled  many clients who as they approach retirement age one of the first questions  they ask is, am I going to outlive my  money? I have got all this put away  that I have saved and scrimped and  foregone purchases and have put this  money away. Am I going to outlive  that?  Well, the wonderful thing about Social Security is you have got the security of knowing you simply cannot outlive this lifetime benefit. So if we are  compelled to fix it, and I think we are  compelled to keep it, if it is good public policy for my mom and dad and for  me, then I would argue that it ought to  be good public policy for my grandchildren and my children, just like the  gentleman has talked about his children as well. So I think we are coming  to some things we can all agree on as  we begin to move toward how do we  come about this conclusion of fixing  whatever is in front of us.  I have six wonderful grandchildren.  God has blessed me  immensely with  four wonderful children and two daughters-in-law and a son-in-law and six  magnificently  wonderful  grandchildren. It would never ever occur to  me to gather those six little critters  up, take them down to my local bank  and say, Mr. Banker, I want to borrow  a lot of money. And I want to spend  that money over the rest of my life  time, and I want my six grandkids to  sign that note. And when they grow up  they will pay off what granddad spent.  If you individualize what we are really doing every single day in this country,  there  is not a grandparent on  Earth I do not believe who would do  that, who would obligate their  individual grandchildren  for  some  individual debts that they might incur. So  if it is not good public policy on an individual  grandparent-to-grandchild  basis, then it really should not be good  public policy on a corporate basis to do  this very exact same thing.  We are a Nation at war, and we have  these wonderful stories coming back  from men and women and the sacrifices  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:41 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H10MR5.REC H10MR5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005

113,Senate,109,0.446,192,2005-03-10,Mr. THOMAS.," Mr. President, today, I  rise to introduce the ‘‘Electric Transmission and Reliability Enhancement  Act of 2005’’. It is my intention to build  on the competitive wholesale open access policies adopted by the Congress  in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. My legislation would  extend  and  improve  these open, non-discriminatory access  policies;  remove  antiquated  federal  statutory barriers that stand  in the  way of competitive wholesale markets;  encourage increased investment in our  transmission system and establish enforceable reliability standards to help  ensure the continued reliability of the  interstate transmission system.  The Congress has been debating how  to update the antiquated statutory and  regulatory  framework governing  the  electric industry for over eight years.  We repeatedly have tried and failed to  enact  legislation that would provide  the right economic signals and regulatory certainty necessary for industry  and wholesale market modernization.  The loser in all of this has been the  consumer, who has been denied the full  benefits that access provides to fairly  priced,  reliable  supplies of power.  I  have come to the conclusion that if we  are to legislate successfully, we will  have to pare down our wish list to the  bare essentials plus those issues necessary for the electric industry to attract the capital it needs to keep our  lights on and ensure that customers  pay no more for their power than is  fair and necessary.  It seems clear that if truly competitive wholesale markets are to exist,  there is a need to ensure that all industry  participants  play  by  the  same  rules. While the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has tried to ensure  this, the Commission’s tools are limited. Only Congress can give FERC the  tools it needs to ensure that all industry participants in competitive wholesale markets play by the same rules.  Under present federal law FERC has  no jurisdiction or authority over transmission  facilities  owned  by  public  power agencies, municipalities and cooperatives. In the West these types of  entities own a substantial portion, perhaps as much as half of the interstate  electric  transmission  system. As  a  matter of fact, in the Western Electric  Coordinating Council, an area that encompasses all or part of 11 Western  states and parts of Canada, non-FERC  jurisdictional facilities account for 52  percent of transmission miles.  My legislation would permit FERC to  require certain nonregulated utilities  to offer transmission service at comparable  rates  to  those  they  charge  themselves, and on terms and conditions comparable to those applicable to  jurisdictional  public  utilities.  Currently nonregulated transmitting utilities would not be subject to the full  panoply of FERC regulation under this  provision.  Instead, a  ‘‘light handed’’  form of regulation would apply and  small nonregulated entities, such as  those that sell less than 4,000,000 MW/h  per year, would be entirely exempt  from these nondiscrimination requirements.  It also seems clear that the Public  Utility Holding Company Act is hindering necessary restructuring of the  industry and the deployment of capital  into an industry that desperately needs  it. Investors are deterred simply because they do not want to deal with the  PUHCA rules and restrictions. If repealed, utility securities will continue  to be regulated by the SEC, FERC and  most state commissions. Mergers and  acquisitions  of  jurisdictional  assets  would  still  require FERC and  state  commission approval and review by the  Department of Justice, DOJ, and the  Federal Trade Commission, FTC. FERC  and state commissions would still be  able  to monitor  rates  and  prevent  cross-subsidies.  Despite State  progress  in  administering the Public Utility Regulatory  Policies Act of 1978, it is clear that  PURPA continues to provide special  privileges to certain favored generators  at the expense of utilities and their  customers. Like PUHCA, PURPA is no  longer needed in today’s competitive  wholesale markets. My legislation prospectively eliminates the mandatory  purchase  and  sell  obligations  of  PURPA.  Over the years the grid has been well  protected through voluntary standards  established  by  the North American  Electric Reliability Council. NERC’s  voluntary reliability standards—which  are  not  enforceable—have  generally  been complied with by  the electric  power industry. But with the opening  of the wholesale power market to competition, our transmission grid is being  used in ways for which it was not designed. New system strains are also  being  created  by  the  break-up  of  vertically integrated utilities and by  the emergence of new market structures and participants. The results of  these changes have been an increase in  the number and severity of violations  of NERC’s voluntary rules.  My legislation converts the existing  NERC  voluntary  reliability  system  into a mandatory reliability system. A  North  America-wide  organization  would have the authority to establish  and enforce reliability standards, and  take into account regional differences.  The new reliability organization will  be run by market participants, and will  be overseen by the FERC in the U.S.  The organization will be made up of  representatives of everyone who is affected—residential, commercial and industrial consumers; State public utility  commissions;  independent power  producers; electric utilities and others.  There is no question that we need a  new system to safeguard the integrity  of our electric grid. My  legislation  would do this, using language that was  agreed upon in the last Congress by  House and Senate conferees for the energy bill.  During the last energy debate, efforts  were made to address some of the more  egregious behavior and attempted market manipulation by certain entities  through legislation. While this area is  obviously very complex, we need to address this issue if regulatory gaps truly  do exist. I realize my attempt might  not be perfect, but I wanted to initiate  discussion on this very important topic  if in fact regulatory agencies do need  additional  authority  to  police  and  monitor the industry.  My legislation will provide more information on prices of electricity and  VerDate Aug 04 2004  05:03 Mar 11, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A10MR6.032 S10PT1 ",2005
114,Senate,109,-0.314,199,2005-03-10,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, the second reason I rise is literally a coincidental but important offshoot of what  Christopher Dodd, Senator DODD’s father, did at  the Nuremberg Trials.  What they did—he and Justice Jackson—was  they understood  that you  could uncover, deal with, and expose to  the world atrocities humanity commits  upon humanity and at the same time  do it under the rule of law, give people  a fair trial, actually abide by what we  say we stand for.  All of us are aware of the genocide  now taking place in the Darfur region  of Sudan. We passed a resolution last  July which called Khartoum’s abuses  in Darfur genocide, which is what they  were, what they are, and what they  continue to be. The then-Secretary of  State Colin Powell made the same assessment in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  in  September of 2004.  The President of the United States,  President Bush, signed legislation imposing sanctions on Khartoum for the  actions in Darfur this past December.  With the signing of the North-South  Peace Agreement on January 9, administration officials believed the situation in Darfur would improve. Unfortunately, they have only gotten worse.

115,,109,0.75,206,2005-03-10,Mr. TANCREDO.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to submit the foreword to an article I authored  in  the Fall 2004 special migration  issue of  Mediterranean Quarterly. People on the Move:  The Security, Social, and Economic  Implications of Migration Foreword  The long cycles of history are revealing to  those who study  them but may harbor surprises for those who choose to ignore them.  The editors of Mediterranean Quarterly, cognizant of lessons learned or ignored, decided  to take a closer look at a pattern of history  that seems to be at the core of current global  instability:  the mass migration of people  in  search of basic means of survival, or just survival from brutal rulers.  On an annual basis, approximately 100 million people either attempt  to or actually do  leave  their place of birth, often not knowing  where they will end up. More than 10 million  illegal  immigrants have entered  the United  States since the last ‘‘amnesty’’ in 1986, and  the flow continues despite the promises of the  North American Free Trade Agreement. Close  to 1 million Albanians, almost one-fourth of the  country’s population, have sought  refuge  in  neighboring countries since  the collapse of  their country’s communist  regime. Tens of  thousands of Turks leave their country annually in search of work in Western Europe and  endure the consequences of cultural discrimination. More tragically, young women from the  poorest components of the former Soviet Empire have vanished into the jungle of human  trafficking and become commodities in an ugly  form of trade that is managed by the new barons of a dangerous underworld. Recent statistics assembled by Greek authorities estimate  that seventeen thousand women are being exploited by sex merchants in the Balkans alone.  Albanian mafia lords, in association with their  former enemies and with links all the way to  Afghanistan, control  lucrative drug, gun, and  human-smuggling operations across national  borders with relative impunity. And as in times  past, the Mediterranean Sea has become the  crossroads of people on  the move and  the  stage on which human tragedy unfolds almost  on a daily basis.  Human cargoes float from island to island in  the eastern Aegean, with boat crews waiting  for the opportunity to dump these people on  dry land, after having extracted the last ounce  of resources  from  their helpless victims. On  the African shores of Gibraltar, thousands of  Africans patiently wait for the first opportunity  to cross the narrow stretch of water and set  foot on European soil. Egyptians, Iraqis, Pakistanis, Filipinos, and Bangladeshis have landed on  Italian, Greek, French, and Spanish  shores over the years. They bring along their  poverty, their energies, and their hopes. They  also bring social, political, and now security  concerns.  More than a dozen scholars, policy makers,  and political leaders present diverse views on  this critical  issue  in  these pages. The  lead  essay, on  the security  implications of  illegal  migration for the United States, is written by  Congressman Tom Tancredo, Republican of  Colorado, and the unfolding drama of African  refugees  is provided by Francis M. Deng,  United Nations  representative  for  internally  displaced persons. Rochelle Gershuni, head of  Israel’s Ministry of Justice, addresses sex exploitation and human  trafficking and  its consequences for her country. Scholars of diverse  origins and  viewpoints deal with migration  issues  in Spain, Egypt, Turkey, and Greece  and  the South-North migration  in  the United  States and Canada. Naturally, we do not pretend that we provide a complete picture of a  huge historical phenomenon, but we do hope  to spark a debate on the social, policy, security, and economic  implications  caused by  ‘‘people on the move.’’  Historical patterns show  that mass population movements have altered cultures, demolished empires, given birth  to new ones,  and ultimately compelled humankind to organize itself into nation-states, with sovereignty  determining their national characters. Now the  nation-state that saw its birth in the Treaty of  Westphalia is in retreat as an organizing concept  of  human  events.  Multiculturalism,  globalization, poverty, and  the North-South  global economic divide have altered the patterns of civilization to a degree unprecedented  since  the eastern  tribes overwhelmed  the  Roman Empire and the Ottomans reached the  gates of Vienna.  The advanced  industrial democracies,  the  ultimate destination of people on  the move,  have shown a lack of vision about the implications of mass movements of people in search  of a livelihood. In their pursuit of high profits  with cheap  labor  in  the shortest  time,  they  have adopted  immigration policies  that no  longer facilitate the orderly integration of cultures and the peaceful evolution of new forms  of ethnic identity. Instead of inviting potential  citizens seeking a better life, the industrial nations have institutionalized the transplantation  of ethnic communities and have set in motion  a process for their own national balkanization.  The essays included in this special issue of  Mediterranean Quarterly (with more to follow  in future issues) examine problems caused by  migration both in countries of destination and  countries of origin. It behooves the first to examine  their social policies and  the  latter  to  come to grips with their inability to match national resources with their peoples’ needs. By  selectively examining problems on both sides  of the divide, the editors hope to spark a debate that will be grounded on the reality that  a silent invasion is under way that could, if left  unattended,  transform world politics and  foment global turmoil for generations to come.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

118,,109,-0.352,213,2005-03-10,Mr. ROTHMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  join with my colleagues and Tibetan communities around  the world  to commemorate Tibetan Uprising Day, and to draw attention to  the continued serious human  rights abuses  committed by the People’s Republic of China.  On March 10, 1959, in reaction to rumors  that the Chinese were planning to kill or kidnap the Dalai Lama, thousands of Tibetan refugees  courageously  surrounded  the Dalai  Lama’s compound and began calling for the  Chinese to leave Tibet. This marked the beginning of the ‘‘Lhasa Uprising.’’ On March 17,  1959, fearing that Chinese troops would massacre the thousands of refugees who were refusing orders to disperse, the Dalai Lama disguised himself and took flight to India. Forty-  eight hours  later, believing  the Dalai Lama  was still inside, Chinese troops began shelling  his compound and other targets in Lhasa, killing  thousands of mostly unarmed civilians.  Chinese statistics estimate that 87,000 Tibetans  from all parts of Tibet were killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps during the  1959 Uprising. Only a small number of  the  thousands who fled to India survived Chinese  military attacks, malnutrition, cold and disease.  Over  the past 46 years, Tibetans  inside  Tibet and  in exile around  the world have  bravely  fought against  tremendous odds  to  preserve  their religious  identity, culture, and  history. It is estimated that 1.5 million Tibetans  have died as a result of Chinese occupation  since 1949 and 6000 monasteries,  temples,  and other cultural buildings were destroyed.  And  today, Tibetans,  including monks and  nuns, are continually persecuted for practicing  their religion, and voicing their support for His  Holiness the Dalai Lama. In fact, five Tibetan  monks were  jailed by Chinese authorities  in  February of this year for allegedly publishing  politically sensitive poems, and were given  sentences of two to three years.  The U.S. government has continually supported Tibetan self-determination, and  I am  proud of the dedication of the U.S. Congress  to drawing attention to the gross human rights  abuses committed by the People’s Republic of  China against  the Tibetan people. We must  continue to support the dialogue between His  Holiness the Dalai Lama and the government  of China, and remain committed to a peaceful  resolution  to  this  tragic conflict, keeping  in  mind our shared values of freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, and freedom from tyranny.  I commend to you the statement written by  His Holiness the Dalai Lama in commemoration of Tibetan Uprising Day, and I am honored to submit the statement in its entirety for  the RECORD.  THESTATEMENTOFHISHOLINESSTHEDALAI  LAMAONTHE46THANNIVERSARYOFTHETIBETANNATIONALUPRISINGDAY  On the occasion of the 46th anniversary of  the Tibetan People’s Uprising, I convey my  warm greetings to my  fellow Tibetans  in  Tibet and in exile and to our friends around  the world.  During these more than four decades great  changes have taken place in Tibet. There has  been a great deal of economic progress along  with  development  in  infrastructure. The  Golmud-Lhasa railway  link that  is being  built is a case in point. However, during the  same period much has been written by independent journalists and travelers to Tibet  about the real situation in Tibet and not  what they have been shown. Most of them  portray a very different picture than what  the  Chinese  government  claims,  clearly  criticizing China about the lack of human  rights,  religious  freedom and  self-rule  in  Tibet. What has actually happened and is  still happening is that since the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region the  real authority has been solely held by Chinese leaders. As for the Tibetan people, they  have been facing suspicions and growing restrictions. The lack of true ethnic equality  and harmony based on trust, and the absence  of genuine stability in Tibet clearly shows  that things are not well in Tibet and that basically there is a problem.  Prominent and respected Tibetan leaders  in Tibet have spoken out on this from time  to time and even suffered because of their  courageous acts. In the early 1960s, the late  Panchen Lama outlined the sufferings and  aspirations of the Tibetan people in his petition to the Chinese leaders. Baba Phuntsok  Wangyal, one of the foremost Tibetan communist leaders, in his recent biography published in English dwells at length on the  need to meet the interests of the Tibetan  people. In fact, it is clear that most senior  Tibetan officials  in Tibet deep  in  their  hearts are extremely dissatisfied.  This year  the Chinese government will  mark the 40th anniversary of the establishment  of  the Tibet Autonomous Region.  There will be much fanfare and many commemorative events to celebrate the occasion  but these will be meaningless when they do  not reflect the ground realities. For example,  the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural  Revolution were celebrated with great pomp  as real achievements at the time they took  place.  China  has made  tremendous  economic  progress during the past more than two decades. China today is not what it was twenty  or thirty years ago. Much has changed in  China. As a result she has become a major  player in the world and China rightly deserves this position. It is a big nation with a  huge population and a rich and ancient civilization. However, China’s  image  is  tarnished by her human rights records, undemocratic actions, the lack of the rule of law and  the unequal  implementation of autonomy  rights regarding minorities,  including the  Tibetans. All these are a cause for more suspicion and distrust from the outside world.  Internally, they are an obstacle to unity and  stability that are of utmost importance to  the leaders of the People’s Republic of China.  In my view, it is important that as China becomes a powerful and respectable nation she  should be able to adopt a reasonable policy  with confidence.  The world in general, of which China is a  part, is changing for the better. In recent  times there is definitely a greater awareness  and appreciation for peace, non-violence, democracy, justice and environmental protection. The  recent unprecedented  response  from governments and individuals across the  world to the tsunami disaster victims reaffirms that the world is truly interdependent  and the  importance of universal responsibility.  My involvement in the affairs of Tibet is  not for the purpose of claiming certain personal rights or political position for myself  not attempting to stake claims for the Tibetan administration in exile.

Moreover, the Tibetans working  in Tibet  should carry on the main responsibility of  administering Tibet.

119,,109,0.274,220,2005-03-10,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the Winnetka Park District on 100  years of service to our community.  In 1904, a group of  concerned  citizens  wanted to restore a piece of land in front of  the  village  train  station, which  had  been  strewn with debris from the local livery stable.  This small band of citizens came together and  collected  the $8,548.30 needed  to purchase  what is now Station Park.  From  those  humble  beginnings,  the  Winnetka Park District has developed into 28  park sites that represent more than 244 acres  of  land. The  lands under  the control of  the  Park District include some of the most beautiful shoreline of Lake Michigan. And from the  initial investment of $8,548.30, the district now  boasts a $9 million annual operating budget.  Through  these 100 years, with  the needs  and  desires  of  the  public  in mind,  the  Winnetka Park District has added new facilities  to meet  the continually growing population. Now, nearly 14,500 citizens enjoy the  Park District’s facilities, which include an 18-  hole championship golf course plus a par-3  course, the first indoor tennis facilities in the  Chicago area, platform  tennis courts, an  indoor ice arena, two outdoor rinks, four public  beaches, a skate park, and a 142-acre expanse of playfield.  The Winnetka Park District also runs hundreds  of  recreation  programs,  from  day  camps,  to athletics,  to classes. The district  plans special events throughout the year, and  thousands partake annually in skating, tennis  and golf lessons.  For one hundred years the Winnetka Park  District worked to provide a balance of quality  recreational and  leisure opportunities  to a  growing community, while protecting the natural resources and open spaces for the benefit  of future generations. I hope that the next hundred years is as successful.  f  IN MEMORY OF JIMMY RIDDLE  HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 10, 2005  ",2005
120,,109,0.57,220,2005-03-10,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  give  tribute  to Jimmy Riddle,  from  the 26th  Congressional District of Texas, for his contributions to his community, country and other  nations. Mr. Riddle was working  for SOC–  SMG, which disposes of munitions  in  Iraq,  when an explosive was detonated within his  convoy, which took his life and that of a co-  worker. Mr. Riddle was 53 years old.  I would like to recognize and celebrate Mr.  Riddle’s life today. Jimmy Riddle consistently  served others  throughout his  life. He  joined  the Marine Corps while  in college and was  stationed  in Japan shortly after  the Vietnam  War. After serving for our country, Mr. Riddle  became  an  officer  for  both  the Sulphur  Springs and Carollton Police Departments in  Texas.  In addition to his career, he spent considerable  time with his  family and promoted  the  ideals of being a servant to his children. As a  result, his son Chris joined the U.S. Navy. Recently, Mr. Riddle was working as a defense  contractor in Bosnia during which time he was  able to see his son Chris for the first time in  two years. Shortly after  this meeting, Chris  was killed by a drunk driver. Always looking to  serve others, Mr. Riddle joined the SOC–SMG  and went to Iraq. Just as in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Qatar, the people in Iraq appreciated  Mr. Riddle and  respected him  for his kindheartedness and devotion to helping others.  It was my honor to represent Jimmy. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family and  friends. He was best described by his fellow  workers as an ‘‘unsung hero.’’  HONORING  THE  BASKETWEAVER,  COLEMAN  ACCOMPLISHED  MRS.  SUE  HON.

121,,109,0.484,220,2005-03-10,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the accomplishments of a truly remarkable woman, Sue Coleman. Mrs. Coleman is a member of the Washo nation on the  Dresslerville Reservation in my home state of  Nevada. Mrs. Coleman is nationally known as  a master in the art of basket weaving. Her art  is not only known in Nevada, but throughout  the nation.  Mrs. Coleman comes from a long line of distinguished basket weavers. She  learned  the  art of weaving  through her mother, Theresa  Smokey Jackson. Together with her mother,  Mrs.  Coleman  gathered  willow,  stripped,  cleaned and made thread by splitting the willows in three sections with their teeth. With the  wisdom and guidance of her mother, Mrs.  Coleman has a very diverse portfolio of artistic  designs. These  include; cradleboards, round  baskets, burden baskets, seed beaters and  winnowing trays all of which are true weaves  of the Washo tradition.  Mrs. Coleman has  received many prestigious awards for her art, and has won over  forty  first place  ribbons  for her baskets  in  many western art competitions. In 2002, she  was awarded the prestigious Governor’s Arts  Award for Excellence in Folk Arts. She is also  part of  the committee  that  is organizing  the  Folklife Festival that will be held on the National Mall in 2006. In addition to her many  other roles, Mrs. Coleman has the honor to be  part of the committee for the Smithsonian Museum’s  ‘‘Carriers of Culture: Contemporary  Native Baskets’’. One of her hand-crafted baskets is even part of the Smithsonian’s permanent collection and will be included in a travel  exhibit  that will  feature  the  finest baskets  made by Native Americans.  Mr. Speaker, prior  to  the passing of her  mother, Mrs. Coleman  promised  that  she  would continue the tradition that they enjoyed  together and pass weaving along  to  future  generations, so  that  this wonderful art will  never be forgotten. It is clear that with her with  passion and dedication to this rich cultural art  that she will continue to honor her mother’s  wishes. I am proud to have this opportunity to  acknowledge her work.  f  RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS  OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL OF  CRANSTON HIGH SCHOOL WEST  WITH REGARD TO  ‘‘THE FEINSTEIN YOUTH HUNGER BRIGADE  PROGRAM’’  HON.

124,Senate,109,-0.158,18,2005-04-04,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today with a heavy heart and deep  sense of gratitude to honor the life of a  brave young man from Bluffton. Master Sergeant Michael Hiester, 33 years  old, was one of four Indiana National  Guardsmen who died on March 26 when  a land mine exploded under their military vehicle south of Kabul. With his  life before him, Michael risked everything to fight for the values Americans  hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.  A devoted father of two young children, Michael served as a part-time  firefighter in his hometown of Bluffton,  in addition to being a member of the  Indiana National Guard. Like most  things Michael set his mind to, he was  successful  in his military career. A  full-time Guardsman  since  1990, Michael was promoted to master sergeant  3 months ago. He had previously served  his country in Bosnia-Herzegovina as  part of  the  Indiana Guard’s peacekeeping  assignment.  According  to  friends and family, Michael was also a  real estate appraiser and an avid athlete who  loved diving and  cycling.  Mayor Ted Ellis shared memories of  Michael with  the Associated Press,  saying, that he ‘‘was just the kind of  guy that every parent wants their child  to be like—outgoing and hardworking  and always thinking about something  that they could do out there for the  community.’’ I stand here today to express gratitude for Michael’s sacrifices  and  for  those made  by  the  entire  Hiester family on behalf of our country.  Michael was killed while serving his  country in Operation Enduring Freedom. He was a member of the Indiana  National Guard’s  76th  Infantry Brigade. This brave young soldier leaves  behind his wife Dawn, a  6-year-old  daughter, Emily, and a 4-year-old son,  Adam.  Today, I join Michael’s family, his  friends and the entire Bluffton community in mourning his death. While we  struggle to bear our sorrow over this  loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make  the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of  Michael, a memory  that will burn  brightly during these continuing days  of conflict and grief.  Michael was known for his dedication  to  family and his  love of country.  Today and always, Michael will be remembered by family members, friends  and fellow Hoosiers as a true American  hero and we honor the sacrifice he  made while dutifully serving his country.  As I search for words to do justice in  honoring Michael’s sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln’s remarks  as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ‘‘We cannot  dedicate, we  cannot  consecrate, we  cannot hallow this ground. The brave  men, living and dead, who struggled  here, have consecrated it, far above our  poor power  to add or detract. The  world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never  forget what they did here.’’ This statement is just as true today as it was  nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain  that the impact of Michael’s actions  will live on far longer than any record  of these words.  It is my sad duty to enter the name  of Michael Hiester  in  the CONGRESSIONALRECORDof the U.S. Senate for  his service to this country and for his  profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about  this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that  comes with the loss of our heroes, I  hope that families like Michael’s can  find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ‘‘He will swallow up  death in victory; and the Lord God will  wipe away tears from off all faces.’’  May God grant strength and peace to  those who mourn, and may God be with  all of you, as I know He is with Michael.  ARMYSPECIALISTBRETTM. HERSHEY  Mr. President, I also wish to honor  the life of a brave young man who grew  up in Indianapolis. Army SPC Brett M.  Hershey, 23 years old, was one of four  Indiana National Guardsmen who died  on March 26th when a land mine exploded under  their military vehicle  south of Kabul. With his entire life before him, Brett risked everything to  fight  for the values Americans hold  close to our hearts, in a land halfway  around the world.  A  2000 graduate of North Central  High School in Indianapolis, Brett was  just seven credits shy of graduating  from  Indiana University  in Bloomington, when he left for Afghanistan.  Friends and teachers recount that at  North Central, Brett was a model student with an ever-present smile, who  was involved in religious groups, varsity lacrosse and student government.  Brett’s older brother, Nate, recalled his  brother’s vibrant spirit when speaking  to the Indianapolis Star saying, Brett  ‘‘loved people very well, and he loved  them because his first love was Jesus.  He was  funny, witty and passionate  about just sucking the marrow out of  life. He always wanted people to know  they were loved.’’  Brett was killed while serving his  country in Operation Enduring Freedom.

125,Senate,109,-0.277,25,2005-04-04,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, a  Federal budget is about setting priorities, and the priorities contained in  this budget are all wrong.  About a year ago, Tom Friedman of  the New York Times, described the  President’s  budget  as  ‘‘faith-based.’’  Faith-based tax cuts were going to generate faith-based revenues, and we were  all going to be better off. Well, the deficit is skyrocketing, interest rates are  going  up,  and  additional  revenues  haven’t magically appeared.  If the budget before us were to pass  unchanged, the deficit would increase  each and every year for the foreseeable  future. Vermonters understand  that  this is a burden we don’t want to pass  on to our grandchildren. We have fallen  into a borrowing pattern that makes  this Yankee cringe.  But let me emphasize that the deficits that we are now facing are primarily caused by a drop in revenues,  not  by wasteful  spending  on  such  things as education, veterans’ benefits,  and Amtrak. We could eliminate all of  the  Federal  Government’s  discretionary spending outside of defense and  we would still have a deficit.  On the mandatory side of the budget,  I agree that we need to get a handle on  increases in Medicaid spending and the  pressures on Social Security due to the  aging baby boom generation. But this  budget  fails to confront these challenges and in the case of Social Security pretends there is no problem.  How can we pass a budget that ignores the cost of the Iraq War after  September 30? How can we pass a budget that includes more tax cuts for the  few, but doesn’t budget for the reform  of the alternative minimum tax or the  President’s own Social Security proposal?  How can we pass a budget that forces  us to ‘‘pay for’’ any increases in programs  for our neediest citizens but  doesn’t require us to ‘‘pay for’’ tax cuts  for the well-to-do? If we are to reinstate the pay-as-you-go rule, then it  should, as it always has, include paying  for both new spending and new tax  cuts.  Speaking of tax cuts, I have grown  very tired of the economic doublespeak  now in fashion. If tax cuts were the  policy of choice when we had large surpluses, and they are still the policy of  choice when we now have large deficits,  when if ever are tax cuts not the appropriate policy? Perhaps the families in  Vermont who used up their heating assistance funds before winter was over,  or the veteran on a waiting list for a  medical procedure at a VA hospital,  would prefer an increase in government  spending to a tax cut.  Priorities, it is all about priorities.  We are 2 years into a war. American  service men and women continue to  come home with horrific wounds, both  physical and mental. While the Department of Defense is keeping wounded  soldiers  in  its medical  system  for  longer periods of time and is shouldering a greater share of the costs, the  long-term costs of health care and rehabilitation still fall heaviest on the  Veterans Administration.  This  budget  responds  by  underfunding the VA by almost $16 billion  over the next 5 years. How can we do  this in the midst of a war? How can the  President in good conscience insist on  maintaining large numbers of troops in  Iraq, and yet refuse to provide for the  health care needs of veterans? This is  unacceptable.  This  budget  drastically  cuts  the  Community Development Block Grant,  CDBG, program and other programs  that our communities rely on. These  programs  now  benefit  so  many  Vermonters who struggle to make ends  meet. This budget would consolidate 18  programs,  including  the CDBG, and  slashes their funding by 34 percent. In  Vermont,  this  budget would most  harshly affect middle and low-income  citizens by making safe and affordable  housing unattainable, ending quality  childcare programs, and compromising  nutrition assistance. Funding for these  important economic development programs must be restored.  I am very concerned that agriculture,  conservation, and food assistance programs are faced with drastic cuts in  funding. The Milk Income Loss Contract Program, MILC, which the President saw fit to include in his proposed  budget, has been left out of this budget  resolution. The MILC Program is necessary to help family farmers through  tough times when milk prices are low.

Peter’s devotion and  service  have left a lasting impression on Mendocino  County.  Born in Germany, Peter immigrated with his  parents to the United States at the age of four.  He received his Bachelors Degree  from  the  University of California before he was drafted  into the United States Army during the Vietnam War. Upon his military discharge, Peter  enrolled in an evening law school program. At  the time, he worked for the Port of San Francisco  and  volunteered with Marin County  Legal Aid. He received the Demetrius Sepatsis  Award for Academic Excellence upon graduation.  Peter joined the Mendocino County Counsel’s office in 1978, one month after its creation.  In  1983,  he  was  appointed  as  Mendocino’s County Counsel, a position  in  which he has served with dedication and distinction  for  the past 22 years. Peter also  served on the Board of Directors for the California  State County Counsel  Association,  where he has been a long time member of the  Association’s Ethics Committee. The Association  is dedicated  to  the maintenance of  the  highest professional standards in the practice  of governmental law and service to the public.  After so many years of serving others,  I  know that Peter is looking forward to spending  more time with his wife Toni, and their three  grown children.  Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we recognize Hans-Peter Klein for his commitment and  dedication to his profession and for his service  to  the people of Mendocino County and his  country.  THE DEATH OF POPE JOHN  PAUL II  to his  peace.  final  resting place. May he  rest  in  HON. LANE EVANS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 8, 2005  ",2005
127,,109,-0.454,6,2005-04-08,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with great  sadness that I join my fellow Catholics and all  citizens of the world in mourning the passing  of Pope John Paul II. Though he is no longer  with us, his extraordinary  influence and  tremendous contributions to the fight against tyranny and oppression will live on.  Pope John Paul II was the 263rd successor  to Saint Peter, and was elected on October  16, 1978. He was the youngest Pope in 132  years at age 58. He was also the first Polish  Pope and  the  first non-Italian Pope  in 450  years. He was seen as active and charismatic,  and could often be found on the ski slopes of  Europe.  Throughout his papacy, Pope John Paul II  worked  tirelessly on behalf of human  rights  and the dignity of all mankind. In contrast with  the Vatican’s preoccupation with Europe, he  was the most traveled Pope in history and involved the Church in world issues.  He visited Africa more than a dozen times,  yet refused  to visit South Africa until  it had  ended its apartheid system. He sought to end  religious and ethnic violence  in Sudan and  Rwanda.  In Latin America, John Paul pressured Chile’s General Augusto Pinochet  to  hold free elections and helped defuse a dispute between Argentina and Peru. He also  visited Southeast Asia,  the  Indian subcontinent,  the Philippines, Haiti, North America,  and Scandinavia, among other destinations.  Pope John Paul  II  is widely credited with  helping  depose  Eastern  European  communism. He helped inspire the worker rebellions and the Solidarity movement in his native  Poland soon after he was elected. Twenty million Poles greeted the Pope during his nine  day homecoming, an exceptional show of discontent with  the one-party dictatorship  that  ruled the country.  He also  insisted  that  the Catholic Church  confront its past misdeeds, including the Inquisition in the 15th century. In 1999, he ordered  the Vatican to issue an ‘‘act of repentance’’ for  the church’s failure to prevent Nazi genocide  against Jews  in World War  II and acknowledged centuries of preaching contempt  for  Jews. The pope expanded upon this in March  2000, when he asked forgiveness for many of  his church’s past sins, including its treatment  of Jews, heretics, women and native peoples.  While John Paul believed in the infallibility of  the church, he recognized that its servants are  human and sometimes stray from the teachings of Jesus.  Along with  John Paul’s  involvement  in  human rights, I have been moved and personally strengthened by his active engagement in  papal duties  in spite of  the development of  Parkinson’s disease. He did not shrink  from  activity or  the public eye  though his body  began to shake and become unsteady. In fact,  it became part of his mission:  to show  the  world the value of each life, even in those who  are suffering from physical pain and the aging  process.  The world is now coming to grips with the  passing of Pope John Paul II. We are comforted that his teachings live on as he moves  f  HONORING  THE  LIFE  AND  ACHIEVEMENTS  OF  HIS  HOLINESS POPE JOHN PAUL  II AND  EXPRESSING PROFOUND SORROW  ON HIS DEATH  SPEECHOF  HON.

128,,109,0.208,6,2005-04-08,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  mourn the loss of a great spiritual and moral  leader for the world. Throughout his lifetime,  he experienced Fascism, Communism and  rampant materialism. He never lost sight of his  own values and beliefs and lived his life as an  example that all of us regardless of faith could  look to.  The earthly light of this Pope has been lost  but his eternal light will shine forever. The millions of pilgrims flowing into St. Peter’s Square  reflect  the genuine warmth and respect  this  man of God had  throughout  the world. He  spoke for the poor, the homeless, the infirmed,  the oppressed and everyone  listened. His  message of caring and love certainly played a  major role in many of the changes we have  seen across the global map. Walls came down  and individual freedom arose from rubble.  To me it was especially noteworthy to watch  the Pope reach out to the youth of the world  and how warmly  they returned his affection.  Their bond will long be remembered.  In life Pope John Paul II showed us how to  live and in death, showed how to die. He has  returned to his Lord and Savior having earned  the reward of ‘‘Welcome home my good and  faithful servant.’’ We have been blessed by his  presence on earth and his  legacy will be a  strength for generations to come.  f  THE INTRODUCTION OF THE COLLEGIATE HOUSING AND  INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF 2005  HON.

130,House,109,0.258,3,2005-04-21,Mr. MURPHY.,"  Madam  Speaker,  study after study associates untreated  depression with  increased  rates  of  chronic  illness and  increased health  care costs. For cancer, heart disease,  asthma, arthritis, diabetes  the  incidence of depression can be double that  of the general population. Untreated  depression complicates treatment and  can double health care costs. Untreated  depression can cost employers $51 billion per year.  Depression management  programs,  however, can save employers an average of $2,600 per employee through increased productivity and reduced absenteeism.  The time has come to improve health  care by integrating and coordinating  medical and mental health services for  more  effective  diagnosis  and  treatment.  Rather than just cut the payments  for health care, Congress can lead the  way to saving lives and money through  integrated care. Science supports this,  and I look forward to working with my  colleagues to transform our health care  system through  innovation,  information, and  incentives to  lower health  care costs for every American. I ask  my colleagues to learn more about integrated care by visiting my website at  Murphy.house.gov.  f  THE ENERGY BILL  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

The studies that the gentleman cites  did not take a look at the top-to-bottom consolidation of the oil industry.  There have been a number of studies,  but each study has been conducted almost in a vacuum without considering  the entirety, the entire scope of this  problem, a problem  that  is putting  small,  independent  retailers  out  of  business and driving up prices on every  street corner in America.  We are not taking a position necessarily on the issue. We are simply  saying it ought to be a responsibility of  the Federal Government to investigate  this situation, to talk about the marketplace.  The other side speaks passionately  about free and fair markets and competition. The purpose of free, fair and  competitive markets is to help drive  prices down. By opposing this amendment, we are protecting an industry  which is driving prices up.  I am deeply disappointed that the  other side would take that position. I  urge them to reconsider.

The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes  appeared to have it.  ",2005
135,House,109,-0.409,24,2005-04-21,Mr. KENNEDY of Rhode Island.," Mr.  Chairman, on behalf of the citizens of  Pascoag, Rhode Island, who have lived  with contaminated water from MBTE,  I rise in support of the Capps amendment.  I would like to thank my good friend Congresswoman CAPPS for  fighting  to bring  this  debate to the floor today.  I have seen  firsthand  the devastation  that  the gasoline additive MTBE can have on our  local communities.  In my home state of Rhode Island, the citizens of Pascoag were unable  to use  their  water for months due to this contamination.  No child should have to turn on the water  faucet to have their tap water smell like turpentine.  But the provision in this bill that seeks to  protect MTBE manufacturers is simply yet another one of many that puts the needs of individuals and families below the requests of industry in this dangerous bill.  I urge my colleagues to take a stand for the  forty-five million Americans whose water systems have been affected by MTBE contamination and vote to strike this provision from the  bill.  ",2005
136,House,109,-0.473,24,2005-04-21,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman,  the  Republican leadership in the House has  done everything it could possibly do to  keep us from voting on this issue. They  so badly wanted to protect the oil companies and to push the costs onto the  local governments to take care of the  polluted drinking water.  We had a vote earlier, as the gentleman from Texas (Chairman BARTON)  indicated, but it was on a procedural  vote. Now we have a vote on the merits. And if we do not support the Capps  amendment, we are keeping this unfunded mandate  in the bill and our  local governments are going to have to  pick up the billions of dollars of costs  to clean up the drinking water.  That is why it is an unfunded mandate. And that is why I am speaking  for the Republican side of the Chamber,  because the Republicans came in under  the Contract with America and said,  We want to do away with unfunded  mandates, and we will  let them be  challenged on the House floor.  And I congratulate the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. CAPPS) for bringing this to the House floor under a procedure that the Republicans allowed.  States’ rights, that used to be a Republican position. But this bill has the  view that Washington knows best. So  we do not let States decide things anymore. They cannot regulate, or participate even, in key energy decisions affecting States and localities such as  LNG facilities or relicensing of hydroelectric dams. Washington knows best.  And in this bill the most egregious example of arrogant  centralization of  power in Washington is this massive  unfunded mandate.  We have heard that Congress insisted  that MBTE be used for reformulated  gas. That is not true. Under the Clean  Air Act, we required reformulated gasoline, but we left it to the oil companies to decide how to do that, and they  were using MBTE before the 1990 Clean  Air Act was adopted. Now  that we  know what they may have known in  advance, that MBTE can cause problems in our drinking water, they want  to shift the costs from the oil companies that have caused the pollution to  the local taxpayers.  I remember when Republicans would  have objected to this. And I hope today  they will object to it as well. And I  guess the Republican leadership fears  that they might, because that is why  they  have  gone  to  such  enormous  lengths to not allow anybody in this  Chamber to vote on this specific issue.  Every time we asked the Committee on  Rules to allow a motion to strike be in  order, they denied it. There was a point  of order raised, and that way they were  able to keep us from voting on it.  But thanks to Newt Gingrich and the  Contract with America, we have this  way of bringing the issue on the merits. Vote for the Capps amendment.

The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 28 offered by Mr. INSLEE:  At the end of title XXVI add the following:  SEC. ll. LIMITATION ON RENT AND OTHER  CHARGES WITH RESPECT TO WIND  ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  ON PUBLIC LANDS.  (a) INGENERAL.—The Secretary of the Interior may  not  impose  rent  and  other  charges, excluding for the cost of processing  rights-of-way, with respect to any wind energy development project on public  lands  that, in the aggregate, exceed 50 percent of  the maximum amount of rent that could be  charged with respect to that project under  the terms of Bureau of Land Management Instruction Memorandum No. 2003–020, dated  October 16, 2002.

139,House,109,-0.338,38,2005-04-21,Mr. BISHOP of New York.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise to express my support of the amendment  offered by Mr. CASTLE to strike the Liquefied  Natural Gas (LNG) Siting provision in H.R. 6.  The language included in H.R. 6 silences the  voices of state governments, local municipalities, and environmental advocacy organizations during  the LNG  terminal site selection  process.  Mr. Chairman, the language in H.R. 6 solidifying FERC’s exclusive  role  in  the siting of  LNG  terminals  is entirely unnecessary. Until  recently, only one LNG  importation  terminal  existed in the country. There are now five in  operation and 6 more have already been approved by federal regulators. The process for  selecting sites and approving LNG importation  terminals is working and in no way requires  removing partial-authority  from  states. The  new FERC rule would be another example of  catering  to  the already  too powerful oil and  gas industry.  Furthermore, when I cast my vote in support  of Mr. CASTLE’s  amendment  to  preserve  states’  rights and strike  this  language  from  H.R. 6, I know that I will also be speaking for  many others residing in my district and across  the Nation. Numerous organizations and legislative bodies who seek to be heard will speak  through my vote,  including, but certainly not  limited to the League of Conservation Voters,  National Association of Counties, U.S. Public  Interest Research Group, National League of  Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors, and  the  National Conference of States Legislatures,  and so many more.  A quarter-mile long floating LNG importation  terminal has been proposed in the Long Island  Sound between Connecticut and Long Island.  Lawmakers and civic organizations at every  level of government in my congressional district have expressed  their opposition  to  this  proposal and are furious at the prospect that  their voices will be silenced during the FERC  approval process. Mr. CASTLE’s amendment, if  passed, will allow their opinions to count.  The  Long  Island Sound  is  an  environmentally unique estuary that needs to be protected. The residents and elected officials of  Long Island have fought vigorously for many  years and spent millions of dollars to preserve  the quality of life that the Long Island Sound  offers. Additionally, our tourism and fishing industries, which provide billions of dollars to the  state’s economy, will be threatened, as fishermen will undoubtedly be displaced.  Mr. Chairman, I will speak for my constituents by  lending my support  to Mr. CASTLE’s  amendment. I urge my colleagues to support  this bipartisan measure.  ",2005

141,House,109,0.471,45,2005-04-21,Mr. WELDON of Florida.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise today to speak in support of H.R. 6, the  Energy Policy Act of 2005. It’s a tremendous  step  in  the  right direction  for  this nation  to  achieve  energy  independence.  Through  a  combined strategy of strong R&D, efficiency  and incentives we can help ensure future generations of Americans a vibrant and growing  economy while not having to worry about the  whims of foreign influence on our energy.  The bill also authorizes $200 million for the  ‘‘Clean Cities’’ program, which will provide  grants to state and local governments to acquire alternative fueled vehicles. I have been  working in Central Florida over the past several years to promote research into hydrogen-  powered vehicles. I applaud the White House  for  taking such a proactive stance on new  technologies. This bill promotes a cleaner environment by encouraging new  innovations  and the use of alternative power sources by  launching a state-of-the-art program to enable  hydrogen fuel cell cars to compete in the marketplace by 2020.  Under  this bill, American consumers will  have better product labeling for a number of  commercial and household products so  that  they will be able to make more informed decisions when purchasing energy saving products. H.R. 6 further decreases America’s dangerous dependence on foreign oil by expanding domestic production and authorizing expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve’s  capacity to 1 billion barrels of oil.  America’s energy consumption is at an all-  time high and  rising, despite ongoing efficiency gains, with consumption projected  to  grow as our economy expands. If our nation is  to meet these needs in the coming decades,  it will be in part due to continued advances in  energy efficiency and conservation—helping to  reduce our demand on  foreign supply and  stimulating economic growth. One goal is to  save consumers and businesses’ money spent  on energy, so  they can  invest, spend and  grow the economy and improve our standard  of living. Expanding our energy production capacity is a key to long-term economic growth  and energy independence.  H.R. 6 encourages the great American tradition of  technological  innovation and creative  problem solving. It is America working at its  best and  this  legislation  is  long overdue.  I  stand in strong support of this legislation and  look forward to seeing it enacted into law.  ",2005
142,House,109,-0.288,45,2005-04-21,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in opposition to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act  of 2005.  For the third time in 5 years, the House Republican leadership has passed up an historic  opportunity  to craft an energy policy  for  the  21st Century. With oil prices hitting record levels and repeated predictions that the cost of a  barrel of oil could hit over $100 in the coming  years, we should be focusing our efforts on alleviating our nation’s dependence on  fossil  fuels.  Instead, H.R. 6 is stuck in the past. Modeled  after the energy plan developed by Vice President CHENEY’s  secret energy  committee 4  years ago, H.R. 6 reflects the philosophy that  the only solution  to  the high price of oil  is  more oil. However, analyses by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration indicate that even if the provisions  of H.R. 6 becomes law, America’s imports of  foreign oil will still increase by as much as 85  percent during the next 20 years, thereby increasing our dependency.  H.R. 6 should have been an honest, bipartisan effort to halt America’s growing dependence on fossil fuels for energy. It could have  been  focused  on  developing  new  technologies,  improving  energy  efficiency,  promoting renewable energy, and conducting the  research and development that could produce  the breakthroughs that would power the world  of tomorrow.  I have no objection to supporting some new  or additional oil and gas exploration or production because, until we develop the energy alternatives of the future, we must continue to  VerDate Aug 31 2005  07:22 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H21AP5.REC H21AP5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005
143,House,109,-0.376,52,2005-04-21,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in opposition to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act.  I believe every Member  in  this chamber  agrees that our country faces a potential energy crisis if we do not act quickly to establish  a new national energy policy. We need  to  make major  investments  in energy self-reliance,  infrastructure, and new  technologies.  However, where we differ is on how best to  achieve those goals. When I look at the provisions of this bill, I do not see a clear vision for  America’s future. Instead, I see a policy that  promises more of the same and that does not  end our nations’ dependence on foreign oil. It  astonishes me that the nation that mobilized to  put an American on the moon is not leading  the world in developing new, clean and renewable energy sources. Such an effort would revitalize our economy,  improve our environment, and strengthen our national security.  However, this mission can be successful only  with the leadership of Congress and the President, and I regret that we have not pursued  that goal here today.  Instead, this bill clings to the incorrect assumption that our nation can drill and dig its  way to energy independence. Although transportation is the largest source of oil consumption in the nation, H.R. 6 authorizes drilling in  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge rather than  making modest  improvements  to automobile  fuel efficiency standards. Instead of investing  in renewable energy sources, 93 percent of its  $8.1 billion in energy production tax incentives  are targeted toward gas, oil, and other non-renewable sources.  The measure also includes some very disturbing provisions that can damage the health  and safety of our citizens. H.R. 6 includes a liability exemption for manufacturers of MTBE,  the  fuel additive  that has contaminated  the  groundwater of communities  throughout  the  nation, including in Pascoag, Rhode Island. It  also strips states of their ability to provide for  the safety of their citizens by granting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission almost  unlimited authority in siting new liquefied natural gas facilities. A recent study by the Department of Energy noted a deliberate attack  on a LNG tanker could result in a deadly fire  reaching as far as a mile away. Nevertheless,  FERC is considering an application for a LNG  facility in Providence, in proximity to Interstate  95, schools, neighborhoods, and Rhode Island  Hospital, the only Level trauma center in the  state. A broad, bipartisan group of state public  officials,  including  the Governor, Lieutenant  Governor, Attorney General, Mayor of Providence,  and  the Congressional  delegation,  have expressed their united opposition to the  proposal, but the provisions in this bill would  place  the decision solely  in  the hands of  FERC without the consent of those elected to  protect the people of Rhode Island.  Last week, right before the April 15th tax filing deadline, this Congress passed an estate  tax bill that benefited only the wealthiest one-  third of one percent of Americans while adding  massive debt  to burden  future generations.  Today, the day before Earth Day, we are considering an energy bill that provides massive  tax breaks to the oil and gas industry instead  of investing in cleaner renewable sources and  energy efficiency. Again, Congress has identified a problem and responded  in a  fashion  contrary to the long-term interests of our nation. I am deeply disappointed in this measure  and urge my colleagues to vote against it so  that we can refocus our efforts on an energy  policy for America’s future.  ",2005
144,House,109,-0.343,52,2005-04-21,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise regrettably in opposition to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act. While there are many good  provisions  in  the act  that make modest  improvements  in support of energy efficiency,  there are major deficiencies in this bill.  My constituents are very clear about  the  problems they face. First, gas prices are too  high at the pump. Second, our country will always have  to  rely on  foreign-produced oil.  Third,  the costs of electricity have been  inflated by the manipulations of energy corporations which have not been required to refund  their illegal profits. In addition, many are concerned about  the effect of greenhouse gas  emissions. This measure does not strongly address these issues.  The cost of gas is a function of supply and  demand.

149,Senate,109,-0.166,129,2005-04-21,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Mr. President, as debate about the supplemental appropriations for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan  comes to a close, I would like to ensure  that our focus remains on the welfare  of our Nation’s troops.  That is why I would like to speak on  behalf of the men and women who are  serving in our Nation’s Armed Forces—  those currently on active duty as well  as  in  the National Guard and Reserves—who are serving today in Iraq,  Afghanistan, and across the globe.  Since the President declared an end  to major combat operations in Iraq on  May 1, 2003, 1,419 American troops have  died in Iraq and more than 11,000 have  been wounded.  Even if combat in Iraq is something  that no longer makes the front pages of  our newspapers, it is still agonizingly  clear that our troops remain in danger.  That is why it is even more important for this body to use sound judgment and good planning. One of my  major concerns is that year after year  we have found a way to take the process of funding military operations in  Iraq and Afghanistan out of our regular  budget process.  I am frustrated, quite frankly, that  we have been subjected to this biannual ritual. I am frustrated that questioning the timing of these requests  may cause our political opponents to  call us unpatriotic. But, most of all, I  am frustrated that doing my duty as a  U.S. Senator could be considered anything less than keeping a sacred trust  with our men and women in uniform.  In April of 2003, just a little over 2  years ago, Congress, at the President’s  request,  provided  approximately  $78  billion to meet the challenge in Iraq.  Six months later, in October of 2003,  the administration came back to us  and requested another $87 billion in the  form of a supplemental appropriation  to fund continuing operations in Iraq.  In early June of 2004, the Senate  voted for another $25 billion to keep  operations going through the end of  that year. Now we are faced with yet  another emergency  supplemental  request of more than $80 billion.  I agree that there is a need to adequately fund our troops. We must do  everything we can to protect our men  and women who are  in harms’ way.  What I don’t understand, quite frankly,  is this President’s inability or unwillingness to make this request a part of  the normal budget and appropriation  process that we go through every year.  As you recall, in April of 2003, the  President requested $78 billion in emergency military funding. We were at the  beginning of a war. Although it was a  war of our choosing, I understood the  uncertainty that war brings. Furthermore, I understood the value of not allowing our enemies to get a read on our  intent by peering into our budget process over the course of a year. I supported the President’s request.  A mere 6 months  later, President  Bush returned to this body to request  another $87 billion for ongoing military  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. At  that time, our troops were facing the  imminent and ever-present danger of  guerilla attacks.  Also, many of our troops were expressing concerns that they were not  adequately trained for the specialized  demands of peacekeeping and policing  that the reconstruction effort required.  Moreover, the dangers and difficulties that our troops faced went far beyond the threat posed by attacks from  insurgents and guerillas.  I grew  increasingly concerned about the conditions under which many of our troops  were being forced to serve in the Middle East.  I was  consistently  hearing  about  shortages of quality food and water. I  was hearing that our troops were not  properly equipped with the tools of  warfare. I was hearing of parents sending their children bullet-proof vests because the military could not or would  not provide them.  Although  the  administration  had  completely misjudged  the nature of  this conflict,  I understood that our  troops must not suffer because others  had let them down. I understood that  whatever this administration’s shortcomings were in terms of planning, our  troops’  safety and well being came  first. I supported the President’s request.  Once again, in June of 2004, this administration asked for another $25 billion supplemental for the ongoing efforts in Iraq. At that time, we were  spending money in Iraq at an unexpectedly high rate, the promised money  from Iraqi oil receipts was becoming an  urban legend, and we were still dealing  with a pervasive insurgency.  By June of 2004, we knew or should  have known that Iraq was going to be  a part of this Nation’s financial responsibility for some time to come. But I  understood that the situation was still  uncertain. We had only been in Iraq little more than a year and I was sure  that the President’s 2006 Defense budget proposal would more accurately reflect the costs of the war. I understood  that we could not drop the ball on the  welfare of our troops. I supported the  President’s request.  Now the President is requesting an  additional $80 billion to support ongoing military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It seems as if we have been here  before. I have to ask myself, when does  an ‘‘emergency’’ supplemental request  become  sufficiently  routine  that  it  should be considered as part of our normal budget process?  Over the last 2 years we have been  subjected  to  this  ‘‘emergency’’  four  times. We have had two budgets come  to Capitol Hill from this administration  in that time. Neither of those  budgets requested one thin dime  in  support of our troops in Iraq or Afghanistan.  The present way in which we fund  these  conflicts  is  irresponsible  and  unsustainable. This administration, by  not properly submitting this request  through the normal budget and appropriations process, has effectively cut  off our oversight role.  We now only have a scant few weeks  to consider one of the most important  pieces of  funding  legislation we will  consider  this year. Furthermore, as  this supplemental becomes more and  more routine, we run the risk of hiding  the true costs of the war  from the  American people.  The American  people  have  every  right to know, in as clear and straightforward a manner as possible, what the  financial costs of the war are. By excluding those costs from the normal  budget process we obscure the true effect of this conflict on our national  debt, our budget and our economy. I  believe that the American people deserve more transparency from us.  We are now at the point where poor  budget planning is no longer acceptable. We can no longer accept the argument  that  unexpected  events  have  changed our outlook therefore we must  have a supplemental. We know that  Iraq is unpredictable. We know that  unforseen events occur. Our planning  must be flexible enough to accommodate this reality.  We see very clearly the effects of  poor planning. We have seen it in the  way our troops have been inadequately  equipped early on in this conflict. We  have seen it in the way this administration has failed to properly budget  and has been forced to run to Congress  for emergency funds every 6 months.

150,Senate,109,0.434,143,2005-04-21,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to pay tribute to a good friend  who recently retired after three decades on the radio. John Ed Willoughby,  who has  been  a  familiar  voice  on  WAPI-AM  1070s morning  talk-radio  show, ‘‘The Breakfast Club,’’ signed off  on April 15, 2005. John Ed’s last day on  the air was the 30th anniversary of his  first day on the air: April 15, 1975. Over  the years, I had many opportunities to  join John Ed on the air, and I always  appreciated his candid, honest, and humorous demeanor.  John Ed was born February 3, 1935, in  Birmingham, AL. He attended West  End High School, where he excelled on  the athletic field as quarterback of the  football team, and captain of the baseball and basketball teams.  He attended the University of Alabama  in Tuscaloosa, which  is where  our friendship began. We met as students at the University of Alabama,  and it was there that we both served as  members of the Delta Chi fraternity.  His radio career began  in 1975 on  WSGN  radio  with  cohost  Tommy  Charles. The duo was an instant success  and  became Birmingham’s  top  rated radio morning show for 81⁄2years.  John Ed and Tommy then moved to  WVOK-AM/WQUS-FM for a short time  before going to WERC radio in 1985.  They were a talk radio  force to be  reckoned with, remaining No. 1 in Birmingham, until Tommy’s passing  in  1996. Following Tommy’s death, Doug  Layton joined John Ed and they stayed  on the air until February of 1998. In  June of 1998, John Ed joined his son, J  Willoughby and Scott Michaels for a  morning show devoted to talk radio on  WAPI-AM  called  ‘‘The  Breakfast  Club.’’ He would finish out his career  at WAPI.  I have had  the pleasure of being  interviewed  by  John Ed  numerous  times over the years. Whether it was  in-studio  in Birmingham,  in Washington during one of his visits, or over  the phone, John Ed has been informative and fair. His listeners could count  on  a  funny  and  enlightening  show  every morning.  John Ed is blessed with a wonderful  family.  I suspect that his newfound  free time will give him the opportunity  to enjoy more time with his wife Jean,  son J, daughter-in-law Kim and granddaughter Samantha Jean.

152,Senate,109,-0.446,150,2005-04-21,Mr. CORZINE.," Mr. President, I am  pleased  to  join  with  Senators  Santorum, Schumer, and DeMint in introducing  the ASPIRE Act of  2005,  which would expand opportunities for  young adults, encourage savings, and  promote financial literacy, by establishing investment accounts, known as  KIDS Accounts,  for  every  child  in  America.  ASPIRE is based largely on a similar  initiative in the United Kingdom developed by Prime Minister Tony Blair.  Yet despite its British roots, the proposal  is based on the most basic of  American  values.  By  giving  every  young person resources with which to  get a start in life, ASPIRE will help realize the American ideal of equal opportunity. And by making every young  person an investor, the proposal would  encourage self reliance, promote savings, and give every family a personal  stake in America’s economy.  Under ASPIRE, an  investment account would be established for every  American child upon receiving a Social  Security number. Each account would  be  funded  initially with $500. Those  with  incomes  less than the national  median would  receive an additional  contribution of up to $500, and would  receive  a  one-for-one  government  match  for their  first $500 of private  contributions each year. Up to $1000 of  after-tax private contributions would  be allowed annually from any source.  Funds would accumulate tax-free and  could not be withdrawn for purposes  other than higher education until the  child reaches the age of 18. At that  point, funds could be withdrawn, according to Roth IRA guidelines, either  for higher education or for the purchase of a home. Funds left unspent  would be saved for retirement under  rules similar to those that apply to  Roth IRAs or rolled over to a 529 plan  for educational expenses. Once the account holder reaches the age of 30, the  initial  $500 government contribution  would have to be repaid, though exceptions could be made to avoid undue  hardship.  Accounts initially would be held by a  government entity that would be based  on the successful Thrift Savings Plan,  or TSP, which now manages retirement  accounts for Federal employees with  relatively low administrative costs. As  with the TSP, investors would have a  range of investment options, such as a  Government securities fund, a fixed income investment fund, and a common  stock fund. However, once an account  holder reaches the age of 18,  funds  could be rolled over to a KIDS Account  held at a private institution.  It is difficult to understate the potential impact of giving every American child a funded investment account  of their own. For the first time, every  child will have a meaningful incentive  to  learn the basics of  investing, because they will have real resources to  invest. For the first time, even families  with modest incomes will have a significant incentive to save, to earn the  government match. And, perhaps most  fundamentally, for the first time, every  American child will grow up knowing  that when they reach adulthood, they  will have the ability to invest in themselves and in their own education. In  short, every child will have hope for a  real future.  Considering  its potentially  significant social and individual benefits, the  ASPIRE Act requires an  investment  that is relatively modest. It has been  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:14 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S21AP5.REC S21AP5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005
153,,109,0.554,178,2005-04-21,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  speak on the importance and effectiveness of  defibrillators. Heart disease kills more  than  250,000 Americans each year and many of  these deaths result  from sudden cardiac arrest, SCA. The most effective  treatment  for  SCA is immediate defibrillation, in which thousands of  lives are saved. Recognizing  this  years ago, I had the honor of working with the  American Heart Association, AHA,  in developing  legislation addressing SCA. This cooperation  led  to  the Cardiac Arrest Survival  Act. Now, I am pleased to see that the AHA  is  donating,  to  Alachua County,  Florida,  defibrillators  to  be  placed  in  each  public  school in Alachua County. The move comes in  light of two incidents earlier this school year,  in which area high school students collapsed.  In Florida, nearly 12,800 people suffer a cardiac arrest each year, and 95 percent of them  die. AHA’s goal is to increase the survival rate  from 5 to 20 percent and I support and stand  behind them in reaching this end.  f  TRIBUTE TO POPE BENEDICT XVI  HON.

154,,109,-0.272,185,2005-04-21,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I  join my  fellow  Texans—and many around the Southwest and  the nation in paying special tribute to Laura  Canales, a very special artistic pioneer, and a  talented  South  Texan, who  accomplished  great  things  throughout her  lifetime of performing.  Before  there was  the  phenomenon  of  Tejano  giant  Selena,  there  was  Laura  Canales, who paved the way for a number of  Tejano artists  in  the  late 20th Century. She  contributed much  to our culture and  to  the  music  industry, and became known as  the  ‘‘Barbara Streisand of Tejano music’’ and as  ‘‘Reina de  la Onda Tejana,’’  (queen of  the  Tejano wave).  Tejano is a popular type of music in Texas  and the Southwest that has become a huge  industry with its own category in the Grammy  Awards. Tejano is a combination of rock-n-roll  and German Conjunto music. Some of the cultural  influences  on Tejano music  include:  Anglo, African, German, and Italian.  Tejano was originally dominated by male  performers and  it was nearly  impossible  for  women to break through in this genre. Laura  Canales, with her unique voice and  love of  performing, became the first woman to enjoy  real success in the world of Tejano, and was  honored as the first woman to be inducted into  the Tejano ROOTS Hall of Fame  in Alice,  Texas. This museum is the only one that is  entirely dedicated  in honoring great Tejano  music figures.  Laura’s influence on Tejano music became  readily apparent during the 1970’s and 1980’s.  With her distinctive voice and popularity, she  released various albums that became hits, including her debut album, Si Vivi Contigo. Her  numerous accomplishments  include a dozen  Tejano music awards, including Female Vocalist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, and  Female  Entertainer  of  the  Year.  This  Kingsville, Texas, native also understood the  value of education, earning a bachelor’s degree in clinical psychology from Texas A&M  University and pursuing a master’s degree.  Laura Canales proved that a woman could  be successful  in  the Tejano music  industry  . . . she broke  the gender barriers  that existed at the dawn of the emergence of popular  Tejano . . . and she and paved the way for  future, female Tejano performers.  This Tejano legend and daughter of South  Texas will truly be missed, although she will  live on in her music, to be enjoyed by many  future connoisseurs of Tejano. I ask my colleagues to join me in keeping her family—and  her many fans—in our thoughts and prayers at  this difficult time.  f  IN HONOR OF THE CITY OF  HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY  HON.

156,,109,-0.553,192,2005-04-21,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, I join Chairman YOUNG in introducing, by request, the Administration’s Amtrak ‘‘reform’’ legislation. It is  a common practice  for  the Chairman and  Ranking Member of a Committee to jointly introduce an Administration’s bill, regardless of  which political party controls the White House  or Congress or the specifics of proposed legislation, and I do this as a courtesy to the Administration. However, introducing a bill ‘‘by request’’ should not be interpreted to imply endorsement.  In  fact,  in  this  instance,  I am  strongly opposed to the Administration’s legislative proposal  for Amtrak and  the direction  this Administration has chosen  for  intercity  passenger rail service in our Nation.  The Administration’s  proposal  is  nothing  new. It is the same flawed bill that the Administration sent to Congress in 2003. The bill establishes two private for-profit corporations to  separately manage and maintain infrastructure  and operations, eliminates our Nation’s intercity passenger rail network and shifts the cost  burden of continuing rail service to the States,  separates the Northeast Corridor from the rest  of the rail network, divides Amtrak into three  separate entities, and eliminates Federal operating support for all intercity passenger trains  over a four-year period. As a practical matter,  within three years, all long-distance train service is likely to be eliminated. Soon thereafter,  the United States entire  intercity passenger  system could consist of skeletal service along  the East and West coasts.  The Administration’s  trust  in  the magic of  privatization and decentralization to solve Amtrak’s problems  is astonishing.  It shows  this  Administration’s  ignorance of  the disastrous  consequences of privatization and under-investment  in  rail. Great Britain’s experience  with privatization  is a perfect example.  In  1994, government-owned British Rail was dissolved and the British government separated  intercity passenger rail infrastructure from operations. A private corporation called Railtrack  took over ownership of all track, signaling, and  stations. Passenger train operators competed  with each other  to provide service. Unfortunately,  the new approach assumed  that private sector  innovation and discipline would  drive down  the  railway’s public  funding  requirement and drive up quality of service,  overcoming recent trends of falling demand. It  didn’t work, and it led to tragic consequences.  The safety of operations and the quality of  service declined steadily. More than 30 people  were killed in an accident at Ladbroke Grove  in 1999 and four more were killed in an accident at Hatfield in 2000. In 2001, another fatal  accident occurred at Potters, just north of London. These accidents were directly traceable  to privatization and Britain’s  long history of  under-investment in rail.  Today,  the British government  is  reeling  from  the  legacy  left behind by privatization.  The government has almost doubled funding  for rail, and has taken steps to improve performance and  tackle  the backlog of maintenance and renewal needs that exploded under  privatization. British government officials have  described their rail privatization as ‘‘an absolute disaster’’.  Despite the British experience, the Bush Administration’s blind faith in the ideology of privatization leads it down the same wrong path.  Let us not repeat Britain’s mistake. The solution to Amtrak’s problems is not privatization.  Amtrak’s  problems  have  one  root  cause:  money. Lack of adequate investment and the  annual threat of elimination have conditioned  Amtrak to focus on survival.  Amtrak’s opponents are quick to point fingers at Amtrak management, and claim that  private  corporations  could  dramatically  improve  intercity passenger  rail  service. The  truth is that a succession of hardworking and  dedicated management teams at Amtrak could  not do  the  impossible—that  is, operate our  Nation’s intercity rail passenger service without a substantial level of investment from the  Federal Government. Railroads throughout the  world  receive some government support  to  supplement the revenues paid by passengers.  But the Administration continues to insist on  the impossible.  Yet despite Amtrak’s starvation budget, Amtrak has had  its  successes. Under David  Gunn’s leadership, Amtrak has improved operations and increased ridership to more than 25  million passengers in 2004: an increase of one  million passengers from 2003 and an Amtrak  record. In Southern California, Amtrak’s Pacific  Surfliner has had a 26.3 percent increase in  ridership  in  the past year.  In Southern California, Amtrak’s Pacific Surfliner has had a  26.3 percent increase in ridership in the past  year. Similarly, several Midwest  trains,  the  Pere Marquette (up 22.1 percent), the State  House (up 13 percent) and the Illini (up 11.4  percent),  experienced  the  next  largest  increases in passengers. In the East, regional  trains carried more passengers than any other  Amtrak service in the country, increasing from  5,760,499 last year to 5,974,806—an increase  of 3.7 percent.  Amtrak has also made significant progress  in  rebuilding  infrastructure and  rolling stock  after years of deferred maintenance. In fiscal  years 2003 and 2004, 256,000 concrete ties  were  laid; 2,755 bridge  ties were  replaced;  266 miles of continuous welded rail were installed; 34 miles of signal cable were  replaced; and 19 stations and 37 substations  were improved.  Amtrak’s mechanical department plowed full  steam ahead. In 2004, it remanufactured 180  passenger cars, rebuilt 51 wrecked cars and  locomotives, and made seven Superliner baggage modifications in passenger cars.  Amtrak sold excess equipment, eliminated  unprofitable services, lowered fares on long-  distance routes to increase ridership, and, in  partnership  with  the  State  of  California,  opened a $71 million maintenance facility.  In short, Amtrak is making great progress.  All of this progress will halt under the Administration’s radical Amtrak reform plan.  Therefore, while I join in introducing this bill  as a traditional courtesy to the Administration,  I want to be clear that I do not support its initiatives. Together with Chairman YOUNG, Subcommittee  Chairman  Subcommittee Ranking Member BROWN, and the  other Members of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure,  I strongly support  both H.R. 1630,  the Amtrak Reauthorization  Act of 2005, and H.R. 1631,  the Rail  Infrastructure Development and Expansion Act for  the 21st Century (RIDE 21). In the 108th Congress,  the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure reported similar bills with near  unanimous bipartisan support. I am very hopeful that the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure will again soon consider this bipartisan  legislation and begin  to provide  the  necessary investment for our Nation’s intercity  passenger  rail system—that  is  the  ‘‘reform’’  that Amtrak so direly needs.

158,House,109,0.584,2,2005-05-03,Mr. CHABOT.," Mr. Speaker, for several years now, President Bush’s judicial nominees have been filibustered,  including those who would fill four vacancies in the Sixth Circuit Court of  Appeals located in my district in Cincinnati, Ohio. This is unprecedented.  Some would have us believe blocking  judicial nominations is a long and revered tradition. Nothing could be further from the truth. Never before have  judicial nominees with clear majority  support been denied the courtesy of an  up-or-down vote. Not once.  The filibuster is not part of the Constitution. It is not even part of the old  Senate rules. While it is a useful tool  when  considering  legislation,  and  should remain as such, we cannot allow  filibustering of  judicial nominations.  Each time a nominee is denied an up-  or-down vote, the impact is vast. Not  only is our Federal judiciary weakened,  but our Constitution becomes more  vulnerable; and as chairman of  the  Subcommittee on the Constitution, let  me emphasize that these actions are  unprecedented and should be abhorrent  to those of us who are bound by oath to  uphold our country’s most sacred document, the United States Constitution.  ASTHMA AWARENESS DAY  ",2005
159,House,109,0.554,2,2005-05-03,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Asthma Awareness Day. I rise to  celebrate  the October  2003  enacted  Asthmatic Students Treatment  and  Health Management Act, ASTHMA. It  is now Public Law 108–377 and was H.R.  2023 in the House and the Senate bill  was S. 2815. I introduced this with the  gentleman  from Rhode  Island  (Mr.  KENNEDY), and Senator ENZIand Senator KENNEDYcarried the mantle there.  Mr. Speaker, this law provides incentives for States to pass favorable laws  that guarantee that students can carry  and use prescribed medicine and anaphylaxis medications while in school.  It is not a mandate, and incurs no new  spending. The  idea has been germinating since the early 1990s and has  been building momentum since.  On Asthma Awareness Day, May 7,  2003, there were only 20 asthma-friendly States in our United States. Even  more limiting, of these 20, only nine  extended that protection even further  to anaphylaxis medication  like epinephrine auto-injectors. Today, according to the Allergy and Asthma Network, Mothers of Asthmatics, we have  a strong number of 41 States protecting  for asthma, 26 for asthma plus anaphylaxis, and four have legislation pending  for both conditions. Four that have  asthma laws have legislation pending  for anaphylaxis, and there is one State  just getting started and has legislation  that  is pending  for asthma anaphylaxis-carrying students.  Mr. Speaker, this is a dramatic upswing for our children. I am especially  proud to report what is going on in  Florida. Florida has been an inhaler-  friendly State for years, but now there  is legislation pending to include epinephrine auto-injectors.  My friend and constituent, Dr. Karl  Altenberger,  an  allergist  in Ocala,  Florida, has been active in advancing  this  for his patients  in the Florida  State  legislature. He  is to be commended. This bill passed last week and  is ready for the Governor’s signature.  Just yesterday, the Orlando Sentinel  reported ‘‘Girl fights for allergy law as  lives depend on it.’’ In Celebration, a  central Florida town, lives 9-year-old  Kelsey Ryan. ‘‘Severely allergic to peanuts, she has never known life without  her EpiPen. The dose of adrenaline inside could save her life and is with her  at all times: in classrooms, on field  trips, and during school activities. Now  Kelsey has been urging Tallahassee  lawmakers to pass a bill that would  allow  the  estimated  100,000 Florida  school children with  life-threatening  allergies  the  same  access  to  this  EpiPen.  Kelsey has testified before four Tallahassee committees since February,  meeting  lawmakers and passing out  practice injectors urging them to pass  the bill. We might call Kelsey a true  respiration  inspiration. She shares a  quote,  ‘‘My mom  told me  in  some  schools, there are children like myself  who need the EpiPen with them, but it  is locked far away in the clinic.’’ She  told the committee that  if someone  needed their EpiPen, it might not get  to them in time.  Kelsey’s charisma and dedication led  legislators  in Tallahassee to rename  H.B. 279 the Kelsey Ryan Act. More  than 60 State legislators cosponsored  the bill which the House passed earlier  this month 114 to 0. The Senate passed  it last week, and it is on the desk of  Governor Jeb Bush.  Brenda Olson, director of governmental affairs for the American Lung  Association of Florida points out that  ‘‘most schools in Florida do not allow  students to carry the EpiPen.’’ As we  have been saying for years, ‘‘Moments  count when these reactions start.’’  Kelsey’s mother, Blair Ryan, emphasized another point we made in our bill,  H.R. 2023, that this is a team effort between the student, the parents, the  physician, and the school. If a parent  and physician believe that a student is  mature and competent to treat him or  herself, a school should not impede this  medical regimen, but help it work for  the student.  Currently,  school  districts  across  Florida have different policies on this  matter, and some may well not serve a  student who  just  accidentally  got  stung by a bee or ate a cookie with an  unknown walnut. Officials in Volusia  and Orange counties said the majority  of EpiPen are kept locked in school  clinics. This is disastrous for the student’s health and potentially a lawsuit  on the school.  In conclusion, I am pleased with the  strong progress on this issue here in  our Nation’s Capitol and in the State  houses. I invite everyone to join us in  the Cannon Caucus Room tomorrow at  11:30 a.m. for a congressional briefing  followed by free asthma screenings and  asthma  health  clinics  and  exhibits  from 1 to 3:30 p.m. This year, Asthma  Awareness Day  is truly a breath of  fresh air.  Mr. Speaker,  tomorrow,  is Asthma Awareness Day and I rise to celebrate the October  2003-enacted Asthmatic Students Treatment  and Health Management Act (ASTHMA). What  is now P.l. 108–377, and was H.R. 2023 in the  House and S. 2815 in the Senate, I had introduced on 2003’s Asthma Awareness Day with  my  friend Representative PATRICK from Rhode  Island.

If  they were commenting on the Bill of  Rights, the  fourth amendment  is an  amendment designed to quash evidence  coming from an unlawful search and  seizure that could allow the conviction  of sexual predators. The fifth amendment gives sexual predators the right  to  protect  themselves  from  self-incrimination. The sixth amendment allows wily and cunning lawyers to use  cross examination and technical rules  to keep sexual predators from getting  convicted.  This is how the majority chooses to  interpret, in this particular case, the  substance and the intent of a series of  amendments made to the bill we voted  on last week.  I have great respect for the chairman  of the committee. He is a fair and honest man, and he has worked hard to defend the jurisdiction of the committee.  And what has been done here with this  majority report in that context is a  tremendous disappointment to me. It  essentially left us with no recourse but  to bring a motion like this to the floor  of the House.  To create the absurd situation and  then characterize the result of a particular amendment by that absurd situation does not do any justice or any  service to this process, to this institution, or to our committee.  We depend, we in the minority depend on a process that relies on honesty and good faith and the duties and  those  duties,  I  truly  believe, were  breached in the case of this report.  The minority has regarded to file its  dissenting views without the benefit of  having to have seen the report which  they are dissenting. That is inherently  an illogical system, but we have gone  along with it, but when something like  this happens,  it raises serious questions about the legitimacy of that particular process.  I think a great wrong has been done  to several Members of this body by virtue of the way the majority has characterized  this  amendment.  I  think  those characterizations should be withdrawn. I think an apology should be  made to them, and I urge the passage  of this motion.  ",2005

The stated purpose of the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act is to  protect the health and safety of young  girls by allowing parental involvement  when their home States have thought  it appropriate to require such involvement.  As a general rule, no one has a young  girl’s best interest at heart more than  her parents. Where this rule is not the  case, the law allows for judicial bypass  of the parental  involvement requirements. Therefore, the amendments introduced by the Democrats in the Committee on the Judiciary are unnecessary. Moreover, these amendments are  dangerous.

We are dramatically benefited by the  people who help us do these jobs, and  no one has been more involved in more  places over those 15 years than Kathryn has, working, as has already been  said,  in the Speaker’s office,  in the  Conference office, in the whip’s office.  During the 4 years that I was the chief  deputy whip, it was never quite clear  to me whether Kathryn was working  for me or I was working for her, but I  always knew that we were all working  to get our job done.

We recently lost a great former Member of the Congress, our good friend  Tiller Fowler,  and Tillie would  be  pleased, I think, that Kathryn is filling  some of the gap that is left there by  Tillie’s passing.  I am sure that our conference chairman will miss Kathryn. I know that  our conference will miss Kathryn on a  daily basis. I really do deeply and truly  know that we will miss Kathryn’s wise  counsel, her good judgment and, maybe  most  of  all,  her  reliable  sense  of  humor. When things are the toughest  and the challenges are the greatest,  Kathryn always had an understanding  of how fortunate we all really were to  be  involved  in that challenging moment, to be making those decisions on  the House Floor, to be part of this  great process in the greatest country  in the world.  Kathryn, we will miss you.  f  IRAQ IS ANOTHER VIETNAM  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, as we acknowledge the 30th  anniversary of the conflict in Vietnam,  it is important to be reminded of the  crisis in Iraq: 12,000 wounded soldiers,  1,500 dead, 143 Iraqis and others killed  over this past weekend; no stated policy from this administration, and the  continuous flow of injured and fallen  soldiers coming home to loved ones.  Iraq  is another Vietnam.  Iraq deserves the attention of this Congress  and of this administration. It is time  now to address the fact that there were  no  weapons  of mass  destruction.  Whether or not we are liberators, no  one seems to care. This government is  in conflict. The Shiite government is  refusing to seek Sunnis. The insurgents  will continue, the bloodshed will continue, the hostages will continue.  We must, we must have a solution to  this terrible tragedy in Iraq. We are  not creating freedom; we are creating  terrorists.  REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR  AMERICA  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2005
166,House,109,0.616,37,2005-05-03,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr.  Speaker,  America is on a really great economic  track right now. Since 2000, Congress  and this great Nation both have had to  contend with a  recession, with  terrorism, but we have dealt with this by  enacting tax relief and working to decrease regulatory burdens on America’s  workers. What we are seeing is real  growth.  Now, the first quarter of this year we  have seen a 3.1 percent growth in the  GDP. It is good and solid. To put it all  in perspective, going back to October  and December of 2004, the fourth quarter of last year, look at what we had  going on here. Germany, 1.5 percent  growth, Italy and Japan both at eight-  tenths of one percent growth. During  that  time, America had  3.9 percent  GDP growth. Do we know why? It is because we have fought to lower taxes  and reduce burdensome regulation both  together, while  other  nations  have  kept raising their taxes and imposing  more regulation.  What does this show? It tells us that  if we want more of something, we tax  it less, we regulate it less.  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO KATHRYN  LEHMAN  (Mr. GOODLATTE asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)

167,House,109,0.518,37,2005-05-03,Mr. CANTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I, too,  rise this evening to bid farewell to an  individual that I have come to know  over the last 4 years since I first started serving in this House. She is not  only a friend, she is a neighbor. She is  an individual that I look to as a colleague and counsel.  As has been mentioned before, Kathryn Lehman has been a critical asset to  this institution over the length of her  career here. She has worked for the  majority leader when he was majority  whip. That is where I came to know  her, and it is then that I began to see  the incredible addition she was to the  leadership team of this House.  She has provided tremendous insight  into not only the history of this institution, but also to the intricacies of  the legislative process, and her ability  to really grasp how to get things done  in  this  town, and certainly  in  this  building.  So  it  is with much  sentiment,  I  think, that I say goodbye. I know it  will not be a permanent goodbye. Kathryn is one who is a true believer, and I  could tell that when I first met her,  that she has the common sense and  conservative  values  that  are  really  what make this country great.  I guess we could claim her as an  adopted Virginian. She lives in the legacy of those great public servants of  the 18th century that founded this Nation and that left us such a legacy to  contribute to our democracy, to stand  up for the principles that we believe in.  So Kathryn, I want to thank you for  all of your wise counsel. I will continue  to seek that counsel. We will miss you  here in the House, but we wish you all  the best, and Godspeed.  f  KATHRYN LEHMAN: A BEHIND-  THE-SCENES PROFESSIONAL  (Mr. KINGSTON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

169,House,109,-0.37,44,2005-05-03,Mr. WU.," Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise  to express my deepest concern about a  proposed Indian gambling casino in the  Columbia River Gorge National Scenic  Area in Oregon.  On April 6, 2005, Oregon Governor,  Ted Kulongoski and the Confederated  Tribes of the Warm Springs signed a  Tribal-State  compact. The  compact  would allow a off-reservation  Indian  gambling casino in the Columbia River  Gorge National Scenic Area. The Columbia River Gorge is the crown jewel  of Oregon’s many natural wonders, a  spectacular and unique sea-level cut  through the Cascade Mountain Range.  It is 80 miles long and up to 4,000 feet  deep. The Columbia River  flows between the Gorge’s north walls in Washington State and its south walls in Oregon. It is a natural wonder and a National Scenic Area.  The proposed 500,000 square foot gambling casino would dramatically alter  the Columbia River Gorge and have a  significant negative effect on the environment by increasing traffic, congestion, and air pollution. Specifically,  the proposed casino would draw an estimated 3 million visitors per year for  non-Gorge related reasons, resulting in  perhaps a million additional vehicle  trips per year. This increased traffic  would exacerbate existing air pollution  problems in the Columbia River Gorge.  State and Federal agencies have already determined that air quality in  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:02 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H03MY5.REC H03MY5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005
170,House,109,-0.529,51,2005-05-03,Mr. HONDA.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for his comments.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to touch on  a couple more subjects, if I may.  As Americans, we need to ensure that  our children  receive a quality education by providing adequate teacher  training, funds for after-school and extracurricular activities, and ensuring  that college is affordable for every student that desires to receive a higher  education.  According to the U.S. census, 50 percent of Asians age 25 or over have a  bachelor’s degree or higher  level of  education. However, I would  like to  emphasize that when we disaggregate  the data for AAPI subgroups, we find  that the ‘‘model minority’’ stereotype  is, in fact, a myth.  Only 9.1 percent of Cambodian Americans, 7.4 percent Hmong Americans,  7.6 percent Lao Americans, and 19.5  percent Vietnamese Americans and 16  percent of native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders who are 25 years and  older have a bachelor’s degree.  These numbers show that we must do  a better job of disaggregating data and  information about our communities to  assess the needs of those hard-working  Americans who still falter behind.  To address the disparities between  subgroups of the larger AAPI community, we need Congress to pass the  Asian American and Pacific Islander  Serving  Institutions bill, which  the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WU) will  be introducing later this month. This  legislation will provide Federal grants  to colleges and universities that have  an enrollment of undergraduate students that is at least 10 percent AAPI  and at least 50 percent of its degree-  seeking students receive financial assistance.  As a caucus, we will work to increase  the  availability  of  loan  assistance,  scholarships, and programs to allow  AAPI students to attend a higher education institution; to ensure full funding  for  teachers and bilingual education programs under the No Child  Left Behind Act; to support English  language learners; and to support full  funding of minority outreach programs  for access to higher education such as  the TRIO programs to expand services  to serve AAPI students.  In health, Mr. Speaker, a common  misperception of AAPIs is that as a  group we face fewer health problems  than other racial and ethnic groups. In  fact, AAPIs as a group and specific populations within this group do experience disparities in health and health  care. For example, AAPIs have  the  highest hepatitis B rates of any racial  group in the U.S.  Last week, I, along with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURPHY), introduced a resolution to support the goals and ideals of National  Hepatitis B Awareness Week.  AAPIs are also five times more likely  to develop cervical and  liver cancer  than any other ethnic and racial group.  According to the Census Bureau, 18  percent of AAPIs went without insurance for the entire year in 2000. This  means that the uninsured are not only  more likely to go without care for serious medical conditions; they are also  more likely to go without routine care,  less likely to have a regular source of  care,  less  likely to use preventative  services, and have fewer visits per year.  At the same time, without appropriate language translation services or  properly translated materials, limited  English-proficient  immigrants cannot  receive adequate care, as well as State  and Federal benefits  for which they  may be eligible. In the AAPI community, 76 percent of Hmong Americans,  61 percent of Vietnamese Americans, 52  percent of Korean Americans, and 39  percent  of  Tongans  speak  limited  English. Therefore, eliminating health  care disparities in the AAPI community must include data collection, linguistically appropriate and culturally  competent  services,  and  access  to  health insurance.  CAPAC has been working with both  the Congressional Hispanic and Black  Caucuses on the Healthcare Equality  and Accountability Act to eliminate  ethnic and racial health disparities for  all of our community. I will be introducing  the Healthcare Equality and  Accountability Act, which will address  expanding the health care safety net,  diversifying the health care workforce,  combating diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities, emphasizing prevention and behavioral health; and promoting the collection and dissemination of data and  enhance medical research, provide interpreters and translation services in  the delivery of health care.  Mr. Speaker, in California a Hmong  man was going to the hospital to have  his right  leg amputated  in surgery.  And the doctor, in order to confirm  whether he had the right leg pointed  out, spoke to the gentleman before surgery and asked him if this is the correct leg, and the gentleman did not understand. He  just nodded. When he  came to from anesthesia after the surgery, he found that his good leg was  amputated. And because of  lack of  translations and lack of linguistic services, this man became more disabled  than he should have been.  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. INSLEE),  a great friend and advocate.  ",2005
171,House,109,0.493,65,2005-05-03,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," Mr.  Speaker, several weeks ago I read a  treatise written by Matt Savinar, and I  was galvanized by his introduction. Let  me read it.  ‘‘Dear reader,’’ he begins, ‘‘civilization as we know it is coming to an end  soon. This is not the whacky proclamation of a doomsday cult, apocalypse  Bible prophesy sect, or conspiracy theory society. Rather, it is the scientific  conclusion of the best-paid, most widely respected geologists, physicists, and  investment bankers in the world. These  are rational, professional, conservative  individuals who are absolutely terrified  by a phenomenon known as global peak  oil.’’  Mr. Speaker,  in the weeks since I  read this, I have checked with a large  number of experts in this area across  the country and  indeed around  the  world. He could be right. He will be  right unless we appropriately address  this  big  challenge which  faces  the  world and particularly faces the United  States, and that is what we will be  talking about in our Special Order this  evening.  I have been joined by the gentleman  from the eastern shore of Maryland  (Mr. GILCHREST), one of my colleagues  who shares a concern in this area of energy, and I yield to the gentleman.  ",2005
172,House,109,0.204,65,2005-05-03,Mr. GILCHREST.," Mr. Speaker, I am  only going to speak for just a couple of  minutes because the gentleman from  Maryland  (Mr. BARTLETT) has a  fascinating story to tell, one that richly  deserves everybody’s attention.  But, just briefly, I want to thank the  gentleman for yielding to me.  The gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  BARTLETT) will talk about energy, peak  oil. As  the demand  increases  enormously, the supply of the fossil fuel  that we are using continues to decrease. We know that energy is power,  and energy is what drives the Nation’s  economy. And we have assumed for a  long time, for decades anyway, that energy supplies have a bottomless well.  And that is correct. The energy source  at the bottom of the well is bottomless.  It is endless. But what is at the bottom  of that well is not oil. It is not even  natural gas. It is not coal. What lies at  the bottom of the bottomless well is  our intellect, our logic, our knowledge,  our know-how.  We used to the light our homes with  whale oil. They did not stop lighting  homes because we ran out of whales,  thank goodness; but we transitioned to  a number of other things. We used to  use just wood all over the world, and  thank goodness we transitioned from  wood to coal because we were tearing  our forests down, and there are a lot  better uses for wood than to burn that  wood.  We  transitioned  for our  transportation needs and many other needs  from coal to oil, and oil is a lot cleaner  and it is a lot more efficient. Then we  went from oil and we found that natural gas is cleaner yet and more efficient than oil. We also began to realize  that  coal has more hydrogen  than  wood. Oil has more hydrogen in its content than coal. Natural gas has more  hydrogen  than  oil.  The  transition  through our energy sources has not  come about because we ran out of those  energy sources. It has come about because we got a little smarter. Our intellect, our quest for knowledge, our  curiosity about something that is better overtook the status quo.  And when the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BARTLETT) talks about peak  oil, not only do we need to move away  from the status quo when we hear his  words about fossil fuel; it is essential.  There is a sense of urgency to move  away. In all our measurements of oil or  natural gas, whenever one looks at a  heater  in their home, whether  it  is  their oil furnace, a Carison heater or  whatever it is, it is measured in Btus.  I want to show a number. This is a 1  with 15 zeros. That is 1 quadrillion. In  1910 we used 7 quadrillion Btus in the  United States. In 1954 we used 35 quadrillion Btus, energy demand increase.  Right now we use 100 quadrillion Btus,  and that is not slowing down.  What we need in this country is logic  and intellect to move us away from an  energy source that has now lost its usefulness for a number of reasons. It is  putting carbon dioxide into our atmosphere faster than we have seen that infusion of carbon dioxide  in the  last  400,000 years, and our supply is diminishing quickly as our demand  is  increasing even faster.  There  are  a  number  of  energy  sources. The gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. BARTLETT) will talk about some of  them. We will have these on a number  of occasions. We are  looking at nuclear. We are looking at solar. We are  looking at wind. We are looking at hydrogen. We are looking at a number of  alternatives. But before we have the  technology to move into those alternatives  for  energy  security, which  means energy independence, the transition has got to be vastly improved efficiency for oil, for natural gas, to move  into biofuels, and I am not talking  about ethanol, which is corn which will  feed the world. I am not talking about  biodiesel, which is soy beans, which is  used to feed the world. What I am talking about are other sources like certain  grass or poplar trees, which farmers  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:02 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H03MY5.REC H03MY5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2005

My dear friend, Dr. Kenneth B.  Clark died on May 1, 2005 and he will be  missed by all who knew him. I extend my condolences to his family and I know I am joined  by  thousands of New Yorkers, as well as  those  throughout  the Nation, who benefited  from his work to end the injustice of legally imposed racial segregation and to create a society where all could have an equal opportunity  to succeed.  Kenneth B. Clark was a brilliant scholar and  teacher who influenced a generation of social  scientists by his work and his example as a  teacher at the City College of New York. He  was also, and at heart perhaps he was even  moreso, an activist who sought to bring about  the social change required to attain equality of  opportunity for African-Americans in our society. He inspired the vision of Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr. and  those who  led  the great Civil  Rights Movement  toward a society  in which  people would be judged, as Dr. King put it ‘‘by  the content of their character and not the color  of their skin.’’  Dr. Clark was committed to the achievement  of an integrated society in America that would  remove  the barriers  to  full participation by  blacks, but would also make whites more  aware of the benefits to be derived from participation by all based upon talent.  Dr. Clark had an impressive career of working for civil rights and education. His research  in  the 1950s established  the  inherent problems of segregated system and alerted  the  Supreme Court and the Nation to the negative  effects of  segregation on African-American  youth. As a member of the New York State  Board of Regents for twenty years, he continually advised elected officials on ways  to  transform and improve their school systems.  He was a passionate advocate  for children  and did not spare those who failed them.  Dr. Clark was an exemplary American who  worked  to  improve  the  life of all persons  in  America. I knew him as an exceptional individual and a trusted friend. The attached obituary from the New York Times (May 2, 2005)  highlights the life story and accomplishments  of Dr. Clark.

His forty year involvement  with  the heart and soul of Fleet Avenue,  Ceska Sin Karlin Hall, served to uplift every  aspect of  this significant cultural organization—an organization that bridges modern life  and antiquity, and connects  the people of  America to their traditions and customs of their  Eastern European origins.  Mr. Priebe maintained an unwavering focus  on family, community and country. During the  Korean War, he served with honor and courage as an  infantryman  in  the United States  Army. Following his discharge, he remained  an active member of the VFW From the military to his professional career, Mr. Priebe reflected an unwavering  level of  integrity and  diligence. He worked as an auditor with the  state’s auditor’s office, until he retired 10 years  ago. Throughout his retirement, he remained  an active and vital part of our community. At  Karlin Hall, Mr. Priebe took on any task that  needed  tackling,  including  bartender,  floor  sweeper, and President.

MARK UDALL  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2005  ",2005
175,,109,-0.353,149,2005-05-03,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to Rodolfo  ‘‘Corky’’  Gonzales, one of Colorado’s most  influential  civil rights leaders who passed away on April  12, 2005. While I did not have the pleasure of  getting to know this remarkable man in person, it is impossible not to know of his extraordinary political career in Denver, Colorado.  Raised during the Great Depression, Corky  Gonzales rose from poverty to become one of  the  founding  leaders of  the Chicano Civil  Rights Movement in the 1960s and in doing so  he gave voice to the aspirations of millions of  people, particularly in the Latino communities  of the southwestern United States.  Corky Gonzales first rose to prominence as  champion boxer during  the  late 1940’s and  early 1950’s. His  fearlessness  in  the  ring  served him well when he decided to use his  voice and not his fists to champion the cause  of equality.  Growing up poor  in Denver shaped his  sense of  justice—and  instilled a very deep  commitment to improve the lives of so many  in the so-called ‘‘Mexican-American’’ community of the times, and he was one of the first  of his generation to call public attention to the  civil rights struggle of Latino people after decades of indifference, benign neglect and outright discrimination.  Gonzales also was an accomplished poet  and lover of art and literature often extolling  the virtues of education and urging his  followers to use their minds as a means of fighting  injustice. Anita, his oldest daughter, has  said  that  the  standard bill of  fare  in  the  Gonzales household was not the latest fad or  fashion, but discussions on art, literature, politics and philosophy. In this regard, Corky was  a  true  ‘‘Renaissance man’’—although  I suspect he would flinch at that description.  In 1965 he founded the ‘‘Crusade for Justice’’ which became a Mecca for likeminded individuals committed  to  the cause of  justice  and equality for those on the margins of society. While the nation’s television news covered  the marches  in Selma and  the civil  rights  struggle of African-Americans  throughout  the  South, young Corky was  raising a similar  voice for equality in the West.  In 1967 he wrote a celebrated epic poem ‘‘I  am Joaquin’’ which many describe as  the  greatest poem  to come out of  the Chicano  Civil Rights Movement. The poem, an odyssey  of self discovery and affirmation of ethnic pride  quickly became a blueprint  for social action  and a clarion call to an entire generation of  Americans young and old alike.  He was not without his detractors, but anyone who attempts to achieve anything of lasting importance seldom is, and for people of  my generation, he was a much needed voice  for change. To his followers and to those who  loved and respected him he was ‘‘the hurricane that rose from the barrios of Denver to  lift his people into the 21st century.’’  This fearless warrior left an indelible imprint  on our society and future generations of leaders. But for his early journey, paving the way  for others, Colorado might never have witnessed Federico Pena as Mayor of Denver or  Ken Salazar as a United States Senator.  Corky launched the idea of Chicano Pride long  before it became fashionable to celebrate Hispanic identity.  Had he been born a few decades later perhaps, the young boxer might have exchanged  his gloves  for a seat  in  this House, but his  contributions to our country and to the communities of color that are so deeply a part of  the mosaic of the Southwestern United States  remain a testament to his memory.  In the Chicano and Mexican-American communities in my part of the country there is a  deep sense of pride in being called to service.  Corky Gonzales was like all great heroes, a  human being who contributed to the great tradition of being involved in something greater  than his own self-interest. In that great tradition it is my pleasure to declare . ‘‘Corky’’ Gonzales, Presente!  . . Rodolfo  f  IN SUPPORT OF A BILL FOR THE  FURTHER STUDY OF DYSTONIA  HON. DANNY K.

178,Senate,109,0.552,8,2005-05-13,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, during  World War I and II, Native Americans  heard the call of their Country and enlisted  in  the United States Armed  Services  in unprecedented numbers.  Many of these brave men performed the  role of code talkers, using a code language derived from a variety of American Indian languages to ensure secure  and rapid communication of information on the battlefield. Through three  wars and  five decades, enemy  forces  were never able to break the United  States code  language thanks to the  service and ingenuity of Native American Code Talkers. These patriots provided  an  invaluable  service  to  the  United States and our allies and deserve recognition for their bravery.  Until 1968, information related to the  code  talker’s activities during both  World Wars remained classified by the  Department of Defense. The postponement in learning about the essential  role of Native American Code Talkers  has resulted in delayed recognition of  these war heroes. The first step in recognizing these men came in 2000 when  President Bush signed into law legislation authorizing Congress  to award  gold medals to the twenty-nine Navajo  Code Talkers as well as a silver medal  to each man who later qualified as a  Navajo Code Talker. While this legislation was a step in the right direction,  it failed to recognize a number of Native Americans who also served as code  talkers but were not members of the  Navajo Nation.  During the first World War, Choctaw  code talkers served with distinction in  France. By transmitting in their native tongue a variety of open voice  messages relating to unit movements,  United States  forces completely surprised the enemy during battle. Following the success of the Choctaw code  talkers,  soldiers  from  the Navajo,  Sioux, Comanche and Meskwaki tribes,  along with members of 14 other tribes,  served as code talkers in some of the  most dangerous operations in both theaters of World War II.  Today I introduce the Code Talkers  Recognition Act to honor those who  were  overlooked when medals were  awarded to the Navajo Code Talkers in  2001. This bill authorizes the presentation of commemorative medals on  behalf of Congress to Native Americans  who served as Code Talkers during any  foreign conflict  in which the United  States was  involved during the 20th  Century. I ask my colleagues to help  honor the heroic contributions of these  gentlemen by cosponsoring this bill.  f  AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO  MEET  COMMITTEEONARMEDSERVICES  ",2005
179,,109,-0.334,22,2005-05-13,Mr. ISRAEL.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to honor  the leadership and service of Rabbi Leonard  Troupp, who is retiring after 18 years as the  spiritual  leader  of Temple Beth David  in  Commack, New York.  All of us in Congress rely on many religious  leaders in our communities for guidance and  inspiration. But Rabbi Troupp transcends that  role. For me, he has been and will continue to  be a dear friend. I have turned to him as a  Member of Congress, and  I have  turned  to  him as a member of his congregation. I have  solicited his advice on the profound public policy challenges that confront our government,  and I have listened to his words on the personal decisions and choices we make every  day in our private lives.  Rabbi Leonard B. Troupp was ordained by  the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of  Religion in 1973. He is a Past President of the  Long  Island Association of Reform Rabbis,  and has also served on the Board of the New  York Association of Reform Rabbis.  Rabbi Troupp’s many passions have forever  enriched the lives of his congregants and others. As a result of his motivation, Temple Beth  David collects over 15,000 pounds of food for  the hungry each year. Through his impossible  dream, 1997 saw the reunion of a Holocaust  Torah with a survivor, Petr Herrmann, whose  father read from that very same Torah scroll.  Rabbi Troupp has been an outspoken and  passionate advocate for human rights and civil  rights; for a strong Israel; for a fair and just  America. He mobilized his congregation in a  letter writing campaign to decry the rising Anti-  Semitism in Europe. Through his hard work,  he and his wife, Michelle, eventually hand-delivered thousands of letters to a Presidential  Representative in the West Wing.  His sermons, candid and sometimes controversial, have been spoken  from his heart  and have  touched  the hearts of  those who  have heard his words.  Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Troupp dedicated his  career to making our community stronger, better and fairer for people of all faiths and backgrounds. He is not simply my Rabbi; he is a  teacher  to a  joyously diverse community  in  New York’s Second Congressional District. His  teachings, his strength and his commitment  will continue to guide my constituents and me.  In that sense, he has made an indelible imprint on the fabric of Long Island, New York,  and our nation.  HONORING VFW 5119  HON.

180,,109,0.244,22,2005-05-13,Mr. FERGUSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5119 in Glen Gardner, New  Jersey. Members of VFW Post 5119, which includes Hunterdon and Warren counties, are  traveling to Washington this week to view the  memorials along the National Mall, throughout  the capital and  in Virginia  that represent so  much of our nation’s history.  These memorials are at once simple and  compelling, powerful enough that in an instant  an old man  is  transported back decades  to  when he was young and walked on the field  of battle. The memorials are our own living reminder that generations of Americans fought,  struggled and died to defend our Nation and  its enduring principles of freedom and liberty.  The Vietnam Veterans Memorial along the  National Mall is the most visited of all landmarks in Washington. The Marine Corps Memorial, also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial,  honors Marines who have given their lives in  defense of our country since 1775. Along  Pennsylvania Avenue, between  this Capitol  and the White House, the Navy Memorial at  the plaza honors  the men and women who  served in the Navy. The Korean War Memorial  opened only 10 years ago, and the National  World War II Memorial opened only last year.  Across the Potomac River in Virginia, Arlington National Cemetery houses the most of sacred of our Nation’s memorials—the Tomb of  the Unknown Soldiers.  There are a lot of memorials for the members of VFW Post 5119 to see, and for the  rest of us, there’s a lot for which we are grateful. The members of VFW Post 5119 honor  each of us with their presence in our Nation’s  capital.  f  CELEBRATING ASIAN PACIFIC  AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH  HON.

181,,109,-0.267,29,2005-05-13,Mr. MOORE of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker, we  join today to pay tribute to William T. Reed,  the President and CEO of KCPT, Kansas  City’s public broadcasting station, who has announced his  retirement effective  June 30,  2005. He steps down after 13 years as head  of Kansas City Public Television.  Bill Reed joined KCPT in 1992 and emphasized education, local programming and outreach. The station received numerous awards  from PBS,  the National Educational Telecommunication Association, NETA, and community organizations for its local programming  and  services,  including 21  regional Emmy  awards and one national Emmy for the documentary, ‘‘Be Good Smile Pretty’’. Four of the  station’s signature program series, ‘‘Ruckus’’,  ‘‘Rare Visions’’,  ‘‘Roadside Revelations’’ and  ‘‘Kansas City Week in Review’’, began under  Reed’s leadership. He also introduced viewers  to the beautiful writings of Kansas City Star  columnist Charles Gusewelle, who this spring  will produce his fourth documentary for KCPT,  called ‘‘Stories Under the Stone’’. Reed’s collaboration  with  Gusewelle  also  launched  KCPT’s home video library venture. Later this  year, children and their parents also will benefit  from  the development of an  interactive  reading program called ‘‘Bark Park Place’’.  Bill Reed made partnerships and collaborations an important part of the station’s business plan. In 2003, KCPT was named Best  Place to Work for Community Partnerships by  the Kansas City Business Journal. Many of  those partnerships, like Chalkwaves, a digital  instructional media service for elementary and  secondary schools now used across the country, changed  the education  landscape. Additionally,  the Kansas City Regional Access  Consortium  for  Higher  Education,  KC  REACHE,  a  distance  education  effort  partnering KCPT with nine area colleges and  universities, began under Reed’s stewardship  long before distance  learning was commonplace. Other successful partnerships  include  Network KC, an  in-depth news partnership  with the Kansas City Star, KCUR–FM, KPRS–  FM and UMKC’s Back Channel, a student production for the web; and Speaking of Women’s Health, a partnership with Shawnee Mission Medical Center to conduct a yearly health  symposium for 1,700 women. The TV Dinner  and the KCPT Holiday Auction were also created, and a partnership developed with  the  Gamma Phi Beta Sorority  for  the Antiques,  Garden and Home Design Show to raise additional funds for the station.  From 1997 to 2001, KCPT successfully conducted a capital campaign that raised $10 million to renovate its facilities on 31st Street and  to purchase digital television equipment. The  station was among the first stations to go on  the air with digital television and was cited by  PBS as one of seven Digital Pioneers in public  television.  Reed began his public broadcasting career  in 1967 as General Manager of KIXE, the public television station in Redding, California. He  joined the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)  in Washington, D.C., in 1974, where he was  promoted  to Senior Vice President  in 1978  and worked until 1991. While at PBS, Reed  led the planning and implementation of PBS  Home Video and  the PBS Adult Learning  Service and the development of PBS VIDEO  (a service  for educational  institutions). After  leaving PBS, he also served as a consultant  to  the Corporation  for Public Broadcasting  (CPB). Reed served on the boards of a number of  local and national organizations:  the  Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Board of  Directors from 1972 to 1974; the Association  of  America’s  Public  Television  Stations’  (APTS) Board of Trustees from 1995 to 2001;  and American Public Television (APT) Board  of Directors from 1997 to 2003. He was elected as the National Educational Telecommunications Association’s (NETA) first chairman in  1997. Reed served as President of the Jackson County Historical Society  from 1996–  1998, President of the Public Television Association of Missouri  (PTAM)  from 1994–1998  and 2002  to present, and Chairman of  the  Kansas Public Broadcasting Council (KPBC)  from 1997–1998. Reed also served on  the  Corporation  for Public Broadcasting’s  (CPB)  Digital Television Task Force from 1998 to the  present, and was a member of the Video Advisory Committee to the Missouri Department of  Elementary and Secondary Education  from  1993 to 2000.  In  1991,  the Pacific Mountain Network  Board  honored Reed with  its Governor’s  Award for Distinguished Service to Public Television. He also served as a private sector  representative  in  telecommunications  for  the  U.S. Department of State to the Conference  on Security and Cooperation in Europe (1989–  London); as Chairman of the Broadcast Panel  for U.S.–U.S.S.R. Bilateral  Information Talks  (1988–Moscow);  and  as President  of  the  Western Educational Network (1972).  Bill Reed was born  in Los Angeles, California. He received his B.A. in History and, following a year of graduate studies, his General  Secondary Teaching Credential from the University of  the Pacific  in Stockton, California.  From 1963  to 1965, he served  in  the U.S.  Army,  including one year  in Vietnam, where  he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the  Air Medal with Three Oak Leaf Clusters and  the Army Commendation Medal for Valor.  Mr. Speaker, Bill Reed and his wife, Mary  Ann, will continue to live in Kansas City after  his retirement. A nationwide search is underway for his replacement and his shoes will be  very difficult to fill. We commend Bill Reed for  his many accomplishments on behalf of  the  Kansas City community during his  tenure at  KCPT and wish him and Mary Ann all the best  in the years to come.

182,House,109,0.402,3,2005-05-26,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to mourn the  loss of a great  American, Todd Venette, whose  life  was cut short by a terrorist attack in  Iraq.  Todd, a former Marine, was helping  Iraq’s young democracy as a government contractor when he was killed by  a terrorist car bomb in Baghdad. As his  friends and family would tell you, Todd  was a selfless person who volunteered  to reenlist shortly after the war in Iraq  started. When he completed his tour,  his dedication to the mission led him  to return to Iraq as a government contractor.  A giving person, a mentor, and a  servant are among the words that have  been used to describe Todd. As a firefighter in Russellville, Arkansas. Todd  helped  protect  the  community. His  service to the people of Russellville did  not end there. Todd was instrumental  in establishing a wrestling program for  kids at the local Boys and Girls Club,  putting his talents to work as a mentor  to shape the lives of young people of  Russellville in a positive way.  Mr. Speaker, Todd  touched many  people in his short life. I ask my colleagues  to keep Todd’s  family and  friends in their thoughts and prayers  during these very difficult times.  f  RECOGNIZING JIM LONGWORTH  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2005
183,House,109,0.641,3,2005-05-26,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to recognize and congratulate Triad  Today for being awarded the Spectrum  of Democracy Award for Responsible  Election Coverage by the North Carolina Center For Voter Education. The  program is aired in the Fifth Congressional District on Sinclair Broadcasting’s WXLV/WUPN  station  covering  the  Winston-Salem/Greensboro/High  Point metropolitan area.  Triad Today was created October 2003  by veteran television broadcaster, author, and columnist Jim Longworth. It  is the Piedmont Triad’s only local television talk show. Its guests have included  Senators  and  Congressmen,  mayors  and  sports  celebrities  like  Richard Petty. But most of the time it  serves  the  community  by  disseminating  information about the  issues  that matter the most to the community, like health care, public safety,  and government.  But  it was another kind of public  service for which Triad Today was recently recognized. During the 2004 election cycle, Jim Longworth distributed  free blocks of air time on his show to  scores  of  congressional  and  gubernatorial candidates. His action helped  raise citizen awareness of candidates  and issues and encouraged more people  to participate in the political process.  For  this, Mr. Longworth and Triad  Today were awarded the Spectrum of  Democracy Award.  Mr. Speaker, the press has a responsibility to fulfill its role as the fourth  estate, that is, to serve as a guardian  of democracy and defender of the public interest. I am pleased to congratulate Triad Today for its outstanding  commitment to keeping the community informed.  f  REPUBLICANS RETURN CONTROL  TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2005
184,House,109,0.547,3,2005-05-26,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, Ronald Reagan once said that  the government’s view of the economy  could be summed up in a few short  phrases: if it moves, tax it. If it keeps  moving, regulate  it; and  if  it stops  moving, subsidize it.  I believe the American people, not  the government, have a better view of  our economy. By working to remove  the economic barriers of taxation, litigation and regulation, House Republicans are  returning  control of  the  economy to the American people. The  109th Congress has passed legislation  this year which will permanently repeal the death tax, decrease the deficit,  strengthen American borders, prevent  frivolous lawsuits, improve our highways, and provide our country with a  comprehensive energy policy.  In my home State of South Carolina,  the unemployment rate continues to  decrease and over 1,300 new jobs have  been created since March. This great  news is positive proof that the Republican leaders are creating more jobs,  growing the economy, and returning  control to the American people.  In conclusion, God bless our troops  and we will never forget September 11.

185,House,109,0.343,3,2005-05-26,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, shortly after the conclusion  of the Civil War, a group of veterans  began a tradition known as Decoration  Day. The day was set aside to decorate  the graves of the men who had perished  during battle, and it was believed Decoration Day was  always  during  the  month of May because flowers needed  for the occasion were finally blooming.  Two centuries later, Decoration Day is  now Memorial Day, but two core traditions remain: we honor those who died  protecting our Nation, and we still do  so in May when the flowers are blooming.  Today, as our Nation spends it third  consecutive Memorial Day at war, we  remember the men and women who  made the ultimate sacrifice defending  the precious gift of liberty. We honor  the people who have left behind husband, wives, children and parents, as  well as the riches and celebrations of  life, to fight for the freedoms of all  Americans; and we should remain always remindful of that symbolic tradition of Decoration Day, that flowers  will bloom, a beautiful America will  bloom from the sacrifices made by our  fallen veterans.

188,House,109,0.484,17,2005-05-26,Mr. GIBBONS.," Madam Chairman, I  rise today in support of H.R. 2528, a bill  which will provide the essential funding that our Nation’s heroes, our veterans, need. I applaud the gentleman  from California  (Mr. LEWIS) and the  gentleman  from the 25th District of  New York (Mr. WALSH) for their vision  and leadership on this important issue,  and I also thank them for allowing me  the time to speak on a bill that is so  important to our country.  This bill increases overall veterans’  benefits to $21 billion which is nearly  $1.6 billion more than last year’s funding level for our veterans.  Madam Chairman, over the  last 2  years  alone,  this Congress has  increased funding for veterans’ medical  care by 18 percent. In addition, H.R.  2528 doubles veterans’ mental health  research funding and requires a comprehensive  study  on  post-traumatic  stress disorder. As a veteran of our  Armed Forces, I understand that this is  an issue that our future veterans, who  are currently fighting in the war on  terror, will most  certainly  struggle  with. I applaud the efforts that this bill  makes to ensure America’s veterans  will receive the mental health care  they need when they return home as  our heroes.  Madam Chairman, I also support this  bill because of the assistance it will  provide to the veterans in my home  State of Nevada. H.R. 2528 provides $199  million for a new veterans hospital in  Las Vegas. Las Vegas is the fastestgrowing metropolitan area in our Nation. Nevada’s veteran population  is  simply exploding. This new hospital  will ensure that those who have bravely served our country have access to all  their health care needs. This is great  news for Nevada’s veterans.  The committee’s report that accompanies H.R. 2528 also ensures that the  vital per diem payments that the VA  provides to our State veterans home in  Boulder City will not be cut. This report language also requests Secretary  Nicholson to engage in a dialogue with  our State-operated veterans homes to  come up with a solution to increasing  the costs of providing quality health  care to our veterans.  Madam Chairman,  I urge my colleagues to support this bill because it  provides our Nation’s veterans with the  benefits that they have earned by protecting our great Nation.  ",2005

190,House,109,-0.352,17,2005-05-26,Mr. ROTHMAN.,"  I  thank  the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, as a member of the  Committee on Appropriations, I rise in  support of the Military Quality of Life  and Veterans Affairs Appropriations  bill. I want to thank the gentleman  from New York (Mr. WALSH) and the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. EDWARDS)  for their very hard work in drafting  this well-balanced bill.  I also want to acknowledge the majority and minority staff for the diligence and dedication that they have  demonstrated throughout this process.  I can appreciate the tough choices that  both the gentleman  from New York  and the gentleman from Texas had to  make with this tight allocation. Admittedly, if there were a different majority in the House, there would have  been more money allocated to these  programs, but within the budget constraints imposed upon the gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS), the gentleman from New York (Mr. WALSH)  and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. EDWARDS), I believe they have done a fine  job, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support the bill.  ",2005
191,House,109,0.274,17,2005-05-26,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Chairman, as a member of the subcommittee, I want to  commend both our chairman and ranking minority member for producing a  bill which will dramatically improve  the life and the experience of men and  women joining the United States Navy  and going for basic training and other  schools in my district at Great Lakes  Naval Training Center.  This bill funds two new barracks for  the Great Lakes Naval Training Center  and an infrastructure upgrade. It continues a $1 billion capitalization program which has  transformed Great  Lakes into the birthplace of the United  States Navy.  But this bill does something even  more important. Throughout the country, we know that we have several hospital facilities funded by the Department of Defense close to VA facilities  also funded by the taxpayer in caring  for our veterans. What this bill does is  it accelerates plans to build a new joint  VA-Navy hospital in North Chicago, Illinois. This new facility, with two reports required by the administration to  accelerate  the progress, will be  the  first ever Navy-VA joint facility. We  are very proud that that will be located  in North Chicago, Illinois. This $100  million facility will ensure veterans’  health care  in northern Illinois and  provide cutting-edge, quality care for  the recruits who are joining the United  States Navy.  For these reasons and others, I really  commend the chairman and the staff  for what they have done to accelerate  this, better health care for veterans,  better health care for naval recruits  and at lower cost to the taxpayer. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to  the  gentleman  from  Oregon  (Mr.  BLUMENAUER). ",2005
192,House,109,-0.428,17,2005-05-26,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," I appreciate the  gentleman’s courtesy  in yielding me  this time.  Mr. Chairman, I, too, am pleased that  we have the creation of a Military  Quality of Life committee. It is hard to  imagine more capable leadership than  that that will be offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. WALSH)  and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. EDWARDS) and there is tremendous potential to look holistically at the problems and opportunities dealing with  military quality of life.  I am particularly pleased because it  will give for the first time a true focus  to look at what is a serious, hidden  issue of military quality of life, and  that is military cleanup. For too long,  this Congress has been missing in action. It has never given priority to the  vast stretches of the United States in  every State of the Union, an area the  size of the States of Maryland and Massachusetts combined, to deal with the  cleanup of past military activities.  It impacts our troops and their families on the bases, their neighbors past  and present, and it has significant financial impacts, although if we do this  job right, we have the opportunity to  dramatically reduce the cost. I am impressed over the last 7 years working  on this  issue that the military, the  men and women in the ranks, want to  do this job right. They have sensitivity  to the environment and they know that  they are in trouble if they are exposed  unnecessarily  to  pollution  and  unexploded ordnance.  Cleanup gives the military many advantages. There are  less hazards to  fighting men and women. There will be  more area to train. There are better relationships with the surrounding area.  Most important, it will develop tools  and techniques that will save American  lives. It will give the military longterm security with these new techniques and technologies.  Every day people die unnecessarily  from land mines and UXO around the  world. I am going to offer some amendments because, frankly, as much respect  as  I have  for  the new  subcommittee and the fact it is new, they  are looking at a whole new range of  areas.  We are looking at allocating over $1.5  billion to the 2005 base closure rounds,  and we have not yet cleaned up after  the very first round of military closures. That is unacceptable. It is time  for Congress to no longer be missing in  action. We need to step up, provide the  guidance, and clean up these areas.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter  into a colloquy with the chairman of  the Subcommittee on Military Quality  of Life and Veterans Affairs of the  Committee on Appropriations.  First of all, I want to take a moment  to commend the gentleman from New  York (Mr. WALSH) and the committee  for bringing  this  important pending  bill  to  the  floor and providing  resources to our military and those who  serve in our military. I thank him for  his  leadership  in  the United States  House of Representatives and for his  service to our Nation.  I had intended to offer an amendment  to add $1.3 million to the Army National Guard construction account in  order to complete the design of a joint  National Guard Reserve Center in Daytona  Beach,  Florida.  Last  year,  through the good work of this appropriations  subcommittee,  the  Subcommittee on Military Construction  appropriated $789,000 in fiscal year 2005  funding to begin the design, and that  funding is now being depleted.  Mr. Chairman,  this project  is  the  Florida National Guard’s number one  priority in the 2012 to 2013, 5-year plan  and will be included in the President’s  budget for the 2007 budget.  I am concerned that possibly cutting  the funding or not providing the funding for this project now may negatively  impact on the Florida National Guard’s  ability to move forward with this important project that is now some nearly 8 years behind schedule.  I would ask the gentleman from New  York whether he can commit to working with me during the conference on  this bill to ensure that funding or adequate attention and language is in the  final bill.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter  into a colloquy to discuss a funding  matter  concerning  the  Assembled  Chemical Weapons Alternatives program.  I rise today, Mr. Chairman, to bring  attention to a significant funding problem that, if it is not solved, could halt  the destruction of dangerous chemical  weapons stockpiles in Richmond, Kentucky and Pueblo, Colorado.  Within the last 2 months, there have  been significant changes in the status  of what is known as the ACWA program which manages the Blue Grass  Ammunition Demilitarization Facility  at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky and at  the Pueblo Chemical  Depot in Pueblo, Colorado.

197,House,109,-0.348,45,2005-05-26,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker, along with  the gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr. COBLE), chairman of the Judiciary  Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security, I  am pleased to introduce the Reducing  Crime and Terrorism at America’s Seaports Act of 2005.  There are 361 seaports in the United  States that serve essential national interests by facilitating the flow of trade  and the movement of cruise passengers,  as well as supporting the effective and  safe deployment of U.S. Armed Forces.  These seaport facilities and other marine  areas  cover  some  3.5 million  square miles of ocean area and 95,000  miles of coastline.  Millions of shipping containers pass  through our ports every month. A single container has room for as much as  60,000 pounds of explosives, 10 to 15  times the amount in the Ryder truck  used to blow up the Murrah Federal  Building in Oklahoma City. When you  consider that a single ship can carry as  many as 8,000 containers at one time,  the vulnerability of our  seaports  is  alarming.  Each year, more  than  141 million  ferry and cruise ship passengers, more  than 2 billion tons of domestic and  international freight and 3 billion tons  of oil move through U.S. seaports. Millions of truck-size cargo containers are  off-loaded onto U.S. docks. Many seaports are still protected by little more  than a chain link fence and, in far too  many instances, have no adequate safeguards to ensure that only authorized  personnel can access sensitive areas of  the port. If we allow this system to  continue unchecked, it is only a matter  of time until terrorists attempt to deliver a weapon of mass destruction to  our doorstep via ship, truck or cargo  container.  New reports by the Government Accountability Office, Congress’  investigative arm, fault both the CustomsTrade Partnership Against Terrorism  and the Container Security Initiative.  C-TPAT allows international shippers  to get quicker clearance through Customs in exchange for voluntary security measures. But the GAO said that  the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s vetting process was not thorough  enough. It found that only 10 percent of  the certified members had been validated through an actual physical inspection by the Agency. The rest had  been certified by paperwork applications.  As part of the recently passed Homeland Security authorization bill, the  House took some important steps to  improve the screening of cargo by expanding the Container Security Initiative and refocusing it, based on risk.  But the truth is that not every container can be inspected, and we need to  use other tools at our disposal to deter  those who would use our seaports as a  point of attack until we can inspect or  somehow  verify  each  container.  Strengthening criminal penalties, as  Chairman COBLE and I are proposing  with this bill, is one way we make our  Nation’s ports less vulnerable.  The Reducing Crime and Terrorism  at America’s Seaports Act of 2005 will  fill a gaping hole in our defense against  terrorism and make American ports,  passengers and cargo safer. Our bill is  substantially  similar  to  bipartisan  Senate  legislation  introduced earlier  this year by Senators BIDENand SPECTERand supported by other key members of the Judiciary Committee, including Senators DIANNEFEINSTEINand  ORRINHATCH. The Senate version of  this legislation has been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee and is awaiting action by the  full Senate.  Our  bill  makes  common-sense  changes to our criminal laws and will  help to close security gaps confronting  our ports. The amendment will make it  a crime to use a vessel to smuggle terrorists or dangerous materials, including nuclear material, into the U.S., impose stiff criminal penalties for providing false information to a Federal  law enforcement officer at a port or on  a vessel, and double the sentence of  anyone who fraudulently gains access  to a seaport.  Our bill would also directly access  several immediate threats by increasing penalties for smugglers who misrepresent illicit cargo. It would also  bridge specific gaps in current Federal  law by making it a crime for a vessel  operator to fail to stop when ordered to  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:56 May 27, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K26MY7.102 H26PT1 ",2005
198,Senate,109,0.429,80,2005-05-26,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, I wish to  join my colleague from Oklahoma and  other colleagues who have risen today  to  support  the nomination of John  Bolton to be our U.N. ambassador.  The United Nations is a unique institution, obviously. It is an institution  which has gone through its good times  and some bad times. Many of us, on our  side of the aisle especially, have been  critical of the United Nations over the  years for different activities, whether  they have been policy driven or,  in  some cases, just the operations aspects  of the United Nations. But I think, at  least for my part, I agree that it is an  extremely important institution, that  it represents an attempt by the community of nations across the world to  find a forum where they can interact  and,  hopefully,  reach  conclusions  which are  constructive  to mankind  generally and especially address issues  which cannot and should not be addressed by nation states individually,  such as issues involving large expansions of disease, issues involving the  treatment  of  children  around  the  world, issues involving the questions of  war.  It  is  important we have a  forum  where nations can come together and  try to work together and, if they disagree, at least have the disagreements  be more transparent and, therefore, the  ability,  hopefully,  to  reach  agreements, and at least have the capacity  to temper those disagreements, which  is more probable of occurring as a result of transparency.

199,Senate,109,-0.383,94,2005-05-26,Mr. REED.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak in opposition to the nomination  of John Bolton to be ambassador to the  United Nations.  There are two issues at stake. First  is an issue of whether this Senate will  receive critical information so that we  can  deliberate  carefully  and  thoroughly about Mr. Bolton’s nomination.  So far, the State Department, as my  colleagues, Senators DODDand BIDEN,  pointed out, failed to provide information under the theory that they get to  decide what we should know when we  are casting a vote as important as ambassador to the United Nations. It is a  novel theory, but it holds no water. If  we allow this to go on, it will make the  Senate  irrelevant when  it comes to  major decisions about nominations and  major decisions about the future policy  of the country.  The second issue is the qualifications  of Mr. Bolton to be ambassador to the  United Nations. For me, this is not a  particularly hard vote. I opposed Mr.  Bolton’s nomination to be Assistant  Secretary for Arms Control. That was  based upon my review of his record, his  statements, and his commitment  to  arms control and counterproliferation.  Frankly, I think over the last several  years—the record is mixed, but in large  part it suggests that his duties there  certainly don’t warrant a promotion to  be ambassador to the U.N.  He was instrumental in establishing  the Proliferation Security Initiative,  which  is a potentially useful  framework, but as CRS pointed out:  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:24 Jan 30, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€5SENATE\S26MY5.REC S26MY5 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2005

203,Senate,109,0.521,143,2005-05-26,Mr. BUNNING.," Mr. President, I pay  tribute and congratulate Mr. Matth  Toebben of Northern Kentucky, who  was recently honored with one of the  ‘‘Movers and Shakers’’ awards for the  Greater Cincinnati area. Mr. Toebben’s  life accomplishments and dedication to  Commonwealth  of  Kentucky  have  given me reason to be proud.  I believe Mr. Toebben to be the embodiment  of  the American Dream.  After immigrating to the United States  from Borger, Germany  in  1953 with  only $10 to his name, he used all of his  money to buy a train ticket to Cincinnati. Upon arrival in the area, Mr.  Toebben took up not only one job, but  two jobs as a carpenter for a Ft. Wright  home builder  in Northern Kentucky.  He worked both night and day saving  as much money as he  could. This  quickly paid off and by 1955, only 2  years after his arrival to the United  States, Mr. Toebben started his own  business, Toebben Builders and Developers.  The ‘‘Movers and Shakers’’ award of  Northern Kentucky is an annual award  presented to honor those within the  Greater Cincinnati region who stand as  an example for all. It is presented by  the Kentucky Enquirer, the Sales and  Marketing Council of Northern Kentucky, The Home Builders Association  of Northern Kentucky and The Kentucky Post.  As a Senator from Kentucky, I commend Mr. Toebben for his hard work  and dedication.  I hope that he will  serve as an inspiration to the citizens  of Kentucky.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  which were referred to the appropriate  committees.

205,,109,0.51,206,2005-05-26,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr.  HUNTER, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, for including my amendment  in the en bloc package.  It is the intent of Congress and in the interest of national security  that we maintain a  strong and healthy industrial base if we are to  remain  the strongest nation on Earth. Even  the founder of modern-day capitalism and free  trade, Adam Smith, recognized the need for a  nation to be able to depend upon its own industrial and agricultural base and not rely on  foreign sources  for  its defense needs. We  cannot maintain our role as global leader on a  pure services-based economy.  This amendment strengthens the Buy American Act, BAA, by restoring the original intent  that more than 50 percent of the components  in end products purchased by the Department  of Defense shall be mined, produced, or manufactured inside the United States.  The Buy American Act originally passed  Congress during  the Great Depression. The  intent of Congress was that to qualify under  the Buy American Act, a company had to have  substantially all of a product made, grown, or  mined in the United States. However, regulations implementing the Buy American Act have  subsequently  redefined  ‘‘substantially all’’  to  mean simply greater than 50 percent.  Yet even  that  regulation has been weakened even further over the years. The Pentagon has used the ‘‘public interest’’ exception  to waive  the Buy American Act  to  treat  the  purchase of some  foreign goods as  if  they  were made in America. The original intent of  the Buy American Act has been undermined  by procurement memoranda of understanding,  MOU, and other agreements with various foreign countries that permit the substitution of  foreign components  for components mined,  produced, or manufactured inside the United  States. These are not treaties or trade agreements approved by Congress—these were Executive Branch agreements not subject to review by Congress.  Thus, the Buy American laws are basically  worthless. There are so many holes in the law  that it means nothing when a company says  they comply with the Buy American Act. The  exception—and it’s a big one—is that the domestic content requirement doesn’t have to be  met if the items are procured from certain designated countries.  The Pentagon has MOUs with 21 developed  countries that waive the Buy American Act because  the Defense Department has determined that, for these countries, complying with  the BAA is ‘‘inconsistent with the public interest.’’ Basically, a company getting an award  from the Pentagon can claim compliance with  the Buy American Act without having to actually make anything here, as long as the components come from one of the 21 countries.  Too often, agencies claim  they need  the  best  for  the  least,  implying  that Americans  can’t make the best or compete on price and  quality. But ‘‘best value’’ is the standard, which  means price shouldn’t be the reigning factor.  The best value  for Americans  is  to have a  strong industrial base and we can’t do that if  DOD  forces U.S. companies  to compete on  price with foreign companies that are owned,  subsidized, or controlled by their governments.  It is important to remember that this amendment does not increase the share of the Buy  American content, but simply codifies the content percentage of what is in existing regulation.  f  HEROES EARNED RETIREMENT  OPPORTUNITIES ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 23, 2005  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would  like to express my support for H.R. 1499, the  Heroes Retirement Opportunities Act. This important  legislation allows military personnel  serving combat zones to deduct contributions  to their individual retirement plans.  The brave men and women of the United  States armed forces risk their lives to defend  our freedom and to continue the war on terror.  These outstanding individuals are called upon  to be stronger, braver, and tougher than they  ever thought possible.  It is our duty to reward the men and women  who risk their lives for our country, and the  Heroes Retirement Opportunities Act accomplishes that goal. This bill will protect as much  of their pay for the future as possible.  I know first hand the sacrifices our service  men and women make. My husband retired  1st Lieutenant Dexter Lehtinen, was wounded  in the Vietnam War by a grenade that almost  took his  life. Soon my stepson, Aviator 1st  Lieutenant Douglas Lehtinen, is preparing to  deploy to Iraq. I am certain that he will meet  individuals who,  like his  father, have paid a  tremendous price to uphold our ideals of freedom and democracy. By passing the Heroes  Retirement Opportunities Act, we can do our  part to assure a more certain future for those  who risk their lives to protect ours.  To all the brave men and women who have  served  and  now  serve  in  our  armed  forces . . .  Thank you, on behalf of a grateful Nation.  f  TOM WOOD: LABOR LEADER OF  THE YEAR!  HON.

207,,109,-0.592,213,2005-05-26,Mr. PAYNE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize and pay tribute to one of this country’s great civil rights  leaders, Rev. John H.  Scott. On May 7, I had the opportunity to attend a tribute to Rev. Scott, honoring the 25th  Anniversary Celebration of the John H. Scott  Memorial Fund in Tallulah, Louisiana. This living memorial was started at  the  request of  Rev. Scott at the end of his life, and now provides scholarships to young people, as well as  supporting other projects  that advance  the  aims and ideals of the Reverend’s life.  Rev. Scott was a minister and a civil rights  leader who was devoted  to  improving  the  quality of  life  for African-Americans  in  this  country. He was born in 1901, in a small, almost all-black parish in Louisiana, where black  schools, businesses, and neighborhoods were  thriving, but existed  in almost  total  isolation  from their white neighbors. He came to see  that this seeming independence was not commensurate with equality, and he dedicated his  life to the pursuit of that equality for all people,  of all color, in all places.  He was a farmer, as well as a pastor for  twenty-five  years,  president  of  the  local  NAACP for thirty-three years, and chairman of  the East Carroll Ministerial Alliance  for  five,  while still finding time to make regular visits to  hospitals, senior citizens’ homes, and prisons.  His  twenty-five year struggle  for  full voting  rights for African-Americans is an exemplar of  how individual people can indeed change the  world. Armed with a passion  for  justice and  ready  to  fight no matter what  the cost, his  local, grassroots efforts became a national  movement that ultimately convinced Attorney  General Robert Kennedy to join his crusade  for equality for all. Despite growing up under  the oppressive injustice of Jim Crow laws, and  knowing the risks it presented to his own life  and  the  lives of his  friends, neighbors, and  family members, he was unfaltering  in his  quest for progress.  His book, Witness to the Truth, which was  compiled by his daughter, Cleo Scott Brown,  is a collection of his writings and transcripts of  his interviews; and I recommend it to all who  wish to know more about the history of race  relations in this country. We must understand  the truth about our past struggles if we are ultimately to see success, because, in the words  of Rev. Scott, ‘‘So much of what we will become depends on how we start.’’ And Rev.  Scott helped us start well. His life is a testament  to  the  tenacity and courage  that daily  fortified our civil rights leaders and sustained  them in their struggle to ensure human rights  for every person, regardless of race, gender,  or economic circumstance.  We all owe a debt of gratitude to Rev. John  H. Scott, and I acknowledge my own indebtedness here today. He once wrote, ‘‘History is of  little value unless it inspires one to greater endeavors, or serves to guide against the mistakes of the past.’’ As the first African-American elected to this great body from my State,  I know that I have been inspired to greater endeavors by people like Rev. Scott, whose lives  paved the way for my accomplishments.  I’d also  like  to  thank Dr. Elsie Scott  for  bringing  this extraordinary Foundation  to my  attention and to commend the other Scott family members  including Jewel Scott, Johnita  Scott, and Louis G. Scott.  Mr. Speaker,  I wish  today  to honor  the  memory of Rev. John H. Scott, and  I know  that all of my colleagues here join me in paying tribute to this man of uncommon distinction  who history will remember as a great warrior  in the struggle for civil rights.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF MR.

208,,109,0.366,213,2005-05-26,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Mr. Speaker, one of  our Nation’s greatest assets is our veterans.  When I look around this chamber and see the  reflection of our democracy, I can’t help but  think of those who fought to ensure our safety,  our strength, and our freedom.  I rise today to recognize an honored veteran  and an extraordinary American, Mr. Hugh Ferguson.  Those who study World War II are aware  that the United States was at war with Japan  for three months after Germany surrendered.  The end of the war with Japan came only after  President Harry S Truman made  the brave  and difficult decision to use the atomic bomb.  On August 9, 1945, Mr. Hugh Ferguson was  piloting the B–29 bomber plane that dropped  the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. This  mission required bravery, faith, and discipline  in order to see it through. Mr. Ferguson was  just a mere  twenty-two years old when his  country employed his piloting skills to end the  battle and forever change the make-up of the  world.  As Mr. Ferguson will tell you, he and his fellow pilots knew  their acts would end World  War  II and save hundreds of  thousands of  American lives. This knowledge made it clear  to Mr. Ferguson what his mission was and  that his success was necessary—even at its  great cost.  It takes a brave and faithful man to carry out  the missions of the United States military. It  takes an even braver man to test history with  the new technology that was the atomic bomb.  Yet, Mr. Ferguson’s bravery did not stop there.  Years later, he again answered the military’s  call of duty. Mr. Ferguson flew the only plane  on site when the United States detonated the  world’s first hydrogen bomb on Eniwetok Atoll.  Not knowing the consequences of this flight,  he and his  crew bravely documented  the  power of the hydrogen bomb for United States  officials.  This year marks Mr. Ferguson’s 82nd birthday. I wish to congratulate and honor him for  his service to this country in the face of war.  As a member of Congress, as a proud citizen  of the United States, and as a person who enjoys the freedom this great Nation offers, I officially recognize Mr. Hugh Ferguson.  IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF DR.  JEFFREY CHARLES KELLER ON  THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT  AFTER  THIRTY-THREE  YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE DUBLIN CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT  HON. PAUL E.

209,,109,0.254,213,2005-05-26,Mr. GILLMOR.," Mr. Speaker, it is my great  pleasure to pay special tribute to one of Ohio’s  finest educators. After  thirty-three years, Dr.  Jeffrey C. Keller is retiring from the Dublin City  School District. Dr. Keller, who for three decades has directed  the Dublin Coffman High  School instrumental music program, has been  a leader in education and an inspiration to the  community.  Raised in Prospect, Ohio, Dr. Keller began  his career at Dublin High School in 1972, after  earning his bachelor’s degree from The Ohio  State University. After three years, Dr. Keller  returned to The Ohio State University where  he earned his Masters and Doctoral degrees.  After his graduate education, Dr. Keller  returned  to Dublin as director of music education, a position he has held ever since.  For more than 30 years, bands under Dr.  Keller’s direction have enjoyed a superior reputation in the State of Ohio. He has shared  countless hours developing the talents and enjoyment of music in each of his students. For  his efforts, Dr. Keller was recognized with the  2002 Ohio Music Educators’ Association’s  Ohio Music Educator of  the Year Award.  In  addition, Dr. Keller has been recognized by  Capital University and Prescott High School in  Arizona  for his education and performance  clinics. Dr. Keller was also awarded The  School of Music Society of Alumni and Friends  Award by his alma mater, The Ohio State University, for excellence in teaching in the music  education division.  Beyond his deep commitment  to  the students of Dublin Coffman High School, Dr. Keller has also given greatly of himself  to  the  community. As a result of his efforts as a community leader, Dr. Keller has been a recipient  of  the Dublin A.M. Rotary Signature Award,  the Dublin Jaycees Golden Shamrock Award  and the ‘‘God and Country’’ Music Award from  the Greater Columbus Area Salvation Army.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in paying special tribute to Dr. Jeffrey C. Keller  in recognition of his superlative service to the  students, parents and  friends of  the Dublin  Coffman Music Education Program. On behalf  of the people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am  proud  to  recognize  his many  accomplishments. We wish Jeff, his wife Gail, and their  daughter Kristany, all the best as we salute  one of Ohio’s finest citizens.  f  HONORING  THE  130TH  ANNIVERSARY OF SUMNER HIGH SCHOOL  HON. WM.

211,,109,0.513,220,2005-05-26,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to the life and legacy of Army Specialist James H. Miller IV. As our country honors our military personnel, both past and  present, this Memorial Day, I want to take this  opportunity to remember those who have sacrificed their lives for our freedom and security.  Army Specialist Miller leaves behind a legacy of honor, service, and compassion to his  family and friends. He died protecting a polling  location which allowed Iraqis the opportunity to  decide their own future.  Army Specialist Miller served as a medic  with  the United States Army and aspired  to  enter  the medical profession and work with  trauma patients. He  is  remembered  for his  commitment to the well-being of his fellow soldiers and  for his sensitivity  to  the needs of  others. In addition, he is remembered for his  love of music, and he particularly enjoyed  playing  the drums and guitar. Based on his  reputation for compassion and commitment to  the men and women he medically treated, I  have no doubt he would have been effective  in the medical field.  Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I  pay my last respects to a young man who was  so full of life; to a young man who had a full  and bright future ahead of him. I pray Army  Specialist Miller’s family and friends find peace  in their hearts, knowing his country is grateful  and humbled by his sacrifice.  I  thank our  brave men and women  in uniform  for continuing with our mission in Iraq, which is the  ultimate tribute to our fallen soldiers, marines,  sailors, and airmen.  Jimmy, to you I offer my sincere gratitude  and my solemn commitment  to continue  to  support your  friends,  the members of your  unit, and the men and women in Iraq who are  continuing without you. Thank you for seeing  a vision greater  than yourself and  for  the  strength of your commitment to our country.  God bless you.

212,,109,0.241,220,2005-05-26,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, I stand today to  honor the memory of a fellow Nevadan. Mr.  Glynn Dunlap passed away at  the age of  eighty-three after bringing smiles to the faces  of small children  for  the past  twenty years.  Glynn Dunlap became well known in the Las  Vegas valley and by children across the country through his artwork and devotion to young  children plagued with  terminal  cancer and  other terminal diseases. I know that he will be  missed.  Mr. Glynn Dunlap was born  in Herculean,  Missouri, in 1922. He later moved to California  as a commercial artist and retired to Boulder  City, Nevada. Upon his retirement, he and his  wife begun working with mentally-challenged  children. Mr. Dunlap noticed the determination  and hard work in these young kids and began  making certificates of achievement  to honor  their efforts.  After giving a certificate one day in 1985 a  child approached him  for a  cartoon;  thus  began a new passion. For  the next  twenty  years Mr. Dunlap drew cartoons for any child  who asked. Shortly after he began drawing for  children, Mr. Dunlap joined forces with such  organizations as the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the Candlelighters. His son, Don  Dunlap, said he dedicated so much  time  to  those kids because it brought joy to those who  were suffering; he did it ‘‘to see a kid smile.’’  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to extend  my gratitude for Mr. Dunlap’s many contributions and to honor the wonderful memory of  this excellent  role model.  I know  that Mr.  Glynn Dunlap will be missed, but not forgotten, especially by all  the  families he helped  cope during some of the most difficult times in  their lives.  f  MOURNING THE PASSING OF  JIMMY PETTYJOHN, JR.  HON. JON C. PORTER  OFNEVADA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 26, 2005  ",2005
213,,109,0.339,227,2005-05-26,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to Civil War Veteran Elisha Johns,  who  received  the Congressional Medal of  Honor for his courage and valor as a Corporal  during  the Battle of Vicksburg, Mississippi.  This Saturday, May 28th, the Porter Township  Board and  the  folks of Union, Michigan will  honor Mr. Johns during a ceremony at his  gravesite in Plum Grove Cemetery.  Elisha enlisted with the Union Army on August 9th, 1862, with whom he served until his  discharge on June 6, 1865. After his enlistment, his leadership and courage was recognized by his superiors as he was made Corporal and promoted to Sergeant soon thereafter. His true valor was demonstrated on May  22, 1863,  the date he earned  the Congressional Medal of Honor.  It was the beginning of the Battle of Vicksburg, Mississippi and there was a call for volunteers to bridge a dike that was essential for  a Union victory. Corporal Johns was one of  150 men that felt called to duty and valiantly  set out  to construct  the bridge. Before  they  succeeded in bridging the dike, two-thirds of  Elisha’s fellow soldiers were shot and unable  to go on. However, Corporal Johns and his  peers boldly continued, while under  intense  Confederate  fire, only  to  find his supporting  soldiers had retreated. As it was early in the  day, and military support lacking, Elisha was  forced to hide along the base of the dike until  darkness fell, when he was able to successfully get back to the Union lines. Forty years  after  his  brave  act, Corporal  Johns was  awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  As we come together as a Nation this Memorial Day, we honor the heroes of yesterday  like Elisha Johns, who gave so much to our  great Nation, and to honor those brave men  and women of our armed forces who are on  the front lines today, sacrificing so much in the  name of freedom.  I commend all the folks of Union, Michigan,  who are committed to preserving the history of  our veterans, such as Corporal Johns, so generations to come will remember the sacrifices  of their forefathers that played such a vital role  in making our great Nation.  f  THE TRAGIC PASSING OF NEALE  CHANEY SLATER  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 26, 2005  ",2005
214,,109,-0.379,227,2005-05-26,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, late last month—  on April 25, 2005—the family and friends of  Neale Chaney Slater, the community of Mechanicsville, and  the State of Maryland suffered a devastating loss when this caring and  accomplished young man was struck down  just as he was preparing to enter the prime of  his life.  WhIle driving out  to help a  local  farmer,  Neale, 20 years old, was killed in a tragic two-  vehicle accident on Route 5 in Hughesville.  Yet, in such a short period of time, Neale  gave so much to so many others.  At the age of 16, Neale joined the Mechanicsville Volunteer Fire Department, and had  held  the office of assistant  secretary and  treasurer.  Neale was a Firefighter  II and  certified  emergency medical technician, and was recognized by his peers with the Mechanicsville  Volunteer Fire Department as ‘‘Rookie of the  Year’’ in 2001. He also was awarded Fire Prevention Awards in 2001 and 2002.  ‘‘He told me he was following the family tradition,’’ said Willie Wilkerson, president of the  department, noting  that Neale’s grandfather  and uncle had also been members of the department. ‘‘For such a short life, he got a lot  accomplished.’’  That, in fact, is an understatement.  Neale was a 2003 honors graduate of the  Leonard  Hall  Junior  Naval  Academy  in  Leonardstown, where he achieved the rank of  Battalion Commander in his junior and senior  years.  He also was awarded Midshipman of  the  Year in 2001, 2002, and 2003, and was also  awarded the Military Excellence, Headmaster’s  and Loyalty Awards at graduation.  Clearly, Mr. Speaker,  this was an exceptional young man—a young man who envisioned a career in public service early on.  At  the  time of his passing, Neale was a  Cadet in the Maryland State Police, which he  joined in 2003. This coming fall, he was set to  join the State Police Academy.  Without question, Neale embodied the best  this country has to offer through his dedicated  public service, his educational achievements,  and the respect he had earned from all who  knew him.  Neale was held in high regards by the community he served, and  rightly so. Colonel  Thomas E. Hutchins, Secretary of the Department of State Police, said that Neale was ‘‘a  young man with a strong work ethic who was  committed to doing his best in every mission  he undertook.’’  Mr. Speaker, the passing of one’s child, particularly one with so much to contribute to his  community, his State and his Nation  is as  painful as it is incomprehensible.  Today, I want to extend my deepest sympathies  to Neale’s parents, Eleanor Fowler  Slater and Austin Joseph Slater, Sr., as well  as all of his family members and friends.  I realize that these words are small solace.  But I hope the Slaters, in time, find some comfort  in  the  fact  that  they raised a  truly  fine  young man who will be sorely missed and  never forgotten.  The Slaters have established  the Neale  Slater Memorial Fund  in his honor at  the  Leonard Hall Junior Naval Academy  for a  graduating senior  intending  to enter  law enforcement.  I know the recipients of this scholarship will  always be  inspired by  the example set by  Neale, and the extraordinarily positive impact  he had on his community will be felt for generations to come.  f  TRIBUTE TO HEROES OF THE OREGON MOUNTAIN RIVER CHAPTER OF THE RED CROSS  HON.

216,House,109,-0.112,5,2005-06-08,Mr. BOREN.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of House Concurrent  Resolution 159, which proposes to designate the week of June 12, 2005, as National Military Families Week. I want  to commend the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. BOOZMAN) and the gentlewoman  from  South  Dakota  (Ms.  HERSETH), the bill’s sponsors, for bringing this matter to the House.  Today, over 280,000 of the 1.4 million  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines  are  currently  deployed  around  the  globe; and, of those currently deployed,  more than 200,000 are serving in the  CENTCOM area of operation in support  of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom  in Afghanistan. And I am especially proud of the  men and women in uniform from my  home State of Oklahoma.  However, times have changed since  we drafted young, single service members. Compared to those earlier years,  many of today’s professional volunteer  forces are married and have families.  Today, there are approximately 700,000  spouses and more than 1.2 million dependent children between the ages of  birth and 18 years, and those numbers  continue to climb after each deployment.  A National Military Families Week  will provide an opportunity to allow  the Nation to recognize the sacrifices  not only of those who serve in uniform  but of the sacrifices that the families  make as well. Military families left behind often face a myriad of challenges  when a loved one is deployed. Fear, disappointment,  depression,  anger,  respect, admiration, joy, and pride are  just a few of the feelings that military  families face during those months of  separation. Many children will be born  while a parent is deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. Tragically, some of them  will  never know  their  parent who  served in uniform.  More so than ever, military families  are facing birthdays, they are facing  proms, graduations, holidays, and weddings and other family events without  their service member. So it is fitting  that our Nation recognizes the sacrifices being made by military families  and appreciate their contributions during a National Military Families Week  with appropriate observance and celebration.  I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2005
217,House,109,0.24,5,2005-06-08,Mr. JONES of North Carolina.,"  Madam Speaker, I yield such time as  he may consume  to  the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. BOOZMAN), who introduced this resolution.  ",2005
218,House,109,0.417,33,2005-06-08,Mr. NUSSLE.," Madam Chairman,  I rise  to  speak on  the measure before us, providing  budget authority for programming by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture and others. It provides  for about 20 percent of  total USDA  budget authority. As Chairman of the Budget  Committee, I am pleased to note that this bill  is consistent with the levels established in H.  Con. Res. 95, the House concurrent resolution  on  the budget  for  fiscal year 2006. Overall  spending in the bill is $29 million more than  the 2005 enacted level and $22 million above  the President’s request.  DEPARTMENTOFAGRICULTURE  In most areas within USDA, appropriators  ended up somewhere between the President’s  request and the 2005 enacted level. None of  the President’s initiatives to collect $178 million in new or increased user fees was taken  up, making up the difference through spending  reductions  in  some discretionary programs  and through $1.4 billion in reductions in some  mandatory programs authorized  for  the  first  time in the 2002 farm bill.  The bill makes changes in various mandatory programs that reduce net budget authority  by $1.4 billion. Specifically, it reduces budget  authority by about 25 percent for a number of  mandatory conservation programs and eliminates funding for a subset of agricultural research  and  rural  development  programs.  While the use of one-year savers in mandatory programs to stay within the Subcommittee’s 302(b) allocation has become  routine,  the Agriculture Committee could change some  of  these same mandatory programs  themselves in order to comply with the reconciliation  instructions  in  the Fiscal Year 2006  budget resolution.  FOODANDDRUGADMINISTRATION  H.R. 2744 provides $1.8 billion for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration [FDA], an increase of $55.3 million, or 3.1 percent, above the 2005 enacted  level and a decrease of $17.7 million below  the President’s request. Of  the appropriated  funds, $357 million is financed from on-going  drug, device and animal drug user fees. Under  provisions of the Prescription Drug User Fee  Act, the FDA will collect $305 million as user  fees to offset part of the costs of prescription  drug approval. This bill provides an increase  of $12.4 million for food safety and counterterrorism activities  to ensure consumers are  protected against  intentional and accidental  risks that threaten our food supply.  H.R. 2744 does not contain any emergencydesignated BA, which is exempt from budget  limits. The bill does rescind $32 million in the  unobligated balances of  the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,  and Children.  IOWACONCERNS  I am particularly pleased that this legislation  contains critical funding for ag and food safety  programs in my home state of Iowa. Specifically, I would like to commend the committee  for  funding  the completion of  the National  Centers  for Animal Health  in Ames,  Iowa,  where vital research to keep our nation’s food  supply safe is being done everyday. In addition,  this bill continues  funding  for  the Agriculture-Based Industrial Lubricants (ABIL) program at the University of Northern Iowa in my  Congressional district. The ABIL program continues  to promote value-added and environmentally safe agriculture products.  As we continue the appropriations season, I  commend Chairman LEWISand our colleagues  on the Appropriations Committee for meeting  the needs of the American public within the  framework established by the budget resolution. In conclusion, I express my support for  H.R. 2744. ",2005

220,House,109,0.351,47,2005-06-08,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  suppor  of Mrs. DELAURO’s  amendment  to  strike part of Section 757 of Title VII of the Agriculture Appropriations bill  for Fiscal Year  2006.  In 1966, the Arizona Cotton Growers Association and the Arizona Cotton Planting Seed  Distributors deeded a piece of property  located at 4135 East Broadway Road in Phoenix To USDA for $1.00 to help with the construction of  the Western Cotton Research  Center. With the construction of a new facility  for  the  research center at  the University of  Arizona’a Maricopa Agricultural Center, the research and its staff will move within the next  two years, leaving this property behind.  I  think  it  is appropriate  that  this property,  which abuts the headquarters of the Arizona  Cotton Growers Association,  revert back  to  that group, since they deeded this property to  USDA originally for only $1.00.  I fully support removing the language allowing  the Secretary of Agriculture  to sell  the  Wester Cotton Research Center, Phoenix, Arizona and crediting  the net proceeds of  that  sale as offsetting collections to the ARS Buildings and Facilities account.

Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of  the time to the gentleman from West  Virginia (Mr. RAHALL).  ",2005
224,House,109,-0.306,61,2005-06-08,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman  from New York  for  yielding me time, and I appreciate his  leadership, as well as the gentleman  from Kentucky  (Mr. WHITFIELD) and  the gentleman  from South Carolina  (Mr. SPRATT).  I want to remind my colleagues that  this particular amendment, which is a  funding  limitation, however,  is  still  very similar to an amendment that the  House voted on shortly before we broke  before the Memorial Day district work  period. That  particular  amendment  passed in an overwhelming fashion and  in a bipartisan fashion. So this is truly  bipartisan when  it comes  to  recognizing how valuable the horse is to this  country and what a symbol it is of our  freedom and how important it is to recognize this truly American icon.  When Americans think of the horse, I  do not believe they think of it in terms  of foreign cuisine on the tables of countries around the European area.  This amendment has invoked a lot of  emotion and misinformation. The opposition has said that this will increase  the abuse of horses and horses running  wild out West. Such statements are not  true.  Here are the facts. Each year some  65,000 horses are slaughtered  in this  country for human consumption in Europe and Asia where they are sold in  restaurants  as  a  delicacy. Another  30,000 are trucked to Canada and Mexico for slaughter. This amendment will  end that slaughter of American horses  for human consumption overseas.  Slaughter is not the same as humane  euthanasia administered by a veterinarian  in a very controlled environment. Euthanasia of horses is administered  by  legal  injection,  whereas  slaughtered  is  administered  by unskilled, untrained workers using the  captive bolt. Many times this is administered  improperly, causing unnecessary pain and suffering before death.  Passage of this amendment will not  cause  an  overpopulation  of  horses.  Each year 690,000 horses die in the U.S.  many of which are euthanized by a licensed  veterinarian.  Slaughtered  horses  represent  only  1  percent  of  horses that die each year. This would  not  result  in  an  overpopulation  of  horses as some suggest.  There  are  alternatives  available.  Americans do not profit from slaughtering horses. This is an export-driven  market. Foreigners eat our horses and  foreign companies make money, and  we should stop looking at it in that  perspective and start looking at it in  the American perspective. The CHAIRMAN.

229,House,109,-0.606,89,2005-06-08,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker, if  the gentleman will yield further, let  me say one thing about that. It is not  as if they are saying we want things to  be exactly as we were promised when  we came  in. These employees have  given up about $3 billion in benefits already.  ",2005
230,House,109,-0.488,89,2005-06-08,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank the ranking member, the gentleman  from California  (Mr. GEORGE  MILLER), and thank the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY) as well  for your leadership on this issue, and  for convening this e-hearing and also  taking this time on the floor tonight.  I think it is imperative to read as  many of these e-mails as possible into  the RECORDand express the voice of so  many people that earned their pensions,  that worked  their  long work  lives and took as a form of deferred  compensation the rights to these pension  benefits.  They  sacrificed  pay  raises and sacrificed other benefits in  exchange for what they thought was a  promise from the company that they  were going to get this pension when  they retired.  One UAL person wrote in and said, ‘‘I  joined UAL with stars in my eyes believing the promise of opportunity, a  secure benefit package and the enthusiasm  of  being  part  of  something  great.’’  Well, it really has not been something great for them. As the gentleman  mentioned, in every way the employees  tried to work it out with the company.  I am so used, as the gentleman is, from  hearing executives tell us, oh, the employees will not cooperate, the employees and their high costs are driving  this company down.  Well, it was the employees at UAL  that actually went into an ESOP program, an employee stock option program,  that  turned  out  to  be near  worthless  for them  in the  long run.  Some  lost hundreds of thousands of  dollars trying to help the company out.  They underwent  cuts  in  pay,  they  forewent benefits, and all of this to  find  the  company  surreptitiously  sneaks into bankruptcy for 21⁄2years  and  then  slides  their  benefits  into  bankruptcy and they end up going into  the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and getting about 30 to 40 percent of the benefits, if they are lucky.  These letters, these e-mails, are written about feelings of betrayal, absolute  feelings of betrayal. They say it is a  sign of what they think is happening to  the moral fiber of this country. They  wonder on a philosophical level how  this is going to impact the values that  they have been brought up with and  they have been instilling in their children.  Jacob Acker said not too long ago  that in 1938 FDR talked about the last  great unconquered frontier of America  was the frontier of uncertainty and insecurity. And then as a country we set  out  to do  something about  it. We  worked with corporations, with employee groups, we worked with private  groups and our government and we put  in Social Security, we put in pensions,  we put in health care benefits, the minimum wage, the GI Bill. We put  in  structures and security so people  in  this country would no longer feel that  they were confronting that frontier of  insecurity and uncertainty.  But here we are in 2005, we find out  executives and management of a company can turn it around and take their  promises and turn them into dust and  take their employees and put them  into sheer desperation, so that again in  2005 we are again facing a frontier of  uncertainty and insecurity. And it is  incumbent on this Congress to finally  act.  I say to the gentleman from California (Mr. GEORGEMILLER), as ranking member of this Committee on Education and Workforce, and the members on the minority side who have  been banging away for some time now  saying this is an impending problem  that has to be addressed, where is Congress on this matter? Where  is the  White House on this matter? They are  dealing with issues the American public does not even care about. You look  at what has happened so far this year  on the agenda of this Congress and the  White House. It is not about jobs, it is  not about health care, it is not about  education for people’s children, and it  is not about pension protection and retirement.  The closest the President comes is  trying  to privatize Social Security,  which would put these people in further jeopardy. And that is what I hear  often from the people at United. Boy, if  they ever realized about the guaranteed benefit of Social Security being  VerDate jul 14 2003  04:29 Jun 09, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K08JN7.203 H08PT1 ",2005
231,Senate,109,0.549,117,2005-06-08,Mr. SESSIONS.," If the Senator will  yield, I will follow up on that.  I remember President Clinton nominated  quite  a  number  of  justices,  judges, who were active members—  some lawyers—for the American Civil  Liberties Union. If you  look at the  American Civil Liberties Union Web  site, they favor and believe the Constitution  allows  the  legalization  of  drugs;  that  there  cannot be a  law  against legalization of drugs.  They oppose all pornography laws—  even child pornography laws—on their  Web site.  We confirmed Marsha Berzon  from  California. She was chairman of the  litigation  committee  of  the ACLU.  There were quite a number of other  members of the ACLU. We gave them a  fair hearing. We asked  their views.  Some were answered satisfactorily to  my view and  some were not. Fundamentally, the question was, will you  follow the law of the Supreme Court?  Will you be faithful to those laws? Do  you have a good  reputation among  your colleagues? Have you a record of  integrity and achievement?  Most of those judges, virtually all of  them, were confirmed.  ",2005
232,Senate,109,0.453,173,2005-06-08,Mr. BURR.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of the nomination of Gretchen  C.F. Shappert to be U.S. Attorney for  the Western District of North Carolina.  Ms. Shappert has been an Assistant  U.S. Attorney for the Western District  since 1990 and has served as Acting U.S.  Attorney since 2004.  Ms. Shappert brings a wealth of experience to the position, and I am confident that she will continue to serve  the President, the State of North Carolina, and the country with honor and  distinction.  From  1983  to  1990, Ms. Shappert  served as Assistant District Attorney  and as Assistant Public Defender for  Mecklenburg County, NC.  Before her career in public service,  Ms. Shappert was an associate with the  law  firm of Tucker, Hicks, Sentelle,  Moon & Hodge in Charlotte, NC.  Ms. Shappert earned her bachelor’s  degree from Duke University and her  J.D. from Washington and Lee University School of Law, where she earned  the title of managing editor of the  Washington and Lee Law Review.  I have no doubt that Ms. Shappert  will continue to represent North Carolina well in the judicial branch of our  Nation.  f  LEGISLATIVE SESSION  ",2005
233,,109,-0.278,180,2005-06-08,Mr. DAVIS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  honor of Ann Lowry Murphey, a tireless public  servant who lost her struggle with cancer last  month.  Ann truly left no stone unturned in her quest  to  improve  the Tampa Bay community. She  energetically led a host of charitable and community organizations, and  in attempting  to  highlight Ann’s causes, any tribute will inevitably fail to recognize all of her contributions.  A faithful servant of God, Ann was a long-  time parishioner and member of the vestry of  St. John’s Episcopal Church. A supporter of  the arts, Ann was active with The Tampa Philharmonic and The Museum Society at the University of Tampa. As a successful businesswoman, she served on the board of First Citizens Bank and Barnett Bank of Tampa and as  Vice  President  of Murphey Capital.  Ann  worked on  the Judicial Nominating Commission for the 13th Circuit and was on the board  of governors of the Greater Tampa Chamber  of Commerce. And Ann never just participated  in any activities—she was a supreme doer  and always a leader.  Throughout her years, she was president  and Sustainer of  the Year of The  Junior  League of Tampa, president of  the Lowry  Family Foundation and served on the board of  directors for The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center  & Research Institute. And in 1992, for all her  hard work, the Tampa Civitan Club gave her  the Citizen of the Year Award.  But above all these contributions, Ann will  be best remembered for her work on behalf of  children—in particular, her efforts to transform  The Children’s Home. Whether she was serving as  the organization’s president of  the  board of directors, chairwoman of the board of  trustees, associate director or director of development, Ann was constantly working not  only to improve the quality of care that The  Children’s Home provides, but also to spend  as much time as she could with the children  who depend on these services. For all her efforts,  it was  fitting  that  last year Voices  for  Children chose Ann as the first recipient of its  Guardian Angel Award.  Through  all  her  work,  Ann  was  an  unstoppable,  passionate  force  for  change.  There were no bounds to her compassion and  generosity. She was  truly a blessing  to  the  whole community.  On behalf of all of those who benefited so  greatly from her tireless efforts, I would like to  extend my deepest sympathies to Ann’s loved  ones. Ann shared so much with us. We can  only try to follow in her footsteps and do our  best to live up to her very high standards.  f  HONORING MS. BETTY B.  MICHALIGA  HON. JAMES P.

235,,109,-0.519,194,2005-06-08,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor John I. Southerland for his loyal service  to the community.  John  I. Southerland was born  in Sanford,  N.C.  to  the  late Annie Bell Southerland. He  graduated  from W.B. Wicker High School  in  1959, then relocated to New Jersey and later  to Brooklyn, N.Y. He is married to Eva Thomas Southerland and they are the proud parents  of  Jonathan  Southerland,  Stephanie  Southerland-Raimer and Nydia Southerland.  In 1968, Mr. Southerland  joined  the New  York City Police Department. During his 27  years with the department, he earned numerous commendations and certificates. He  received the Certificate of Merit for 27 years of  service and a Certificate of Attendance, which  is given to staff members who had not been  late or absent for five more years. After retiring  from  the Police Department  in 1995, he  pursued his interest in fire safety. He then received a certificate and worked as a fire safety  officer  in  the World Trade Center until September  11.  Also  during  the  1990’s, Mr.  Southerland was installed as a Deacon, by the  late Rev. Dr. Paul C. Hayes, at Mercy Seat  Baptist Church of Brooklyn.  In 2001, Mr. Southerland turned his attention to community advocacy. He is a member  of the Executive Board of the Community Action Project (CAP), a community organization  located in East Flatbush. As a board member,  he has met with  local politicians  to  lobby  against  fraudulent  immigration services and  rampant illegal truck traffic. Currently, he and  the board strive  to sustain  the area’s economic growth  through better coordination of  city services, specifically sanitation and police.  He is also attending Queens College to broaden his understanding of political activism  to  better serve his community.  Mr. Southerland  is an active member of  local DC 37. He was chosen as a delegate to  go to Albany to meet with state representative  to discuss issues pertaining to the union and  its members.  He continues  to show commitment  to  the  community by visiting  the sick and helping  senior citizens. He is always willing to share a  smile and words of encouragement with everyone he meets. As a result, Mr. Speaker, today  we acknowledge John I. Southerland, an asset  to the community.  f  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  NATIONAL  CHAMPION  KELLER  HIGH  SCHOOL GIRL’S SOFTBALL TEAM  HON.

238,House,109,0.449,37,2005-06-20,Mr. TIAHRT.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  support of Chairman HUNTER’s amendment  upholding  religious  freedom at  the United  States Air Force Academy. Protecting the religious freedom of our military cadets and service members is critically important to me, and  should be critically important to this Congress.  During  full committee consideration of  the  Defense Appropriations bill, Ranking Member  OBEY inserted a provision condemning the Air  Force, the Air Force Academy and its Cadets.  The allegations on which  this provision  is  based have not been substantiated by any  credible source. They are simply rumors advanced by a very few disgruntled individuals.  Nonetheless, the Air Force has taken these  allegations  very  seriously  since  they were  made in late April. First, the Academy established a new mandatory course to encourage  respect for all religions. Second, the Air Force  launched several investigations. These investigations are still ongoing and a report is expected shortly. The  task  force charged with  looking  into  these allegations has been directed to assess:  (1) Air Force and USAFA policy and guidance on the subject of religious respect and  tolerance.  (2) The appropriateness of relevant training,  for the cadet wing, faculty, and staff.  (3) The  religious climate and assessment  tools used at USAFA.  (4) The effectiveness of USAFA mechanisms to address complaints on this subject,  to include the chain of command, the Academy’s  Inspector General  and  the Military  Equal Opportunity office. (5) The practices of the chain of command,  faculty, staff or cadet wing that either enhance  or detract  from a climate  that respects both  the ‘‘free exercise of religion’’ and the ‘‘establishment’’ clauses of the First Amendment.  (6) The relevance of the religious climate at  the USAFA to the entire Air Force.  Additionally, the Task Force’s final assessment will include an Air Force Inspector General report on the removal of Air Force Captain Melinda Morton from her position at the  Academy.  The Air Force has made progress to ensure  that no one  feels pressure  from  religious  groups, and is continuing these efforts. This  final report should be released in the next couple of weeks. I have full confidence that this  report will provide a  thorough and complete  report as to the truth of these rumors.  Congress must reserve judgment until all of  the facts are revealed. The Air Force has yet  to tell its side of the story. Until they do, we  do not know what actually happened in Colorado Springs. For this House to condemn the  Air Force and the Academy at this time, before all the information is available, is wrong.  This provision simply has no place in an otherwise tremendous bill.  The Obey provision  is all  the more disappointing because men and women  in our  Nation’s Air Force have sacrificed  immeasurable blood and treasure to protect the principles of freedom and liberty. Today, we are  engaged in a global war on terrorism—aimed  directly at our Nation’s democracy and core  values. Our young men and women are fighting and dying for these freedoms. It is wrong  for Congress to chip away at the very freedoms  these heroes are shedding  their own  blood to protect. When a young man or woman stands up to  fight for this country, he or she does not surrender his or her Constitutional  rights. The  men and women of our military have the right  to freely practice their religion, and Congress  has a solemn duty  to  fight  to protect  their  rights.  I would ask my colleagues  to  join me  in  support of Chairman HUNTER’s amendment.  The Obey provision is wrong. It is bad policy,  and  it  is misguided, and  it  is  inappropriate.  Congress should wait to act until we have all  the facts. Please stand up for the Air Force,  the Academy,  the Cadets,  and  the First  Amendment  that guarantees every American  the  freedom of  religion. Vote  to  the Hunter  Amendment.

239,House,109,-0.491,44,2005-06-20,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Chairman, I regret  that a point of order was raised, but I  do want to commend the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. YOUNG) for his outstanding  leadership  to  protect  our  country. He is a champion for national  security, a champion for our troops. I  respect him enormously. I wish he had  not raised this point of order.  I want to commend the chairman of  the  full  committee,  the  gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS), who is in  the Chamber right now, for his distinguished leadership on behalf of America’s troops and on behalf of our national security. They have worked in a  bipartisan manner with  our  distinguished ranking member, former chair  of the subcommittee, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA). By  working together with the gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS) in the last  session of Congress and on an ongoing  basis with the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. YOUNG), they have really tried  very hard to provide our troops with  what they need to do their job and to  come home safely and soon.  I also want to recognize the outstanding leadership of the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY), the ranking member of  the  full committee,  former chair of the committee. I think  these four gentleman have worked very  closely together, removed the doubt in  anyone’s minds that we understand our  obligation under the Constitution to  provide for the common defense and  they help us honor that commitment. I  thank them all.  The legislation that we are considering today contains in it another $45  billion for the war in Iraq that has already  consumed nearly  $200 billion,  ended the  lives of over 1,700 of our  troops, and thousands more Iraqis, and  changed  forever the  lives of tens of  thousands more who have been wounded in that war.  They were sent into the war without  the intelligence about where they were  going, what they were going to confront, without adequate equipment to  protect them and without a plan for  what would happen after the  fall of  Baghdad.  As  I  referenced  earlier,  the  gentleman  from California  (Mr. LEWIS),  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  MURTHA), the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. YOUNG), and the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY) have fought hard,  especially  the gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS) and the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA) last  year in the defense Committee on Appropriations to correct the inadequacy  of the equipment they had.  Many of us have visited with soldiers  in Iraq. Some of them are on their second tour of duty. I conveyed to these  brave soldiers, as I have to soldiers in  hospitals here and abroad, how grateful  the American people are to them for  their valor,  for their patriotism,  for  the sacrifices they are willing to make  for our country. They have performed  their duties with great courage and  skill, and we are deeply in their debt.  Disagreement with the policies that  sent our troops to Iraq and which keep  them in danger today in no way diminishes the respect and admiration that  we have for our troops. Sadly, the level  of their sacrifice has not been met by a  level of language by the administration, and now  the American people  agree that this war is not making us  safer.  Republican Senator Robert Taft of  Ohio, who in time became the Republican leader in the United States Senate, had this to say about our duty in  time of war as Members of Congress.  He said, ‘‘Criticism in time of war is essential to the maintenance of a governing democracy.’’  He was a Republican. This was World  War II. He was a Republican in the  Senate. He said that, and he was right.  It is in that spirit that I disagree  with those Republicans who continue  the course of action that we are on  now. When we went into this war, it  was a war of choice. President Bush  sent us into a war of choice, a preemptive war. When you have a war, you  have to go in with the preparation that  you have. But when  it  is a war of  choice, you have an increased responsibility to be prepared and to have a plan  for what happens after the fall of, in  this case Baghdad, but we have not. b1700  Vice President CHENEY at the time  said that our troops would be met with  rose petals.  Instead, they were met  with rocket-propelled grenades.  Under Secretary Wolfowitz said that  this is a country that can easily afford  its own reconstruction and soon, and  the U.S. taxpayer is still paying the  tab.  This is a war that each passing day  confirms what I have said before and I  will say again, that this war in Iraq is  a grotesque mistake. It is not making  America safer and the American people  know it.  Early on, the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. MURTHA)  said what a  Democratic, what a bipartisan proposal  should be as far as going into Iraq, that  with the fall of Baghdad, we should  move quickly to Iraqtize, to turn the  security of Iraq over to the Iraqis. We  should internationalize, that we should  form the diplomatic alliances in the region for the Iraqi government so that  our troops could accomplish their goals  militarily with the help of diplomacy.  It simply cannot be done alone.  The gentleman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr. MURTHA),  in  leading our House  Democrats on this issue, said that we  should energize, we must turn on the  light, we must have reconstruction in  Iraq, and because of some of the poor  planning or lack of planning, the reconstruction has taken much longer, is  much more costly, and again, the security is making it almost impossible.  You cannot go forward with the social services and the rest unless you  have a secure Iraq. You cannot have it  be secure and bring our troops home  unless you turn over that security responsibility to the Iraqis.  So we go to a place where we should  expect the least Congress should do is  to insist that the President provide the  details on how it will be determined  when the responsibility for Iraq’s security can be turned over to the Iraqis  and how Iraq’s economic and political  stability will be assessed. That is what  my  amendment  would  have  done,  would do, if it were made in order.  The failure by the President and his  administration to plan adequately for  the conduct of war to date has made it  all the more imperative that Congress  ensure  the  planning  be  done  competently for bringing our troops home.  If our troops are to leave when the mission has succeeded, we need to know  how success will be defined.  Despite the manner in which the administration has chosen to  fund the  war, relying totally on supplemental  appropriations up until now, as though  it was a surprise that keeping hundreds  of thousands of military personnel in  and near Iraq would have a cost, our  commitment in Iraq cannot be openended. Congress should have insisted  long ago that the limits on that commitment be publicly shared and well  understood.  The Iraq money in this bill is described as a bridge fund. Congress and  the American people have a right to  ask: A bridge to what? A bridge to  where? The  report  required by my  amendment would have built on the report request in the recently enacted  supplemental appropriations bill and  help answer that question, and that request was agreed to  in a bipartisan  way. This is really an endorsement of  that, taking it from report language,  putting it into law and raising its profile so the administration knows that  it must answer those questions in the  supplemental.  Republicans  apparently  prefer  to  keep their heads in the sand and continue to provide money for the Iraq  War with no questions asked.  Congress did not discharge  its responsibility to oversee these policies at  the start of the war, and it has not  done so since. The American people deserve better. More  importantly, Mr.  Chairman, our  troops who  serve  in  harm’s way deserve better. They are  owed more by those who sent them  there than lack of planning.  We must do everything in our power  to honor our obligation to our troops.  Only then will we be fulfilling our responsibility.

240,House,109,0.51,51,2005-06-20,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, this Velazquez amendment  is an effort to kill the Small  Business  Comp Demonstration  program. The issue is more appropriately  settled in the authorizing committee  and not on an appropriations bill.  First of all, the Comp Demonstration  program does not cost the taxpayers  one dime. There is no money appropriated for it. The Small Business Competitive Demonstration program began  in 1988 with three purposes: first, to  help emerging small businesses; second,  to expand  the participation of  small businesses and  industries that  were traditionally dominated by large  businesses; and, third, to test the competitiveness of small businesses in industries in which small businesses are  well represented. The Comp Demo program was renewed in 1992, made permanent in 1997, and slightly expanded in  2004 as a part of larger bills that passed  by wide margins or unanimous consent.  Prior to the adoption of the Comp  Demonstration program,  small businesses were  relegated  to  industries  dominated by small businesses. Federal  agencies could say they met their overall small business goals while not doing  much  to provide more contracts  to  small businesses in more higher-end,  higher-paying  industries. The Comp  Demo program ended this practice all  while showing that small businesses  are still competitive in the industries  where they have been historically well  represented. These  industries  include  construction, garbage collection, architectural  engineering,  surveying  and  mapping, non nuclear shipbuilding and  ship repair, landscaping, and pest control. The Comp Demo program requires  that small businesses receive a  ‘‘fair  proportion’’ of government contracts  in each industry rather than just a few.  The principles upon which the program were established are still valid.  Emerging small businesses still need  help. Small businesses need to participate in industries in which they have  traditionally not had a chance to obtain a Federal contract.  I would urge my colleagues to vote  ‘‘no’’ on the Vela´zquez amendment. ",2005
241,,109,0.325,58,2005-06-20,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do  now rise and report the bill back to the  House with sundry amendments, with  the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as  amended, do pass.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly,  the Committee  rose;  and  the Speaker pro  tempore  (Mr.  SHIMKUS) having assumed the chair,  Mr. CAMP, Chairman of the Committee  of the Whole House on the State of the  Union, reported that that Committee,  having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 2863) making appropriations for  the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and  for other purposes, had directed him to  report the bill back to the House with  sundry  amendments, with  the  recommendation that the amendments be  agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass.

242,,109,-0.402,58,2005-06-20,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, it is my  sad duty to inform the House of the  passing of a friend to many of us and a  long-term colleague here in the House,  J.J.  ‘‘Jake’’ Pickle of Austin. Jake  passed away at the age of 91, peacefully, on Saturday. He had a long career here in Washington, having served  as a night watchman over in the Cannon Building, a job he told me he never  did very well, but he sure worked night  and day in the 31 years that he served  here in the House of Representatives,  working with colleagues on both sides  of the aisle, bringing not only his legislative talents but his tremendous good  humor.  He has more stories than anyone can  remember, many  of  them  collected  with his daughter Peggy in a book. We  have got an elementary school, a research center and a Federal building  named after him, but I think he lives  on  in the hearts of the many who  worked with him here in Washington  and certainly in the lives of the thousands of people he helped in central  Texas, most of whom have a squeaky  green pickle  to  remember him by,  along with his many good deeds.  Services will be at  4 o’clock on  Wednesday in Austin. I know all of our  colleagues will join in expressing our  sympathies to his wife, Beryl; daughter, Peggy; and all the members of the  Pickle family and in saying, Jake, a  job well done.  ",2005
243,House,109,0.585,65,2005-06-20,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, I have listened to my colleagues  with great interest tonight.  Three  issues  seem  to  have  been  raised. One is on CAFTA, which I will  address tonight, and then we talked  about Guantanamo, which I am going  to try to address later this week. Then  we will talk about Iraq because there  are parallels between what we are seeing in Iraq right now and what happened in World War I and World War II,  but I cannot cover all those tonight. So  I will debate my colleagues on some of  those other issues later this week.  Let me talk about CAFTA right now  because the gentlewoman  from Ohio  (Ms. KAPTUR), my  good  friend,  for  whom I have the highest regard, was  just talking about some of the problems that occur with women in Central  and South America and the living conditions and  the working conditions,  and I agree with her.  Because of that, and a number of  other reasons, I voted against NAFTA  and worked with my colleague on that,  and I voted against the WTO and the  General Agreement  on Tariffs  and  Trade. So you probably ask, well, why  in the world, Danny, would you be in  favor of CAFTA  if you opposed all  those others? So I want to tell my colleagues tonight why I support CAFTA.  First of all, we have what is known  as the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and  the Caribbean Basin Initiative is kind  of a one-way street right now. We allow  the Caribbean countries and Central  American countries to export into the  United States without tariffs while at  the same time, when we send stuff into  those countries, we do have to pay tariffs in many cases. So the bottom line  is it is a one-way street.  The Caribbean Basin Initiative will  go by the wayside if we pass CAFTA,  and we will have a  two-way  street  where there will be minimal tariffs or  no tariffs whatsoever, and so our producers will benefit the same as the producers in Central America and the Caribbean. I think that is one reason why  I think CAFTA is a better deal than  what we see with the Caribbean Basin  Initiative.  The second thing is that we need to  see  stability  in Central and South  America. President Reagan, when he  was President, worked very hard to  create democracy in our hemisphere,  and as a result of the Reagan doctrine,  all of the countries  in Central and  South America became  fledgling democracies over the past few decades  with the exception of Cuba. We are  starting to see cracks in those democracies because of  the poverty down  there and because of some leftist leaders. We see problems in four or five, six  countries in Central and South America right now, and one of the things  that we need to do is to address the  issue of poverty down there.  One way to do that is to try to see  some foreign investment going in there  from places besides China and Europe  into Central and South America  so  that we see a reduction in the poverty  rate and a reduction in the pressure  that is being brought about on the existing democracies down there to move  toward leftist governments.  If we have a change, a sea change in  those countries in Central and South  America, then what is going to happen  is  the  illegal  immigration problems  MENENDEZ)  that we see right now will be magnified. They will grow because people  want to flee tyranny. They want to flee  conflict, and if you start seeing revolutionary activity take place, like that  which we saw in El Salvador in the  1980s, and in Nicaragua in the 1980s and  elsewhere, then you are going to see  people saying, I am getting the heck  out of here; I am going north; I am  going to the United States. Our border  is very porous. We have a terrible time  controlling it right now. We have millions of people that have come across  that border that are now in the United  States that cost our taxpayers money  and cause a lot of hardship and problems.  So stabilizing those governments in  Central and South America I think is  extremely  important.  I am now the  chairman of the Subcommittee on the  Western Hemisphere on the Committee  on International Relations, and I have  had a chance, along with my colleague  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  to  start  looking at  this  issue. We may not agree on this, but I  think it is important that we go down  there and look at these countries and  find out how we can make sure there  are stable governments in place and  that we do not see democracies start to  deteriorate and go by the wayside.  So I feel it is very important that we  look at this from more than just one  point of view. Trade is important. Job  loss by Americans is very important. I  am  concerned  about  both  of  those  things. A two-way street in trade with  no tariffs I think is also very important, but also one of the major issues  as far as I am concerned is the stabilization of democracy in our hemisphere. If we do not, as a leader of  democratic institutions in this hemisphere and around the world, take the  initiative to stabilize those countries,  who in the heck will?  So I still believe  in  free and  fair  trade. I would not vote  for NAFTA  today.  I would not vote  for GATT  today. I would not vote for the WTO  today, but  I am going  to vote  for  CAFTA, and the reason I am voting for  CAFTA is for the reason I just said. I  think it is extremely important to not  only worry about trade and balance but  also about national security and immigration, and I hope my colleagues at  least understand where I stand on this  issue because I love you guys. f  ",2005

245,House,109,-0.448,72,2005-06-20,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor to pay tribute to former judiciary chairman Peter Rodino, he was a champion of civil  rights and a beacon of justice during his 40  year tenure in Congress and his 16 years as  a Seton Hall Professor of Law.  Mr. Rodino was most famous for his handling of the Watergate crisis. All sides—including Democrats, Republicans, and even the national press—hailed Rodino  for  the  fair and  just hand he used to guide the impeachment  hearings. During this period of crisis, his courage and wisdom provided  the  foundation of  strong leadership that gave Members the confidence to do what was right, even if it meant  crossing party lines. The issue became one of  preserving the sanctity of the system, rather  than preserving the reputation of an individual.  Throughout the process, Rodino’s commitment  to the system never wavered.  The son of Italian immigrants, Peter Rodino  came of age  in Newark, New Jersey. After  leaving high school, Congressman Rodino endured 10 years of menial jobs while studying  late into the night for a law degree at New Jersey Law School.  In 1938 his patience and  dedication was  rewarded when he  joined a  local law firm. He put his newly found career  on hiatus when he chose to defend his Nation  against injustice in World War II. Mr. Rodino’s  strong  character and determination earned  him not only a Bronze star, but also a Knight  of Order of Crown from Italy—a token of national gratitude  for a  soldier’s accomplishments. Upon return he decided to run for Congress. Although his first attempt failed, his perseverance and strong work ethic served him  well, and he was elected to Congress in 1948.  A strong advocate of racial equality, he was  a driving force behind the Civil Rights Act of  1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Another accomplishment  in  the  long  list of Mr.  Rodino’s  notable  achievements was  sponsoring the bill that made Columbus Day a national holiday to commemorate the contribution  of  Italian Americans  in  the  founding of our  great Nation. Mr. Rodino also contributed to  the legislation that made Martin Luther King’s  birthday a national holiday.  Though Mr. Rodino will be remembered for  so much more  than  the Watergate crisis,  it  was undoubtedly his greatest moment. Rodino  allowed a moderate central group of both  Democrats and Republicans  to develop  the  case for impeachment, preventing it from turning it into any type of political ploy. Just last  year, Mr. Rodino gave an interview stating that  there are lessons to be learned from Watergate, namely  the extent of Government corruption. Mr. Rodino understood that it was the  duty of Congress to rein in any administration  or individual that was not adhering to the principles of justice.  It is with great respect and admiration that  I offer my condolences to Mr. Rodino’s wife,  Joy, and their family. Mr. Rodino is survived  by two children, Margaret Stanziale and Peter  W. Rodino  III,  three  grandchildren, Carla  Prunty, Maria Stanziale and Talia Rodino, and  twin great-grandchildren, Annabel and Charlotte Prunty. When asked about her husband,  Joy says, ‘‘He was so ahead of his time. He  lived civil rights. He lived equality. In his life,  he didn’t see color, he didn’t see sex. He just  went for the equality of the person.’’ Former  Representative Rodino was a man that I was  proud to have worked with and honored to call  friend.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that you and my colleagues to join me in honoring the late Peter  Rodino. He was a pioneer for justice in our  country and he will be greatly missed by all  who knew him. f  CONTINUING THE TRIBUTE TO  PETER RODINO  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  MARCHANT). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 4, 2005, the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. HOLT)  is recognized for 60 minutes.  ",2005

254,Senate,109,-0.223,107,2005-06-20,Mr. SALAZAR.," Mr. President, I rise  today to remember one of Colorado’s  fallen heroes, Marine LCpl Chad Bryant Maynard who was killed last week  in Ar Ramadi, Iraq. He was only 19  years old.  Lance Corporal Maynard hailed from  Montrose, CO, on the Western Slope.  Growing up, it was his dream to serve  his country. Chad Maynard’s deep patriotism was a family tradition—his father served  in the Marines, and his  brother Jacob returned from his second  tour in Iraq a few months ago.  As a high school student, Chad had  secretly contacted recruiters when he  was 16 about his wish to join the Marines.  His  parents  remember  him  sneaking recruiting brochures into the  house. The recruiters had to ask him to  stop contacting them until he was 18.  But Lance Corporal Maynard was determined  to  serve his  country. He  joined the junior ROTC at Montrose  High School. One of his friends once  quipped,  ‘‘God rested on the seventh  day and on the eighth day made Maynard for the Marines. . . .’’ He worked  hard at his classes so he could graduate  early to go to boot camp. At his 2004  graduation from Montrose High, Chad  Maynard stood proudly in his Marine  Corps dress uniform.  Lance Corporal Maynard’s  friends  and  instructors remember him as a  young man who took his commitment  to his country very seriously. On September 11, Lance Corporal Maynard organized a prayer around the flagpole at  school. He sought out the Marines because he wanted to be on the front  lines, making a difference for his country.  Today in Montrose is the funeral for  Lance Corporal Maynard. Just 1 year  and 6 days after he picked up his diploma, Chad Maynard was taken from  us, a  life of  extraordinary promise  snuffed out all too soon. He served his  Nation with honor and distinction.  LCpl Chad Maynard set an example  for all those around him to follow and  left a positive mark on every life he  touched. Chad’s brave and selfless actions have made the world a better and  safer place for all of us and we owe him  a debt of gratitude which we will never  be able to pay. To his wife Becky and  their soon-to-be-born child, I send my  humble thanks for Chad’s sacrifice on  our behalf. Your family will remain in  my thoughts and prayers.  f  LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT  ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005  ",2005

256,,109,0.278,170,2005-06-20,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker, beginning in Fiscal Year 2001 Congress began providing funds for a vessel time charter for the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to use in addressing the critical  hydrographic survey backlog. The vessel time  charter added a third method of acquiring the  data needed to update and improve the hydrographic  charts  of  our  nation’s waterways.  These charts are essential for our national security, defense and economy. NOAA now uses  (1)  its own hydrographic survey vessels, (2)  data—contracts under the Brooks Act, and (3)  a long-term, multi-year, vessel lease/charter of  a private sector vessel with contract hydrographers.  The long-term vessel lease/charter, is now  completing  its  first year of operation.  I  rise  today to urge NOAA to reprogram funds to extend  the current charter  through  the end of  this calendar year. This extension will allow  enough data  to be gathered  to determine  whether the continued use of the time charter  is cost effective, and competitive with other  methods of acquiring hydrographic data. It will  also keep the contract going long enough to  determine if fiscal year 2006 funds are available for continued long term vessel charters.  To emphasize  the bipartisan  importance of  this issue, I ask that the May 31, 2005, letter  to the NOAA Administrator that my good friend  and colleague, NORMDICKS signed with me,  be entered into the RECORD.  CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  Washington, DC, May 31, 2005.  Vice Admiral CONRADC. LAUTENBACHER, Jr.,  Undersecretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, National Oceanic and Atmospheric, Administration, Herbert Clark Hoover Building,  Washington DC.  DEARADMIRALLAUTENBACHER: As you are  aware, the Nation faces a huge backlog of  critical hydrographic survey work. To reduce  this backlog, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had developed a three-pronged approach. NOAA is  using 1) its own hydrographic survey vessels  and personnel; 2) data acquisition contracts;  and 3) a leased vessel staffed by contract hydrographers.  In fiscal years 2002 through 2005, Congress  provided funding and specific direction to  NOAA  to enter  into a multi-year vessel  lease. After a lengthy bid process, the Military Sealift Command entered into a lease  on NOAA’s behalf that included a base year,  and 4 one-year options. The first year of that  lease will soon end, and unless it is extended  this portion of the hydrographic surveying  initiative will end. The bidders, including  the winning bidder, based their bids on a 5-  year lease period. Therefore, it was very disappointing to learn that NOAA does not intend to exercise even its first annual lease  option, especially since NOAA appears to be  satisfied with the work that has been done  by the leased vessel.  We have requested that the Appropriations  Committee include funding to continue the  vessel lease program in fiscal year 2006. This  will allow NOAA time to acquire and examine cost data on the lease to determine if  vessel leasing is a cost effective method of  acquiring hydrographic data. While this request is pending, we urge you to extend the  vessel lease with the roughly $1.6 million remaining  of  the  amounts  already  appropriated for that purpose. This will hold open  the door to allow NOAA to exercise the first  annual contract option if Congress appropriates vessel lease funds in Fiscal Year 2006.  Both Congress and NOAA deliberated long  and hard before establishing the longterm  vessel lease program as an additional method  to reduce the survey backlog. Given the time  and effort it has taken to get that program  under way, it would be very inefficient for  NOAA to kill the program this year, and  then go through another multi-year contract  bidding process starting next year. Therefore, we urge you to use the remaining funds  to extend the vessel contract.  Thank you for your expeditious consideration of this request. We look forward to  your prompt response.  Sincerely,  DONYOUNG,  Congressman  Alaska.  for All  NORMAND. DICKS,  Member of Congress.  f  CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF GARY JOB CORPS  IN  SAN MARCOS, TEXAS  HON.

261,House,109,0.299,45,2005-06-27,Mr. OSBORNE.," Mr. Speaker, there  has been a great deal of debate on this  House floor recently about the war in  Iraq and not so much about Afghanistan, interestingly, but certainly about  Iraq. Some in Congress are clamoring  for us to pull out of Iraq immediately.  Some want a timetable  indicating a  date certain when we will withdraw.  Some say there is no plan concerning  postwar Iraq, no exit strategy. I would  like to address each of these points just  briefly.  Number 1, we promised the Iraqi people that we would not pull out prematurely. Remember that back in the  Gulf War in the early 1990s, we made a  similar promise. We did pull out, and  thousands of Iraqis died. We have had a  very  difficult  time  regaining  their  trust since. I think to this point we  may have regained some of that status  and some of that trust.  A date certain on which we will leave  Iraq will encourage insurgents to hang  on until that date and then intensify  the attacks. I think the date certain of  withdrawal will certainly be  looked  upon by many insurgents as a sign that  they were winning, a sign of victory. I  am sure they would claim victory at  that point.  Also, I think it is important that a  withdrawal without victory will dishonor the memories of those who have  died and  sacrificed, and  I,  for one,  would very much hate to go back and  face some of those parents and some of  those husbands and wives who have  lost soldiers in the war and try to tell  them that basically their son, their  daughter, their husband, or their wife  died for no cause at all. That would be  very, very difficult for them to swallow.  Then I think most of us who have  been overseas, and a great many Members of Congress have, have been to  Iraq and Afghanistan and Kuwait, and  Landstuhl in Germany to the hospital,  and up to Walter Reed, and one thing  that we  found almost universally  is  that our soldiers have tremendous morale. They have a very strong sense of  mission, and they have a real sense of  purpose. Almost to a person the military personnel that I have talked to  would tell you that they absolutely do  not want to leave this thing undone.  They want to make sure there  is a  sense of accomplishment and a sense of  purpose.  Finally, let us address the issue of no  plan, that there is no strategy, no exit  plan at all. We might refer to this  chart here. One year ago, there was one  Iraqi military  battalion  that  was  trained and equipped. Now there are  more than 100 battalions trained and  equipped, and those are reflected over  here on this 75,791 total of Ministry of  Defense forces. Also, in addition, there  are 90,883 policemen and other patrol  and security guards that have been  trained. So it is a total of 170,000 Iraqis  who  are  currently  trained  and  equipped.  I have been to Iraq where I have seen  some of this training occur. I have been  to Amman, Jordan, where a lot of the  police academies are held. So at the  present time we are aiming for 270,000,  and we are most of the way there. We  still have 100,000 to go, and we are  training about 10,000 a month. So that  means in about 10 months we will be at  roughly 270,000.  General Petraeus says there  is no  shortage of volunteers; we have more  people applying for this position than  we have  slots  to  fill  them at  the  present time.

263,House,109,0.338,59,2005-06-27,Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.," I thank  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  DENT) for organizing this discussion tonight. It is vital we take the time to  talk about these important issues, and  I appreciate the gentleman’s efforts to  highlight some of our accomplishments  this evening.  Mr. Speaker, this Congress has done  many good things to help secure our  homeland, some of which we are discussing tonight, but in other areas, we  still have a ways to go.  Take, for example, the issue of border  surveillance. About 2 weeks ago, the  subcommittee I chair held a hearing to  discuss the camera system that monitors our Nation’s northern and southern borders. Known as the Integrated  Surveillance  Intelligence System, or  ISIS, these cameras are a critical link  for helping secure our border.  Unfortunately,  this  system  is not  working as planned. What began as a  program to monitor the border crossing of illegal immigrants, drug trafficker, and even terrorists has morphed  into what one of our witnesses called  ‘‘a major project gone awry.’’  According to a 2004 GSA audit, the  problems go even further. For example,  the  initial  $2 million  contract was  awarded without full competition. Just  1  year  later  that  same  contract  ballooned to over $200 million, again  without full competition, and the problems do not end there.  The GSA audit also reported significant issues relating to the surveillance  system itself: 60-foot poles that were  paid for but never installed; sensitive  equipment that  failed to meet electrical  codes;  an  operations  center  where contractors and government employees did little or no work for over a  year; and not surprisingly, numerous  cost overruns. To top it off, in September 2004, the GSA abruptly ended  the maintenance contract. This left approximately  70 border  sites without  monitoring equipment.  Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. What we have here, plain  and simple,  is a case of gross mismanagement of a multimillion-dollar  contract. This agreement has violated  Federal contracting rules, and it has  wasted taxpayers’ dollars. Worst of all,  it has seriously weakened our Nation’s  border security.  Before DHS spends another $2.5 billion on a replacement system known as  the America’s Shield  Initiative, we  need to first fix the system we have  got. With Federal dollars scarce and  budgets  tight,  it  is vital  that  the  American people know what they are  getting.  Thanks to the work of this Congress  and many of my colleagues here tonight, we are improving the safety of  America’s homeland, but we still have  a ways to go. As we move forward, I  hope we can continue to address these  issues at DHS.  I thank my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle for their support.  ",2005
264,House,109,0.232,66,2005-06-27,Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise this evening to discuss  for the next 45 minutes the most important topic that will allow us to protect the homeland, provide for the security of the American people and our  allies and our troops around the world:  our intelligence.  Last Thursday, Mr. Speaker, I had a  meeting with the very able and distinguished chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence,  the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HOEKSTRA). We discussed many things, one  of which was a source that I had hoped  that we could get some information to  assist us in understanding the threats  in Iraq and the Middle East, and especially in regard to Iran.  I said to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. HOEKSTRA),  I am going to  make a prediction to you. Based on my  source, I said, common wisdom tells us  that the winner of the election in Iran  that will take place on Friday and Saturday  our  time  will  probably  be  Rafsanjani. He is the name that most  pundits have said would be the likely  winner in a two-person runoff against  the more conservative and not well-  known mayor of Tehran. But I said to  the  gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr.  HOEKSTRA), based on  information we  had, the election was not going to be  close; it will be a landslide. But the  conservative mayor of Tehran, a relative unknown, had been anointed by  Ayatollah Homeni in Iran and he would  in fact win the Iranian election.  We all saw the results, Mr. Speaker,  on Saturday night and Sunday morning as, in fact, the mayor of Tehran  won the election with a margin of 62 to  38 percent, an overwhelming landslide.  I raise this issue, Mr. Speaker, because  good intelligence and good information  is the most critical tool that we can  have over the next several years and  decades to protect our homeland.  Mr. Speaker, I rise because information has come to my attention over the  past several months that is very disturbing. I have learned that, in fact,  one of our Federal agencies had,  in  fact,  identified the major New York  cell of Mohamed Atta prior to 9/11; and  I have learned, Mr. Speaker, that in  September of 2000, that Federal agency  actually was prepared to bring the FBI  in and prepared to work with the FBI  to take down the cell that Mohamed  Atta was involved in in New York City,  along with two of the other terrorists.  I have also  learned, Mr. Speaker,  that when that recommendation was  discussed within that Federal agency,  the lawyers in the administration at  that time said, you cannot pursue contact with the FBI against that cell.  Mohamed Atta is in the U.S. on a green  card, and we are fearful of the fallout  from the Waco incident. So we did not  allow that Federal agency to proceed.  Mr. Speaker, what this now means is  that prior to September 11, we had employees of the Federal Government in  one of our agencies who actually identified the Mohamed Atta cell and made  a specific recommendation to act on  that cell, but were denied the ability to  go forward. Obviously, if we had taken  out that cell, 9/11 would not have occurred and, certainly, taking out those  three principal players  in  that cell  would have severely crippled, if not totally stopped, the operation that killed  3,000 people in America.  Tonight, I am going to provide some  background to my colleagues, because I  think this represents a major problem  with our intelligence that needs to be  focused on by the committees of the  House and the Senate, by the leadership of the House and the Senate, by  John Negroponte, the new person assigned by President Bush, and a very  able man, to integrate the 33 classified  systems overseen by the 15 Federal  agencies.  I want to also start off by praising  Porter Goss, the director of the CIA.  Porter served us extremely well in this  body as the chairman of the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence; and  he went over to the CIA with an aggressive agenda to change that agency,  and he has begun that process. We, in  this body, need to rally the American  people to support the efforts brought  forward by Porter Goss and to allow  John Negroponte to undertake perhaps  the most difficult task in protecting  the security of America, a task that  will not be easy, given the history of  our Federal agency system.  Let me take my colleagues back, Mr.  Speaker, to 1999. It was, in fact, the  spring of 1999 when I was first involved  in taking a delegation of 10 Members of  Congress to Vienna with the support of  my  friend  and  colleague,  the  gentleman  from Maryland  (Mr. HOYER),  and with the support of the Clinton  State Department.  b2320  The  11-member  delegation  of  five  Democrats, five Republicans and myself, along with the State Department  employee, traveled to Vienna to meet  with five senior leaders of the Russian  political parties. Our purpose was to  try to reach a framework that could  allow for a peaceful resolution of the  war in Kosovo on the terms that the  U.S. had desired after Ramboullet.  After securing a military plane, my  Russian  friends  told me  they were  bringing a Serb along with them, a  Serb who would be able to understand  what we were talking about and help  us decide and determine whether or not  Milosevic back in Belgrade would accept any  recommendations  that we  would develop. I did not know anything  about the Serb. I knew the Russians.  But I figure I had better ask the CIA  what they knew about this Serb so I  could be better prepared, and to make  sure that the Serb was not a part of the  Milosevic regime, because that would  cause myself and my colleagues to be  in violation of the Hobbs Act because  we were at war with Serbia at that  time.  So I called George Tenet. I said, Director Tenet, can you give me some information about this Serb? His family  is evidently well known.  I need  to  know whether or not he is a part of the  Milosevic regime. I need to know any  other information you can provide to  me because we are going to meet with  him when we travel to Vienna to meet  with the Russian leaders to help provide a beginning of a solution to end  the war in Kosovo.  He called me back the next day and  he gave me a couple of sentences and  said not to worry, he was not a part of  the Milosevic  regime. And he had  strong ties to the Communist Party inside of Moscow and had ties to other  leaders in the Russian Government. It  was not much to go on.  But at the time, Mr. Speaker, I was  chairman of the Defense Research Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. My job was to oversee the funding, approximately $40 billion of defense research money on new systems  and new technologies. And one of the  most  striking  technologies was  the  work being done by the Army’s Information Dominance Center  at Fort  Belvoir, formerly known as the LIWA,  the Land Information Warfare Assessment Center. I had visited the LIWA  several times and was tremendously  impressed with not just the ability to  provide security for our Army classified systems, but I saw a unique approach to doing well beyond that, data  mining, data collaboration, using cutting-edge software tools like Starlight  and Spires, able to do profiling. Having  plussed-up  funding  for  this  facility  after talking to George Tenet, I called  my friends at the Army’s Information  Dominance Center and said, can you do  something for me as a favor, off the  record? And they said sure, Congressman, whatever you like. Would you run  me a profile of this Serb, for the same  reason I had asked the Director of the  CIA. They said, no problem, Congressman; we will get back to you in a few  hours. And they did. They gave me 10  pages  of  information, Mr. Speaker,  about the Serb and his ties. Now, the  information was not vetted but it was  from a number of sources that the Information Dominance Center was able  to pull together very quickly. I used  that information as we traveled to Vienna to understand who we were meeting with. We had those meetings for 2  days and my colleagues, my five Republican and five Democrat colleagues,  worked  aggressively  to  establish  a  framework that would begin the end of  the Kosovo war. In fact, it was historic.  When we returned to Washington several weeks later I was contacted by the  FBI and they said, Congressman, we  would like to debrief you. We would  like you to tell us what you know  about that Serb that you all met in Vienna.  I said, no problem,  I will be  happy to do it Monday afternoon in my  office. The Friday before the Monday,  my D.C. office paged me with a 911  page. When I called them they said,  you have got to call CIA Congressional  Affairs immediately, which I did.

Immediately following the debate,  however, in his haste to keep the proceedings  moving, the Chair called a vote, contradicting  my intention to withdraw my amendment. With  nobody apparently listening, or realizing there  was a vote  in progress—no  ‘‘aye’’ or  ‘‘nay’’  vote was heard—the Chair declared the voice  vote in the negative.  I would like the RECORD to reflect that it was  my intention to withdraw my amendment, because of Chairman REGULA’s commitment to  the Arts  in Education program.  I  trust  that  commitment will not be affected by the procedural error.  f  DEPARTMENTS  OF  LABOR,  HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,  AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED  AGENCIES  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT, 2006  SPEECHOF  HON. DANNY K. DAVIS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  tions offered by President Bush’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, minimizes  the importance of mental health to the well-  being of Americans, and threatens vital efforts  to promote access to mental health services.  Mental health is one of the greatest problems facing our Nation. During any one-year  period, up to 50 million Americans—more than  22 percent—suffer from a clearly diagnosable  mental disorder  involving a degree of  incapacity that interferes with employment, attendance at school or daily  life. Among other  things, mental health affects whether one gets  involved  in substance abuse, commits violence,  follows  through on medical advice,  cares for a child, performs his work, and engages  in healthy behaviors.  In short, one’s  mental health affects almost every aspect of  life.  I believe strongly in the need to support children’s physical and mental health, while respecting  parental  rights. Recognizing  that  early childhood is a critical period for the onset  of emotional and behavioral problems,  the  President’s Commission encouraged organizations that work with children to improve early  identification of children with mental health  needs. Research shows that early detection,  assessment, and connection to treatment and  support helps prevent mental health problems  from worsening. Because more than 52 million  students attend schools in the U.S., the Commission recognized that schools are in a key  position  to  identify mental health problems  early and help  link children  to appropriate  services. The Commission  in no way  recommends mandatory legislation or any effort  to circumvent parental consent to screening.  Quite the opposite, in fact. It repeatedly recommends  that  child-serving  organizations  work with parents to support identification and  treatment efforts.  Like so many disorders, mental illness does  not discriminate and effects every age, ethnic,  and socioeconomic group. Given  its widespread effect on  individuals and society, we  need to put more emphasis on mental health,  not less. I urge my colleagues to vote against  the Paul amendment.  f  DAVID MUELLER OF WESTFIELD,  INDIANA  HON.

DENT  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2005  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 3010) making appropriations for the Departments of Labor,  Health and Human Services, and Education,  and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for other purposes:  ",2005
269,,109,0.243,136,2005-06-27,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my support for the Community Services  Block Grants, and take a moment to highlight  the effect  these grants have on my District.  CSBG funds are used to support the Community Action Committee of  the Lehigh Valley  (CACLV). I have a long history of working with  the CACLV on a wide range of antipoverty initiatives which  include housing, hunger, and  community development, and I have seen the  positive contributions  that CACLV has made  as a result of CSBG funding.  CSBG grants are uniquely effective because  they are locally-controlled and respond to the  particular need of each individual community.  The grants produce a return on investments  and have a sophisticated outcome-based accountability system. In my district, the CACLV  generates over $8 for each CSBG dollar; half  of that leveraged money comes from private  sources which include utilities, banks, churches, foundations, and individuals.  CACLV runs two homeless shelters in my  district—Safe Harbor  in Easton and  the 6th  Street Shelter  in Allentown. These shelters  serve  individuals  and  families with  issues  ranging from drug and alcohol dependence to  mental health. The CACLV also operates Second Harvest Food Bank, distributing about 5  million pounds of donated and government  food to over 170 agencies each year.  CACLV operates three community development subsidiaries  that are conducting entrepreneurial  training and offer micro  loans  to  help create dozens of micro enterprises each  year. These CDC’s operate  two  inner-city  farmers’ markets, offer  cash assistance  to  struggling  neighborhood-based  businesses,  provide residential and commercial facade improvement grants, and youth recreation programs.  Finally, CACLV operates a comprehensive  financial services program  that  teaches dozens of low income families to save money and  buy homes. Additionally,  the CACLV offers  free tax preparation services to over 600 taxpaying households.  Beyond  these  impressive  efforts,  the  CACLV has a record of building partnerships.  It conceived and led a campaign that resulted  in two open space referenda. This project is  set to generate $70 million to create and enhance parks, protect natural areas and preserve farms. The CACLV’s housing initiatives  have  led campaigns  to create housing  trust  funds in two counties in my district, and funded programs that have dramatically expanded  homeowners hip throughout the Lehigh Valley.  The funding reductions included in this bill  will greatly impact CACLV and Community Action Agencies across the country. The Executive Director of CACLV expects that a cut in  excess of 50 percent will result in the closing  of one of its homeless shelters and all of its  small business development work and perhaps even more.  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that my district and  the nation need the services that Community  Action agencies provide. Although  I understand  the  tight budget constraints we  face,  these programs will stimulate  the economy  and improve the quality of life for the residents  of my district. As the appropriations process  advances, I would like to express my support  for funding levels equal to the final FY 2005  appropriations for CSBG.  f  REGARDING MEETING WITH  GENERAL LLOYD W.

272,Senate,109,-0.296,71,2005-07-11,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor a community in North  Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 2, the residents of  Dawson, ND,  gathered  to  celebrate  their community’s history and founding.  Dawson is a small town in south central North Dakota with a population of  approximately  75. Despite  its  small  size, Dawson holds an important place  in North Dakota’s history. The Sibley  Expedition helped begin the settlement  of this area, but it was the railroad’s  expansion  that was  responsible  for  Dawson’s birth. J. Dawson Thompson,  along with Fredrick D. Hager and Robert E. Wallace established the city of  Dawson in 1880. This town started with  a windmill and a water tower and later  developed into an important city. As a  railroad center, it was responsible for  welcoming early settlers.  As the first established city of Kidder  County, Dawson has experienced many  changes over the years. Today, Mayor  Rand Loveness leads this great city.  Known for its excellent hunting and  fishing, Dawson attracts a wide variety  of sportsmen. Although small in size,  Dawson has found ways to touch the  lives  of many  people. Dawson  has  served thousands of children and adults  through Camp Grassick. This  camp  specializes in giving people with disabilities and special needs a wonderful  summer  camp  experience. The Veterans Memorial Wall in Dawson is another example of how this town has  given back to its community. This wall  honors 1,010 veterans serving from the  Crimean War to the gulf war.  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in  congratulating Dawson, ND, and  its  residents on their first 125 years and in  wishing them well through the next  century. By honoring Dawson and all  the other historic small towns of North  Dakota, we keep the pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations.  It is places such as Dawson that have  helped to shape this country into what  it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.  Dawson has a proud past and a bright  future.∑  f  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF LANKIN,  NORTH DAKOTA  ∑",2005
273,,109,-0.33,183,2005-07-11,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to an outstanding representative from the  1st District of the great State of Washington,  Frank Maziarski, CRNA, MS, CLNC. Mr.  Maziarski will soon complete his year as national president of the American Association of  Nurse Anesthetists (AANA). I am very pleased  that this son of Washington was tapped as the  2004–2005 president of  this prestigious national organization, and I am honored to count  him as one of my constituents.  The AANA is the professional organization  that represents more  than 33,000 practicing  Certified  Registered  Nurse  Anesthetists  (CRNAs). Founded in 1931, the AANA is the  professional association representing CRNAs  nationwide. As you may know, CRNAs are anesthesia professionals who administer approximately 65 percent of all anesthetics given to  patients each year in the United States. They  work in every setting in which anesthesia is  delivered including hospital surgical suites and  obstetrical delivery rooms, ambulatory surgical  centers, and the offices of dentists, podiatrists,  and plastic surgeons.  CRNAs provide anesthesia for all types of  surgical cases and,  in some states, are  the  sole anesthesia providers in approximately 70  percent of all rural hospitals, affording these  medical facilities obstetrical, surgical and trauma stabilization services.  Mr. Maziarski earned his Master of Science  (MS) degree and his Bachelors of Science degree in nursing (BSN) from the University of  Nebraska at Omaha. He was educated in the  art and science of Nurse Anesthesia at the Albany Medical Center, School of Nurse Anesthesia, Albany, NY. He spent 21 years as an  officer in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps, first as  an anesthesia provider and then as an educator  in  the  Academy  of Health  Sciences  Schools of Nurse Anesthesia and was a Director of the Phase I (clinical) and also a Director  of Phase II (academic) portions of the Nurse  Anesthesia programs. He retired as a Lieutenant Colonel at Beaumont Army Medical Center, El Paso, Texas. He also spent one year  as Chief Nurse Anesthetist of the 93rd Evac.  Hospital, in Long Binh, Viet Nam during July,  1968–July, 1969. He is currently a practicing  nurse anesthetist and owner of Allied Anesthesia Associates, which provides anesthesia  services in and around the Shoreline, Washington area, in my congressional district.  Mr. Maziarski has held various  leadership  positions  in  the AANA as President-Elect,  Vice-President, and Regional Director before  becoming the National President of the AANA  in 2004. In addition, Frank has served terms  as President, President-Elect, Vice-President,  Treasurer, and as a Member of the Board of  Directors  for  the Washington Association of  Nurse Anesthetists (WANA). He was also appointed by Governor Gary Locke to the Washington State Nursing Care Quality Assurance  Commission from 1997–2004 and was elected  as its chair twice during his tenure.  Adding to his professional accomplishments,  Mr. Maziarski has been recognized  for both  publishing and speaking on anesthesia-related  topics over the years. He has taken his experience and knowledge from the workplace and  AANA leadership roles to lecture on political  and academic anesthesia related topics before  different professional groups. During his AANA  Presidency, Mr. Maziarski has played important  roles  in advocating  for  the practice of  nurse anesthesia and its patients before Medicare and other Federal agencies, promoted  anesthesia patient  safety  through  vigorous  participation  in  the  interdisciplinary National  Quality Forum (NQF), and advanced principles  of wellness among practitioners in this highstress profession. In addition, Mr. Maziarski directed that the AANA be represented before  three key subcommittees of this Congress, in  which members of  this organization  testified  about the importance of nurse anesthesia education, the roles and contributions of CRNAs  in the Veterans’ Affairs health system, and the  dedication with which CRNAs have provided  safe anesthesia care to members of the U.S.  Armed Forces at home and abroad.  It  is my  understanding  that  under Mr.  Maziarski’s leadership, the AANA continued to  foster an important line of communication with  the American Society  of Anesthesiologists  (ASA). While  these organizations of anesthesia professionals have not always seen  eye-to-eye, both the AANA and ASA are working to ensure the safe administration of powerful anesthesia drugs, and have shared interest  in patients’ safe access  to anesthesia care  with respect to Medicare regulations governing  locked anesthesia carts. These two societies’  professional working  relationship may  not  have been possible without the continued initiative of AANA President Maziarski and his  ASA counterpart.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  today  in  recognizing Mr. Frank Maziarski,  CRNA, MS, CLNC, for his notable career and  outstanding achievements. f  TRIBUTE TO ELISSA  GIAMBASTIANI  HON.

274,,109,-0.556,183,2005-07-11,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Elissa Giambastiani who is retiring after  18 years as President and CEO of the San  Rafael, California, Chamber of Commerce.  Under Elissa’s dynamic leadership, the Chamber has successfully promoted not only the immediate needs of  local businesses but also  the long-term economic interests of the community.  As an advocate for workforce housing and  transportation  infrastructure  improvements,  Elissa has been in the forefront of efforts to  establish a housing trust and to pass a transportation sales  tax. Her expertise  is widely  recognized, and she was recently  invited  to  speak at a National Workforce Housing summit in Arlington, Virginia, on ‘‘Fostering Community Acceptance of Affordable and Workforce Housing.’’  Born  and  raised  in Minnesota,  Elissa  worked there as a teacher before taking a job  with the Army teaching in Europe. After her return, she moved to San Francisco where she  worked  in an architect’s office and met her  husband Ron Giambastiani who worked in the  same office and lived in San Rafael. She also  worked as public relations consultant before  joining the Chamber in 1987.  As President, Elissa developed and implemented the overall program for an organization with over 950 members. She also took the  lead in tracking and advocating the business  viewpoint on  legislation,  including an  instrumental role in the formation of the Alliance of  North Bay Chambers to increase clout. This  function  lead  to  the San Rafael Chamber  earning an Advocacy Chamber of  the Year  Award, one of the first winners in this category  which was created by the California Chamber  of Commerce in 2003.  Elissa has also won an award from Western  Association of Chamber Executives for management excellence and an Accredited Chamber  Executive  designation  from  the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce. Locally, she  is a  member of the League of Women Voters, the  Ecumenical Association for Housing, and the  San Rafael Rotary.  Mr. Speaker, ‘‘tenacious’’ and ‘‘tireless’’ are  appropriate words frequently used to describe  Elissa Giambastiani. I would add ‘‘clear-sighted, passionate, and  caring,’’ all adjectives  which do  justice  to her effectiveness as a  leader in of the San Rafael community. I wish  her luck in her new pursuits of piano playing,  Japanese flower arranging, Italian study, public  relations  consulting  as  well  as  grandmothering.

275,,109,0.348,190,2005-07-11,Mr. CALVERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor and pay tribute to Linda Graham Ward,  who retired on June 17,2005 after thirty three  years as a teacher in the Ocean View School  District of Huntington Beach, California.  Linda G. Ward  is a  fantastic  teacher who  truly cares  for her students. She has dedicated her 33 years of teaching to improving  the quality of life of her students by teaching  them Fitness  for Life. Her greatest career  achievements include not only saving the lives  of several students, but teaching students how  to live healthier lives through physical fitness.  She inspired her students to go on to become  Olympians, professional athletes, and  teachers.  Linda was born and  raised  in EI Centro,  California. Her love of learning lead her to the  University of Southern California where she  earned her teaching credential in 1972. That  fall she began her long career with the Ocean  View School District  teaching Physical Education and Science. Her. campus assignments  took her to the Rancho View School, the Vista  View Middle School and the Spring View Middle School. She kept  learning as well and  earned a master’s degree  in kinesiology  in  1973.  At each campus she served as a teacher,  coach  and mentor  to  her  students. She  coached  volleyball, basketball,  track,  cross  country, softball and soccer. She was  the  Mentor Teacher for Ocean View School District Physical Education Program and Developed  and  implemented  the Ocean  View  School District’s Physical Fitness Program for  Grades 6, 7 and 8. Linda went above and beyond the normal teaching role to inspire her  students to live a fit and healthy lifestyle. She  created  the Ocean View School District’s  Physical Fitness Awards Program based on  Olympic Games model to recognize students’  achievements and implemented the California  Fitness  Testing  Program  in Ocean  View  School District.  She made remarkable strides in improving  the health of her students by becoming a CPR  Instructor for the Ocean View School District  and teaching students and employees how to  save lives. Linda also served as Physical Education expert and advisor to Orange County  Grand Jury  investigation regarding childhood  obesity. She also wrote, obtained and expended PEP grant  funds  in  the amount of  $472,000 to implement the SPARK Program  for physical fitness in her district. For her efforts Linda was named the Most Inspirational  Teacher in the Ocean View School District, an  award she certainly deserves.  For over three decades Linda G. Ward has  been educating and motivating the young people of Southern California. She has  indeed  made a positive difference  in  thousands of  lives and earned my many thanks. I wish her  all the best in her future endeavors. f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. TOM COLE  OFOKLAHOMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 11, 2005 ",2005
276,,109,-0.404,190,2005-07-11,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  remember U.S. Army CPL Phillip  Charles Edmundson, of my hometown of Wilson, NC, for serving our country during Operation  Iraqi Freedom. Corporal Edmundson  made  the ultimate sacrifice  for our country  when he died on June 1, 2005 when an improvised explosive device detonated near his  Bradley Fighting Vehicle during combat operations. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion,  9th  Infantry Regiment, 2nd  Infantry Division,  Fort Carson, CO. He was just 22 years old.  Corporal Edmundson was  the  first person  from my community  to die  in combat since  Vietnam. While we are saddened at this great  loss, we are so honored  to claim Corporal  Edmundson as the product of our community.  Corporal Edmundson had re-enlisted while  in Iraq and was scheduled to be promoted to  sergeant. During his funeral service, Corporal  Edmundson was awarded a Bronze Star and  Purple Heart posthumously for his bravery and  dedicated service.  It was my honor  to  represent U.S. Army  CPL Phillip Charles Edmundson and to have  a  friendship  with  his  parents,  Robert  Edmundson and Anne Edmundson. I extend  my deepest  sympathies  to his  family and  friends. He will be deeply missed and his service was greatly appreciated.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit for the  a  poem  by CPL Phillip Charles  Edmundson. RECORD A SOLDIER’SREFLECTIONS  I was that which others did not want to be.  I went where others feared to go  and did what others failed to do.  I asked nothing from those who gave nothing  and reluctantly accepted the thought of eternal loneliness . . .  Should I fail, I have seen the face of terror;  Felt the stinging cold of fear;  and enjoyed the sweet taste of a moment’s  love.  I have cried, pained, and hoped . . .  but most of all, I have lived times others  would say  were best forgotten. At least someday  I will be able to say that I was proud of what  I was . . .  ‘‘A Soldier’’.  —CPL Phillip Charles Edmundson VerDate jul 14 2003  04:12 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A11JY8.043 E11PT1 ",2005
277,,109,0.171,66,2005-07-15,Mr. SIMMONS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  praise  the service and sacrifice of a brave  young soldier  from my district, SPC Christopher Lee Hoskins, who gave his life in the  cause of  freedom and democracy  in  Iraq.  I  also pay tribute to SPC Hoskins’ family, who  raised this fine young man in an environment  of loving care and who supported his decision  to serve his country in uniform in Iraq.  On June 21, Army SPC Christopher Hoskins, of Killingly, Connecticut, was killed  in  Ramadi, Iraq, after his unit came under small  arms fire west of Baghdad. The death of SPC  Hoskins, who was a member of the Army’s 1st  Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade  Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, marked  the 25th death of a Connecticut soldier in the  war in Afghanistan and the Middle East.  SPC Hoskins was 21 years old. He, along  with  so many other  fine  young men and  women from across our Nation, was serving  America and the cause of freedom by fighting  terrorism and helping to bring stability to a part  of the world that for far too long has known  mainly violence and misery.  SPC Hoskins graduated from Killingly High  School  in 2001. He enlisted  in  the Army  in  2003. He had recently re-enlisted for another  four years.  In many ways, SPC Hoskins was typical of  most American youths. His  friends  recalled  that he was generous and polite; he enjoyed  listening  to Metallica; he played chess and  was a member of his high school wrestling  team; he enjoyed painting and he worked the  cameras at school plays.  And  in many ways he was  typical of  the  men and women who preceded him as members of our Nation’s armed forces. This was a  young man who wanted to serve a cause larger than himself.  This was a young man who did not have to  place himself in harm’s way but volunteered to  do so in service to our Nation, our people and  the way of life that we treasure. America is a  better place because of young men like Army  SPC Christopher Hoskins.  We cannot repay the debt we owe Christopher Hoskins; we can only honor him and  his family. And we do.  Memorial Day was set aside as  the day  when Americans  remember  those who  left  their homes, families and jobs to defend our  Nation—and never returned. But our men and  women in uniform defend freedom every day,  and every day there are those who pay the ultimate price for their selflessness. It would be  highly appropriate if we took a moment out of  every day  to honor and remember  the men  and women who stand between America and  those who would do her harm.  Today, July 14, 2005 SPC Hoskins was interred at Arlington National Cemetery overlooking Washington, D.C. with full military honors. He will posthumously  receive a Purple  Heart for his wounds and a Bronze Star for his  valor. SPC Hoskins will rest in good company,  among others who answered the call to duty,  honor and country.  We pray  that  the service and sacrifice of  SPC Hoskins will remind us of the high cost  which is paid by those who love our freedom,  who believe in our democracy and who give  their best to defend the best Nation on Earth.  May God rest his soul. f  FREEDOM FOR ALEJANDRO  GONZA´LEZ RAGA  HON. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 14, 2005 Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to speak about Alejandro  Gonza´lez Raga, a political prisoner  in  totalitarian Cuba.  Mr. Gonza´lez Raga is an independent journalist and a  contributor  to  the Camagu¨ey  Press Agency. As an independent journalist in  a totalitarian Cuba, Mr. Gonza´lez Raga’s truthful articles have helped the world to learn the  facts about the nightmare that is the Castro  regime. Because of his belief in factual reporting, Mr. Gonza´lez Raga relentlessly chronicled  the atrocities committed by Castro’s machinery  of  repression.  I  remind my colleagues  that,  under Castro’s  totalitarian  regime, any  freedom of  the press, any effort  to display  the  atrocities of the regime under the spotlight of  truth, is met with swift and violent repression.  In March, 2003, Mr. Gonza´lez Raga was arrested as part of  the dictatorship’s heinous  crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy activists. According to Reporters Without Borders,  as part of his sham trial, Mr. Gonza´lez Raga  was accused of ‘‘cooperating with the foreign  press,’’ and of  ‘‘systematically endangering  territorial integrity’’ by writing reports on subjects considered ‘‘very sensitive’’ by the dictatorship such as  ‘‘shortages due  to  the economic crisis, relations with other countries, TV  programs, the education budget.’’ He was sentenced to 14 years in Castro’s dungeons for  these ‘‘crimes.’’  Let me be very clear, Mr. Gonza´lez Raga is  currently  languishing  in  the depraved conditions of the totalitarian gulag for his truthful articles. The U.S. State Department describes  the conditions in the gulag as, ‘‘harsh and life  threatening.’’ The State Department also reports that police and prison officials beat, neglect, isolate, and deny medical treatment to  detainees and prisoners. It is a crime of the  highest order  that people are  imprisoned  in  these nightmarish conditions simply for reporting the facts.  Mr. Speaker, it is as inconceivable as it is  unacceptable that, while the world stands by  in  silence  and  acquiescence,  independent  journalists who write the truth about totalitarian  regimes are systematically  tortured. My Colleagues, we must demand the immediate and  unconditional  release of Alejandro Gonza´lez  Raga and every political prisoner in totalitarian  Cuba. f  MONMOUTH  DANSKIN  BIRTHDAY  COUNTY’S  CELEBRATES  BEN  80TH  HON.

Ben Danskin has been a key figure in government service, public advocacy and business development in Monmouth County, New  Jersey  for more  than 50 years. He  is  respected, admired and well-liked by colleagues,  associates and former political rivals. His family and close friends are inspired by his wit,  good nature, character, charisma and kindness.  Born and raised in Spring Lake, New Jersey, Ben and his older brother, Clyde, learned  the importance of public service through their  father’s example. Their  father, Benjamin S.

He served as  the Secretary of the State Division of Tax Appeals, President of the New Jersey Association of Tax Commissioners, and Deputy Director of Taxation, assisting in the creation of the  state  tax equalization program. Government  service would become a family trait.  In September 1943, young Ben Danskin  joined the Army as a Lieutenant and began  training to become a B–25 bomber pilot.

279,House,109,0.202,2,2005-07-25,Mr. FITZPATRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  today  to address  the  issue of  health care insurance in America, its  rising costs and a solution that will  help to reduce the cost for many Americans. Our Nation is in the midst of a  health care crisis. This crisis affects  Pennsylvania’s  health  care  professionals, their patients and the doctor-  patient relationship. This crisis is especially acute in my district in Southeastern Pennsylvania.  Last week I held a small business  committee forum in my district. The  health care crisis and how it affects  small businesses was the topic of the  forum. The gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. MANZULLO) was kind enough to  come to the forum and to apply his  many years of experience to the issue,  and I thank the gentleman for his contribution and for his insights.  Pennsylvania’s health care problems  are among the worst in the Nation.  Doctors in Pennsylvania are faced with  some  of  the  highest medical malpractice insurance rates in the country. Because they cannot afford to pay  for malpractice insurance, many Pennsylvania physicians are practicing defensive medicine or simply shutting  their doors, moving to other states or  retiring. Young doctors establishing a  new practice are reluctant to consider  Pennsylvania because of malpractice  insurance problems.  Over 50 percent of Pennsylvanians  say their family has had difficulty in  paying the cost of health care or obtaining  health  insurance  coverage.  Since 2001, the cost of health insurance  has risen 59 percent, and employers  who offer health care benefits are paying an average of 11 percent more for  health insurance premiums than they  did in 2004. This is the fourth year in a  row of double digit increases with no  end in sight.  From a national perspective, the statistics are staggering. The Labor Department has recently reported that 3.7  million new  jobs were created since  May of 2003, marking 25 consecutive  months of positive job growth for the  U.S. economy. Unfortunately, there are  41 million Americans who are without  health care insurance. Nearly 60 percent of the 41 million uninsured Americans are employed by small businesses  or are dependent on someone who is  employed  by  a  small  business. As  health care costs continue to increase,  fewer employers and working families  will be able to obtain coverage, and the  number of uninsured will  inevitably  rise. For a Nation of the 21st Century,  and  in  a  country  that  boasts  the  world’s  largest and most productive  economy, this is simply unacceptable.  The skyrocketing cost of health care  is making employer-sponsored health  coverage harder and harder for businesses, especially small businesses, to  provide to their employees. This fact  makes it nearly impossible for many  hard working  families to receive affordable care that they need and deserve.

282,House,109,0.518,37,2005-07-25,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  appreciate the gentleman from Colorado’s leadership. The key point, many  of them that he made, was that America’s  agricultural  community  is  so  strongly behind this trade agreement.  There are nearly 70 ag associations  around America who are  supporting  this. In fact, the American Farm Bureau Federation believes that we will  sell almost $1.5 billion more ag products each year to Central America.  That is our beef, that is our chicken,  that is our pork, our corn, our milk,  our potatoes, you name it, at a time  when a lot of the world is closed to  America’s ag products.  b2100  We have got the most productive ag  community in the world; but if we keep  making things cheaper and faster and  better but do not have anyone to sell it  to, the price just goes down. We want  those ‘‘American need not apply’’ signs  to be torn up all throughout this world,  give our ag community a chance to  compete. Watch what we will  sell  around the world.  And we ought to start with Central  America, a neighbor, a proven neighbor, who cannot only buy our goods  and services but is easy to ship to and  in the process we are going to continue  to help those six countries into stronger democracies, a stronger rule of law.  It is truly a win-win situation.  I appreciate the gentleman’s leadership. As a business person, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BEAUPREZ)  knows what small businesses and small  farmers and small communities have  to go through to compete, and giving  them a level playing field is good for  Colorado and good for America as well.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like  to yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. CARTER), who served, before coming to Congress, as a district judge for  more than 2 decades. And his background is just filled with decades of  common sense. He did a great job on  the bench  in Texas. Here  in Washington he has been intent not only on  national  security,  supporting  our  troops, but also in serving on his committee, finding ways to help our American economy grow.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. CARTER).  ",2005
283,House,109,0.467,37,2005-07-25,Mr. CARTER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY),  who clearly has been in the lead and is  outspoken for the CAFTA-Dominican  Republic project, for yielding to me.  This is critical not only to the Central America region but to the United  States of America. We are opening up  trade so that our products get sold in  Central America without duties on our  products.  The Central American countries have  the opportunity to sell in our country,  and they do not have a burden on their  products up here. And, in fact, we are  their number one trading partner. The  expansion, the benefit that we see is  what is going to happen to our folks.  Whenever  I  look at one of  these  things that are coming up in Congress,  I try to take a look at my district and  see who is in my district and try to  learn and study and figure out who is  going to get helped by these things.  And it was easy to see how the high-  tech industry with Dell Computer, one  of our great neighbors in Williamson  County,  it was easy to see what  is  going to happen there. But I look further down  to  that dairy  farmer  in  Stephenville, Texas, in Erath County.  This is not a little dairy farm operation in Erath County. We are talking  about one of the most important parts  of the agriculture industry in Texas.  The area in my district produces over  $40 million to the Texas economy every  year in milk and dairy product production.

285,Senate,109,0.572,72,2005-07-25,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, No. 1506  deals with the mineral rights at Rocky  Flats. This basically will provide for  the Secretary to purchase these mineral rights. There is money that has  been provided for this in previous legislation and that is pending. This allows  for the transfer of those mineral rights  on Rocky Flats. It  is based on the  owner of the mineral rights being willing to sell.  In 2001, I successfully inserted a provision in the National Defense authorization bill that authorized the creation of  the Rocky Flats National  Wildlife Refuge. Under this legislation,  the Department of Energy was required  to transfer most of the Rocky Flats  Environmental Technology Site to the  Department of  Interior  for the purposes of creating a wildlife refuge to  preserve Colorado’s rare Front Range  habitat.  Earlier, 2 months ago, the Departments of Energy and Interior signed a  memorandum  of understanding  that  stipulated how and when the Department of Energy would  transfer  the  management of most of  the Rocky  Flats Environmental Technology Site  to the Department of Interior. However,  this memorandum  of  understanding was incomplete. It completely  deferred the issue of the disruptive surface mining of privately owned mineral  rights that  is occurring on the site  until later this year. This deferral did  not meet the legislation requirement  under the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act and represented a critical  impediment  to  the  closure  of  Rocky Flats.  The Department  of  Interior  contended that surface mining such as  that now occurring at Rocky Flats is  fundamentally contrary to its refuge  management  goals,  and makes  the  achievement  of  refuge  purposes  on  those lands impossible.  To better understand this issue, I requested that the Department of Energy  hire an independent contractor to conduct an appraisal on the value of the  mineral rights. The independent contractor determined the owners and provided a preliminary cost estimate as to  the fair market value of those mineral  rights containing sand and gravel.  After the appraisal was completed,  my  staff personally  contacted  each  mineral rights owner. I wanted to see if  they would be interested in selling if  they were offered money for the fair  market value of the mineral rights. I  also reassured them that the owners  would not be  forced to sell  if they  didn’t want to.  Shortly thereafter, it was brought to  my attention that the purchase of mineral rights could be included as part of  a comprehensive natural resource damage settlement. I am pleased to announce that the State of Colorado, my  colleague  from  Colorado,  Senator  SALAZAR, and I have worked out legislation providing for such an arrangement. I am confidant that this arrangement will be acceptable to the Department of Energy and the Department of  Interior.  Under the amendment I am  introducing today, the Secretary of Energy  will be required to purchase essential  mineral rights necessary to transition  Rocky Flats to a national wildlife refuge.  The Secretary  can  only  purchase  these mineral rights once the following  conditions are met: (1) The owner of  the minieral right is a willing seller;  (2) the Secretary purchases the mineral  right at fair market value; and (3) the  Trustees for Rocky Flats release the  Department from its natural resource  damage  liabilities  under  the  Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation, and Liability Act of  1980, CERCLA.  Also included in this legislation is a  provision that states that if the owner  of the mineral right refuses to sell, the  Secretary of Energy may satisfy the  Department’s natural resource liability  obligation by paying the trustees of  the site an amount equal to the fair  market value of  the mineral  right  owned by the unwilling seller.  I believe this amendment makes too  much sense for us to pass up. We have  winners, winners, and winners. It  is  certainly a win for the State of Colorado—the State mechanism that would  provide more dollars for Colorado than  most  likely would have been gained  through the normal natural resources  damages settlement process. The owners of the mineral rights win because  they now have an opportunity to sell  their mineral rights at  fair market  value, a possibility that never existed  before. The Department of Energy wins  because it is able to pay off its natural  resource damage liabilities that would  have arisen under the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. The Department of Interior wins because this  legislation would remove the last impediment to the memorandum of understanding between Interior and the  Department of Energy so that Interior  can move forward with creating a wildlife refuge at Rocky Flats. Most importantly, the people of Colorado win because now they will be able to enjoy  the pristine beauty and splendor of the  Rocky  Mountain’s  Front  Range  through  the Rocky Flats National  Wildlife Refuge. Hundreds of acres of  rare xeric tallgrass prairie will be preserved. The natural wildlife in the refuge will be protected.  As I said, this is a win-win proposal.  Everyone gains. I urge my colleagues  to support my amendment.  AMENDMENTNO. 1492  I rise in opposition to the Levin missile defense amendment. This amendment eliminates $30 million—there has  been $50 million requested—for  long-  lead  funding  for ground-based  interceptor missiles 31–40 and $20 million for  associated silo construction. The $50  million would be used to plus-up the  Cooperative Threat Reduction Program  which is already fully funded at $415.5  million, with an additional $1.6 billion  for DOE nonproliferation programs.

Andrew Wojtanik,  of Overland Park, KS, won gold for the  2004 National Geographic Bee, and has  also published a book, called Afghanistan to Zimbabwe: Country Facts that  Helped Me Win  the National Geographic Bee.  Then 14-year old-Andrew was among  three young Americans  to  compete  against over 5 million students from all  over the world. In preparation for the 5  day world championship, Andrew compiled a 432-page study guide with information on 193 countries around the  world. After Andrew’s guide was published by National Geographic Society,  he was congratulated by the United  States Congress on the  floor of the  House of Representatives. The House  passed House Resolution 815 in honor of  Andrew as the champion of the National Geographic World Championship.  Andrew Wojtanik’s  recognition  for  the Geographic Bee is well deserved.  His commitment to understanding the  world helped America defend its championship title in the 2004 National Geographic Bee.  Today, I join the United States Congress in recognizing and paying tribute  to this extraordinary young American.  Andrew Wojtanik is a true champion,  and I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing this young man for his outstanding achievement in the 2004 National Geographic World Championship.∑  f  125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  TURNER COUNTY FAIR  ∑",2005
288,Senate,109,-0.25,107,2005-07-25,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, today  I wish to honor and publicly recognize  the 125th anniversary of the Turner  County Fair. From August 14 through  August 18, 2005, the citizens of Turner  County will gather in Parker, SD, to  celebrate their proud past as well as  their hope for a promising future.  The Turner County Fair is South Dakota’s oldest fair, first organized by  the Turner County Agricultural Society and held on October 13 and 14 of  1880.  Since then, the fair has grown into a  major event. This year, more  than  65,000 people are expected to visit during  the  4  days  of  festivities,  and  fairgoers will be treated to a rich variety of entertainment. Scheduled activities include a parade, races, concerts, a  carnival, a livestock show, and a rodeo.  The fair will end with a fireworks display  that  the  local newspaper,  the  Southeast Trumpet, has advertised as  ‘‘bigger and better than ever.’’  I would especially like to recognize  the Turner County 4–H Club for their  part in this event. Turner County 4–H  has played a leading role in the fair for  the last 103 years and will figure prominently again this year. The local Jaycees Club, fire department, and a number of other community organizations  also deserve recognition for their participation in organizing and producing  this event.  For  125 years,  the Turner County  Fair has brought citizens together to  celebrate their heritage, their communities, and their shared hopes. It is indeed a privilege for me to officially recognize its anniversary today, and to  wish the citizens of Turner County another 125 years of prosperity and happiness.∑  f  JUNKO CUSHMAN  ∑",2005
289,,109,0.284,184,2005-07-25,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  share with my colleagues the attached statement by our former colleague Tony Hall, who  now serves as U.S. ambassador to the World  Food Programme. Ambassador Hall  is concerned about the future of world food aid in  light of current negotiations at the World Trade  Organization.  In  the past year,  the world has been  broadsided  by  tragedy. Mother  Nature  wreaked havoc in Indonesia, destroying lives  and impairing the ability of tens of thousands of survivors to  feed themselves. In  Darfur, the constant need for food aid will  not subside until people can safely return to  their homes and begin to plant seeds. Ethiopia has once again found itself on the brink  of famine. There, the causes are complex, but  the need is simple. Food aid is helping Ethiopians stay alive.  I want to discuss another looming tragedy.  But we can prevent this one. I’m talking  about negotiations happening right now in  Geneva at the World Trade Organization.  Some European members of the WTO are  working to eliminate most in-kind food donations to humanitarian situations. There is  a belief among some countries that the best  way to insure minimal impact is to move to  a cash only system for donations.  The U.S. is adamantly opposed to any proposal that would RESTRICT and therefore  REDUCE the amount of donations to the  world’s hungry. There are 850 million people  who don’t have enough food to eat. And yet  we are reaching only about 100 million of  them with assistance. We need to be increasing our volumes of food aid worldwide but  some of the wealthy WTO member states are  pushing positions that will inevitably cut  food aid back.  Eliminating in-kind assistance results in  smaller amounts of food aid to the hungry of  the world. For example, WFP’S own research  found  ‘‘a clear decline in European Union  food aid after the EC and other European  member nations moved  from  in-kind  to  cash.’’  It is inconceivable to me that a group of  our colleagues meeting in Geneva would put  already fragile lives at risk. Why is this conversation even happening, considering the  humanitarian  emergencies  in  the world  today?  The U.S. has given $1.6 billion in 2005—  that’s half of total food aid—and emergency  needs are still not being met.  The WTO should not be even be discussing  food aid reform. FAO and WFP are the experts. The discussions of improving food aid  ",2005

One of  the world ’s most grueling athletic  events,  this year ’s Tour de France bicycling  race covered 2,254 miles in 21 days.  Aside  from his many victories as a racer,  Lance Armstrong has become a household  name, vital to the promotion of cycling as a  sport, a healthy fitness activity, and a pollution-free transportation alternative. These athletic accomplishments are even more dramatic  considering his successful battle against widespread cancer. Lance has become a  role  model  to  cancer  patients  and  his  efforts  through the Lance Armstrong Foundation have  helped to advance cancer research, diagnosis,  treatment, and after-treatment services.  The resolution being introduced today is a  deserving tribute to Lance Armstrong and his  Tour de France victory, commitment to cancer  awareness and survivorship, and promotion of  bicycling.  f  IN MEMORY OF COLONEL BENNIE  HOWARD MANN  HON.

291,,109,0.54,191,2005-07-25,Mr. COX.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to a distinguished constituent of mine,  Colonel Bennie Mann of Laguna Woods, California. Bennie Mann’s recent passing follows  an inspiring, 31-year career as one of the finest  helicopter  pilots  in  the United States  Armed Forces.  Bennie was born in Yuma, Arizona, on May  31, 1928, to Mr. and Mrs. Bennie H. Mann, Sr.  After Colonel Mann graduated  from Yuma  Union High School in 1946, he attended Arizona State University at Tempe. He joined the  Navy in 1950, traveling to Korea aboard the  U.S.S. Essex. He was selected for the Aviation Cadet Program  the  following year, and  was commissioned a second lieutenant in the  U.S. Marine Corps in 1953.  Following a second  tour of duty  in Korea  and an assignment to instructor duty with the  training command at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, Bennie was  transferred  to  the  Marine Corps Air Station  in Cherry Point,  North Carolina. In 1960, he was ordered to the  Second Marine Division, Camp Lejuene, North  Carolina, for duty with the Force Communications Company.  Bennie, then a captain, received a military  science degree from the University of Omaha.  After attending the Junior Officers’ Course at  Quantico, Virginia, in 1962, Mann became a  helicopter pilot based in Santa Ana, California.  In December 1964, then-Major Mann departed  for Vietnam, serving as operations officer and  executive officer of Marine Medium Helicopter  Squadron 163 before moving to Washington,  DC, to serve in the policy analysis and career  planning branches of the Marine Corps headquarters.  Mann  returned  to Vietnam  in December  1969, serving as commanding officer of HMM–  161 and as executive officer of MAG–16. After  a year in Vietnam, he returned to Santa Ana,  where he remained until 1972. In due course,  Mann’s leadership was rewarded with a promotion  to  the  rank of colonel. He  then  received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University and  joined  the 3rd Marine Aircraft  Wing, serving as assistant chief of staff before  assuming command of MAG –16  in 1977.  In  June 1978, Colonel Mann became chief of  staff of  the Third Marine Amphibious Force,  Okinawa, Japan.  Colonel Mann retired from the United States  Marine Corps on December 23, 1981. He was  the first Marine helicopter pilot in our Nation’s  history to be awarded the Navy Cross. Colonel  Mann was the deserving recipient of a host of  other awards, including the Distinguished Flying Cross,  the Bronze Star,  the Meritorious  Service Medal, and 37 Air Medals. Colonel  Mann recently passed away, and was buried  at Arlington National Cemetery on July 7. He  is survived by his wife Carroll of Laguna  Woods, California, his sons George and Russ,  his daughter Connie Lee Coln, his nine grandchildren, and his six great-grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the California delegation and the people of Orange County, I  am honored  to salute Colonel Mann  for his  service to this great country and to extend my  condolences to his friends and family.  f  USA  PATRIOT  AND  TERRORISM  PREVENTION REAUTHORIZATION  ACT OF 2005  SPEECHOF  HON.

292,House,109,-0.263,9,2005-07-29,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  the conference report for H.R. 3, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005. I want to acknowledge  the work of  the Transportation Committee on  this complex bill and especially  thank my  friend and  colleague  from Wisconsin, Mr. PETRI,  for his  leadership on  the  legislation; the Wisconsin delegation is lucky  to have such a strong advocate for our citizens.  H.R. 3  is a significant economic development and job creation bill, and now is certainly  the time that we need more jobs throughout  the country. I consistently hear from constituents who are searching  for work; who have  sent out dozens of resumes and updated their  skills but remain unemployed. Each billion dollars spent on highway funding creates not only  safer and better roads, but it also creates an  estimated 47,500 news jobs. An investment in  highway funding is an investment for steady  work for those in Wisconsin and around the  nation.  In addition, I am pleased that the bill recognizes the importance of funding crucial highways and bridges in Wisconsin’s Third Congressional District. Specifically, the inclusion of  funding  for  the Stillwater Bridge, which connects Houlton, Wisconsin, and Stillwater, Minnesota,  is great news  for  those of us who  have been working on this project for years.  The bridge is only one example of an important project that will provide our citizens with  safer  roads, shorter commutes, and better  jobs.  Furthermore, I would like to recognize the  important conservation provisions that are included in H.R. 3. As a hunter and fisherman,  I am particularly pleased with a provision  which  recaptures  the  final 4.8 cents of  the  18.3 cents per gallon  tax on motorboat  fuel  and directs  it back  into  the Federal Aid  in  Sport  Fish Restoration Act’s Aquatic Resources Trust Fund (ARTF). This full recovery  of the motorboat fuel excise tax will provide  about $110 million a year  for  recreational  trails, new funding for signage identifying access for anglers and hunters, and vital safety  programs dealing with wildlife-vehicle  collisions. These important provisions make H.R.  3 the most comprehensive transportation bill  for sportsmen ever created.  I am proud  to have served on  the conference committee to help reconcile this bill so  it could reach  the House and Senate  for a  final vote. Moreover, I would like to thank Senators KOHLand FEINGOLD for all the work they  have done with this bill to make sure that it  benefits the citizens of Wisconsin. The long-  awaited passage of this bill is great news for  western Wisconsin.  I urge my colleagues  to  support the bill.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  commend Chairman YOUNG and  Ranking Member OBERSTAR, as well as  the  Subcommittee leadership for their hard work in  crafting  the underlying  legislation.  I consider  the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure and the appointed Conferees for this  bill to be a ‘‘club’’ of sorts, and it is in that vein  that I commend them for the tremendous job  appropriate funding for surface transportation  projects and environmental mitigation projects  of importance to every congressional district.

293,House,109,0.593,30,2005-07-29,Mr. POE.," The gentleman from Georgia is exactly correct. I know a lot of  police officers. Some  rookies,  some  have been around, some have retired.  They do it for the reason that they  want to help the community protect  the neighborhoods and enforce the rule  of law. They, too, are frustrated about  these sanctuary laws throughout the  United States that basically give them  a hands-off  policy  in  dealing with  illegals. They want to work with the  Federal authorities. Of  course  they  know the consequences of enforcing the  law. Some of them have been threatened with being terminated if they arrest people who have been illegally in  the United States for no other purpose.  ",2005
294,House,109,0.533,30,2005-07-29,Mr. NORWOOD.," If the gentleman will  yield one more time, part of the problem of this is that groups like La Raza  and others make it their business to  try to sue cities, county commissions,  law enforcement when they do enforce  Federal law because the present law is  just written in such a way that they  can get away with some of that. Does  that deter a city like Houston, Texas,  from encouraging its law enforcement  officials to help obey the law, help enforce the law, or is that why they are  saying to their officials, Hey, don’t  help anything with this. We may get  sued?  ",2005
295,Senate,109,-0.199,128,2005-07-29,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of the highway bill conference  report. This legislation is 2 years overdue, and I am pleased that we are finally  completing  this  very  critical  piece of legislation.  I would  like  to  Senators  thank  INHOFE, BOND, JEFFORDS, BAUCUS, and  LOTT their staffs for their very hard work on  this bill and commend them for the bipartisan way in which they have proceeded.  I would also like to thank Senator  and Senator INOUYE, the chairman and co chairman of the Commerce  Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine, for their  work on the safety portions of this bill,  as well as Senator STEVENS, the chair  of the full Commerce Committee. I was  proud to have worked on these very important motor carrier and passenger  safety provisions.  I have addressed  this body before  with my concerns about the need for a  highway bill.  In America over one-third of our  major roads are both deteriorating and  congested. In Arkansas, 47 percent of  our roads are in poor or mediocre condition—almost half. Additionally, over  one in four bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.  The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that close to 42,800  persons died in car crashes in 2004. Over  2,000 Arkansans have died on our highways over the past several years. Too  many families die on our highways—  plain and simple.  The amount of freight expected to  travel on our Nation’s highways over  the next 20 years is expected to double.  Not only do we need to improve the existing system, we feed to increase the  capacity of the system.  This bill would decrease congestion  on American roads and enable businesses  to  transport  their materials  across  the United States  safely.  It  would also spur economic development  and create many jobs for hard-working  Americans.  The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that for every $1 billion of investment in our highways, we  create 47,500 jobs annually. This bill  provides a record amount of  investment  in our Nation’s highways and  interstates, over $286 billion.  But we still have much work to do.  We must continue  to make  investments in infrastructure, and we must  work toward finding creative solutions  to our transportation problems. After  all, good schools, good health care, and  good jobs don’t mean much if you can’t  get there.  I am pleased this bill provides funding  increases that could be used to  make substantial progress on important economic development projects in  my State and around the country. With  passage of this bill, Arkansas would be  able to make progress on many critical  projects such as the Northeast Arkansas Connector,  the Caraway Bridge  Overpass, the Interstate 430/630 Interchange Modification, the Perry Road  Overpass, and the Hot Springs East-  West Arterial,  just  to name a  few.  These projects will greatly enhance the  capacity and safety of Arkansas roadways.  This bill also enables Arkansas to  make significant progress on our two  large corridors, I–49 and I–69, that, if  completed, would help generate economic expansion, add jobs, and provide  isolated areas with transportation options. I am pleased this bill provides  $75 million for the I–69 Corridor, including the Great River Bridge which  serves as a ‘‘Bridge Across the Delta.’’  It provides $72 million for the I–69 Connector, which will enable the northern  part of the State to access I–69. 1 am  also pleased that this bill provides $37  million for the I–49 Bella Vista Bypass  and several other projects that will reduce congestion and allow for further  economic  development  in northwest  Arkansas, one of the top 10  fastest  growing areas in America.  This is a wise investment that will  pay for itself by fostering interstate  commerce, bolstering tourism, and creating jobs.  Mr. President, this is a good bill. It is  a long overdue bill. It is a bipartisan  bill. My constituents support it, I support it, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",2005

Delegate Louderback  has  been  a  strong advocate for lower taxes in Virginia, serving as the ranking majority  member of the House Finance Committee, and as the chairman of both  the House Subcommittee on Sales Tax  Exemptions and the Subcommittee on  Tax Preferences. From 2001 to 2003, he  also served on the Joint Subcommittee  to Reform Commonwealth Tax Structure.  In  addition, Delegate Louderback  served on the Agriculture, Chesapeake  and Natural Resources  Committee,  where he chaired the Chesapeake Subcommittee, and sat on the House Committee on Militia, Police and Public  Safety. In 2002, he was named Legislator of the Year for the 140-member  Virginia General Assembly  by  the  Family Foundation. And in 2003, Allen  was awarded the same honor by the  Commissioners  of Revenue Association. Delegate Louderback  is also a  member of the Commonwealth Competition Council, the State Procurement Commission, and the State Water  Commission, where he chairs the Karst  Subcommittee.  Prior to his small business entrepreneurship and public service in Luray,  VA, Allen worked in Washington, DC,  as an investigator and manager for the  U.S. General Accounting Office for 18  years. As a manager at GAO, he was  the recipient of the Director’s Award  for his ‘‘outstanding managerial skills’’  in 1979.  Delegate Louderback earned his B.S.  from Virginia Polytechnic  Institute  and State University. He  is a past  president of the Luray Rotary Club and  the Luray Kiwanis Club. His wife,  Nadia, and two sons attend Leaksville  United Church of Christ.  The 15th District, and indeed all of  Virginia, will surely miss the leadership and talents that Delegate Allen  Louderback displayed in the Virginia  General Assembly. I would like to recognize and thank Allen for his commitment to bettering the Commonwealth  of Virginia. I congratulate him on his  retirement and wish him many more  years of success and happiness.∑  f  RECOGNIZING MAYOR RALPH H.  DEAN  ∑",2005
297,Senate,109,-0.318,198,2005-07-29,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, today I  introduce  legislation  that will  safeguard and promote specialty crops and  value-added agriculture in Oregon and  in the United States. The great farmers  and ranchers of Oregon produce over  200 commodities. This bill intends to  improve  their marketing  opportunities, help Oregon  farmers and processors get better prices for their products, and help Oregon  farmers and  processors compete in an increasingly  global market. As it will help Oregon  farmers so it will help specialty crop  farmers  from New York to Florida,  Wisconsin to California.  I introduce this bill as my colleague  from Oregon, Congresswoman HOOLEY,  introduces the same bill in the House  of Representatives.  In  the  increasingly  technological  world of microchips, products like potato chips and other agricultural commodities still remain a large part of  Oregon’s economy. In fact, agriculture  is Oregon’s second largest traded sector  and Oregon’s second largest export, behind the electronics industry. Oregon  agriculture creates more than $8 billion of direct and indirect economic activity, in both urban and rural areas in  the state.  At the center of this bill is the expansion of a specialty crop grant program, authorized by Congress in 2001,  of which Oregon producers have already made use. Oregon received about  $3.2 million that was used for over 50  projects  involving  product  development, marketing, research, and export  promotion. The Oregon Department of  Agriculture estimates that over 3000  producers  benefited  from  these  projects. They also estimate that enhanced  sales  resulting  from  these  projects reached $20 million—about six  times what was invested.  The problem with this pilot program  was  the grants were only available  once. Last year Congress passed legislation that reinstated these specialty  crop grants but at funding level that  would provide only around $500,000 to  Oregon. This legislation raises the authorized  level  to  $500 million  and  makes the grant program permanent.  Under this expansion Oregon has the  potential to receive $5 million a year in  specialty crop grants.  The bill I am introducing today also  improves USDA’s value added grant  program. Right now this program is  run by bureaucrats in Washington, DC  who have probably never been to Oregon and probably couldn’t name the  top Oregon specialty crops. My office  has heard numerous complaints that  this program is unwieldy, bureaucratic,  and difficult to navigate. Last year  every applicant from Oregon was disqualified on a technicality. This bill  would make one simple but very important change: instead of having the  Federal Government  distribute  the  money, each State would get a share of  the money to hand out to their chosen  priorities.  Between these two grant programs  each State in the union should have  plenty of money to implement agricultural promotion strategies that match  the needs of  its  individual growers,  processors, and citizens.  This bill also authorizes  funds  for  farmers and processors to become ‘‘certified.’’ Certification comes  in many  forms  like  ‘‘Good Agricultural Practices,’’ ‘‘Good Handling Practices,’’ or  ‘‘Organic.’’ Often getting certified  is  necessary before farmers or processors  can effectively market products whether in local grocery stores or to foreign  countries.  Certified  products  often  fetch premium prices. To encourage  farmers to get these certifications and  increase their market share this legislation would have the USDA reimburse  half the cost of the certifications.  Last, this legislation improves opportunities for specialty crop farmers to  get crop insurance, increase loan availability, provide additional funding for  export promotion, and make sure that  American trade policy takes specialty  crops into account.  I know that Oregonians doing a great  job growing some of the best quality  crops in the world. There are a lot of  challenges  facing  agriculture:  cheap  imports,  low commodity prices, taxation, labor, and dozens of others. This  bill won’t solve everything, but I think  it will make an important contribution  to  improving Oregon agriculture by  making it more competitive on a global level and helping farmers get a decent price  for what they produce. I  look forward to working with my colleagues to assure the enactment of this  legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 1556  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

298,Senate,109,-0.435,205,2005-07-29,Mr. SARBANES.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation to  facilitate the orderly disposition of an  800 acre parcel of Federal property located in Laurel, Maryland, a portion of  which is currently used by the District  of Columbia as the Oak Hills Juvenile  Detention  and Commitment Center.  The legislation is a companion to a  measure which has been introduced in  the House by Representative BENJAMIN  CARDIN.  The Oak Hill Youth Center, located  adjacent  to  the National  Security  Agency and the Baltimore-Washington  parkway, is a detention facility for juvenile offenders from the District of  Columbia between the ages of 12 and 21.  It has been plagued by  facility and  management problems for many years.  The buildings at the center are in deplorable condition and  fail  to meet  health  and  safety  standards. Overcrowding, mismanagement,  escapes,  drug use and abuse of detainees at the  center have been the subject of numerous  investigations, press reports and  lawsuits over the years, and are of  great concern to juvenile justice advocates, families of detainees and local  residents, alike. Nearly two decades  ago, a consent decree stemming from  the lawsuit Jerry M. v. District of Columbia, required the District to make  improvements at the facility and address the chronic neglect of its adolescent detainees. Since the decree, ‘‘sixty  judicial orders, 44 monitoring reports  and almost $3 million in court imposed  fines’’ have been issued in connection  with the District’s Youth Services Administration  failure to  fully comply  with the decree, according to a July  2001 article  in the Washington Post.  Last year a report issued by the District’s Inspector General’s office found  that, ‘‘many of the same types of problems that resulted in the 1986 Jerry M.  lawsuit still exist today . . .’’ The report  documented numerous  security  problems, health issues, deficiencies in  management,  failures  to  effectively  maintain the safety of female youth  housed at the center, and drugs being  smuggled into the facility on a continual basis.  There is a consensus that the Oak  Hill Youth Center should be shutdown.  A Blue Ribbon Commission on Youth  Safety and Juvenile Justice Reform,  established by Mayor Williams in August 2000, recommended in its final 2001  report that the Oak Hill Juvenile Detention center be closed and demolished. The Justice for DC Youth coalition, whose members include parents  and juvenile justice advocates, has adamantly supported closing the existing  Oak Hill facility and replacing it with  a smaller, more homelike facility that  is closer to the youth’s homes.  This measure seeks to ensure the closure of the facility and the orderly disposition of the property, while addressing  the  concerns  of Anne Arundel  County, the NSA, the District of Columbia and all surrounding neighborhoods and  residences. Above all,  it  would serve the youth currently being  held at the facility by helping to place  them in an environment that is more  suitable for successful rehabilitation. I  hope this measure can be acted upon  quickly by the Congress and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 1564  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. DISPOSITION OF OAK HILL PROPERTY.  (a) INGENERAL.—The Oak Hill property  shall be disposed of as follows:  (1) The portion of the property which is located west  of  the Baltimore-Washington  Parkway shall be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Director of the National Park  Service, who shall use such portion for parkland purposes.  (2) Subject to subsection (b), the portion of  the property which is located east of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and 200 feet and  further north of the Patuxent River shall be  transferred to the Secretary of the Army  (acting through the Chief of Engineers) for  use by the Director of the National Security  Agency, who may lease such portion to the  District of Columbia.  (3) The portion of the property which is located  east  of  the Baltimore-Washington  Parkway and south of the portion described  in paragraph (2) shall be transferred to the  jurisdiction of the Administrator of General  Services, who shall in turn convey such portion to Anne Arundel County, Maryland, in  accordance with subsection (c).  (b) PAYMENTFORCONSTRUCTIONOFNEWJUVENILEDETENTIONFACILITYFORDISTRICTOF  COLUMBIA.—As a condition of the transfer  under subsection (a)(2), the Director of the  National Security Agency shall enter into an  agreement with the Mayor of the District of  Columbia under which—  (1) the juvenile detention facility for the  District of Columbia currently located on  the Oak Hill property shall be closed; and  (2) subject to appropriations, the Agency  shall pay for the construction of a replacement facility at a site to be determined, with  priority given to a location within the District of Columbia.  (c) CONVEYANCEOFPORTIONOFPROPERTY  TOANNEARUNDELCOUNTY.—  OF AND CONVEYCONDITIONS (1)  IN GENERAL.—The Administrator  of  General Services shall convey, without consideration, to Anne Arundel County, Maryland, all right, title, and  interest of the  United States in and to that portion of the  Oak Hill property referred to in subsection  (a)(3).  (2) TERMS ANCE.—The conveyance under paragraph (1)  shall be carried out under such terms and  conditions as may be agreed to by the Administrator and Anne Arundel County, except that, as a condition of the conveyance—  (A) Anne Arundel County shall agree to  dedicate a portion of the property which is  adjacent to the Patuxent River to parkland  and recreational use; and  (B) Anne Arundel County shall agree to reimburse the National Security Agency for  the amounts paid by the Agency under subsection (b) for the construction of a new juvenile detention facility for the District of  Columbia, but only if the County makes 25  percent or more of the property conveyed  under this subsection available for purposes  other than open space or recreational use.  SEC. 2. OAK HILL PROPERTY DEFINED.  In this Act, the term ‘‘Oak Hill property’’  means the Federal property consisting of approximately 800 acres near Laurel, Maryland,  a portion of which is currently used by the  District of Columbia as a juvenile detention  facility, and which is shown on Map Number  20 in the records of the Department of Assessments and Taxation, Tax Map Division,  of Anne Arundel County.

Dr. Showers has been an outstanding educator  in North Alabama. Throughout his career, Dr. Showers has held many diverse positions. He has been an elementary technology  teacher, a middle school earth science teacher, a middle school industrial teacher, a vocational education  teacher, an adult education  teacher, and an adult education coordinator.  Additionally Mr. Speaker, Dr. Showers has  proudly served  the Huntsville community as  the District One City Council Member since  October of 1988. In fact, he was the first African-American to be elected to the City Council  since 1907. As a council member, Dr. Showers sponsored the first smoking ordinance in  the city, he was successful in locating an industrial park in North Huntsville, and he supported efforts in naming the Northern bypass  in honor of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Showers has had a  tremendous effect on our community as a teacher and City Council member and I would like  thank him for his lifelong commitment to inspiring our community’s children and his encouragement of adults to continue their education.  I rise  today  to  join his  fellow  teachers, students,  family members, and  friends  in celebrating his distinguished career and  to congratulate him upon his retirement.  f  IN HONOR OF CAPTAIN SANDRA L.

300,,109,-0.187,317,2005-07-29,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor and wish well  in  retirement Captain  Sandra L. DeGroot of Lemoore, California.  Captain DeGroot has diligently served her  country for the past thirty years.  In  September  1975  Sandra  joined  the  United States Navy as a Nurse Corps Candidate and was commissioned an Ensign.  It  was  there  that Captain DeGroot committed  herself to ensuring proper care and recovery  for the women and men who place themselves  in harm’s way in the effort to protect our freedom.  She graduated from Keuka College with a  Bachelor of Science Degree  in Nursing  in  1976 and  reported  for Officer  Indoctrination  School in Newport, Rhode Island. Upon completion of her Officer training, Sandra began  her career at the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida in the Intensive Care unit.  Captain DeGroot’s profession brought her to  a variety of places. She was assigned  to  Naval Hospital Pensacola, Florida  as  the  charge nurse of  the medicine ward. Shortly  thereafter Sandra became head nurse of the  Pediatric Clinic at Naval Hospital, Guam and  after a brief return to Florida, she joined the  ranks  in California at Naval Hospital San  Diego. At San Diego Captain DeGroot  filled  many roles; she served as the staff nurse on  Labor and Delivery, Division Officer OB/GYN  clinics and Perinatal Clinical Nurse Specialist.  Ever  the avid  learner, Sandra  transferred  to  Utah where she completed her Master of  Science Degree  in Nursing, with a major  in  Nurse-Midwifery. Her dedication to work and  school brought great  rewards and  in 1996  Captain DeGroot reported  to Naval Hospital  Jacksonville where she was  the Navy’s  first  Director of Women’s Health Services. A few  years  later Sandra was assigned  to U.S.  Naval Hospital Keflavik, Iceland before returning to California at Naval Hospital Lemoore as  the Commanding Officer.  On  top of her successful career Captain  DeGroot has also made time for membership  in various organizations. The American College of Nurse Midwives, the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, the American Holistic Nurses Association and the Association  of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal  Nurses are just some of the organizations with  which she is involved. Her hard work has not  gone unnoticed because Captain DeGroot has  received  the Meritorious Service Medal with  Gold Star, Navy Commendation Medal with  Gold Star, Navy Achievement Medal, National  Defense Service Medal with Bronze Star and  the Overseas Service Ribbon.  For us, her  retirement  is bittersweet—although it is well deserved Captain DeGroot’s  efforts will be greatly missed.  I congratulate  Captain Sandra L. DeGroot, and wish her and  her family all the best.  f  HONORING MR. GARY NEALE  HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005

302,,109,0.547,324,2005-07-29,Mr. RYUN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today in support of H.R. 525, which would authorize small businesses around the country to  establish Association Health Plans. An estimated 45 million people are uninsured in the  United States, and  the number has grown  since 1989. Eighty-five percent of these people are in working families where the price of  premiums have increased so much that they  cannot afford the coverage that will give them  peace of mind.  The majority of Americans receive health insurance coverage through their employers, but  with rising health care costs, many small businesses can no longer afford to provide coverage  for  their employees. H.R. 525 would  remedy this by allowing small businesses to  band together to garner greater buying power  when bargaining with health care providers.  Let’s give Americans access to more affordable  health  care  and  support Association  Health Plans.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE MOUNT  CLEMENS ROTARY  HON. SANDER M.

303,,109,-0.53,324,2005-07-29,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday  I  voted against the Dominican Republic-Central  America Free Trade Agreement. As negotiated  by the Bush Administration, it fails the fundamental tests that our trade agreements should  meet.  First, our trade agreements must be structured to raise labor standards, not put downward pressures on the rights and protections  of American workers. All workers—in the U.S.,  the Dominican Republic and Central America—deserve fair wages, safe workplaces, and  reasonable working conditions.  Second, all citizens—in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and Central America—deserve  clean air and clean water. Polluting factories  that poison our environment should not be located in San Salvador or San Jose, any more  than they should be in Baraboo or Beloit, or  Waunakee or Wisconsin Dells.  The United States should be a leader in the  world in raising standards for everyone. DR–  CAFTA was an opportunity to enshrine these  fundamental  protections  in  a model  trade  agreement that could have served as a template  for  raising working standards, wages,  safety and environmental protections around  the world. Instead, it is an opportunity squandered.  Unfortunately, even more  than an opportunity squandered,  it  threatens  to undermine  those very protections that American workers  and their families have every right to expect.  We need a truly fair trade deal. DR–CAFTA  isn’t fair, and it isn’t a deal.  f  RECOGNIZING  MICHAEL  ‘‘MIKE’’  WALKER OF LOWER LAKE, CALIFORNIA  HON.

306,,109,-0.343,345,2005-07-29,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor the life of Vice Admiral James  Bond Stockdale, a true American patriot and a  great military veteran. Vice Admiral Stockdale  passed away on July 5, 2005 at the age of 81  after a life of public service and sacrifice. He  is survived by his beloved wife Mrs. Sybil B.  Stockdale of Coronado, Calif., and his  four  sons.  I believe Gordon R. England, the Secretary  of the Navy, eloquently described the legacy  Mr.  Stockdale  has  left  behind:  ‘‘Admiral  Stockdale’s courage and life stand as timeless  examples  of  the  power  of  faith  and  the  strength of the human spirit.’’  I could not agree more and would  like  to  share a  few details of his extraordinary  life.  Vice Admiral Stockdale was born on Dec 23,  1923  in Abingdon,  Ill. At  the age of 24 he  graduated  from  the U.S. Naval Academy  in  the Class of 1947 and began his unmatched  naval career. Among his many distinctions,  Vice Admiral Stockdale is remembered for his  remarkable leadership as the senior naval officer held in captivity during the Vietnam War.  On September 9, 1965, after  flying more  than 200 missions over Vietnam, he ejected  over a small village after his plane was struck  by anti-aircraft fire. He broke his left knee during the landing and it was broken a second  time during his captivity.  During his 71⁄2year imprisonment, Vice Admiral Stockdale was tortured numerous times,  was forced to wear heavy leg irons for over  two years and spent four years in solitary confinement.  But his spirit and determination  to survive  never wavered. Despite the torture and abuse,  he refused to participate in enemy propaganda  films. Vice Admiral Stockdale’s extraordinary  heroism became widely known when he was  in 1976, only  awarded  the Medal of Honor  three years after his release.  His 26 combat awards included two Distinguished Flying Crosses,  the Distinguished  Service Medals,  two Purple Hearts and  four  Silver Stars. He is a member of the Navy’s  Carrier Hall of Fame,  the National Aviation  Hall of Fame and an Honorary Fellow of the  Society of Experimental Test Pilots. Stockdale  received several honorary doctoral degrees.  He  is  the highest-ranking naval officer  to  wear both aviator wings and  the Medal of  Honor. His  other  accomplishments  include  earning a master’s degree from Stanford University and serving at the prestigious institution’s Hoover Institute for 15 years. He was  also President of the Citadel for two years.  In 1992, he was a candidate for Vice President of the United States winning nearly 20  percent of the popular vote.  Mr. Speaker,  I  introduce  this  resolution  today  to recognize  the great sacrifices Vice  Admiral made protecting the freedoms of the  United States and  to recognize his commitment to public service. I would also like to extend my deepest sympathies to the family Mr.  Stockdale left behind, including his wife and  four sons.

ANDREWS  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005
307,,109,-0.396,345,2005-07-29,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to an outstanding law enforcement  officer who 40 years ago began his dedicated  career in St. Ignace, Michigan as a police officer and rose through the ranks to head the  Mackinac County Sheriff’s Department. Sheriff  Lawrence  ‘‘Lumpy’’ Leveille  retired  this past  winter with  eight  service  stars  upon  his  epaulets, each representing five years on the  force. Sheriff Leveille’s nearly 40 years as a  law enforcement officer and leader stand as a  shining example to us all.  Sheriff Leveille graduated from LaSalle High  School in St. Ignace in 1965 where in the 10th  grade he was given the nickname ‘‘Lumpy’’.  Being native of the first city across the Mackinac Bridge from Michigan’s Lower Peninsula,  it seemed  fitting  for Leveille  to return  to St.  Ignace when he began his career as a police  officer on May 25th, 1965. That same year on  September 11, he married Ara Jean Litzner.  Through the years, they have grown their family with five children and eleven grandchildren.  After nine years of patrolling and protecting St.  Ignace along  the shores of  the Straights of  Mackinac, Leveille was promoted to Sergeant  of the local police department.  Among his  long  list of accomplishments,  Sheriff Leveille has decreased the number of  drunk driving arrests thanks to new technology  and better training for his officers, despite the  increase in Mackinac County’s population. He  has improved safety for residents and his officers because of new cameras installed on patrol cars and  in booking rooms which have  lead to a reduction in criminal trials. He was  also able to achieve fast finger print and background searches to help officers as well as the  Straits Area Narcotics Enforcement Team.  Sheriff Leveille’s staff of 22 and budget of  about $1.5 million made his department  the  largest in the county.  Although Sheriff Leveille’s career with  the  Mackinac County Sheriff’s Department has  come to an end, he has continued to serve  the public as a Mackinac County Commissioner. There he has and will continue to have  an influence on local policy with the best interests of County  residents  in mind. Having  worked with many of the people involved in  the county’s administration, ‘‘Lumpy’’ Leveille’s  transition to the Board has been smooth as he  works to bring a better harmony to the system.  On a personal note, Mr. Speaker, as a  former State Trooper myself, I have had the  pleasure of knowing Sheriff Leveille over the  years and can attest to his impeccable reputation of being a fair and honest protector of the  people. I know that through his work he has  encountered  both  exciting  opportunities  to  grow with the community but also hard times  when  tragedy and  tough  times affected  the  area. He has given his heart and soul to his  work and I have always admired his dedication  to  the people of Mackinac County and  Michigan’s First Congressional District.

308,,109,-0.408,359,2005-07-29,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call  attention  to  the commemoration of  the 16th  annual National Recovery Month  this September. National Recovery Month serves as  an important reminder of the benefits of treating alcohol and drug use.  It promotes  the  message that recovery from alcohol and drug  use disorder in all its forms is possible and  lauds  the  collective  effort  that  goes  into  achieving such recovery.  Substance abuse and substance dependence create substantial health risks not only to  the  individual, but also  to other community  members in that individual’s life. According to  the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services, as many as 63 percent of Americans  admit that addiction to alcohol or illicit drugs  has had an impact on them at some point in  their lives. This may include either their own  personal addiction or that of a friend or family  member.  In 2003, an estimated 22.2 million  Americans age 12 or older were considered in  need of treatment for an alcohol or drug use  disorder. Substance abuse is not only linked  to chronic health problems, but also with other  problems  such  as  unemployment,  crime,  homelessness, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  These disorders can be  treated, and  the  treatments  leading  to  recovery are as successful as treatments to other medical conditions such as high blood pressure or asthma.  Recovery, or  the process of  initiating and  maintaining abstinence  from drug use,  requires persistent and often multiple courses of  treatment, including behavior based therapies  and for some, medication. Unfortunately, many  people who are in need of treatment do not  receive it.  National Recovery Month 2005 heightens  awareness of the need to improve the process  of assessing abuse problems and  referring  people to appropriate treatment. It is imperative that families are provided with the support  services they need, that appropriate treatment  is affordable, and that access to treatment options are more readily available.  Addiction  is a  real and complex disease,  one which impacts the individual, family, and  community. Our esteemed  former colleague,  Congressman Michael Forbes, was directly  impacted by the substance abuse of a beloved  family member, one of my constituents. Carrick Forbes of Hastings-on-Hudson is a courageous young woman who overcame her addiction problems and successfully rebuilt her  life. Her recovery serves as an example of the  importance of treatment and the need to support more programs and initiatives to help our  friends, family, and members of our community.  f  HONORING DAVID J.

309,,109,-0.201,373,2005-07-29,Mr. ROSS.," Mr. Speaker, on July 26, 1990,  President George H. W. Bush signed into law  the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act.  This  legislation was  the world’s  first comprehensive declaration of equality for people  with disabilities.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)  was the next step in the civil rights revolution  that began with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The ADA extended broad civil rights protections  to America’s 54 million citizens with a  disability. To the over 97,000 working disabled  Arkansans, this legislation has helped to establish greater options for individuals who are  willing and able participants  in our communities.  Among its key provisions, the ADA prohibits  employers with 15 or more employees  from  discriminating against qualified individuals with  disabilities. It calls for the removal of barriers  to access for people with disabilities to a wide  range of public accommodations,  including  restaurants, lodgings, places of entertainment,  hospitals, doctors’ offices, pharmacies, grocery  stores, and all other retail and service establishments. It also requires the removal of barriers to access for people with disabilities to  various public services, including public transportation. Additionally  it mandates  that  telecommunications be made accessible to those  with speech and hearing impairments through  the use of special relay systems.  Over the last 15 years, there is no question  that  the ADA  has  ushered  in  significant  change. One need only look around to see the  signs of progress: curb cuts, wheelchair lifts,  Braille signs, and assistive listening devices at  movie  theaters. The ADA has made  transit  systems and communications systems more  accessible. And, perhaps most importantly, the  ADA has begun to change society’s attitudes  toward people with disabilities.  Despite  this  important  and  widespread  progress,  the promise of  the ADA  remains  unfulfilled for far too many. A major focus of  the ADA, for example, was to improve employment opportunities. However,  the evidence  shows that there has been little change in the  employment  rate of people with disabilities.  Only 32 percent of people of working age who  have a disability are employed. And  today,  people with disabilities are still  three  times  more likely to live in poverty.  Furthermore, we can still find disparities for  the disabled in education, housing, and technology. It is for this reason that we need to  take greater steps to ensure that the disabled  community not only has access to, but is also  participating  in gainful elements of all programs and facets of society. I call on my fellow colleagues to join together in a bipartisan  effort to find ways we can strengthen the ADA  and  fulfill our commitment  to our disabled  communities.  been the constant target of Castro’s machinery of repression. He has been harassed by  the tyrant’s thugs and, now, unjustly incarcerated as a political prisoner for his peaceful activities.  Eight  years  before,  in  1997,  after  coauthoring the important and historic work ‘‘La  Patria es de Todos’’ (‘‘The Homeland Belongs  to All’’) with Martha Beatriz Roque, Felix  Bonne Carcasses and another Cuban patriot,  Vladimiro Roca, Mr. Go´mez Manzano was arrested by  the dictatorship and sentenced  to  various years in the gulag. During his unjust  imprisonment, and after being released, Mr.  Go´mez Manzano never wavered in his commitment  to bring  freedom, democracy and  human rights  to  the Cuban people. Unfortunately,  in an additional act of extreme and  despicable repression by the dictatorship, Mr.  Go´mez Manzano, along with dozens of others,  was arrested once again on July 22, 2005, before he could attend a peaceful demonstration  in front of the French Embassy in Havana to  protest  the  resumption  of  the  European  Union’s policy of so-called engagement with  the terrorist regime in Havana.  I have never had  the honor of personally  meeting Mr. Go´mez Manzano, but I can certainly say that I know him quite well. I have  spoken  to him by  telephone during various  Congressional  hearings  and  other  public  events dedicated to highlighting the suffering  and oppression of the Cuban people. He is a  great patriot, a man of  the  law, a man of  peace, and an apostle of freedom for Cuba.  Mr. Speaker, it is completely unacceptable  that, while the world stands by in silence and  acquiescence, Mr. Go´mez Manzano  languishes in the gulag because of his belief in  freedom, democracy, human  rights and  the  rule of law. We cannot permit the brutal treatment by a demented and murderous tyrant of  a man of peace like Mr. Go´mez Manzano for  simply supporting freedom for his people. My  colleagues, we must demand  the  immediate  and unconditional  release of Rene Go´mez  Manzano and every political prisoner in totalitarian Cuba.  f  f  FREEDOM FOR RENE GO´MEZ  MANZANO  HON. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr.  Speaker,  I rise  today  to speak about Rene  Go´mez Manzano, a political prisoner in totalitarian Cuba.  Mr. Go´mez Manzano is a lawyer and a distinguished member of the pro-democracy opposition in Cuba. Along with fellow Cuban patriots Martha Beatriz Roque and Felix Bonne  Carcasses, he is a leader of the Assembly to  Promote Civil Society. The Assembly  is an  umbrella organization of over 300 groups of  Cubans who have asserted  their  independence from the totalitarian state. On May 20,  2005, the Assembly carried out a meeting of  approximately 200 Cubans who publicly demonstrated their rejection of totalitarianism and  their support  for democracy and  the rule of  law in Havana. Mr. Go´mez Manzano was one  of the primary architects of that historic, admirable accomplishment. Accordingly, he has  ON THE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL  TO EXCLUDE SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FROM THE JURISDICTION  OF  THE  SURFACE  TRANSPORTATION BOARD  HON.

This bill would hurt  patients who are harmed by medical malpractice by arbitrarily capping damages, denying justice to injured patients and their families.  This bill makes a number of changes to current law affecting medical malpractice lawsuits  filed in Federal and State court, including limiting the amount of non-economic and punitive  damages that could be awarded to a plaintiff,  and restricting the contingency fees that can  be charged by attorneys. The bill also pre-  empts State laws that conflict with the enforcement of any of  its provisions. The measure  does not, however, pre-empt any State statutory limits on the amount of compensatory, punitive or total damages awarded in health care  lawsuits. The provisions of the measure dealing with caps on awards would apply only to  those States that have no statutory limits on  damage awards in health care lawsuits.

Sergeant Taylor was assigned to B Battery, 1st  Battalion, 41st Field Artillery Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, at Fort Stewart, Georgia, and  according to initial reports died when he was  struck by  indirect  fire on a Coalition  forces  base. His survivors include his wife Janina, his  son Xavier; and his daughter Aaliyah.  Christopher Taylor was proud to serve his  country, Mr. Speaker. He was a graduate of  Opelika High School and was known  in  the  community as a loving friend and father. Like  every soldier, he dutifully left behind his young  family and  loved ones  to serve our country  overseas.  Words cannot express the sense of sadness  we have for his family, and for the gratitude  our country  feels  for his service. Sergeant  Taylor died serving not just the United States,  but the entire cause of liberty, on a noble mission to help spread the cause of freedom in  Iraq and liberate an oppressed people from tyrannical rule. He was a true American.  We will  forever hold him closely  in our  hearts, and remember his sacrifice and that of  his family as a remembrance of his bravery  and willingness  to  serve. Thank  you, Mr.  Speaker, for the House’s remembrance on this  mournful day.  f  CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 6,  ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005  SPEECHOF  HON. TOM UDALL  OFNEWMEXICO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2005  ",2005
313,,109,-0.454,394,2005-07-29,Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today in support of the energy bill conference report, but  I do so with very strong  reservations. Although  I believe we missed  many opportunities  to make  this energy bill  truly comprehensive,  I also believe  that  the  conference report is an improvement over the  House-passed energy bill.  It is a sad indictment of the way the Majority  is running this Congress that it has taken us  5 years to pass an energy bill and the final  product  falls  far short of what  I believe  the  American public wants. I will vote for this conference report, but this bill lacks boldness and  vision. There is more we can and must do to  reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lower  skyrocketing gas prices, protect our environment, and steer our country  in a more  forward-thinking direction on energy policy. I am  pleased, however, that the bill makes strides  in encouraging alternative energy  research  and production. Specifically, $3.2 billion is included for renewable energy production incentives and $1.3 billion is allotted for energy efficiency and conservation.  I was disappointed to see that a Renewable  Portfolio Standard, RPS, was not included in  the bill. The Senate-passed bill  included an  RPS that would have required utilities to generate 10 percent of  their electricity  from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar,  biomass, and geothermal, by the year 2020.  Studies conducted by the Energy Information  Administration  illustrate  that a  federal RPS  could save consumers $19 billion. Moreover,  20 States have already enacted RPS requirement, many of which go beyond the Senate-  passed provision. A federal RPS would have  established a nationwide market-based trading  system to ensure that renewables are developed at the lowest possible price. I strongly  supported this provision, and over 70 of my  colleagues signed onto a  letter with me  to  conferees urging them to keep the RPS in the  bill. The Senate conferees voted in a bipartisan manner to keep the RPS in the bill, but  the House conferees stripped the provision. I  hope that my colleagues will work with me in  the future to support H.R. 983, a bill with bipartisan support that I introduced to create a  federal RPS of 20 percent by 2027. The time  for a federal RPS has come.  We also missed an opportunity to address  the serious problem of global warming. I believe that the amendment Senator BINGAMAN  offered,  and  that  passed,  expressing  the  sense of the Senate that mandatory action on  climate change should be enacted was an important step  towards congressional action  to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While I am  disappointed that we could not do more, and  that this sense of the Senate amendment was  stripped  from  the conference  report,  I am  pleased that the conference report includes a  provision to establish a new cabinet-level advisory committee, charged with developing a national policy to address climate change and to  promote  technologies  to  reduce greenhouse  gas emissions.  In addition,  the provision allows the Energy Department to authorize demonstration  projects  designed  to  test  technologies  that  limit harmful emissions. The  long-term solution to solving the global warming problem lies in the creation of new technologies and the Federal Government has a  key role to play in promoting technological innovations.  I believe we should have done  more, something along  the  lines of  the recommendations made recently by the National  Commission on Energy Policy, but it is critical  that we do something, and this climate change  provision is the least we can do to begin the  process of slowing global warming.  I am very pleased that a provision included  in the House-passed bill, giving $30 million to  uranium mining companies, was stripped from  the bill. If enacted, this provision would have  posed a grave threat to the water resources of  two Navajo communities in northwestern New  Mexico where four uranium in-situ leach mines  have been granted conditional licenses by the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

314,,109,0.703,401,2005-07-29,Mr. HENSARLING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to discuss funding for veterans’ healthcare. As  the son, grandson, and brother of veterans, I  understand just how important this funding is  to our brave men and women who have answered the call of duty to serve their country.  Since coming to Congress, it has been one of  my greatest pleasures to be able to provide  our veterans with the care and the treatment  they deserve.  Since 1995, Congress has increased spending on veterans by more than 59 percent—an  average increase of 6.9 percent per year. During  this Congress alone we have  increased  the death benefits and life insurance coverage  of our Armed Services personnel. We have  also provided  funding  for  specialty mental  health care for the first time ever, increased  funding  for  the  treatment of conditions  like  Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, and doubled  funding for mental health care issues. This is  indeed a record to which we can all be proud.  I was also proud to cosponsor H.R. 303, the  Retired Pay Restoration Act, in the 108th Congress. With the agreement of the House and  Senate, another version of this bill was passed  and signed by President Bush  in order  to  allow certain military retirees to receive both  their  longevity retired pay and veterans disability  compensation.  As  Speaker  of  the  House J. DENNISHASTERTnoted, ‘‘Congressman HENSARLING’s strong support for our nation’s veterans and concurrent receipt legislation was critical to ensuring that we achieved  the most significant, positive step forward for  veterans in our nation’s history.’’  Unfortunately, sometimes Congress can fall  short. For instance, the Fiscal Year 2004 Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill,  fell $1.8 billion  short of what was agreed  to  in  that year’s  budget  resolution. This  inadequate  level  for  funding  for veterans healthcare greatly concerned me, and that is why I voted against the  bill. When thousands of veterans were waiting  6 months or longer for healthcare, I did not  believe that it was the time to skimp on needed resources.  Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House of Representatives voted on  the Fiscal Year 2006  Department of the Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies Appropriations bill. Included  as part of this legislation was $1.5 billion in  funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs  to cover an anticipated budgetary shortfall for  the current fiscal year. I am very pleased that  the House of Representatives has approved  the funding necessary to ensure that they receive  the medical care  they deserve. However, because  the underlying  legislation  to  which we attached this important provision violated the budget we agree to abide by earlier  this year, I found myself in the difficult position  of having to vote against this legislation.  There were a number of alternative methods  that could have been used  to alleviate  this  problem—methods  that would not have violated the budget. Most notably, we could have  amended H.R. 3130, which was approved  unanimously by the House of Representatives  on June 30, 2005, to provide the necessary  funding levels. This broadly supported measure would have demonstrated our firm commitment to our veterans, and it is unfortunate this  alternative was not utilized.  Mr. Speaker, in the end the greatest threat  to adequately  funding  the needs of our veterans is Congress’ seemingly inherent inability  to control runaway wasteful spending  in our  budget. Each and every  time we spend another dollar on wasteful measures like bulletproof vests for K–9s, bridges to nowhere, or  an underground cafeteria in the Carlsbad Caverns, is a dollar that is not available for our  veterans.  One of Congress’s most solemn obligations  is to care for our veterans. I remain committed  to funding 100 percent of the benefits veterans  have earned  through  their service and sacrifice  to our country.  I will continue  to work  with Members of Congress to explore ways to  ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs  gets the money they need within the rules of  our budget agreement. I will not however, support legislation to grow the budget of another  department, such as this bill would have done  with the Department of the Interior, at the expense of our veteran’s and our children’s future.  f  COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAM  HON.

316,House,109,0.458,6,2005-09-22,Mr. KELLER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of the rule and of the underlying Head  Start bill. Since I was elected to Congress in 2000, we have increased Head  Start funding by 28 percent, from $5.8  billion in 2000 to $6.8 billion today.  Head Start is a crucial program for  over 900,000 of our Nation’s most needy  students.  It provides  child development, educational, health, nutritional,  social and other activities to help prepare young children for kindergarten.  A good Head Start program will make  sure that low-income 4-year-old children will know their ABCs, be able to  count to 20, have the building blocks  they need to hit the ground running on  their first day of kindergarten.  We know today how important early  childhood  education  is  to a  child’s  long-term success. Head Start makes  sure  that children  from  low-income  families have the educational foundation they need to succeed.  As a father of two, I know firsthand  how precious our children’s first years  are and how important they are to our  children’s future. I am proud of Congress’ increased support for low-income  children through the Head Start program, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and  ‘‘yes’’ on the  Head Start reauthorization bill.  b1045  ",2005

318,House,109,0.513,20,2005-09-22,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  If what is being proposed under the  Boustany amendment is so awful, why  would President Bill Clinton, during  his 8 years in office, have signed the  following bills into law: the 1996 welfare reform law; the 1998 Community  Services Block Grant reauthorization,  the 2000 Community Renewal Tax Relief Act; the 2000 Substance Abuse and  Mental Health Services Administration  Act.  Why would President Bill Clinton  have signed all of these bills into law  if, in fact, this was such a bad idea? Because all of these acts, signed into law  by President Clinton, have the same  identical language that is going to be  offered later today.  The second point I would make is  that what do we have to fear from allowing the House to work its will and  letting the majority rule? Let us have  the debate. Let us have the vote. Unfortunately, my colleagues know that  we are likely to win, because we have  won on this case time and time again  as this debate has occurred  in this  House.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2005
319,House,109,-0.225,20,2005-09-22,Mr. CUELLAR.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to focus on the extra provisions dealing  with the Migrant and Seasonal Head  Start programs. These programs are  among the most essential, providing  comprehensive education, health care,  child care services to the families who  often have literally nowhere else to go.  I am familiar with this, working with  the Texas Migrant Council in my district, Laredo, Texas.  This  year we  are  breaking  new  ground by mandating at least 5 percent  of the Head Start budget to go to migrant and seasonal programs. I want to  thank the chairman and the members  of the committee  for this. This  increase even by 1 percent means a lot,  going from 4 to 5 percent. It would permit Migrant and Seasonal Head Start  to serve as many as 10,000 additional  children. This is a case where a small  increase in funding can make a big difference to a lot of children, changing  the path they are on.  I want to emphasize that this program is extremely important. I know  that for the migrant farm worker population  facing a unique  set of challenges, working on a seasonal basis,  migrant families often have to move  from State to State during the year,  making it extremely difficult for the  children to get in and remain in high-  quality  educational programs. When  they are in the fields, parents often  work 12 hours a day or more, making it  very difficult for child care. This is  why this provision is extremely important.  This program  is  important, and  I  know because I am also the son of migrant workers. I want to thank the  chairman and the ranking member (Ms.  WOOLSEY) for the work, and the committee members  for  this new additional funding for the seasonal migrant  workers.  ",2005
320,House,109,-0.656,20,2005-09-22,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Chairman, today I  am a Member of Congress. Prior to ever  being elected to office and serving in  the State  legislature or Congress,  I  worked 6 years for Head Start. I started as assistant teacher, and I went on  to be the supervisor of Parent Involvement and Volunteer Services. I  love  Head Start, and I have a great appreciation for what my government has  done in creating this program to give  poor kids and the kids of working families an opportunity to get a head start,  to get prepared for kindergarten and to  get prepared for success. That is what  Head Start has been doing.  Not only does Head Start build self-  esteem,  it prepares children to read  and get ready for the educational experience. It teaches parents to appreciate  their children’s work. It teaches parents that they can have involvement in  their  children’s  educational destiny.  This is a wonderful program.  I think the committee did a good job  in working through some of the problems. I do not agree with everything,  but I would support this bill.  But I am absolutely shocked and surprised that my colleague that I came  into this Congress with would lead an  effort to kill Head Start. The gentleman knows he is killing Head Start  by putting  this amendment on  the  floor to put religious involvement in  the program. A faith-based initiative  has no place in Head Start. Head Start  teaches children to respect each other,  to enjoy each other, to respect all cultures.  On Sunday morning in America, religion is the most segregated sector of  our society. Whites go to white churches, blacks go to black churches, Greeks  go to Greek churches, Muslims are in  their mosque, Jews are in their synagogue; and that is all right. We have  religious freedom. People go to whatever church they want. But do not  bring that to Head Start. Allow Head  Start to be what it should be for all  Americans.

321,House,109,-0.353,34,2005-09-22,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in support of this bill, though I have concerns about one specific provision that would  go too far to allow discrimination.  The basic  tenet of Head Start  is as  true  today as  it was a generation ago—quality  early education programs can be instrumental  in helping children overcome barriers to learning. This program not only plays an important  role in providing opportunities for the next generation but also has an important impact on  our economy. For every dollar spent on Head  Start, we receive seven dollars back. There  are few federal programs that can boost that  kind of success.  As a nation we must ensure that our children are prepared, academically, emotionally  and nutritionally to enter school. Removing the  outside  forces  that  result  in under-prepared  students opens up children’s minds  to  learn  and gain an education. Head Start is one of  the most  important programs  in our government and I am pleased to see this bill come  to the floor with bipartisan support.  Unfortunately,  I have concerns about an  amendment passed by this body that allows  faith-based Head Start grantees  to discriminate in hiring based on religion. Federally supported programs should never support discrimination in its programs on any level. Since  Head Starts inception in 1972 it has never discriminated in hiring for faith based and other  organizations. There is no need to start now.  I was pleased the House did not adopt an  amendment offered by Ms. MUSGRAVE that  would allow for-profit Head Start providers to  collect federal funds as profit. While for-profit  Head Start grantees play an important role in  school  readiness,  I do not support allowing  them to collect a profit from federal grants provided to serve low-income students. Any savings from funds designated for administrative  costs should go towards serving the needs of  these  low-income students. This amendment  provides the wrong type of incentive for Head  Start grantees.  While this bill is not perfect, there are many  provisions that will provide needed and worthwhile reforms to Head Start. Head Start has  proven to be a successful program and this  bill will largely make it even more successful  and efficient. So Mr. Chairman, I am voting in  favor of this bill.  ",2005
322,House,109,-0.4,55,2005-09-22,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague,  the  gentlewoman  from  Connecticut  (Ms.  DELAURO) that would allow Head Start centers  to partner with colleges, universities and community-based organizations to recruit and train  college students  to serve as mentors and  reading coaches to preschool children.  Early childhood is a critical time for children  to develop  reading,  language and cognitive  skills. For 40 years, Head Start has worked to  increase the overall school preparedness for  the Nation’s  young  children  in  low-income  communities. As Congress moves forward to  reauthorize Head Start and make a number of  changes,  the  reauthorization should  include  meaningful programming to improve the offerings of Head Start programs. This amendment, that allows Head Start centers to partner with an institution of higher education or a  community-based organization in order to recruit and  train college students  to serve as  mentors and  reading coaches  to preschool  children, and would allow children to receive  the personal  instruction and attention  they  need to be successfully prepared for school.  One-to-one  learning  is a proven  teaching  method  that strengthens cognitive skills  in  young children. Mentors provide children with  the additional support they need to boost comprehension and self-confidence. Back home in  my district in Connecticut, the Jumpstart Hartford program is an excellent example of this  type of comprehensive  learning partnership.  Jumpstart Hartford,  in partnership with  the  University of Hartford,  facilitates one-on-one  instruction with students  from  the University  and young children from low-income families  in Hartford. The program places special focus  on developing stronger language, literacy, social and  initiative  skills. The program has  made significant gains in narrowing language  and literacy gaps with its young children.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the DeLauro amendment that would allow  mentor partnerships in Head Start and make  real progress towards preparing all children in  Head Start for success in school and throughout life.  ",2005
323,House,109,-0.478,69,2005-09-22,Mr. RUSH.," Mr. Chairman, today we are debating whether or not we should repeal civil  rights provisions in Head Start reauthorization,  and allow religious organizations that use federal funding to discriminate in hiring and firing  based on an individual’s religious beliefs. In a  time when we are forcefully trying to persuade  other countries to include protections against  religious discrimination in their constitutions, it  is astounding that we are here, in the United  States Congress, trying to repeal these same  protections for our own citizens.  As a practicing ordained minister, I find the  Boustany amendment to be unnecessary, unwise, and unproductive. The Boustany amendment would allow  religious organizations  to  waive civil rights protections that nonreligious  organizations must abide by. The provisions  that currently govern Head Start have been in  place and have been working effectively  for  decades. Religious organizations operate over  5 percent of all Head Start programs, abiding  by the civil rights provisions, and there is no  need for Congress to take this unprecedented  step  that Mr. BOUSTANY is proposing. Never  before has Congress ever repealed existing  civil rights protections by adopting an amendment on the House Floor, without the benefit  of committee hearings, debate, or expert testimony.  In  fact, H.R. 2123,  the School Readiness  Act, passed  through  the Education and  the  Workforce Committee by a bipartisan, unanimous 48–0 vote. Now, some Members of  Congress are attempting to sabotage this bill  by  attaching  this  unconstitutional,  divisive  amendment  to  it. Maybe  this  is a way  for  Members who are against Head Start anyway,  to try and derail the program. Mr. BOUSTANY  knows  that Democrats will note vote  for an  amendment that allows federally funded organizations  to discriminate against any Americans on any grounds.  Republicans are trying to make us choose  between early childcare for our neediest students and civil rights protections for the rest of  our citizens. I wonder what the real motivation  is behind bringing up this amendment.  It  is  truly a shame  that Members of  this  House are playing politics with a bill that affects millions of our young children, and which  millions of Americans have come to trust and  rely on. No, Mr. Speaker, I will not vote for a  bill that repeals civil rights protections. I will  not vote for federally funded discrimination. It  is unconscionable that Members of Congress  would try to reverse the progress that we have  made on civil rights in this country. What message are we sending to the rest of the world,  including  the newly-established democracies  struggling to find a balance between religious  freedom and civil  liberties  in  their own  laws  and constitutions?  Adopting the Boustany amendment will send  our country in the wrong direction. This is just  another example of where  the Republican  Leadership wants to take our country, and I  hope all our citizens are watching carefully. I  urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the Boustany amendment.  ",2005
324,House,109,0.392,69,2005-09-22,Mr. BOUSTANY.," Mr. Chairman, on September 22, 2005, I returned to my district to  prepare  for Hurricane Rita, which was projected to hit southwest Louisiana, and I was  unable to be present during House consideration of H.R. 2123, ‘‘School Readiness Act of  2005.’’ Had I been present, I planned to offer  an amendment  that would allow  faith-based  Head Start providers to participate in the program and maintain the character of their organization through their employment practices. I  would like to thank my colleague, Representative  for  introducing  this  amendment in my absence.  It  is critical  that  faith-based organizations  that are willing to serve their communities by  participating  in  federal  programs  are  not  forced to give up who they are to participate.  They cannot be expected to sustain their religious mission without the ability to employ individuals who share the tenets and practices  of their faith or who are dedicated to upholding  the values of the organization. These groups  should not be forced to abandon who they are  because they want to assist the community;  we lose too many good people who want to  help when we put that barrier in their way.  Now, more than ever before, we are seeing  first hand  the good work  these groups are  doing in my region of the country. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, faith-based organizations were among the first to reach out a  hand in service to those impacted by the disaster.  The 1964 Civil Rights Act makes  it clear  that faith-based groups have a federally protected right to maintain their religious nature  and character through those they hire. If we  do not include the provision to allow them to  exercise their right we are continuing to discourage potential providers, who could provide  needed  learning  experiences,  from  participating in the program.  Let me be clear, we are not talking about  discrimination—nothing in the amendment will  allow a  faith-based provider  to discriminate.  The Boehner amendment merely allows faith-  based providers to exercise their rights under  the Civil Rights Act and help their neighbors  by participating in this federal program.

328,,109,0.641,167,2005-09-22,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, I want to express  my disappointment about a vote  that was  taken in this House last week.  The House  took up very  important,  long  overdue  legislation  to protect America’s children and keep despicable predators off our  streets.  However, an abominable amendment was  offered by a Democrat that had no business  being a part of the Children’s Safety Act.  The noble and monumental Children’s Safety Act was tainted by the Conyers amendment  that seeks to punish people for their thoughts,  specifically  if  they believe homosexuality  is  wrong.  While considering a great Republican bill  that will crack down on pedophiles, rapists and  murderers,  the self-motivated Democrats  instead took the opportunity to further their out  of touch agenda.  I voted against the Conyers amendment and  I am truly saddened that it passed.  The Children’s Safety Act  is so  important  and will do so much good in our country that  I still voted for final passage despite the inclusion of this awful, unrelated amendment.  The opportunity to vote to protect American  children from monstrous criminals could not be  declined simply because there was a blemish  on otherwise outstanding legislation.  f  RECOGNIZING RYAN E.

329,,109,-0.296,167,2005-09-22,Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.," Mr. Speaker, William and Margurite Addison are a wonderful  couple who have provided a permanent home  for  five children who were part of  the State  foster care system. Although the Addisons had  thought their childrearing years were finished  when  their own biological children had become young adults (Ms. Addison has four biological children, ranging in age from 34 to 41,  and Mr. Addison has two birth children, ages  29 and 35), they opened their home to one of  Mr. Addison’s nephews, Ralph, (now age 17)  in 1992. The Addisons became approved foster parents  for Ralph  in 1994 and subsequently decided to open their home to non-relative foster children when they realized how  many children were in desperate need of out-  of-home care.  In 1998, the Addisons were approved as an  adoptive resource for Ralph and their adoption  was subsequently  finalized  that year. However, that was only the first of what ultimately  became  five adoptions.  In 1999, Malik (now  age 9) was adopted, Kevin (now age 3), was  adopted  in 2000, Warren  (now age 6) was  adopted  in 2003, and Bryleigh (now age 3)  was adopted in 2004. Except for Ralph, each  of  these children had come  to  the Addison  home via the foster care system as drug-exposed infants (none of them are related). In  addition, Warren suffers from sickle-cell anemia, as well as emotional/behavioral difficulties. Ralph has  received special education  services in school and it is likely Warren will  also need a special school setting.

330,,109,-0.347,174,2005-09-22,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule to provide for consideration of  H.R. 250, the Manufacturing Technology Competitiveness Act. The  rule did not make  in  order an amendment  that  I submitted which  would have elevated the advisory committee,  present now and codified by H.R. 250, to a  Presidential Council on Manufacturing. The  amendment would have broadened the diversity of the Council and provided much needed  accountability to their strategic role.  If our manufacturing industry and our manufacturing jobs are truly as important as much  rhetoric suggests, we owe it to Americans in  the industry to create a council that has the  ear of our President.  As many of us know, the Council on Manufacturing has been in existence since last year  and is now solely comprised of industry representatives. My amendment would broaden  the diversity of those that sit on the panel to  include labor, research, and academia, bringing a much needed voice  to  individuals adversely affected by and who have expertise in  the current state of manufacturing.  Furthermore,  under my  amendment,  the  President’s Manufacturing Council would be  directed to develop a National Manufacturing  Strategy with clear  issues  to consider and  specific reports to be submitted to Congress.  As it stands currently, the Advisory Council  is not carrying out its responsibilities as envisioned by H.R. 250, which assigns responsibilities to the Council to review federal manufacturing R&D and to review the actions of the  Interagency Working Group on Manufacturing  R&D. The Council has accomplished neither  of these stated goals.  Perhaps most astonishing, according to the  Commerce Department staff, the Council does  not have an agenda for the coming year, nor  were they certain that such an agenda would  even be developed.  The National Council  for Advanced Manufacturing reported on the Bush Manufacturing  Initiative suggesting  that  the Council have a  more expansive role, that they have a strong  Congressional mandate, and  that  the committee be chaired by the Secretary of Commerce.  My colleagues, I believe it is clear that the  Council as it stands now does not meet these  recommendations.  We have seen drastic changes in manufacturing  jobs  in  this country,  transfer of entire  operations overseas, and communities deeply  affected by these changes.  While  there  is much disagreement  in  this  body about how to tackle the problems affiliated with  the changing climate of our workforce, I seldom hear disagreement that there  is an ongoing change  in  the U.S. manufacturing sector.  Unfortunately, this rule will not allow us to  consider the design of the Council. I urge a  ‘no’ vote on the rule so that we may have the  opportunity  to proactively address  the problems of the manufacturing industry and to fulfill  a promise to working Americans in the sector  that we value their industry and their contribution to our nation.  We will not sit idly by while our neighbors  lose their jobs and their way of life.  Vote no so that we may task this Council  with a strong mandate and a clear role.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF ANDRE LOUIS  AND THE ‘‘RIDE FOR THE AGES’’  HON. GARY L.

On August 10, Mr. Louis began a 3,300 mile  journey by bicycle across the United States in  an effort to raise awareness of the importance  of maintaining physical health for senior citizens. Andre, the Psychiatric Services Coordinator at the Margaret Tietz Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Jamaica, New York, was inspired by his experiences working with aging  individuals suffering from serious health problems.  On his way from San Francisco to Jamaica,  Andre, who himself is nearing retirement age,  stopped at various American Association of  Homes and Services for the Aging facilities to  meet with and inspire staff members and patients alike. Accompanied by family members  along the way, Andre has dedicated the ‘‘Ride  for the Ages’’ to his daughter, Michele, who  survived leukemia as a result of a bone marrow transplant from her brother Jean-Daniel.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is with great pride  that  I  commend Andre Louis  for his altruism and  dedication to the health of our seniors. He is  truly a determined individual and an inspiration  to us all. I ask my colleagues in the House of  Representatives to please join me in honoring  Andre Louis for his extraordinary undertaking  and wishing him many more years of success.  f  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT L.

332,,109,-0.172,174,2005-09-22,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize  the outstanding service of Robert L.  Goldich, a Specialist in National Defense with  the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of the Congressional Research Service.  Mr. Goldich is retiring after 33 years at CRS.  During this time, he has provided Members of  Congress with perspective and analysis on a  broad  range of  topics  in military manpower  and personnel policy, military history, Department of Defense organization, prisoner of war  (POW) and missing  in action  (MIA)  issues,  and major aspects of overall U.S. defense policy.  During his career, Mr. Goldich excelled at  working with Members of Congress and congressional staff on many issues. He is an expert on such issues as military retirement, military compensation and benefits, officer personnel management, military education and  training; as well as the draft and all-volunteer  force, military  reserve components and  the  National Guard, and U.S. defense organization  and management  including  the Goldwater-  Nichols Act and the Reserve Officer Personnel  Management Act. He received a CRS commendation for his service to Congress in 1987,  and in 1991 he received a CRS meritorious  award for his service to Congress during the  Persian Gulf War. He is the second youngest  person ever to graduate from the National War  College.  Mr. Goldich also served  twice as head of  CRS’s Military Manpower, Budget and Policy  Management Section and was responsible for  providing to Congress analytical capability on  a variety of defense issues associated with the  Department of Defense’s budget and policy  priorities. He received many accolades as a  supervisor and lead with dedication, analytical  skill, clear thinking, and fair-minded approach  in working with members of the Section. In addition to his work for Congress, Mr. Goldich’s  outside professional activities are impressive.  He was invited to participate in high level conferences, writing book reviews  for  the Army  Center of Military History, and having longtime  participatory memberships to the Inter-Agency  Seminar Group and the Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Mr.  Goldich for his many years of service and his  many contributions to congressional deliberations on defense related  issues.  I wish him  and his family all the best in the days ahead.  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:21 Sep 23, 2005 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22SE8.051 E22SEPT1 ",2005

I  just saw a poll last week that had 60  percent of the independent voters in  the country are sick and tired of what  has been going on in Washington, D.C.  Mr. Wagner from General Motors said  D.C. better do something about health  care. We are not doing anything. What  we are doing seems like we are doing  something, but the energy bill is not  really doing anything.  The gentleman mentioned the $1.5  billion a week that we are spending in  Iraq. I want to share one thing. This is  a great article today in the Washington  Post. The first line says it feels like  the 1990s minus the good parts, all of  the scandals that were going on, but  the economy, energy costs and everything is bad.  There was a proposal made, and talking about dealing with the Chinese, we  need to offer, and that is what we are  doing as Democrats, we just need to  convince the American people that we  are offering alternatives and do have  ideas, whether it is prescription drugs  or alternative energy.  I want to share a proposal from the  National Academies and it is a combination of a variety of different things  to get our math scores up. Our math  scores  in 8th grade, we ranked 15th  internationally and in the 9th grade we  ranked  24th  internationally. We are  not going to stimulate the economy if  we do not have engineers and math and  science majors, and the 30–Something  Group is calling for a million new engineers and scientists over the next 10  years because we believe that is going  to be the greatest stimulus.  But let me share the proposal from  the  National  Academies  to  spend  money  on math  prizes  for  high  schoolers, pay raises for math teachers  and to boost Federal research funding  by 10 percent annually for 7 years. That  would cost $10 billion a year. That is it.  We are spending $1.5 billion a week in  Iraq. The American people judge, $10  billion a year on  increased Federal  funding for research and development  and targeted investments to increase  math and science scores in the United  States of America among K–12 school  kids. That is what the Democrats want  to do, versus $1.5 billion a week in Iraq,  versus hundreds of thousands and millions and trillions of dollars over the  next 10 years in tax cuts for people who  make more than $600,000 a year.  b2130  Pick what they want. Democrats, increased funding for Pell grants to lower  tuition costs. Republicans, cut taxes  for the top 1 percent. Trillions.  Democrats, fully fund No Child Left  Behind, make sure every kid who is eligible for more funding, for afterschool  tutoring, summer school, before school;  Democrats are for full funding of that.  Republicans, no. We have to give our  tax cuts to our buddies.  And that is the difference. Time and  time again and over the course of the  next year, we are just going to hammer  the differences between the two parties.  ",2005

364,,109,0.375,156,2005-10-17,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Sister Paula DelGrosso of the Carmelite Community of the Word, Altoona, Pennsylvania, as  the recipient of  the 2005 John  Riley Human Relations Award for community  service. This award is presented each year to  an individual who has performed outstanding  and meritorious service to the community of  Altoona through personal efforts by enhancing  the dignity and worth of  its citizens. This  award is presented by the Blair County Advisory Council to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission and is now in its sixteenth  year of giving  this award. The Pennsylvania  Human Relations Commission has served the  citizens of Pennsylvania faithfully since 1955  fighting the practice or policy of discrimination  against  individuals or groups by  reason of  their race, color, familial status, creed, ancestry, age, sex, national origin or disability.  Sister DelGrosso is receiving this award in  recognition for her lifelong commitment to the  community of Altoona, but in particular for her  special efforts over the past fourteen years as  Director of the St. Vincent DePaul Soup Kitchen and Food  for Families Food Bank  in Altoona. Under Sister DelGrosso’s guidance, the  dining hall at St. Vincent DePaul’s has been  able to provide over 35,000 meals every year  to needy people in the community. Thanks in  large part  to her steadfast  leadership,  the  kitchen at St. Vincent DePaul’s enjoys support  from various segments of the community ranging from the religious to the financial and from  the public  to  the private sector. These are  people within the community of Altoona who  share different philosophies, beliefs and opinions, yet Sister DelGrosso has been able to  bring  them  together  in support of a worthy  cause.  Sister Paula has led a life filled with compassion and dignity. Born in the town of Altoona,  the daughter of Thomas and Mary  DelGrosso, Sister Paula graduated  from Altoona Area High School and Mt. Aloysius, before going on to graduate with a B.S. in Education from St. Francis University, and a Masters Degree and Supervision Certificate  in  Guidance and Counseling from Duquesne University. Her passion for education has imbued  her life as she has served in the field of education for thirty-four years, with sixteen being  spent as an elementary and secondary school  teacher and eighteen years as Assistant Superintendent of Schools for the Altoona/Johnstown Diocese.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to congratulate  Sister Paula DelGrosso for her lifelong commitment to the community of Altoona and I am  proud to call Sister Paula a constituent.  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO EMMETT C.

365,,109,-0.328,156,2005-10-17,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay special  tribute  to Emmett C. Burns, Jr.,  who is an outstanding delegate to the Maryland House of Delegates and who has been  awarded this year’s Thurgood Marshall Legacy  Award by  the Baltimore City Branch of  the  NAACP.  It is most fitting that Emmett Burns is the recipient of an award named  for our Nation’s  first African-American U.S. Supreme Court  Justice. Thurgood Marshall, who was born in  Baltimore, was one of the most important figures in our Nation’s struggle for civil rights. As  chief attorney for the NAACP, he successfully  argued the Brown v. Board of Education case  before  the Supreme Court, ending  legalized  segregation of our Nation’s schools.  Since 1995, Emmett Burns has been a leader in the Maryland House of Delegates for the  rights of all Marylanders. Most  recently, he  was instrumental in the enactment of a law to  rename Maryland’s  largest airport  the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.  As former head and lifelong member of the  Baltimore NAACP, he has been a role model  for the African-American community, providing  a strong voice for social justice and equality.  I have known Emmett Burns for many years  and  I consider him a  friend whose advice  I  seek and value.  I urge my colleagues in the U.S. House of  Representatives  to  join me  in congratulating  Del. Emmett C. Burns on being this year’s recipient of the Baltimore City NAACP Thurgood  Marshall Legacy Award.  IN RECOGNITION OF A NEW FEDERAL COURTHOUSE  IN FRESNO,  CA  HON.

366,,109,0.103,156,2005-10-17,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, as Chairman  of the House Committee on Science, I am an  avid supporter of programs that encourage the  youth of America to push the limits of innovation. One  such program  is  the Discovery  Channel Young Scientist Challenge.  In 1999, Discovery Communications,  Inc.,  designed  the Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge  to help address America’s  chronic underachievement  in K–12 science  and math. The annual national contest  responds  to evidence  that our students’ academic performance and interest in science declines dramatically as they become older, particularly during the middle school years.  The Discovery Channel Young Scientist  Challenge attempts to reverse that decline by  identifying and honoring America’s top middle  school students with a demonstrated ability in  leadership,  teamwork, and scientific problem  solving. More  than 9,500 middle school students have accepted the challenge and have  competed  for  the  title  of  ‘‘America’s Top  Young Scientist of  the Year.’’ Since 1999,  scholarship awards for the students have totaled more than $500,000, and challenge winners have participated in science-related trips  to far-off places, including the Roslin Institute  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:34 Oct 18, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A17OC8.024 E17OCPT1 ",2005
367,,109,0.435,163,2005-10-17,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing legislation, along with Ranking Member  EVANSand other distinguished Members of the  Committee, will  introduce  legislation  that will  mandate the Department of Veterans’ Affairs  to empower the Department’s Chief Information Officer with  authority  over  resources,  budget and personnel related  to  information  technology for the Department.  Since coming to Congress in 1993, I have  witnessed this Committee struggle with VA’s  inability to adequately manage its IT funding  and IT modernization efforts.  While there have been significant improvements in VA’s IT modernization efforts, the improvements have come at significant cost to  our Veterans: $600 million plus for a decade  of VETSNET—the automated compensation  and pension claims processing system  that  still has not been  implemented  in 10 years.  $342 million for CoreFLS—the failed financial  management system. $300 million for the HR  Links—the failed automated personnel system.  $485 million annually to maintain VISTA, VA’s  25-year-old medical information system.  This  legislation,  the  ‘‘Department of Veterans Affairs Information Technology Management Improvement Act’’ will ensure accountability in VA IT spending, and reorganize VA’s  IT  infrastructure  to better serve our nation’s  veterans.

368,Senate,109,-0.203,15,2005-10-24,Ms. LANDRIEU.," I know people are  going to debate about Davis-Bacon, but  I just want to tell the American people  this point: When the President issued  the order and basically said, right after  Katrina, waive all the labor laws that  allow people to be paid a fair wage, he  said he was doing that to save money.  How does one save money on a no-bid  contract? If a contract is not being put  out  for bid, how does one save any  money? All that happens is wages of  the people who need them the most at  a time when they have lost everything  are driven down. They are not asking  for charity. They are not asking for a  handout. They stood up to get a job to  work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and  still were basically under the administrative rules of waiving Davis-Bacon,  lack of oversight and lack of focus, and  have basically been asked to leave the  military base.  So  I hope that  in the  few weeks  ahead, we can get these electricians  back on the job, back to their homes,  back to their neighborhoods to rebuild,  and build some support in this Chamber and around America for paying people a decent wage. I do not think $22 is  too much. I do not expect people to rebuild Louisiana at a minimum wage or  $8 or $9 an hour without benefits.  People have to make a living. That  amounts to about $45,000 a year. Is that  too much to pay someone working 12  hours a day, 7 days a week, doing hard  and sometimes dangerous work? I don’t  think so. But evidently somebody in  Washington thinks that is too much  because,  instead  of  holding wages  steady—not asking  for union wages,  but asking for an average wage, between  union  and  nonunion, which  seems fair to me—we are undercutting  our workers. The Government should  not mandate a union wage to be paid,  but neither should we undercut our  workers. So  the prevailing wage  is  what we have come up with, to say  don’t pay union, don’t pay nonunion,  pay something in the middle, the average wage:  $18,  $20,  $22 an hour  for  skilled labor. That is not too much to  ask. But evidently it is.  Even  if people can get these  jobs  back, under the policies of this administration, they will be told: You can  work, so be happy and smile that we  are going to pay you $9 an hour, on  which you cannot even feed your family,  invest  in your pension, or send  your children to school. You should  smile and be happy you have a job.  People in Louisiana want more respect than that. They deserve more respect than that. The people along the  gulf coast are, as I have said many  times, honest, hardworking, and self-  reliant. We do not come here asking for  charity, but we do come here asking  for help out of our National Treasury  to which we have contributed so much  over 300 years of hard work and toil to  build the Nation’s only energy coast.  We are proud to do it, proud to take  the risks associated with that hard  work—building  a  port  system,  the  greatest in the North American Continent, and building commerce that allows every State and every parish and  every county in America to flourish.  Without this port system, without this  energy coast, our Nation would not be  what it is today.

I  think it was Mr. GUTKNECHT’s original  idea, and I am very pleased that he had  it.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 3989, this resolution which pays  tribute to an outstanding Minnesotan  through the designation of the Albert  H. Quie Post Office. I express my appreciation  to my colleague  from Minnesota, as I said, for his leadership, for  his initiative in this bill, and for helping us pull the entire Minnesota delegation together. We have unanimous  bipartisan support for this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, Al Quie is a lifelong  Minnesotan who is guided by a strong  faith and the principle of selfless service. Residents of Minnesota’s Second  Congressional District can be proud of  this native son who was born on a farm  in Rice  County, was  educated  in  Nerstrand and Northfield, and graduated from St. Olaf College in 1950, all  institutions in the Second District of  Minnesota.

371,House,109,-0.495,29,2005-11-01,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  it  is  important to understand  that not only did the Vice President  and his chief of staff, Mr. Libby, withhold  information  from the American  people; they have made a decision to  withhold from the Senate Intelligence  Committee key documents. It was reported just this past week in a national  magazine, the National Journal, that  the Vice President and Mr. Libby overruled advice from some White House  political staffers, some White House  political staffers and lawyers, and decided to withhold crucial documents  from  the Senate  Intelligence Committee in 2004. The withheld documents  included  intelligence data  from CHENEY’s office and Libby in particular,  that they pushed to be  included  in  Powell’s speech, referring to his presentation before the United Nations.  The new information, and I am reading here,  the new  information  that  CHENEYand Libby blocked information  to the Senate Intelligence Committee  further underscores  the central  role  played by the Vice President’s office in  trying to blunt criticism that the Bush  administration  exaggerated  intelligence data to make the case to go to  war.  They withheld it from the Senate.  They withheld it from the Senate. And  because there is no conduct of vigorous  oversight either in this Chamber or in  the Senate, our democracy  is being  shrouded in this cloud of secrecy.  The gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  earlier  said,  What did we do it for? Why? Why? Why,  I guess, is going to be the question that  people will ask far into the future. If  you remember, first it was about the  weapons of mass destruction. No weapons of mass destruction. It was about  some alleged al Qaeda links, a haven  for terrorism. No al Qaeda links. Saddam Hussein despises Osama bin Laden  and vice versa because Saddam Hussein, albeit an evil individual, was a  secularist. He is not one of these fundamental Islamists. He is just a regional  thug. And then finally it was to bring  democracy to Iraq.  I think it is so ironic that we are  bringing democracy to Iraq and simultaneously eroding democracy because  of the secrecy in Washington, D.C.  What a tragedy.  ",2005

It is with great admiration that I  honor Doris today for her unwavering commitment to the VNA for the past 50 years.  Doris originally came to the association as a  clerk  for a  fundraising consultant,  the Foote  System,  in 1955. Since  then, she has held  such positions as receptionist, assistant supervisor and supervisor of the Foote Department,  and senior clerk. Her warm, caring voice has  greeted callers and  reassured patients and  their families for many years.  Through her hard work and devotion, Doris  earned herself further promotions to communications operator, and customer service coordinator. Furthermore, Doris was named VNA  of Central Jersey’s first employee of the month  in 2003. These accomplishments only further  reiterate what a worthy, notable person Doris  Septen is and how indispensable she has become to her organization.  Doris  is a compassionate woman  that  is  genuinely concerned with  the well-being of  those who rely on the VNACJ. She handles  many tasks, such as tracking down nurses for  patients, helping callers on the main switchboard, and facilitating the Monmouth County  support staff council.  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join  me in recognizing Ms. Doris Septen for all she  has done for the VNACJ community, and congratulate her on reaching the milestone of 50  years of service.  f  RECOGNIZING  THE  CAMBRIDGE  HIGH SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTAL  CLUB  HON.

Major  General Terry Tucker  recently  relinquished  command of the Fort Knox or School, bringing  to a close a 3-year tenure marked by unprecedented growth and change at one of America’s most important military installations.  Generl Tucker  joined  the Army  in 1972,  signing in at the same building at Fort Knox  where, 31 years later, he would take full installation command. Raised on a dirt farm in West  Virginia, General Tucker, with the help of an  Army scholarship was the first member of his  family  to graduate  from college. After completing his initial 4-year obligation to the Army,  General Tucker and his wife Patti went on to  fulfill a wide variety of military assignments at  home and abroad throughout their 33 years of  service to our country.  Upon his return to Fort Knox, first as Deputy  Commanding General in 2000, then as Commanding General  in 2003, General Tucker  presided over a wide scope of critical responsibilities. Along with managing on-base training, he was authorized to develop and implement  training  for  the entire United States  Mounted Force, changing the way soldiers are  trained to meet a new wartime mission. General Tucker successfully matched this training  with a strong focus on improved combat systems and equipment, such as the Abrams tank  and the Bradley IFV, to meet new and emerging threats.  During his time at Fort Knox, General Tucker’s leadership inspired officers and civilians to  be good neighbors, making Fort Knox and its  surrounding communities a better place to live  and work.  In  this capacity, General Tucker  worked hard to build partnerships with community organizations to support Fort Knox Soldiers and their families. General Tucker also  oversaw critical improvements to the Garrison  and  IMA, modernizing  facilities  to enhance  Fort Knox’s future viability.  Perhaps General Tucker’s most enduring  legacy to the citizens of my congressional district will be his  tireless promotion of Fort  Knox’s military value during Base Realignment  and Closure proceedings this year. Because  of his efforts, Fort Knox remains open, adapting to a new mission as a vital multi-functional  home to operational army forces and various  administrative commands.  It is my great privilege to recognize Major  General Terry Tucker today, before the entire  U.S. House of Representatives, for his lifelong  example of  leadership and service.  I would  like to thank him personally for his exemplary  stewardship at Fort Knox during a time of war  and  administrative  transition.  His  unique  achievements and dedication to the men and  women of the U.S. Army make him an outstanding American worthy of our collective  honor and respect.

397,House,109,-0.451,13,2005-12-07,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support of H.R. 4311. This bill  protects judges against certain security threats. The September 11 tragedy  and events thereafter have only heightened the security concerns that make  this legislation necessary.  H.R. 4311 permanently extends the  ability of judges to request redaction of  their financial disclosure reports. The  current redaction authority sunsets at  the end of this year. Thus it is imperative that we act quickly to get this bill  to the Senate where we hope it will  pass before the end of the year so that  the legislation can be enacted.  The redaction authority for judges is  appropriately limited and thus should  not raise concerns about undue restrictions on public access to financial disclosure reports. A judge’s report may  only be redacted if the Judicial Conference and the U.S. Marshals Service  both find that revealing the personal  and sensitive information could endanger  that  particular  judge. Furthermore, the report can only be redacted  to the extent necessary to protect the  judge and only for so long as a danger  exists.  The redaction authority has not been  abused to date. Of over 2,000 judges filing reports in 2000, only 6 percent had  their  reports  redacted  in any way.  Typically, the information redacted is  limited to such things as a spouse’s  place of work, location of a judge’s second home and things of that nature. It  is obvious how a person of ill will could  misuse  that  information  to harm a  judge or the judge’s family.  This law is tightly drawn, and it requires the Judicial Conference, in concert with the Department of Justice, to  file an annual  report detailing  the  number and circumstances of all of the  redactions. This  statutory  reporting  requirement enables Congress to monitor for any abuse of the redaction authority, so I would urge my colleagues  to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation.  b1130  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman  from New York  (Ms.  SLAUGHTER).

398,House,109,-0.465,13,2005-12-07,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding me  this time.  This is a critically important piece of  legislation that everyone in the House  should  support without  reservation.  H.R. 4311, which amends the 1978 Ethics  in Government Act, will make permanent an expiring provision which protects the safety of our Nation’s judges  as well as the integrity of our judicial  system.  And I know that everyone here remembers, as Mr. SENSENBRENNER just  reminded us, the horrifying murders of  a Chicago judge’s family members this  past summer. These crimes were committed by an individual, who was angered by a ruling on his case. He went  to the judge’s home to confront her  and, while there, shot her husband and  mother in cold blood.  The bill we have before us will allow  judges who have been threatened to  withhold certain personal information  from public record, information, such  as their home address, that has been  used in the past for the most tragic of  ends.  And  I want  to  emphasize  that  I  strongly support the bill and I commend the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee for bringing it to the floor  today. No one here wishes to avoid our  responsibility to protect those men and  women who form the bedrock of our  legal system, nor do any of us desire to  in any way detract from the significance of this bill.  However, Mr. Speaker, I believe that  this bill does not go far enough. My  conscience compels me to pause here  and remind my friends on the other  side of the aisle that we are discussing  a reform to the Ethics in Government  Act, which should be extended to really  talk about ethics in government, a vitally  important piece of  legislation  which, when it was passed, confirmed  the national commitment to the creation and preservation of the government as good and as ethical as the people it serves.  I, therefore, cannot let this moment  pass without speaking of what has become a standing source of shame for  this body and for this Nation: the collapse of ethical conduct within our  House. Mr. Speaker, I have no choice  but to speak of the topic here and now  because this is the last time the House  will address the subject of ethics this  year.

I think  that first we should salute the hard  work of Chairman OXLEYand Ranking  Member FRANK, as well as the hard  work of Subcommittee Chairman RICHARDBAKER, who just so eloquently explained why this legislation is so important not only to New York in the  aftermath of 9/11 but to every city in  the country that finds themselves in  the plight of terrorism and the reinsurance markets.  This is an opportunity for us to continue where the free market will not be  able to indemnify building owners as  we look at this across the country. I  think that the authors of this legislation, as the House passes this  later  today, give us a real opportunity to  move  forward with a  2-year opportunity to help the marketplace, the  building owners who are affected by  the need for coverage of this exposure,  while also recognizing that the  free  marketplace is not able to absorb this  without the governmental mechanism  that has been outlined as the intent of  the bill.  So I wholeheartedly support it. It is  something that will affect the buildings and the marketplace throughout  the country, and certainly my State is  one where it is vitally needed in order  to have coverage for the markets.

403,House,109,0.559,34,2005-12-07,Mr. LINDER.," Mr. Speaker, I am a co-sponsor of this legislation and I rise in strong support of H.R. 4096, the Stealth Tax Relief Act.  A couple of years ago, I got a call from my  daughter who asked, ‘‘What is the AMT and  why is it sneaking up on people like me?’’  As  a  proponent  of  tax  reform,  I  hear  phrases  like  that every day describing  the  AMT as part of ‘‘a tax code so out of control  that now it is sneaking up on the middle class  and threatening it with an unintended stealth  tax.’’ And while that phrase might indicate that  the code is an animate entity, it is also a fact  that ‘‘the AMT, since its enactment in 1969,  has been significantly modified  in 1971,  in  1976, in 1977, in 1978, in 1982, in 1986, in  1990, in 1993, and in 2001.’’  These facts send a clear reminder that we  have created a complex, convoluted monster  of a tax code that is constantly being amended with special provisions  targeted  to  treat  Americans differently. The  intentional harm  that the current code is causing in terms of  lost economic growth is bad enough. Now it  appears we have to worry about the unintentional harm the code inflicts as well.  The AMT  is a case study of our chaotic  code—it forces Americans to perform two tax  calculations, using two completely different set  of rules, and it’s so difficult to understand that  most taxpayers have to hire someone to figure  it out. And the reason we have the AMT is because  the code  is used  to promote various  goals  through preferential  tax  treatment. Because people were taking advantage of those  incentives, and reducing  their  income  taxes,  the AMT was created to make sure wealthy  people didn’t reduce  their  income  taxes  too  much. Now,  it  threatens  the entire middle  class.  Mr. Speaker,  I support every effort  to  improve this tax system and I strongly support  Mr. REYNOLDS’ bill to extend AMT relief for millions of U.S. taxpayers for an additional year.  But the AMT is just a symptom of a twisted  tax code that is now so broken that it routinely  results in these kinds of unintended tax consequences  and  undermines  hardworking  American workers every day.

Again, we have an opportunity to  stand up for free trade and pass the  U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement.  This is a simple matter. Free trade  delivers a greater choice of goods and  services  to American  consumers  at  lower prices. That means families can  buy more using less of their paychecks.  More trade means more competition,  and competition has always helped the  consumer. We have over 200 years of  history to prove that.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, over the past  few years, prices have dropped for a  wide array of goods and services which  are produced around the world, such as  video equipment and toys. Yet we pay  a lot more for products that do not effectively compete with foreign companies,  for example, prescription drugs  and cable television. Again, competition works. Trade works.

407,,109,-0.658,118,2005-12-07,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker,  today’s actions are a shameful disservice both  to our  soldiers  in  Iraq and  to Americans here at  home. Republicans are denying the Nation an  open debate on the war in Iraq. On tonight’s  agenda,  the Republicans not only have  replaced Mr. MURTHA’s resolution on  Iraq with  H.R. 571, a perversion of the Murtha Resolution  that Representative HUNTER introduced,  and which in no way conveys the sentiment of  Representative MURTHA’s proposal. They also  have had the temerity to characterize it as a  ‘‘Democratic proposal.’’  Representative MURTHA’s Resolution states  that, ‘‘The deployment of U.S. forces in Iraq,  by direction of Congress, is hereby terminated  and  the  forces are  to be redeployed at  the  earliest practicable date.’’ It also provides for  deploying a contingency capability outside of  Iraq, and requires America to pursue security  and stability  in  Iraq  through diplomacy. The  Republican  legislation contains none of  this  language.  I am a member of the ‘‘Out of Iraq Caucus’’  because I believe we should bring our troops  home from Iraq as soon as practicably possible, as does Representative MURTHA. The  citizens of this country deserve to have a true  floor debate on why this is right and on how  best to do it. Then their Representatives owe  them an up or down vote on this issue. Mr.  MURTHA’s speech should open serious hearings on the issue, followed by extensive debate on our policy in Iraq.  Mr. Speaker,  to paraphrase FDR: Tonight  it’s clear that the only thing the Bush White  House has to fear is public debate itself.  It is the height of hypocrisy for the Republican leadership to schedule a sudden, strait-  jacketed mini-debate and vote on their version  of Mr. MURTHA’s resolution. To understand this  hypocrisy its necessary to put their deceit in  context.  The House Majority Leadership has consistently refused  to allow  the House  to debate  H.J. Res. 55, an earlier bill offered by 63  House members  in a bipartisan  fashion.  It  would require the President to set forth a plan  for withdrawal from Iraq and to begin to implement it next fall. The Republican Leadership  has stonewalled efforts to have this bill considered in committee and brought to the Floor for  consideration. They have forced us to employ  the parliamentary  last  resort of  filing a discharge petition, in order to force the Leadership to let us debate H.J. Res. 55. The issue  before the House at this point is not even the  merits of that resolution. Instead, it is preservation of the basic democratic process and the  ability of the public to hear debate on the most  pressing issue facing this country.  Now, in a 180 degree reversal, the Leadership suddenly wants an abbreviated debate on  our policy for ending President Bush’s disaster  in  Iraq. Why  this bizarre  turn-around, Mr.  Speaker? The answer is simple. Mr. MURTHA,  the Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday struck fear  in the Leadership and the White House with  his statement of plain truths. Because of his  stature in this body, the gentlemen from Pennsylvania, with that single speech, shredded the  White House’s defense of its flawed policies.  Until now, the President and Vice President  have relied on questioning  the patriotism of  their critics on Iraq. They have hidden behind  the claim that—any critics of their war do not  support our  troops and do not  respect our  troops’ sacrifices. They have  repeated  that  outrageous mantra over and over, most disgracefully in President Bush’s remarks on Veterans Day.  Those false claims to discredit critics were  demolished  in one stroke by Mr. MURTHA’s  statement. The White House knows full well:  that  there  is no more patriotic Member of  this House,  that  there  troops more,  that there is no Member who has supported  our troops more, and  that there is no Member who has served in  our military more bravely than ",2005
408,,109,-0.265,118,2005-12-07,Mr. MURTHA.,"  The White House political spinners also realize that the American people are disgusted  when attacks on a patriot like Mr. MURTHAare  made by elected officials in the White House  who sought to evade military service in time of  war. So now they resort to this sleazy tactic.  They pretend to have the Nation consider the  issues raised by Mr. MURTHA’s candid analysis, but in reality they seek to sweep those  powerful remarks under the rug.  Then  they will pretend  that  the Congress  has seriously considered the tragic issues of  is no Member who  loves our  life and death and claim  that  this steam-  rollered vote reflects the fully-informed, considered opinion of our constituents. That’s nonsense.  This is a disgrace to the House, and more  important, it’s a disgrace to all that our men  and women in Iraq are fighting and dying for.  The American people and our soldiers deserve better  than  this cheap  trick. To  those  across  the aisle who want  to prevent  the  American people from learning the awful truths  about Iraq and who seek to stifle real national  debate, there is only one thing to say: ‘‘Shame  on you.’’  Mr. HUNTER’s charade should be defeated.  f  S.  136; TITLE  III—REDWOOD NATIONAL  PARK  BOUNDARY  ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2005  HON.

409,,109,-0.409,125,2005-12-07,Mr. KENNEDY of Rhode Island.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to express my enthusiastic support of subsidized  guardianship.  I understand  that many  times  grandparents or other  relatives become  the  primary caregivers  to children who are not  able  to  live with  their parents. This can become a significant financial challenge and we  must offer these families more resources. In  my home state of Rhode Island, 4,176 grandparents were financially responsible for meeting  their grandchild’s basic needs  in 2003.  Subsidized guardianship programs, which are  increasingly used by states around the country—including Rhode  Island—allow  children  living safely with relatives to exit formal foster  care and achieve legal permanence. That is  why  I am proud  to be a cosponsor of H.R.  3380, The Guardianship Assistance Promotion  and Kinship Support Act, which would allow  the use of  federal  funding  to support subsidized guardianship programs.  Today I offer my formal acknowledgement  and deepest appreciation for the ongoing service of these caregivers to our country and our  nation’s most valuable asset, our children.  f  HONORING THE CLASS ACT GROUP  OF MILITARY RETIREES  HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 7, 2005  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker,  today  is  the 64th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl  Harbor, the infamous day in 1941 that led us  into World War II. It is appropriate that I rise  today to honor the military retirees’ grassroots  organization known as the Class Act Group.  After nearly ten years of citizen advocacy, urging Congress  to  fully restore  their promised  military health care benefits, this noble group  of warriors has decided to call it a day and  close its offices.  CAG’s  roots date back  to July 16, 1996,  when attorney George E. Day filed a law suit  in Federal Court in Pensacola, Florida on behalf of retired Air Force Colonels William O.  Schism and Robert Reinlie. The suit alleged  breach of contract with military retirees over  the age of 65 years by the failure of the U.S.  to provide  the military medical care  it had  promised.  But George Day is not just any lawyer. Col.  George ‘‘Bud’’ Day (Retired) is a veteran of  more  than 30 years service  in  the Armed  Forces of the United States. He joined the Marine Corps in 1942 and served 30 months in  the South Pacific as a noncommissioned officer. He received an appointment as a Second  Lieutenant in the National Guard in 1950. He  was called to active duty in the Air Force in  1951. He served two tours in the Far East as  a fighter-bomber pilot during the Korean War.  In April 1967, Colonel Day was assigned to  the 31st Tac Fighter Wing at Tuy Hoa Air  Base, Republic of Vietnam. Shot down over  North Vietnam on August 26, 1967, he spent  67 months as a Prisoner of War. Colonel Day  was the only POW to escape from prison in  North Vietnam and then to be recaptured by  the Viet Cong in the South. He is also credited  with living through the first ‘‘no chute’’ bailout  from a burning jet fighter in England in 1955.  Colonel Day holds every significant combat  award. He is the nation’s most highly decorated officer since General Douglass MacArthur. He holds nearly seventy military decorations and awards of which more  than  fifty  are for combat. Most notable are the Medal of  Honor, the Air Force Cross, the Distinguished  Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Legion of  Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air  Medal with nine Oak Leaf Clusters, the Bronze  Star for Valor with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the  Bronze Star, the Purple Heart with three Clusters and  the POW ribbon. He wears  twelve  Campaign Battle Stars.  So, Mr. Speaker, Col. Day’s  long, distinguished record shows that he was a fighter in  the field defending his comrades and country  and, I can attest, he has been just as determined a fighter in the courtroom, too. He recruited his own army of grassroots soldiers  who, in town meetings and over the Internet,  gathered  together  to exercise  their constitutional freedoms to fight for their rights, just as  Thomas  Jefferson,  John Adams, Benjamin  Franklin and all the Founding Fathers imagined they would.  The CAG suit filed in 1996 was based on  the  fact  that agents of  the Federal Government—including military recruiters, active duty  members of the uniformed services, and other  government officials—routinely promised  that  the government would provide lifetime health  care to military retirees and their dependents  if they served a career of at least 20 years in  uniformed service.  The promise of lifetime care was made and  fulfilled  for generations, but until 1956 Congress had never passed a statute that specified what level of care would be provided. On  December 7, 1956 a new law took effect with  a provision  that provided  for health care at  military facilities on a ‘‘space available’’ basis.  This new law had the practical effect of defining and  limiting  the Federal Government’s  commitment to military retiree health care, by  conditioning such care on space availability.  In other words, after 1956, health care that  had been promised and routinely delivered for  years was no  longer assured. As military  bases began to close and downsize, the availability of health care became more and more  limited. Subsequent laws completely removed  Medicare-eligible military retirees from the military health care system.  The 1956  law  ‘‘changed  the  rules  in  the  middle of the game’’ for military retirees who  entered  the  service prior  to December 7,  1956. When they agreed to enter the service,  they had promises—a verbal contract—of lifetime health care  that routinely were  fulfilled.  When they left the service 20 or more years  later, they lived under a new set of rules. In  short, the health care rug was pulled out from  under them.  On November 18, 2002, a Federal Appeals  Court ruled that only Congress can authorize  the  level of health care  the government will  provide to military retirees; therefore, promises  made by military recruiters or government officials were not binding. On June 2, 2003, the  Supreme Court  declined  to  consider Col.  Day’s appeal of the ruling, putting an end to  the law suit.  Although the Appeals Court did not rule in  favor of  the plaintiffs,  the  language of  the  Court ruling was very clear that the plaintiffs  had won a moral victory:  Accordingly, we must affirm the district  court’s judgment and can do no more than  hope Congress will make good on the promises recruiters made in good faith to plaintiffs and others of the World War II and  Korean War era—from  1941  to  1956,  when Congress enacted its first health  care insurance act for military members, excluding older retirees. . . .  We cannot readily imagine more sympathetic plaintiffs than the retired officers of  the World War II and Korean War era involved in this case. They served their country for at least 20 years with the understanding that when they retired they and  their  dependents would  receive  full  free  health care  for  life. The promise of such  health care was made in good faith and relied upon. Again, however, because no authority existed to make such promises in the  first place, and because Congress has never  ratified or acquiesced to this promise, we  have no alternative but to uphold the judgment against the retirees’ breach-of-contract  claim. . . .  Perhaps Congress will consider using its  legal power to address the moral claims  raised by Schism and Reinlie on their own  behalf, and indirectly for other affected retirees.  Mr. Speaker, CAG  and  the  nationwide  grassroots group did in fact win a substantial  legislative  victory.  In  2000, Congress  responded  to an  intense national grassroots  campaign waged by military retirees by enacting Tricare  for Life  (TFL), which provides  health care to Medicare-eligible military retirees (generally age 65 or older). TFL did not  go all the way to fulfill the government’s promise of lifetime health care for our Nation’s warriors, but it was a substantial step forward in  that effort.  The military retirees grassroots group also  actively encouraged Congress to address the  unfulfilled health care needs of many younger  military  retirees who  find  they are not well  served by  the military health care system  known as Tricare Standard, a plan for retirees  who do not live near military bases that could  otherwise  provide  their  promised military  health care.  Mr. Speaker,  the men and women at  the  core of the Class Act Group have grown old  serving  their country. They were heroes  in  World War II, Korea and Vietnam. And they  were heroes in the courtroom and in the halls  of government fighting for their rights.  They have  fought  the good  fight, but as  good soldiers they know when it is time to regroup. Even with  the advent of TFL  these  grassroots warriors kept  fighting  for  full restoration of their promised health care. But they  know  that budget battles  in Congress have  gotten  tougher,  that  new  generations  of  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:11 Dec 08, 2005 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A07DE8.074 E07DEPT1 ",2005
410,House,109,-0.365,2,2005-12-16,Mr. LARSEN of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to honor the heroism of a man named Matthew Scott,  who nearly 9 years ago performed an  act of uncommon courage that saved  the life of a young woman in my congressional district.  In August  of  1997,  a  15-year-old  woman and her friend were driving on  a narrow, windy road near a dangerous  area called Deception Pass. Unable to  see the road, Leslie, the driver, drove  off a 185-foot cliff  into the  freezing  ocean below. Her passenger managed to  jump to safety from the truck before it  went over the edge. At the same time,  Matthew Scott, a young Naval Chief  Petty Officer, was driving by the location when he spotted a busted guardrail and a group of people pointing to  the waters below.  Matthew  scaled  down  the  treacherous, dark cliff with only a small  flashlight to guide him. At the bottom  of his 185-foot descent, he swam 30  yards out  in strong tides and  frigid  water to rescue Leslie who had suffered  a broken back, leg, and arm.

415,House,109,-0.272,107,2005-12-16,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for his effort at pulling  together this bill. Reforming immigration in this  Nation—and reinforcing the borders, as I have  advocated for over a year and a half—is a difficult proposition.  However,  the gentleman  from Wisconsin  and those that are in support of this bill do not  seem to understand the complexities of border  and  immigration policy. The bill before us  today would do little to solve the immigration  problem, and it is not what we need to reform  immigration policy and  to reinforce our borders.  Any effort by Congress to truly reform immigration and protect our borders must address  the  root  causes of  illegal  immigration. As  President Bush has stated, people come  to  the country to do the jobs Americans do not  want to do. We must understand that it is our  labor market that draws them to the U.S., and  we must address how the U.S. could absorb  the economic blow of losing this part of our  labor market that keeps prices artificially low  for consumers. Are businesses ready to pay  high wages to agriculture workers? Are Americans ready to absorb that cost and pay higher  prices for their produce?  An honest policy discussion  is needed  to  address  the complete problem—our broken  immigration system and the needs of our labor  market.  Although my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle claim this bill will secure our borders,  it does nothing of the sort. Nothing in this bill  guarantees funding for detention facilities, Border Patrol agents, immigration judges or prosecutors.  The single most important thing we can do  in Congress  is  invest  in homeland security.  However, our experience has been this: Numerous Members of Congress put forth ideas  about how to fix border security, but funding  these ideas has been impossible.  Let’s use 2005 as an example. One year  ago,  the  9/11  Commission  did  what  Congress’s current majority could not do: It investigated the events leading up to the attacks  on the United States, and made solid suggestions to the Nation about how the Government  could prevent similar attacks in the future.  On the issues of Border Patrol agents and  detention beds, the 9/11 Commission said the  very least the United States needed to do was  add 2,000 agents annually—for 10 years—and  8,000  detention  beds  annually. Congress  agreed, and passed the bill overwhelmingly.  How did the President and Congress react  when it came time to pay for it all? The President’s budget proposed  funding 200 Border  Patrol agents this year—that’s 1,800 short of  the least we should do—and 1,900 detention  beds—that’s  6,100  short  of  the  least we  should do.  Congress acted a  little better, passing an  emergency spending bill and a spending bill  for homeland security that netted us a total of  1,500 Border Patrol agents—still 500 short of  9/11  Commission  recommendations—and  4,250 detention beds—still 3,750 short of 9/11  Commission recommendations.  We are playing a shell game with our border  security and, by extension, our national security. On the one hand, every single elected official is for more border security. Yet, the leadership in Congress does not have the political  courage to pay for it.  This is what always hangs us up. There’s  no money and no political will to change the  equation.  The American people deserve an honest  debate on how to protect our homeland. All of  us in Congress understand the world changed  after September 11. For that reason, we must  put forth a solution to bring out of the shadows  the 8  to 11 million people who are  in  this  country now, paying  taxes and doing hard  labor and have an honest discussion, absent  the politics.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, the Congress has been negligent in dealing with the  challenge of border security, homeland security and immigration policy reform. We must do  what  is necessary  to protect our homeland  and implement comprehensive immigration reform. It is time to address these issues in a  meaningful way.  Unfortunately,  this  legislation  fails  to meet  the test. This bill does contain some important  provisions  that will enhance border security.  Indeed, the bill that emerged from the Homeland Security Committee was one that I could  basically support. Unfortunately, the Judiciary  Committee put politics over policy and added  a number of highly objectionable provisions.  Some of these provisions will turn a number of  well-intentioned and law abiding citizens into  criminals and felons. Other provisions penalize  many individuals who have come to this country lawfully but have, through no fault of their  own,  become  ensnared  in  a  bureaucratic  snafu with  the Citizenship and  Immigration  Services where if someone misses a deadline  by a day in changing their visa category they  can be prosecuted  for unlawful presence.  Moreover, visitors  from other countries who  are here on tourist visas but cannot return to  their country within  the visa  timeframe because of a natural disaster or the outbreak of  civil war will be made into criminals.  This bill is also flawed in a number of other  respects. First, it creates the dangerous illusion that we are addressing the most pressing  homeland security issues, when we are not.  The 9/11 Commission recently released its assessment of the progress being made by the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:45 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00107 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H16DE5.REC H16DE5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2005
416,Senate,109,-0.212,184,2005-12-16,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, shortly,  we will complete legislative business  and adjourn for the year. Senators will  leave to spend the holidays with our  families. Senators will travel to the  comfort of our homes.  But there are still those in the gulf  region who do not have homes.  Hurricane Katrina struck almost 4  months ago. We cannot, in good conscience, conclude our action  for the  year without passing tax relief for the  gulf region.  The legislation before us today is a  good bill. We must pass it today.  In September,  I was pleased  that  Congress  could  come  together  and  quickly pass emergency tax relief for  victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Prior to passing that legislation, I  promised that I would work with my  colleagues to draft a long-term tax relief package. And that is what we did.  We worked to create legislation that  would help rebuild homes and businesses. We worked to create legislation  that would pump money  into  local  economies. And we worked to create  legislation that would help distressed  working families.  We must come together again. We  must pass this legislation today.  On November 18th, the Senate passed  the tax reconciliation bill. We included  Hurricane tax relief. We included Alternative Minimum Tax relief. And we  included more than a dozen important  tax provisions that expire on December  31st, including the Work Opportunity  Tax Credit and the Research and Development Tax Credit.  With the help of many, Chairman  GRASSLEYand I fit all of that legislation within  the  constraints  of  the  budget resolution’s instructions.  But the House did not take up our  bill. Instead, the House passed hurricane relief and Alternative Minimum  Tax relief outside of the budget reconciliation process. Then the next day,  the House passed a tax reconciliation  bill.  Why did the House need three bills to  achieve what the Senate succeeded in  passing in one bill?  The reason is simple. The reason is  the capital gains and dividends tax cut.  I am disappointed in the House. I am  disappointed that Congress could not  pass all the important tax relief that  the Senate did in one bill.  And that is why we have the legislation before us today, the House hurricane tax relief bill.  The  amendment  that  Chairman  and I have crafted to this  bill recognizes that to revitalize the  gulf region, the region must have a  strong economy. We must encourage  individuals to return. And that means  that there must be jobs for them to return to. This  legislation gives businesses help to create those jobs.  We would provide bonus depreciation.  We would increase small business expensing limits. We would also provide  new authority for tax-favored private  activity and mortgage bonds.  We would also extend to victims of  Hurricanes Rita and Wilma some of the  tax relief that we provided to victims  of Hurricane Katrina  in September.  This  includes penalty-free early tax-  free withdrawals  from pensions and  IRAs. We would allow victims to fully  deduct casualty losses. And we would  remove the cap on allowable corporate  charitable contributions made  in response to the hurricanes.  And thanks to the hard work and persistence of  the good Senators  from  Florida and Texas, we have been able  to forge an agreement to provide extra  low-income housing benefits  for  the  Rita and Wilma hurricane zones. My  good friend from Florida, Senator NELSON, has made the convincing case that  these devastated areas need more assistance with low-income housing, and  I am pleased to say this bill will be providing that very help.  The substitute that Senator GRASSLEYand I offer today provides $8 billion  GRASSLEY in tax relief for the gulf region. We  take the House bill, but we provide additional tax relief for employers and  students to encourage people to return  to the gulf region.  One item of particular importance to  me is tax relief to employers who continued to pay their workers after the  hurricanes struck. Employers located  in the Katrina, Rita, and Wilma disaster zones will be able to take up to a  $2,400 tax credit on wages paid to employees during the period the business  was shut down. These business owners  have tapped into their savings to help  out their workers. They deserve tax relief. We provided this relief in our first  bill, but it was limited to small employers. I have always felt and argued  strongly that any employer that helps  out their workers while the business is  shut down deserves this assistance. I  am very pleased that we were able to  eliminate this cap, and extend this relief for the Rita and Wilma zones as  well.  Another priority  item  for me  is a  provision to encourage students to return to the gulf region. Many colleges  and universities were  forced to shut  down after Hurricane Katrina and students have been scattered across the  country. To encourage these students,  and new students as well, to come back  to the gulf region, we double the Hope  Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax  credits.  Students  from  around  the  country would be able to take a credit  up  to  $4,000  for  tuition,  room and  board, books, and  fees  for attending  college in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. I was very pleased that  we could include this benefit in our  Senate version and that we have retained it in this substitute. I think it  will be extremely valuable to the colleges and universities who have really  suffered from this hurricane.  One further priority item for me is  the additional $1 billion in new markets  tax  credit  authority  for  the  Katrina zone. I fought to get this credit in our Senate version because I am  convinced  this program works. The  program provides access to capital for  small businesses through established  community development entities. Entities with a significant mission of rebuilding in the hurricane zone may access  these additional  tax credits  in  order to help these struggling businesses rebuild. These businesses may  not be able to utilize some of the other  tax benefits in the bill, but access to  capital will help many of them stay in  business and stay in the zone.  One last item that I would like to  highlight is an employer credit for providing housing for workers and their  families. My good  friend  from Louisiana, Senator LANDRIEU, offered this  provision during our floor debate last  month. And if I could just take a moment to point out to our colleagues the  tremendous work she has done on this  bill. She has truly been our compass  during these negotiations and has been  essential in conveying the true plight  of her constituents.

But that  isn’t JONCORZINE’s style. JONis a committed ‘‘workhorse,’’ who works long  hours with high intensity. He doesn’t  have a lot of flash, but he is very effective.  He came to Washington for one reason: to serve the people of New Jersey.  Now, with some sorrow on my part, he  is leaving us here for the same reason:  to help New Jersey even more directly.
