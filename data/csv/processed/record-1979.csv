1,Senate,96,-0.598,119,3,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, for 13  years  I have spoken  in  this Chamber  thousands  of  times on  the Genocide  Convention and,  in fact, almost every  day we have been in session, on how it  relates to current issues and on specific  arguments pro and con. In dealing with  the many and complex  facets of  the  Genocide Convention, we must not lose  sight of its original purpose and the his tory of its tribulations.  The Genocide Convention was pro posed at the first session of the United  Nations on November 2, 1946-1946-a  world reeling in the aftermath of  the  holocaust, a world shocked by the hor rifying crime which defined  the word  ""genocide,"" a world determined never to  let this happen again. But, Mr. Presi dent,  this determination has danger ously been allowed to fade.  The United States was party to  the  unanimous U.N. adoption of the Geno cide Convention in 1948. Soon afterward,  President Truman, realizing the signifi cance of  the  treaty,  transmitted  the  Genocide Convention to the Senate. Mr.  President,  every President  since  that  time has, as well, strongly endorsed the  Convention.  The Foreign Relations Committee and  Subcommittee have since 1950 consist ently  recommended  the  Convention  favorably  to the Senate.  The American Bar Association, which  for many years had hesitations about the  Convention, now unequivocally supports  it.  Mr. President, every argument against  the Genocide Convention has long since  been resolved.  The Genocide Convention was the first  human rights resolution of the United  Nations and it is still the most important.  Ratification by  the U.S. Senate  is-es sential for the treaty to have the world wide consequence it should have. There  is only one way for us to demonstrate  our convictions: We must act now  to  ratify the Genocide Convention.  Mr. President, I yield  the floor and  suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",1979

3,Senate,96,-0.426,158,3,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing a bill to correct an egre gious wrong that happened 34 years ago  last month. Many of us are .familiar with  the story of Pvt. Eddie Slovik, the only  man executed by the United States for  desertion since the Civil War. Over 20,000  desertions  occurred  in  the European  theater in World War II, some of these  resulted  in general courts-martial and  convictions, 49 were sentenced to death,  but only one was shot: Eddie Slovik.  His widow  is still alive,  though her  physical condition and spiritual strength  appear to be waning. Recently, Mrs. Slo vik was admitted to a hospital suffering  from a multitude of ailments; not the  least being frustration and defeat.  Mrs. Slovik has been living as a vir tual pauper for all these years, and has  been fostering the hope that some relief  would be forthcoming from the Govern ment. She has filed appeals and taken  the required bureaucratic steps to obtain  the life insurance benefits from a Gov ernment policy in her husband's name.  None of these efforts has been success.ful.  The circumstances surrounding the de sertion, trial and execution of Eddie Sla vik are by no means clear. His Army  counsel has suggested that Eddie Slovik's  due process was denied. These questions  may never be resolved, but one fact re mains; a lonely woman has suffered for  many years and has but one remaining  hope.  The legislation that I introduce would  mandate the payment of those life in surance benefits with accrued interest to  Mrs. Slovik. Congressman RANGEL has  introduced  a  similar measure  in  the  House and,  last year, President Carter  indicated his support for such measures.  I  believe  that compassion and  justice  should guide using the consideration of  this legislation. This is a chance to alle viate some of the suffering and indignity  that Mrs. Slovik has undergone, and I  urge the adoption of this bill.

33,,96,-0.478,236,3,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, the suc cess of social security has always rested  on the foundation of public confidence in  the Government's determination to ful fill its commitments under the system.  In her  recent  letter  to  the editor,  which appeared in the New York Times  of February 9, Elizabeth Wickenden per suasively  argues  against  ""tinkering""  with promised benefits as a means of  freeing funds for other Federal purposes.  I  find her letter particularly illumi nating and I  commend  it to my col leagues attention:  SOCIAL  SECURITY:  DON'T  BENEFITS  ""TINKER"" WITH  of  To the Editor:  The Times has been a staunch and knowl edgeable  defender  of  Social  Security  throughout  the system's long and highly  successful history. The <two indispenS81ble in gredients of that success have been stabillty  institutional  arrangemeilltl.5  and  confi dence on the part of  the public that the  Government will fulfill its commitments un der itJhe system.  These have depended,  in turn, on long range planning to maintain the delicate bal ance bebween contributions pa.id in by fu ture beneficiaries and benefits paid out, as  promised,  to the currently retired, the dis aJbled and  those deprived by death of the  family breadwinner.  It ls >therefore disappointing to find The  Times,  in its editorial of Feb. 1,  treating  Social Security benefilts as if they were just  another element in the current Federal budg et. President Carter himself has modified  his origin.a,! recommendation to this etrort by  requesting  (in his Supplemental State of  the Union Message of Jan. 25)  the two al ready existing statutory 'bodies on Social SeFebruary 21, 1979  fi curity to consider his recommendations as  part of  their overall examination of  this  complex system.  No one is objecting to a considered review  of the system with respect  to benefits,  nancing and demographic factors. What is  objectionable  is  to  tinker with promised  benefits in a given fiscal budget as a means  of freeing .funds !or other Federal purposes.  Social Security in the United States is a  self-contained,  self-financing  system  .and  should be so trealted. The best way to assure  his original recommendation to this effect by  Sena.tor Ohurch:  to create an independent  Social Security board to administer the pro gram and to separate its financing entirely  from  the consolidated Federal budgett.  As a postscript, I must, as an advocate for  children, protest The Times's cha.ractertza tion of the ""heart of Social Security"" as ""ba sic income and medical care for the old and  disabled."" Not only a.re five million children  currently receiving monthly Social Seou.rity  benefits bwt the life insurance protection or  the system has major immediate value  to  the younger working families now paying So cial Security truces.

DON EDWARDS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 21, 1979  e ",1979
34,,96,-0.599,236,3,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I am today introducing legis lation to prohibit the aerial spraying of  the chemical 2,4,5-T and other chem icals containing dioxin in our national  forests.  The chemical 2,4,5-T has been used in  the United States in the spraying of our  forest, range, and agricultural lands for  some  30  years.  It  is  used  to  kill  forest underbrush, control weeds, and  clear brush. In recent years there has  been growing concern about the health  hazards posed by the use of  this sub stance. The chemical 2,4,5-T contains  as an unavoidable contaminant a sub stance known as TCDD <tetra-chloro dibenzo-dioxin)  or dioxin, one of  the  most toxic substances known. It is the  presence of  this dioxin which  is  the  source of this concern.  My own alarm over  the use of  this  chemical has been increasing over the  last year. I first became involved in this  issue  through my work on the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee. As my col leagues know, the committee has been  looking into allegations of serious health  difficulties being encountered by Vietnam  veterans as a  result of  their exposure  while in Vietnam to a defoliant known as  Agent Orange. Agent Orange contains  2,4,5-T, and  thus  the dioxin contami nant.  Many Vietnam veterans have  come  forth  to  file  claims  for compensation  for such health problems as numbness in  limbs, weight  loss,  fatigue,  chloracne,  psychological  problems,  cancer,  and  birth defects in children they parent. The  veterans have alleged that these ailments  are the result of their exposure to Agent  Orange.  ",1979
35,,96,-0.041,262,3,Mr. FOUNTAIN.," Mr.  Speaker,  on  January 31, I introduced H.R. 1664, the  Federal Constitutional Convention Pro cedures Act. The purpose of this legis lation is to provide procedures for call ing Constitutional Conventions for pro posing amendments to the Constitution,  on application of two-thirds of the State  legislatures, pursuant to article V of the  Constitution.  We are faced with the real possibility  that in the very near future 34 States  will have petitioned  the Congress  to  call a  convention  for  the purpose of  proposing a balanced budget amendment  to the Constitution.  Yet the Nation is completely unpre pared for such an eventuality, because  the Congress has never taken action to  spell out in detail the terms of the Con vention alternative set forth  in article  v.  H.R. 1664 provides an authoritative  basis for resolving many of the sensitive  questions posed in connection with the  article V Convention provision-all of  which are matters of fundamental con stitutional concern. My bill would estab lish the basic ground rules for a Con vention,  thereby  reducing  the chances  of chaos and constitutional crisis which  might well ensue from a runaway con vention.  For  example,  the  legislation would  achieve this objective by specifying the  details of  the application process,  in cluding an application's effective period  and  the  question  of  rescissions;  by  spelling out the congressional role once  the requisite number of applications has  been received, including determining the  validity of applications and  issuing a  convention call; by providing  for  the  selection of delegates to the Convention,  the selection of officers and other routine  business, the Convention's scope of delib erations, its duration, and the limits to  be placed on the subject matter of any  proposed amendments it might adopt;  and by prescribing congressional respon sibilities after a proposed amendment  has been approved by the convention.  This legislation reflects the construc tive efforts of the distinguished former  senior Senator  from North Carolina,  Sam J. Ervin,  Jr., who guided  it  to  passage by the Senate in 1971 <S. 215  of the 92d Congress)  and, in identical  form, again in 1973 <S. 1272 of the 93d  Congress).  In fact, H.R. 1664  technically differs  from the Ervin legislation in only two  respects. Sections 2 and 3(b) have been  slightly  altered so as  to make  clear  that the Congress would have the power  to determine  the validity not only of  applications  transmitted  to  the Con gress after the enactment of the bill but  also of applications transmitted before  enactment. The Ervin  version would  appear to be applicable only to resolu tions submitted after enactment.  Mr. Speaker, I might also point out  that section lO(a) of H.R. 1664 provides  that a convention may propose amend ments by a two-thirds vote of the total  number of delegates. When the Senate  passed S. 215 in 1971, much debate, and  a floor vote, occurred on the question of  whether it should take a two-thirds ma jority, or only a simple majority, to pro pose an amendment--Senator Ervin ad hered to the latter point of view although  the Senate -adopted the two-thirds stand ard. While I am not unalterably wedded  to the two-thirds figure, I do at this time  believe it to be preferable since a  two thirds majority  in each House  re quired under article V for the Congress  itself  to propose  an  amendment di rectly-an integral part of our system of  checks and balances with regard to the  amendatory process.  While  I personally prefer  the Con gress proposing an amendment to bal ance the budget rather than a convention  doing so, and have sponsored separate  legislation to that effect, I want to em phasize that the primary purpose of H.R.  1664 is to put into statutory form the  processes governing a convention should  a congressional call become mandatory  under article V. This bill's purpose  wholly procedural,  though basic ques tions of powers and prerogatives are ob viously  involved. And, with  respect  to  those questions, I believe that a sensi ble and salutary balance is struck in this  legislation between the interests of the  States and  those of  the Congress-all  is  is  with a view toward preserving constitu tional integrity.  The framers of the Constitution un questionably  intended  the  convention  method of proposing amendments to be  an attainable means of constitutional  change. Moreover, the Congress has the  obligation  to  legislate on  this subject  now, without the sort of emergency fever  pitch which might well be prevailing  later, and try to prevent ahead of time  the procedural quagmire which could  transform a convention into a constitu ..  tional nightmare.  Mr. Speaker,  the Advisory Commis sion on Intergovernmental Relations, on  which I am privileged to represent the  House, urged in 1971  the enactment of  legislation of this type. Two years later,  a special study committee of the Ameri can Bar Association also  reached  the  conclusion that such legislation is needed  to remove unintended obstacles in the  way of legitimate use of the convention  approach to amending the Constitution.  For these reasons, I believe that early  action  on  this  legislation  is  crucial.  Further delay could well place the Na tion in a regrettable situation-perhaps  even  this year.  I,  therefore, urge  the  Judiciary Committee to give serious and  timely  consideration  to  this pressing  matter so that the Congress might satisfy  a  long-neglected constitutional respon sibility.

37,,96,-0.318,275,3,Mr. GIAIMO.," Mr. Speaker, the 96th  Congress is receiving, and will continue  to receive, substantial pressure to join  the ""Balanced-Budget Drive"" which  is  taking place in many States. The im mediate objective of this movement is to  urge Congress  to call a  constitutional  convention to pass an amendment to re quire  that the Federal budget be bal anced. Enough Members have asked my  views  regarding  these  proposals  prompt me to share my thoughts with  all Members of the House.  Let me first make a distinction be tween the concept of a balanced Federal  budget and a constitutional amendment  to require a balanced Federal budget.  First, I know of no Congressman who  likes budget deficits. We all support the  concept of a balanced budget and we are  working hard to achieve that goal. Last  fall, for example, while we were not as  successful as we hoped we would be, Con gress passed a budget resolution which  contained the lowest deficit in the past 5  years. We are moving in the right direc tion and in a deliberative manner which  takes  into account national economic  conditions.  But while I support balancing the Fed2985  eral budget, I am wary of tampering with  our Constitution to accomplish that ob jective. I am very suspicious of what ap pears to be a ""quick-fix"" for what are  extremely complicated fiscal problems.  Initially, we must  remind ourselves  that the Federal Government is not a  State and does not manage its fiscal and  financial affairs like a State. No State  budget is an economic policy document.  No single State's budget transaction, or  for that matter all the States combined,  has the same kind of effect on economic  trends and conditions as has the Federal  budget. No State is responsible for pro viding for our national defense or aid to  State governments.  Aside from the substantial legal ques tions involved, we need to know a great  deal more about the fiscal impact of the  constitutional amendments being pro posed. We should know what the long term as well as short-term effects will be  before we jump on this bandwagon. We  need  remember  the important role  Federal stimulus programs play when our  economy is weak and the delicate rela tionship between the economy and the  Federal budget. Three years ago,  the  Joint Economic Committee summarized  this very well:  to  The Federal deficit  ls the result of eco nomic conditions as well as tax and spending  policy. For example, if t'he rate of inflation  is high causing money income to rise, people  will be pushed into higher tax brackets and  Federal tax receipts will rise. If the economy  is depressed  so  that personal  income and  profits decline, then Federal tax receipts also  decline. If the unemployment rate is high,  Federal spending for unemployment compen sation and other income support programs  will rise. In order to assess the consequences  of a deficit, we must consider the state of  the economy at the time the deficit occurs.  We need to examine what constitutes  the term ""balanced-budget"" as it is used  by the States and as it is used in the  various proposed constitutional amend ments. Some experts have claimed that  if the Federal Government used the same  accounting approaches as most states  use,  the current Federal budget would  be close  to being balanced rather than  showing a deficit of almost $40 billion.  The National Governors' Association has  been quoted as saying  thaJt ""although  State governments operate on balanced  general fund budgets, they may still incur  debt by borrowing funds  through  the  bond market and spending the borrowed  funds through separate capital budgets.""  If we are to imitate the states in this  wiay, we need to analyze the impact of  establishing a  separate capital budget  at the Federal level. Will moving major  Federal borrowing programs out of the  traditional Federal budget result in Con gress losing budgetary control of these  activities?  Also, shifting activities from one Fed er,al budget to another could inevitably  lead  budget gimmickry.  Ingenious  Federal officials could quickly discover  ways to subvert the whole purpose of the  amendment. If this occurred, the result  could be a mockery of our Constitution.  Finally, we also need to examine the  effect of such a constitutional require ment on Federal programs. A constitu tional amendment could place the Conto  ",1979

A Member does not have  to wait  until they are brought up.

But more than that, Mr. President, if  the amendment is really substantive and  the amendment is really germane, that  is all  the more reason for passing my  amendment, because you are not doing  anything about precloture. Therefore, if  the opportunity to amend is only post cloture do we really want to adopt a rule  which is going to cut off germane, legit imate, and substantive amendments?

42,Senate,96,-0.319,366,3,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, today I  am reintroducing a bill designed to deal  with a serious inequity, currently legal,  which alJows insurance companies to re duce private disability benefits paid to  policyholders by the amount of cost of  living  increases in social security pay ments.  Congress, in providing periodic cost of  living  increases in social security pay ments, intended to allow the income of  beneficiaries to keep pace with inflation.  That  intent  is  completely  subverted  when  insurance companies can reduce  benefit payments by the amount of the  cost-of-living  increases. By using  that  practice insurance companies force dis abled social security beneficiaries to live  on fixed incomes subject to the ravages  of  inflation, while  earning an unfair  windfall profit themselves on each in crease in social security payments. The  disabled, who may well be unable to sup plement  their  income with other em ployment and who often  require ever  more expensive medical treatment, can  ill afford to have the cost-of-living in creases  intended for  them diverted  to  subsidize insurance companies.  Therefore, I wish to take some correc tive action. My bill will accomplish the  reform so urgently needed in this area  without disturbing the customary State  regulation of the insurance industry. It  amends the 1974 Employee Retirement  Income Security Act and the 1954 In ternal Revenue Code to prohibit the ac crual of increased social security bene fits toward defraying, reducing, or sub rogating the payments owed beneficiaries  under private insurance contracts.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 476  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States  of  America in Congress assembled, That section  206 (b) of the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974 is amended by striking  out ""pension plan""  in paragraph  (1)  and  inserting in lieu thereof ''-employee welfare  benefit plan"".  SEC.  2.  (a) Section 264 of  the Internal  Revenue Code of 1954  (relating  to certain  amounts paid in connection with insurance  contracts)  is amended by adding at the end  thereof the following new subsection:  '' ( d)  Certain  Disability  Compensation  Plans.-Notwithstanding  the provisions of  sections 162, 212, and 404, no deduction shall  be allowed for amounts paid or contributed  to or under a disability compensation plan  by  the employer maintaining that plan if  under the plan the benefits payable to an  individual receivlng benefits under the plan  are  reduced, or any scheduled  increase in  such benefits is omitted. on account of any  increase  in monthly  insurance .benefits  to  which such an individual is entitled under  title II of the Social Security Act if such  increase occurs after such individual begins  to receive benefits under suqh plan. For pur poses of this subsection, the term 'disability  compensation plan' means a program  (in cluding a program of insurance) established  by an employer under which employees re ceive periodic payments or a lump-sum pay ment in compensation for physical or men tal disability resulting from their employ ment."".  (b) (1) The caption of section 264 of such  Code  is amended by inserting after ""CON TRACTS"" the following: ""OR UNDER CER TAJN  DISAKLITY  COMPENSATION  PLANS"".

This is to support action taken  to secure answers and necessary correc tive steps through HEW, GAO and other  appropriate authorities. The news arti cles follow:  rFrom the Power County (Ida.ho) Press,  Apr. 20, 1978)  COUNTY  SUPPORTS  NON-SUPPORTIVE  CLINIC  (By Micha.el H. O'Donnell}  Power County taxpayers a.re helping pa.y  one medical clinic to compete a.gs.inst an other tax-supported clinic a.nd hospital.  Ta.x supported rent a.nd renovations pay ments have helped bring physicians  into  American Fa.Us for a. total of a.bout 30 hours  a week a.nd have not stimulated the  local  hospl ta.I economy.  The Power County Hospital has a. two-year  agreement to pay the Southeast Idaho Fam ily Medical and Educational Services  (SIF MES), American Fa.Us Medical Center rent  a.nd  1utlllties costs of $225 per month. A  $3,227 county warrant paid for bullding re novation of the clinic in June 1977.  During  that  same  period of  time,  the  county has paid to support the operation of  the hospital and the Power County Clinic.  All  the revenue made at the county-sup ported clinic  ls returned to the county to  defray the cost of a.  two-year contract with  Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI),  a. Sa.It Lake City firm.  ""When the HSRI clinic became established  in American Falls, we changed from a. sup portive cllnic for the hospital to a. competi tive one,"" Dr. Samuel Romeo, founder of the  SIFMES organization, said.  American Fa.Us Medical Center has placed  22 patients in the county hospital since it  began operation more than a. year ago. The  SIFMES operation has logged approximately  5,000 patient visits during that same  time  period.  Most of the in-patient care needed by SIF MES cllnlc patients ls obtained in Pocatello  hospitals.  according to SIFMES  adminis trator Lionel Oberlln. The SIFMES head  office  in Pocatello said  they did not have  accurate figures on ithe number of American  Falls  patients  admitted  to  hospitals  in  Pocatello.  SIFMES did offer  staff  the hospital  emergency room with a physician's assistant,  but the hospital refused on the grounds of  a.n existing by-law. The la.w requires a. physi cian to live within 10 miles of the hospital  before obtaining hospital privileges.  ""OUr physician assistants provide exquisite  care,"" Romeo said.  Romeo said the SIFMES corporation util izes  the ""modern hospital concept"" of ad mitting less patients for in-patient care. He  said the clinics in the organization admit  a.bout two percent of all patients sent to hos pitals for care. The American Falls Medical  to  $78,000 grant  $141,000 grant  Center would  lia.ve  referred about 100 pa tients  to Pocatello hospitals  last year  if  Romeo's estimate is correct.  Ward Alexander was vice-chairman of the  hospital board d,uring the time the county  hospital made  support  agreements with  SIFMES.  ""They  indicated  they would get  someone over here,"" Alexander said.  ""They  are  not  performing  the  service  needed in American Fa.Us,"" the former board  member  said. He  added he  thought  the  SIFMES group was concerned a.bout the hos pital operation, but they are apparently not  concerned.  Romeo said it was true that SIFMES indi cated they would place a. resident physician  in American Falls. ""We've spent many hun dreds of dollars trying,"" he said. He said the  SIFMES cllnic was not taking new business  a.way from the county hospital.  ""Almost 10 percent of my private practice  in Pocatello was American Falls patients  before the SIFMES clinic opened,"" Romeo  said.  Romeo said he began negotiations with  grant institutions in 1976 prior to the time  the county signed a contract with HSRL. Be fore the gran,ts became a.va.lla.ble, the Amer ican Falls medical  situation changed,  ac cording to Romeo.  The American Falls SIFMES clinic did re ceive  a.  from  the Kellogg  Foundation as aci,ministered by the Hospital  Research  and Education Trust, Chicago.  More  than  400 programs applied  for  the  grants and less than 20 were recipients, ac cording to a Hospital Research and Educa tion Trust spokesman.  The SIFMES clinic in American Falls re ceived $94,000 of the grant ln 197'7. The clinic  was also  a.warded half of  a.  from HEW for migrant health care last year.  Romeo said some of the migrant funds have  been utilized yet.  Despite the fact the county pays the rent  and funded renovation of the clinic and the  operation received a Kellogg grant, Romeo  said lt is opera.ting ""way in the hole.""  SIFMES office staff said  the average pa tient visit brings $14 into the clinic and the  collection  rate  last year was  65' percent.  'Dhese figures  indicate that the clinic gen erated $45,500 in patient revenue ln the past  12 months.  The clinic received $31,000 of the remain ing Kellogg grant the first of this year.  Total  income  for  the clinic was about  $170,500 during the first 12 months of lts op eration. The most expensive operating cost  for the clinic is physician services, according  to SIFMES administrator Lionel Oberlin.  Operating expenses other than physidans  services include equipment valued at $12,000  according t,o a list given to the Power County  assessor bv Oberlin. Supplies cost the clinic  a.bout $2,500 a. month, according to SIFMES,  for a. itotal of $30,000.  Two of the American Falls clinic employees  a.re CETA funded, but SIFMES paid the wages  for the office mama.ger and pa.rt of last year  for a registered nurse, according to Romeo.  The clinic is open from 8 a..m. to 5 p.m.,  Monday through Friday. SIFMES has a con tract with the Family Medical Center. Poca tello, for physician services at the cllnic. Dr.  Romeo  is a  profit-sharing partner  ln  the  Family Medical Center.  Four different Pocatello doctors, Dr. Lou  Wlllia.ms, Dr.  Jack Summers, Dr. Dennis  Minister and Dr. Michael Baker rotate visd.ts  to the American F1alls clinic ea.ch week. Dur ing an average week none of the doctors  spendS more than 12 hours working in Ameri can Falls.  The contract with Fa.niily Medical Center  also includes a. full-time physician's a.ss!st ant, Dennis Royston, who works at  the  STFMES clinic four days a week from 8 a.m.  to 5 p.m.  The cost of the physiciam services contra.cts  with Famlly Medical Center was not spec1fled  by Oberlin but the SIFMES a.dminlstra.tor did  say the aver,age cost would be about $50,000  for a. full time physician per year.  Romeo said the American Fa.lls clinic has  a contra.ot for one and one-half physicians  plus a physician's assistant. Although doctors  a.re only in the clinic about 30 hours a. week,  Romeo said they a.re on call 24 hours a. d,a.y.  The extra one-half doctor charged on the  contract is for compensation of this call time,  a.ocording to Romeo.  Tota.I contract cost for a. yea.r's phys.icla.n  services at the SIFMES clinic would be ap proximately $90,000,  according  to SIFMES  figures.  The doctors working in the American Falls  clinic spend most of their work week in, the  Family Medical Center practice ln Pocatello.  ""We do believe that the key to our success  in American Fa.Us  is a  resident physician,""  Romeo said. He added the SIFMES clinic does  provide an option for patients who do not  want ,to use the Power County Hospital.  ""Our clinic sends patients to the hospital  they request,"" SIFMES administrator Ober lin said. He said the American Falls ccm muni ty ""does not want to acknowledge"" the  fact the past doctor shortage established a.  ha.bit  of  obtaining medical  services  in  Pooa.tello.

O'Donnell)  A publicly supported corporation ls appar ently pumping business into a profit-making  medical clinic.  The non-profit SIFMES corporation shares  building  space, doctor  services and board  members with the Family Medical Center, a  profit-making private practice in Pocatello.  Although  the SIFMES  four-clinic group  has  received about $700,00  in grants and  government support, it is opera.ting ""in the  red,""  according  to  administrator  Lionel  Oberlin.  The American Fa.Us cllnic  ls just one of  four clinics in the corporation. The largest  operating expense for ,the clinics is the pay ment  for physicians services, according  to  Oberlln. The Famlly Medical Center Poca tello,  holds most  of  the  contract with  SIFMES for their service.  Southeast Idaho Family Medical and Edu cational Services, Inc.

I guess he  is  the closest thing to a  Senator. The fact, as the Senator from  Alaska has pointed out, that he served  in the Senate 48 years and has been mar ried 49 years means that Mrs. Dompierre  has led a very difficult life for all but 1  thank the Senator  year of their marriage, and I hope that  the  period  which  is  beginning  on  Wednesday will be a period of great hap piness for both of them, in which they  will have  time  to enjoy each other's  company and to enjoy the company of  their family.  I have a particular interest in their  family. Mr. and Mrs. Dompierre have  two daughters, o:ne of whom, Mrs. Not tingham, has been a member of my staff  for a number of years.  We share a number of things in com mon; among them the fact that we both  served in the U.S. Navy during World  War II, and I think that really demon strates the consistent sense of patriot i3m and dedication that Mr. Dompierre  has brought to this job over the years.  The very desk from which I am speak ing at this moment is a desk which was  at one time used by a great Member, one  of the giants, who served in this body,  Arthur Vandenberg, and it is appropriate  that I should speak from this desk be cause Dom served with Senator Vanden berg as well as with Senator Ferguson.  He has been floor assistant to the Sen ate minority leaders, men such as Sena tor Knowland and Senator Dirksen, so  he has had an integral part in the work  of the Senate for almost half a century.  He has known what was happening  Lefore it happened, and in some cases I  suspect he made it happen.  It is  the kind of staff career which  is absolutely essential to the smooth and  efficient functioning of the U.S. Senate.  Without people of this level of compe tence and this depth of experience, the  U.S. Senate could not be the institution  that it is today.

51,House,96,-0.311,561,3,Mr. WEAVER.," Mr. Speaker, in 1973,  when our oil was cut off from overseas,  we all said: ""We must act. We must be come energy independent.""  And what did we do? We did nothing.  And the result? The greatest recession  since the thirties and the forerunner of  things to come.  Did we learn from this? Did we act?  Did we cut back on our use of energy?  No. Instead, we sharply increased our  energy use. Since 1972 our oil use has not  decreased but has gone up 20 percent.  Imports are up 80 percent. We continue  to squander. We live on the edge of a  precipice. And any moment a disruption  of oil supplies can plunge us into depres sion. So today, with the instability in the  Mideast, this could happen at any time.  Where does our oil go? Forty percent  goes  to  industry;  40  percent goes  to  transport; 15 percent goes to electricity;  and 5 percent goes  to feedstocks. So if  we have a sudden 20 percent cutback,  where would it come from? Out of what?  Half would come from our industry and  it will close down half our travel.  As far as our national security  our  Nation is threatened, and we talk ~fin creasing defense budgets and building  more bombs and guns and missiles and  planes and tanks and ships. Yet we are  in far greater danger of running out of  gas before we run out of bombs.  ~oes the Qovernment not understand  this? Ca~ they not see what situation we  are in? And if they understand it, why  are they not doing something about it?  We are paralyzed. It is pathetic. The  times and the people cry out for leader ship, for bold moves.  For even if there is no disruption one  thing is sure: Prices will increase.' Our  dollars will flow overseas in even larger  numbers,  joining the 600 billion Euro dollars which now hang like a sword of  Damocles over our financial stability.  Mr. Speaker, how much  longer can  seas  to pay for oil we squander here.  Answer: Not a moment. It is already too  we afford to send $50 or $60 billion over late. We are suffering crippling inflation  because of excessive use of high price  energy, a falling dollar, and huge deficits  to pay for all this.  What is the answer?  Develop more energy? Not as we have  done. We have been stealing from  to morrow and squandering our assets to day.  There are new  energy  technologies  which need to be developed-but they are  impeded by our very squandering of oil.  The answer is thrift, discipline. Is it  any secret that our society-richest on  Earth-is falling apart? Our economy,  greatest  in  history,  is  disintegrating  ~th inflation, lack of productivity, plain  simple sloppiness. We buy things from  foreign producers because they are bet ter made.  When do we pull ourselves together?  The first essential step is: Stop squan dering, start conserving.  We must use less energy, we must do  it rationally or it will be forced on us by  devastating inflation and shattering de pression. If we cannot curb our excesses  the economy will do it for us-it is now  doing it for us with cold, brutal force.  And our Government, are they lead ing us? What is the policy of the Energy  Department? Just last week the Depart ment of Energy came forth with a bold  policy of conservation. They would pro hibit outside gas lights. Yes, sir, but such  a drastic step could not be done over night. No, it would be phased in by 1982.  God help us, 55-mile speed limits and  Sund~y closings are also small, pathetic  steps m the face of the threat confront ing us.  There is only one answer to our ex cessive use of oil, excessive use that clogs  our cities with cars, poisons our air with  exhaust fumes, jeapordizes our national  security by putting us in thrall to foreign  nations-making us slaves  to our own  machines. To  free ourselves we must  conserve, and conserve as a nation.  We must  ration. Rising prices will  force  less use, but price  rationing  is  harsh and unfair. It also lards the al ready too powerful oil companies with  money to buy up our economy.  Price  rationing can be made more  equitable by having the Government ab sorb the price increases by taxation and  distributing back the money in such a  way as lowering social security taxes.  Or we can go to outright rationing of  oil and gas. Oh, that would be terrible,  it is said. Let me tell you that if we con tinue on our present course the terror  will be a hundredfold worse.  If we continue our squandering we  face financial collapse.  When do we  stop  this squander of  resource;;? Do we stop when disruption in  the mideast forces us into desperation  and military moves?  Do we stop when inflation plunges our  economy into a depression and is a de pression necessary to cure our waste and  sloppiness? God grant it is not.  Do we stop when our balance of pay ments becomes so distorted that a dollar  panic unleashes those 600 billion Euro markets?  When do we stop?

In the State  of Michigan, while almost 25,ooo steel workers are employed in 22 steel-indus try facilities,  thousands more workers  are employed in automotive and related  industries that are dependent upon spe cialty steel.

Since the import limitations were im posed, employment in the U.S. specialty  steel  industry has  increased. However,  recovery from the flood of foreign spe cialty steel products into the U.S. market  is far from complete. If import restraints  are now allowed to expire, the healing  process in our domestic specialty steel in dustry would come to an abrupt halt, and  the negative  impact on specialty steel  and steel-related  jobs would be enor mous. Expiration could mean the loss of  over 65,000  jobs and would  jeopardize  capital  investments  and  technological  advances by the industry during the im port restraint period.  Mr. Speaker, to further elaborate on  the steel import problem, I place in the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  an  excellent  article by United Steelworkers of Amer ica President Lloyd McBride  that ap peared in the last issue of ""ViewPoint,""  the quarterly magazine of the Industrial  Union Department, AFL--CIO:  FOREIGN TRADE PROBLEMS RUN DEEP  (By Lloyd McBride)  Whatever doubts  there  remained  in this  nation over the need for reform of our trade  laws surely suffered a jolt this summer when  the Department of Commerce  released  a.  startling report. The report showed that oil,  once the United States' leading import irtem,  had dropped to third place behind the :flrst pla.ce category of machinery and transport  e;:iuipment and the new second-ranking cate gory of manufactured goods.  In short, the Commerce Depa.rtmen t was  in.forming  the American  people  that  t.ihe  trade problem waters run much deeper than  energy, that most popular vlllia.n in the bal ance of trade economlc war. In reality, the  Commerce Department was telling us in its  dry, statistical fashion, we a.re coming even  closer to becoming a nation of workers who,  instead of ma.king the world's washing ma chines, take in its la. undry.  According  to  the Commerce Department  figures, covering the first five months of 1978,  the United States  imported  $19.1  bUlion  worth of machinery and  transport equip ment of all kinds including maoh.ine  tools,  electronic equipment,  automobiles,  trucks,  railroad equipment and ships, mostly from  Europe and Japan. That was a. 35.6 percent  increase over the year-a.go period.  In addition,  the United States imported  $18.2 blllion worth of manufactured goods in cluding iron and steel, nonferrous meta.ls, al loys, plastics,  instruments, medical equip ment, bicycles a.nd other items, again mostly  from Japan and Europe. That wa.s a. 38.8 %  increase.  Altogether,  the value of  those  two cate gories ca.me to $37.3 billion, or 45.9% of all  imports-more than double the $15.9 billion  that Americans paid for imported on during  the same period.  While this data. was certainly not all ba.d it reflected, in pa.rt, a. decline in our oil im ports-it underscored a. problem that Ameri can labor ha.s struggled for years to bring to  the attention of our policymakers. It under scored America's continuing decline a.s an in dustrial power a.nd the inescapable threat to  its industrial workforce.  The numbers a.re there for everyone to see.  In recent yea.rs we've lost---conservatively150,000  jobs  in electronics and electronic  machinery; 300,000 Jobs  in textile a.nd ap parel; 70,000 jobs in shoes, and 100,000 Jobs  in primary meta.Is. These a.re Just some of  the more obvious industries: the list is vir tually endless. And with ea.ch job in manu facturing goP.s 1.5 Jobs in related industries.  For every 1,000 workers who make television  sets, for example, another 292 workers make  components, another 85 workers are  em ployed in rubber and plastics, another 124  a.re  logging, wood and  furniture workers.  None of us stand a.lone.  Tra.dltionally, two-thirds of this country's  exports have been of manufactured goods of  almost all descriptions. Today, only aircraft  and automotive goods, key consumers of my  own industry's output, account for any sig nificant pa.rt of  the manufactures we ex port--a.nd even those situations a.re shaky.  Japan, already a. major steel producer, now  is threatening to use its U.S.-a.cquired tech nology  to  threaten American producers  in  aerospace, a. billion-dollar cornerstone of the  nation's economy both in terms of domestic  Jobs and exportable goods.  While  the threats a.re obvious,  the solu tions, thanks in large pa.rt to political short sightedness and tortoise-like responsivenes.5,  are less so. Instead of being able to look to  the United States Government for  a. com prehensive trade policy to protect American  industry a.nd its workers, individual indus tries have been forced to mount their own  campaigns for redress.  An example  is my own  industry,  steel.  While  the steel  import picture right now  holds more promise than at any time since  our union first started to call for corrective  action seven years a.go, it is only because we  in the industry launched that campaign that  relief may be in sight. As  imports swelled  and production fa.c111ties were shut down, we  in the United Steelworkers of America and  the American Iron and Steel Institute pre sented our views to the government on the  need for  a.  long-term solution to the steel  trade problem. In our joint presentation to  Administration officials and the Congress in  1975 we emphasized the need for ""sectoral,""  or special, negotiations at the international  level, because we were convinced that the  prohlems facing the steel industry are global  in  their causes and can be handled only  through international discussions.  Our plea was met with much understand ing, but no action. As the situation worsened  ",1979
53,House,96,-0.427,587,3,Mr. NEDZI.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to join with my colleagues in urging the  President to extend the import quotas  on specialty steel.  Under the current import restrictions,  the domestic specialty steel industry has  experienced a partial regeneration. In  the absence of an extension. this progress  would be thwarted with a damaging im pact on American industries and Ameri can workers.  Foreign producers are heavily  sub sidized and often owned by their govern ments which permits them to undercut  the privately owned American specialty  steel companies. American companies are  thus under a competitive disadvantage  and are vulnerable to being driven out of  business with  the resulting disastrous  impact on American jobs.  A faltering domestic specialty steel in dustry threatens our national security  since specialty steel is essential to the  production of defense weapons and criti cal weapon systems. In a crunch and  lacking facilities to produce the steel, we  could find ourselves dependent upon an  unreliable supply from foreign nations.  The request for an extension of the  quotas is not raised frivolously. A crip pled domestic specialty steel industry has  adverse  repercussions on our security,  our economy, and on our working men  and working women.    ",1979
54,House,96,-0.347,587,3,Mr. BAILEY.," Mr. Speaker, the 21st  District of Pennsylvania, which I repre sent, has 2 of the 20 companies which  make up the tool, specialty, and stain less steel industry of the United States.  These companies represent the backbone  of a vital industry, not only to the 21st  District, but to the Nation as well.  By specialty steel, we mean stainless  steels, tool and die steels, high-temper ature alloys and electric, magnetic and  electronic alloys which are designed and  produced for use  in extreme environ ments because they are resistant to heat  and hard to corrode. As a result, special ty steel is difficult to make and requires  greater labor input than other steel. It  is a  is  an  essential  element  to: Aircraft,  automobiles, electronics, mining, missile  parts, petroleum products, power gen erators, stainless steel,  tools, dies, and  the like.  There are some distinctive features to  the specialty steel industry. One is that  freight costs do not significantly influ ence distribution. Specialty steel goes  where  there  job  to be done. For  example, you might not ship carbon steel  sheet  from Latrobe, Pa.,  to Seattle,  Wash. But, you would  ship  specialty  steel to aircraft plants in Seattle or to  machine shops in Chicago, to the electric  turbine plants in Philadelphia or to the  oil drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.  There  is no doubt  today  that  the  specialty steel industry has become bed rock  to almost every other  industrial  process in America. In fact, it is so basic  to everything we do or make that the  demand  for  it does not  fluctuate  as  broadly as it does for conventional steels.  It is the stability of this market that  demands protection. I believe  that we  need a specialty steel imports restraint  program. It is vital to job security and  the prosperity of an essential industry.  While I  think domestic competition  is  healthy, I do favor the import quota pro gram to cut back on subsidized foreign  competition.  If the American buyer is forced to rely  extensively on foreign suppliers, then he  must be willing and able to live with a  host of uncertainties in the international  environment that can reduce or delay  the essential shipment of badly needed  materials. In addition, currency fluctua tions mean that American firms cannot  determine their costs for raw materials.  In short,  such  a  situation  could  be  disastrous.  However, thanks to import restraints  that are now in effect, we have helped  to partially restore the industry's health.  This has resulted in significant improve ments in employment and has not con tributed to an inflationary spiral. More over, these restraints have enabled the  specialty steel industry to make higher  expenditures for research and develop ment and to commit substantial capital  investments to further reduce costs and  improve productivity. If the restraints  are permitted to expire, all this might  disappear.  Mr. Speaker, after a serious review of  this issue, I firmly believe that the im port restraints on specialty steel must be  continued. This is in the best interest's  of those who work in the industry as well  as all of us who depend upon the indus try's products that contribute to the eco nomic vitality .of  this great Nation.

55,House,96,0.021,587,3,Mr. MOTTL.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  pleasure that I add what emphasis I can  to  the urgency of the matter at hand.  The matter is not a complicated one. A  little over 3 years ago, America's specialty  steel industry was in a crisis. A goodly  number of its employees were out of jobs,  because a tidal wave of imported steel unfairly,  even  illegally  priced-had  surged into American markets. The peril  was so obvious and real that an impor tant restraint program had  to be  stalled.  in   ",1979
56,,96,0.416,613,3,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr.  Speaker,  on  Wednesday of this week,  the Democrat  administration and  the Democrat big  spenders in the House, will ask this body  to approve another whopping increase in  the public debt ceiling. This time $38 bil lion which would raise the ceiling from  its current level of $798 billion to $836  billion. How long will this flim-flam on  the American taxpayer continue?  How long will the Democrat big spend ers continue to spend this country into  the red? How long will the Democrat big  spenders continue to turn a callous, deaf  ear to the call from the American people  to put an end  to  this  traditional and  reckless Democrat policy of spend and  borrow, and borrow, and spend? Last  Thursday,  the Republican policy com mittee went on record as opposing this  increase  to bail out the Democrat big  spenders.  I  challenge  the  thoughtful  Democrats in this Chamber to join with  Republicans on Wednesday and vote  down H.R. 1894.  Without  objection, Mr.  Speaker,  would like to insert into the RECORD the  complete text of the Republican policy  committee statement on increasing the  public debt.  The statement follows:  1  H.R. 1894-INCREASING THE PUBLIC DEBT  The Democrat big-spenders are at it again.  In order  to pay  for  the  federal programs  which cost more than the federal government  receives in revenues the Democrats are push  ing the passage of legislation to increase the  public debt ceiling from its current level of  $798 billion to $836 billion.  Over the past four decades, the Democrats  who have controlled Congress for 42 out of  46 years have spent our country into the red  by more than $800 billion. The public debt is  a national disgrace. Instead of listening to  the call of American taxpayers for a reduc tion  in spending and a  balanced  federal  budget,  the Carter Administration and the  Democrat Majority want, to pass H.R. 1894, to  finance through borrowing the federal gov ernment's bills coming due over  the next  seven months.  H.R. 1894 raises the public debt limit by $38  billion through September 30, 1979, author izes the Department of the Treasury to sell  lohg term securities at interest rates above  the statutory ceiling of 4.25 percent, and in creases the statutory Interest rate ceiling on  savings bonds.  This exercise of increasing the public debt  is nothing more  than a  film-flam of  the  American  taxpayers by  the Democrat big spenders. The Democrats, rather than earnestly trying to balance the budget, continue  to vote one deficit budget on top of another  deficit budget. Then when the bills come due  the Democrat big-spenders demagogue the fl. nancial crisis which necessitates increasing  the public debt limit and reluctantly vote to  increase it. This entire charade becomes an  actual fraud on the American people when  current Treasury Department estimates show  that an additional increse of $60 billion in  public debt will be necessary to meet require ments for fiscal 1980 bringin:g the total na tional debt ceiling to $896 billion.  The American people are  calling  for  a  change in the fiscal policies of the federal  government. The public groundswell  for a  balanced budget indicates that the American  taxpayer has had it with deficit spending, in flation and gross mismanagement of tax dol lars. The congressional budget process and  the public debt limit give the Congress the  authority to respond and produce a balanced  federal budget. Republican efforts to change  the direction of existing fiscal policy have  been repeatedly turned back by the Demo crat Majority in Congress.  This nation is entering the fifth consecu tive year of economic growth. The second  longest recovery in the post war history. It's  time now  to begin ba,lanclng  the  federal  budget.  The Republican Policy Committee believes  that Republicans, who d1d not vote for the  Democrat initiated wasteful spending, should  not vote for the increase in the national debt  to bail out the Democrat big-spenders. Let  the Democrat Majority who got this country  into a financial mess provide the votes to in crease the public debt. Let those who have  danced to the Democrat big-spenders tune  now vote to pay the piper.e  LEAA  HON. ROMANO L.

While LEAA has many critics,  it is  far  from  a  failure.

Recently,  Jefferson  County  (Ky.,)  Commonwealth Attorney David Arm strong, brought  to my attention one  particularly  successful LEAA program  now underway in Jefferson County deal ing with white collar crime.  Under this project, an economic crime  unit was established and prosecuting as  well as preventing economic crimes were  given top priority.

58,,96,-0.265,626,3,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to  insert  into  the CONGRESSIONAL  February 26, 1979  RECORD an editorial from the Johnstown  Tribune-Democrat of February 12  that  summarizes much of my feeling about  the proposal for public financing of con gressional campaigns:  LET CANDIDATES PAY  When a person chooses to run for the U.S.  House of Representatives, he should be pre pared to pay his campaign expenses him self-with the help, of course, of those who  legally wish to contribute to his electioneer ing.  Such candidates should not be assisted, as  a new blll proposes, partially by public con tributions from  the $1  checkoff fund pro vided on the federal tax forms. The blll also  would place a  limit on total spending for a  House campaign-a limit of $150,000.  We have no argument with financing of  the presidential campaigns with funds pro vide:! by the tax-form checkoff. However, al though House candidates go to Washington  if they are elected, basically they run on lo cal  issues and win on local favor-though  they may give passing attention to what the  national party line may be. Therefore,  let  them find their campaign finances in thelr  own backyards, not from backyards all over  the country.  If people are concerned  that  less-than wealthy candidates have little or no chance  of election, then let the emphasis be placed  on the spending-limit aspect of the proposal  and forget about the checkoff.  However, candidates with limited funds do  get elected. Their candidacies can attract  adequate contributions. If they can't, per haps they are not worth electing.e  WORLD  BANK  PROJECT  SLOWS  FLOW OF EMIGRANTS TO UNITED  STATES  HON. MATTHEW F.

Mr. Speaker, from time  to time allegations are made that there  are numerous shortcomings in our for eign assistance programs generally, and  in the programs of the World Bank in  particular.  In view of this, I believe the Members  might be interested ip an article which  appeared  in  the New York Times on  February 15 which I am including in the  RECORD for the benefit of those who may  not have seen it.

But this last weekend, his essay also  had national importance. I would like to  bring it to my colleagues' attention:  THE DRAFT Is A TERRIBLE IDEA  (By William Greider)  Anyone who knows Charles Peters,  the  editor of The Washington Monthly, wm tell  you that he ls a wise and warm-hearted man.  Why,  I wondered,  is Peters pushing this  vicious idea in the pages of his little mag azine? A rotten idea hiding behind a bland  title-""national service.""  Charlie Peters fears that America has lost  its way,  that people are  too  selfish,  that  young people need inspiration in the patri otic values. His  solution  ls  to  force my  children into involuntary servitude for the  government.  That seems a disproportionate price for my  children to pay. To surrender two or three  years of their lives to the control of some  bureaucrat,  civilian  or military,  so  that  Ch9.rlle Peters wlll feel good about America  again!  Peters wants young people to see the inside  of an Army barracks which, I concede, is an  interesting experience but, surely not one  required for true citizenship. I did my turn  in the peacetime Army and mostly I learned  about mindless regimentation.

60,,96,0.225,652,3,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, on Febru ary 22, I introduced, once again, my bill  to establish a U.S. Court of Labor Man agement Relations  that would  have  jurisdiction over major  labor disputes  that have a substantial impact on the  Nation's economy.  This measure is designed to establish  a mechanism for the orderly, rational  and equitable  resolution of  labor dis putes where the general public has a sig nificant interest in the outcome.  It is designed to fill a very serious gap  that now exists  in our ability  to deal  with prolonged labor disputes, such as  last year's coal strike, in a rational man-  ner that takes into account the needs  and equities of both labor and manage ment, as well as the impact of a settle ment on the consuming public.  We can no longer afford settlements  wherein management ""caves in"" to labor  simply to avoid a strike, and passes on  the cost  to  the public  in the form of  higher prices. Nor can we afford pro longed  strikes,  that  leave plant and  idled,  and  consumers  goods  and  equipment  of  important  deprived  services.  The  court  described  in  achieves  a  middle  ground  this  bill  between  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  strikes or lockouts, which I consider a  form of economic barbarism, and com pulsory arbitration, which I believe is too  susceptible to charges of capriciousness.  In our Nation, we  submit virtually  every type of dispute to a court of law for  its resolution. So far, we have seemed  unwilling to do the same for labor dis putes, I fail to understand this, especially  in light of recent talk favoring the sub mission  of  disputes  involving  public  employees  to arbitration. I believe the  time has come to give serious attention  to this proposal, and I commend it to my  colleagues for their consideration.   PHILIP M. CRANE  HON. RON PAUL  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 26, 1979    Mr. PA UL. Mr. Speaker, one of our  most  eloquent,  hardest working,  and  brightest colleagues was recently written  about in Private Practice m~gazine.  Since  that colleague,  the Honorable  PHILIP CRANE, may soon be moving to the  other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,  I  would like to bring this article to the at tention of the entire House by inserting  it in the RECORD:  PHIL CRANE AND THE PRESIDENCY  (By Michael Watterlond)  In the doldrums of last summer, the bad  planning and chaos of this almost tropical  capital of Washington, D.C., were even more  befuddling than usual. Shining slabs of mar ble  loomed  surprisingly  over  a  steaming  jungle of urban trees and beneath the trees  there was the boggling pattern of streets and  avenues  that  inexplicably meandered and  bent and  lost  themselves without  logic or  reason. Nothing seems simply  to go  from  here to there in this city.  And in this mishmash of tangled pavement  it often seems as though every misconceived  notion in the country has settled here and  taken root in institutionalization. But unfor tunately this is a country still young enough  to have energetic and ambitious men and  women who welcome  the chance  to weed  these notions out.  Even though it is a frustrating and seem ingly fruitless job, Congressman Ph111p Crane  of Illinois, chairman of the American Con servative Union and member of  the House  subcommittee on health,  thinks he  is  the  man to do it. Phil Crane wants to be Presi dent.  Last summer he made  the national an nouncement that he will seek election to the  office of the President. He has been shown  on network  television kissing his wife, his  children, sharing great hopes with the ad miring staff cf his office. And the media gen erally  concede  that  even  in  these  early  months he has as good a chance to win the  Presidency as Governor Carter did when he  announced in December 1974.  And now,  on  these hectic  election-year  mornings,  there are members of the press  who perhaps could not have identified Phil  Crane only a few months ago, but who now  jot down and record his statements on NHI,  taxation, campaigns, the future, the direc tion of conservative philosophy. It is clear  to the writers and photographers that they  have something special on  their hands-a  handsome, articulate, intellectual conserva tive with presidential aspirations who will  February 26, 1979  look you in the eye and smile when he says  ""revolution!""  Possibly what he means is ""rebellion,"" but  nevertheless, Philip Crane has found a na tional bandwagon, a national movement, and  an awaiting audience  in  these days when  taxpayers have stopped shaking their heads  in amazement and have started picking up  pitchforks, tar pails, and initiative petitions.  Crane's square-jawed, conservative stand  on national medical issues has given him a.  firm basis of argument as regards what the  press is calling our ""tax revolt.""  Crane has made repeated attacks on the  faults of  the national government  in the  medical field. He is a great enthusiast of free  enterprise and imagination as well as hard  work and determination-all things he pret ty much dismisses from federal programs.  ""Those who advance the idea of crisis in  American medical care argue that govern ment intervention  is necessary because we  have  a  shortage of doctors,"" Crane  says.  ""Somehow, they say, government control of  medicine will ease  this shortage. Unfortu nately, most of the participants in this de bate accept as a given notion that a doctor  shortage exists.  ""Since 1965  the number of doctors has  increased at a rate three times that of the  population, yet much of the discussion about  the alleged shortage of doctors has proceeded  as if there has been no change in the situ ation.""  Crane has been a champion of privacy in  me:iical  records. And  a  vociferous  foe  of  National Health Insurance.  ""The potential for abuse cannot be over looked,"" he says of governmental access to  medical records. ""Unless a greater degree of  confidentiality is extended to private med ical records, an Ellsberg break-in would no  longer be necessary if a government official  wanted to examine sensitive psychiatric rec ords for unauthorized reasons. The records  would be already available.""  He has introduced legislation to limit, in  fact prohibit, government access to medical  records  of  any  treatment  not  paid  for  through federal funds. His position is that  such a  bill would prove a great relief  to  patients not receiving federal assistance and  would, at the same time, provide some point  of consideration  for  evalu&.tion of  federal  medical aid through veterans' benefits, So cial Security, or Medicare assistance. HEW  has lobbied against his bill.  On  the subject of National Health  In surance, Crane makes no bones about his  opposition:  ""There  is every reason for Americans  to  reject the idea of National Health Insurance.  If we carefully consider the strengths of our  private practice system and the availability  of private health insurance tailored to each  person's needs and resources, and compare it  to the weaknesses of the socialized medical  systems of other countries, and then review  the failure of our own government programs  such as Medicare and Medicaid, that conclu sion becomes inevitable  ""Let us not in the  name of 'better health care' set in motion a  series of events that will damage medical  care, impose heavy new taxes, and demolish  more individual liberty.""  Crane's position on  these medical  issues  sets him in line with much of the public hue  and cry these days about taxes and tax use in  general.  Although the Congressman's marketability  as a presidential candidate has been touted  by Crane enthusiasts from the start (he took  the congressional seat Donald Rumsfeld left  to join the Nixon Administration in 1969)  it cannot be denied that today's voter con~  cern for hardline conservative tax attitudes  has made him even more attractive than ever.  ""I would not want to be running for any thing  in  this country,"" Crane says, ""on a  platform that does not support serious tax  reform.  ",1979
61,House,96,-0.278,678,3,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr.  Speaker, when  workplace tragedies occur, too often the  responsibility of the Occupational Safety  and Health Administration  is brought  under scrutiny and criticism. Since the  passage of the OSHA Act, various spokes men for business, labor, and the general  public have voiced concerns with regard  to regulations and enforcement on the  part of OSHA officials.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on  Health and Safety of the Education and  Labor Committee, I have been in contact  with Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall  and Assistant Secretary for Occupational  Safety and Health Dr. Eula Bingham in  an effort to clarify many of the miscon ceptions surrounding OSHA. Since as suming  their positions Marshall  and  Bingham have been diligently pursuing  measures designed to upgrade the per formance of OSHA. However, notwith standing the merit of some complaints  about OSHA, it appears that OSHA may  have received a ""bum rap"" with respect  to the charge that it has not been ade quately performing its primary objective  of significantly reducing occupationally  related fatalities.  It was gratifying to come across an  editorial entitled, ""Bum Rap for OSHA?""  which suggests  that, on  the contrary,  OSHA may deserve a pat on the back for  increasing the safety of the American  workplace.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I include the  editorial by Michael Gorham in the Jan uary 19, 1979,  issue of the Federal Re serve Bank of San Francisco Weekly  Letter to be printed in the RECORD:  BUM RAP FOR OSHA?  Grisly  statistic:  some  4,760  American  workers died a.t their desks or on the assem bly line in 1977. But to put that figure in  context roughly 1.8 m111ion Americans died  off  the Job  in 1977, which might suggest  that the factory or office is a.ctua.lly a. much  safer place  to be than  the highways and  homes of the nation. Stlll, one government  agency is very concerned a.bout those 4,760  Americans, especially because  their deaths  represented a. 21-percent  increase over the  previous year.  This agency is the Occupa.tiona.1 Safety and  Health Administration (generally referred to  as OSHA), which was established in mid1971  to ""assure a safe and healthful work place"" for all Americans. Such a. charge ls no  simple matter, and OSHA's efforts to achieve  this goal have sometimes antagonized both  business people  (who complain that OSHA  undermines  the  efficiency of  the na.tion'f3  factories) and labor leaders (who complain  that OSHA fails to ensure improved safety  a.nd health conditions).  When  the Department of Labor  report  emerged with the 1977 statistics, the media.  found good copy in the 21-percent rise in  fa,ta.litles reported for the year. ""Big Increase  in Work Deaths Mystifies Federal Officials,""  trumpeted one newspaper. Business Week  spoke of the ""atmosphere of gloom""  that  the new report had ca.st over OSHA.  FATALITIES AND  INJURIES  Despite  the validity of other complaints  a.bout OSHA operations, the agency may have  ta.ken a. bum rap on that particular charge.  To see wha. t ha.s a.ctua.lly happened in the  nation's workplaces, we should first look be yond a. one year change in the number of  fa.tali ties.  While workplace deaths did rise in 1977  by 21 percent, most media. reports failed to  note that this rise followed a.n even larger  26-percent decline the year before. Moreover,  we should look a.ta. more relevant mea.sure the number of workplace fatalities a.s a. per centage of the workforce-Just a.s we look a.t  the unemployment rate rather than the num ber of unemployed. Indeed, this fatality rate  was lower in 1977 than in all but one other  year of OSHA's existence.  In  assessing  OSHA's  performance,  we  should remember also that a workplace fa tality is a. rare occurrence. A much more re liable indicator of the safety and healthful ness of our nation's offices and factories is  the work-injury rate, or the number of work place  injuries related  to  the total number  of workers or  the  total amount of work time:  The  large  number  of work  in juries  (roughly 1200  times  the number of  workplace fatalities) makes this a. more sta tistically reliable indicator. Also, since this  measure ls expressed relative to the size of  the work force, it allows us to eliminate the  sea.le effect. It must be noted also that post1970 data. cannot be compared directly with  earlier  data.,  since  the  law  that  created  OSHA  liberalized  the definition of  ""work  injury,"" and also established a more com prehensive and mandatory system of data.  collection. Furthermore, the post-1970 data  also include work-related lllnesses, but these  account for only a.bout 3 percent of the total.  BUSINESS-CYCLE EFFECT  But even more importantly, to assess the  performance of OSHA-or any other pro gram for  that matter-we must a.void  the  before-and-after fallacy. The relevant com parison is not between what occurred this  year and  la.st year, but between what did  occur this year with the program and what  would have occurred this year in the absence  of the program. This suggests that if there  a.re other factors systematically influencing  the program's  target va.rla.ble,  then  these  factors must be considered.  In the case of work  injuries,  there ls a  fairly well established, albeit little known,  relationship  between  the  rate  a.t which  workers get mangled on  the  job and  the  rate of business activity. Studies of the rela tionship between work injuries and the busi ness cycle have appeared on and off in the  economic literature at least since the 1930's,  but generally in fairly remote publications.  The logic behind this pro-cyclical pattern  in work injuries goes something like the fol lowing. During a cyclical downturn in a. firm's  new orders, the manager ls uncertain whether  the decline is temporary or wlll be sustained  over a. period of  time, so he  is somewhat  .reluctant to lay off workers whom he may  soon have to rehire. Thus workers get laid  off at a slower rate than the rate at which  output declines, and there is a consequent  slowdown in the general pace of production.  But at the slower pace of output there ls  more  time for maintenance and repair of  equipment. The  result  is  fewer accidents.  In addition, the workers who get laid off are  typically the youngest and least experienced  group which tends to be the most accident prone. This shift in composition of the still working  population  a.way  from  accident prone  individuals also  tends  to  lower  the  work-injury rate.  During expansions, both these effects work  in precisely the opposite direction. Managers  a.re reluctant to rehire workers as rapidly as  new orders increase, for fear they may have to  turn a.round and fire  them should the in crease be only transitory. The result ls a.n in crease in pace of production, more pressure  on workers and less time for maintenance of  machinery. Moreover, new hires a.re  less ex perienced, and even the skills they do have  may be a. bit rusty due to extended period  out of work. Both of these effects combine to  push up the rate at which workers get in jured.  MmROR  IMAGE  The work-injury rate is almost a. mirror  image of the unemployment rate-a. reason able business-cycle proxy-although the sta tistical relationship between the two series  ls not always stable  (see cha.rt). Roughly  speaking,  a.  one-percent  (not  percentage  point)  decline  in  the unemployment rate  tends to generate a. quarter-percent rise in  the work-injury rate, according to our ex perience over the 1942-70 period. Thus the  9-percent drop  in the unemployment rate  between 1976 and 1977 (from 7.7 to 7.0 per cent) should have ~ed to a 2-to-3 percent rise  in the work-injury rate, other things equal.  In fact, the work-injury rate in ma.nufa.ctur lng actually declined by 0.8 percent and the  rate for the whole private sector rose by only  0.8 percent. This suggests that there were al most 1 million fewer workplace injuries in  the total private economy in 1977 than would  have been expected based upon movements in  the business cycle a.lone. This fa.ct contrasts  sharply with the impression left by the ""21percent increase"" in workplace deaths head lined by the media..  Indeed, in all but two years of OSHA's ex istence,  the work-injury rate fell by more  than would  have been predicted by  the  business-cycle effect. Thus, the work-injury  rate in 1977 was roughly 3 percentage points  lower than would have been expected from  the 1971-77 movement of business activity.  This translates into a.bout 2.8 mlll1on fewer  injuries than we would have expected in the  total private economy in 1977 a.Ione. Several  factors may have contributed to  this  im provement, but in absence of evidence  to  the contrary, OSHA should certainly be able  to take some credit for the increasing safety  of the American workplace.  What about 1978? We already know that  the unemployment rate  last year was 14.3  percent below the 1977 figure because of a  strong business expansion. This should have  ca.used the work-injury rate to rise by about  3.5 percent if you believe our estimates. The  data won't be available until almost year  end, but they should show some increase. If  the actual injury rate rises by less than 3.5  percent, or  if  there  is a.n actual decline,  OSHA may deserve  a pat on  the back. MICHAEL GORHAM.

74,,96,-0.644,717,3,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, profes sional management of our Nation's cities  is more crucial today than in the past,  because of the myriad of urban problems  we face. Due to the dedication of these  appointed  administrators,  city  prob lems are being tackled and solved.  The International City Management  Association, the educational and profes sional organization of city managers, is  holding a reception March 3 in Washing ton to honor 30 recently appointed mi nority managers from arormd the coun try.  Through its 5-year-old minority ex ecutive placement program (MEPP) and  its director, Michael C. Rogers, the as sociation  has  been  instrumental  in  matching qualified minority managers/  administrators with  openings  in  city  governments around the United States.  Since its inception in 1974, the program  has aided more than 500 minorities and  women to rise in their chosen profession  of urban management. There has been  an 80 percent increase of minority man agers since that time.  Elijah B. Rogers, the new city admin istrator  for Washington, D.C.,  is  the  chairman of the association's MEPP ad visory board and has been an active  participant in association work for many  years. He is being honored at the March  3 reception along with minority man agers from 13 States.

76,House,96,0.422,756,3,Mr. RUDD.," Mr. Speaker, events of the  past' several weeks paint a dark picture  for the United States.  An American Ambassador has been  killed in Afghanistan without a strong,  substantive response from our Govern ment.  The administration has failed to react  in a positive way  to Iranian develop ments, including the sacking of our own  Embassy there, in order to protect U.S.  interests and our citizens in that country.  Our Government has been unable to  exert sufficient  influence  to prevent a  second price increase within a year in  OPEC oil prices.  The President's highly publicized Mex ico  trip projected an unstatesmanlike  and unproductive performance through out the world.  Our intelligence system either failed  to forecast the Communist Chinese in vasion of Vietnam,  or  the President  would not let that intelligence interfere  with Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping's  public relations tour of our country.  The administration has been unwilling  and unable to deal from a position of  strength with the Soviets on the strategic  arms limitation talks.  Mr. Speaker, this apparent unending  series of foreign policy setbacks for the  United States stems from a  total lack  of leadership by the administration.  Vapid rhetoric from the White House  and  the State Department does not  disguise  to  the world and  to our own  citizens that we lack direction or a co hesive foreign policy to protect our best  interests.  It is imperative for Congress to take  all possible steps to fill  this noticeable  void until new leadership can take com mand under our  constitutional  proc esses.  INTRODUCING  PRIVATE BILL  TO  FACILITATE  ADOPTION OF  AN  INDIAN ORPHAN, RENUKA PAVLA  (Mr. DUNCAN of Oregon asked and  was given  permission  to  address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)   ",1979
77,House,96,-0.341,756,3,Mr. DUNCAN of Oregon.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  introducing a private bill  today  which  I  hope will be  favorably  con sidered by my  colleagues and passed  early in the first session of this Congress.  The purpose of the bill  is  to facilitate  the  adoption  of  an  Indian  orphan,  Renuka Pavla,  by  an Oregon  family  which  has  opened  their  hearts  and  offered their home to this child.  Renuka is a 14-year-old girl who suf fers from  the effects of residual polio myelitis,  and  is  currently undergoing  surgery and treatment in the Portland,  Oreg., Shriners' Hospital.  Early last year a bill was offered by my  colleague,  Senator  PACKWOOD,  which,  while it was approved by the Senate in  mid-August, failed to reach the floor of  the House for a vote before the end of  the 95th Congress. I have been assured  that it was the burden of other legisla tion before the House Judiciary Commit tee,  rather than any prejudice against  the bill, that prevented consideration by  this body.  Therefore, by introducing this measure  early in this Congress, I hope an oppor tunity will arise for favorable and timely  action.   DEADLINE DIPLOMACY IS DEAD  END DIPLOMACY  <Mr. MICHEL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and  to  revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1979
78,House,96,0.372,756,3,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker,  rumors  are circulating in town that the admin istration is prepared to announce very  soon that the initialing of the SALT II  Treaty will take place 1 month from now  and  final  signing will  take  place  2  months from now.  As I say, these are rumors. I hope they  are false. This administration has an ob session with setting a date by which an  event is supposed to take place.  Remember  the welfare  reform  and  energy  proposals? The President has  sworn to have them before the Congress  by a certain date. Needless to say,  the  complexity of the issues made it impos sible for the administration to meet their  preconceived deadlines.  Remember  the Camp David accords  and the rigid schedule for implementa tion? December 1 7 was to be the magic  date for signing but as of this date the  parties are still talking.  Some critics have said the failure to  meet that deadline forced the adminis tration to play the China card perhaps  too quickly-in view of  their incursion  across Vietnam's border.  Now we may have  the most serious  example  of  deadline  diplomacy.  The  SALT Treaty is not in its final form and  it  is  too  important an issue  to be re solved  by  deadline  diplomacy. Mr.  Speaker, deadline diplomacy is a dead  end.  D 1510  CONGRESS ELIMINATES A BILLION  DOLLARS OF UNNECESSARY RED TAPE  (Mr. EVANS of Delaware asked and  was  given  permission  to  address  the  House for 1 minute and  to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1979
79,House,96,0.178,756,3,Mr. EVANS of Delaware.," Mr. Speaker,  the House of Representatives to its credit  took a  significant step yesterday. We  eliminated a section of law which would  have ultimately cost the American con sumer approximately $1 billion.  And for what purpose? Supposedly to  protect the consumer. But what benefits  were achieved? Was there any protection  actually afforded the consumer?  The answer is that no discernible bene fit would have been achieved. But  it  would have been costly. A billion dollars  of unnecessary redtape.  The American consumer just cannot  afford any more of this type of so-called  protection.  The Congress of the United States must  begin to take its oversight responsibili ties seriously.  We must eliminate unnecessary and  costly burdens whether they be mandated  by legislation or by regulation. The over whelming passage of S. 37, I hope, sets  the tone for the 96th Congress. We need  to look for more ways of eliminating un necessary and wasteful Federal require ments.  ARE WE IN THE END-STAGE OF THE  WELFARE STA TE?  (Mr. PAUL asked and was given per mission to address the House for 1 min ute and  to  revise and extend his  re marks).  ",1979
80,House,96,0.863,756,3,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Speaker, today many  sober economists believe we are in the  end-stage of the welfare state, as more  and more special interest groups clamor  for a bigger slice of a shrinking economic  pie.  We have run out of money-except the  paper dollars being printed  in greater  and greater quantities. But these dollars  do not represent real wealth. Since this  is due to an inflationary increase in the  money supply,  they subtract from  real  wealth.  Compared to my time here in 1976, I  find the lobbyists come in larger, better  trained groups, and are much more ag gressive. They demand special subsidies  for  their business,  industry, profession,  region, or economic group.  When everyone turns  to Washington  for the solutions to his problems, bitter ness and social divisiveness result.  A welfare state that has run out of real  money-as ours has-can take one of two  roads: into complete socialism or toward  a free economy. The choice is up to us.

85,House,96,-0.359,769,3,Mr. PEYSER.," Mr. Chairman,  there  has been a great deal of conversation  directed  to  the freshmen Members of  this Congress. I have the privilege once  again to be a freshman Member of this  Congress. During  the  time  that I  sat  with my colleagues on the Republican  side of the House, I voted for every ex tension of the debt limit, because I felt  that it was foolish; it made no real sense  to try to pretend to the public that we  did not have to pay our bills. What had  to be done and what still has to be done  is that the debt limit must be extended.  to say to the freshmen  I would  like  on either side: If they want to register  a real feeling about the spending in this  Congress,  then they should vote when  the bills come up that they think are  wasteful, that they do not think will do  the  job, and they should vote against  those bills.  I would like to say to some of my col leagues on either side who are opposing  the extension that I have fought many  times on the floor when an issue of farm  subsidies running into billions was under  consideration, where the very Members  here today are saying we are not going  to vote for  the extension of the debt,  I  0  everyone  and  voted  programs.  This  is a question of a government  paying its bills. It is nothing more than  that. Sometimes we do not give the pub lic  the credit they are entitled to, but  the public understands  this. They un derstand we have bills. Maybe we should  not have voted for some programs that  we did, but we still have to pay the bills.  This is a government that is responsible.  If this Congress does not act  to keep  the Government responsible, it will be  our fault and not the public that is at  fault, because the public would vote for  this. They might say: ""Let us not spend  more money,"" but they would say: ""Pay  your bills.""  And that is what I urge the freshmen  and all Members to remember on this  vote.  ",1979
86,House,96,0.176,769,3,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Chairman, as a  freshman Congressman, I am deeply dis turbed to find myself in the midst of a  depressingly regular ritual brought about  by congressional overspending. This Con gress now finds the bill coming due for  last Congress budgeting  excesses  and  proposes  to allow our Nation to go yet  deeper into debt in order to pay this bill.  These yearly crises ought to be pre vented and can be prevented. Congress  must exercise more  responsibility and  self-discipline and  refuse  to vote  for  spending programs that cost more money  than the Government has. Ours is a Na tion that was built on thrift and self discipline; prolongation of the national  debt is a dangerous repudiation of this  essential heritage.  It is, indeed, unfortunate that it should  be the position of just the minority party  to say ""no"" to repeated deficits. All of  us in the 96th Congress must make an  effort to heed our constituents' pleas for  a  cutback  in  excessive Government  spending. Rejecting an increase in the  national debt ought to be the first step  of many that this Congress takes toward  the goal of a sound fiscal policy and a  balanced budget, a goal that is earnestly  desired by many millions of our fellow  citizens.  ",1979
87,House,96,0.43,769,3,Mr. KRAMER.," Mr. Chairman, today  Members of this body have their first op portunity in this session to express their  concern about the growing public debt  and the problems created by that growth.  For too many years now, the Congress  has piled debt upon debt rather than face  reality and bring the Federal Govern ment's spending policies into line with  its revenues. The results of such past  overspending confront us daily in the  complaints from our constituents about  the  near  double-digit  inflation  rate  which is depriving them of their earn ings and their future security.  The public debt has grown from $222  billion in 1955  to the current limit of  billion;  and now we  are being  asked to raise the temporary debt ceiling  to $436 billion, thus increasing the total  $798  ",1979
88,House,96,0.146,782,3,Mr. BUCHANAN.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to enter a tribute to Lt. Comdr. Rob ert Garfield Hughes, who died while fly ing his Navy jet aircraft off the coast of  southern California January 30 of this  year.  Lieutenant Commander Hughes was  the son of retired Rear Adm. and Mrs.  William Hughes of Birmingham, Ala.  He was born in Birmingham in 1945 and  attended Bishop O'Connell High School  in Arlington and Creighton Preparatory  School in Omaha, Nebr. He graduated  from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1967.  He was designated a naval aviator  in  1968, and served with distinction  in a  number of aviation commands  includ ing squadrons stationed aboard U.S.S.  the U.S.S.  Kitty Hawk. He piloted his jet fighter on  numerous combat missions in Southeast  Asia. On May 6, 1972, while protecting  another squadron engaged in a bombing  mission, he led a devastating aeria: at tack against a larger formation of enemy  fighters, destroying one of  them and  driving the others off, successfully pro tecting the lives of other pilots. For his  exceptional heroism, he was awarded the  Silver Star Medal.  On  the afternoon of his death, Lt.  Cmdr. Hughes was  not  engaged  in  combat. He was conducting a  training  mission.  But we must not for a second think  his death was in vain. He gave his life  for his country by insuring its readiness  and thus deterring an enemy. All over  the world, thousands of young men and  women are carrying out training mis sions designed to maintain our military  combat  readiness. Our Nation's very  existence could depend upon such train ing. We are at peace because we are  strong and we  are strong because of  individuals like Lieutenant Commander  Hughes.  This fine young man was a hero in  every sense of the word. He had known  and overcome fear  in combat, and he  faced with confidence and dedication the  everyday hazards of his dangerous pro fession.  Indeed, who can explain such  deep  inner  convictions,  courage,  and  faith in their nation, which enable our  naval f viators  to launch from and re turn to their tiny pitching decks in the  middle of the vast ocean in darkness and  rain, knowing that each second of their  existence depends upon their skills and  their God. We should give thanks every  day of our lives that we have such men  as Lieutenant Commander Hughes who  wiil  risk  their  lives  in order that our  country may remain strong and free.  I  ",1979
89,House,96,-0.24,795,3,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr. Speaker, I recently  had the opportunity to visit the Philip pines for several days, a visit which I  found  to be a very rewarding learning  experience. Fortuitously, my time in the  Philippines roughly coincided with the  official announcement of the agreement  between the United States and the Phil ippines to the amendments to the 1947  military bases agreement. I would  like  to take this opportunity to briefly dis cuss my general reactions to this agree ment in light of the impressions that I  gathered  during  my  stay  in  the  Philippines.  On June 25, 1976, I  inserted a state ment in the RECORD which addressed it self to the wisdom of a continuing high profile U.S. presence in the Philippines.  Conditions have changed since then, but  there  is also much  that  remains  the  same.  In that statement nearly 3 years ago,  I voiced my concern that to maintain  our presence there would invite charges  from Filipinos  that the United States  was interfering in the internal affairs of  their country. I also expressed concern  that this continued U.S. visibility could  well lead to a situation where U.S. forces  ",1979

It is my belief that the American tax payers have been sold a bill of goods by  Congress and the administration. On one  hand they have been told that everything  will be done by Congress and the ad ministration to hold down  the cost of  government, yet on the other hand, the  Federal Government reaches deeper into  their pockets.  My constituents and most all Ameri can taxpayers demand one thing from  this House: Stop the wasteful spending  of their tax dollars and cut the size of  government.

H.R. 42,  introduced on  January 15, 1979,  is entitled the ""Con sumer Food Labeling Act"" and is au thored by my colleague from New York,  ",1979
102,,96,-0.562,821,3,Mr. ROSENTHAL.,"  In  The history of Federal oversight and  quality control in the food industry be gan over 40 years ago after a great deal  of public outcry about the disease-en gendering  environment  and  horrid  workplaces  in which American  foods  were produced and packaged. I am re minded in particular of profound effects  that work like Upton Sinclair's the Jun gle had in creating a public awareness  of the need for Government intervention  and standard setting.  Now, in the 1970's, significant progress  has been made in assuring that the prod ucts which we buy at the local grocery  store  are  free  from  disease-causing  agents and originate from kitchens com parably clean to those in our homes. But  in the past 40 years, the mass food pro duction, processing, and packaging in dustry has developed many new technol ogies which have significantly altered  the material ingredients of foods sold  under commonly recognized names.  today's marketplace where  the  American consumer is confronted with  a wide variety of choices in products, the  shape of a package and the subtle design  of an advertising logo become forces in  shaping the consumer's idea of the prod uct. For that reason, I believe that we  must move to insure that labels on pack ages accurately reflect what is contained  within the products being sold. I do not  believe or condone  the  idea  that  the  Government should be involved in the  activity of actively shaping the opinions  of consumers within the auspices of the  American marketplace:  I believe  that  the American consumer is the wisest in  the world, and if left to their own re sources, will ultimately choose the best  products. The legislation which I rise to  support today will enable American con sumers to have access to a wider range  of facts on which to base their decision making process which is the source of  strength of their buying power.  More  important  than  the  improved  power offered to the consumer, H.R. 42  will provide vital information to those  Americans who have the need to know  what is contained in the foods they eat  for health, religious, and moral reasons.  One out of four people need  to know  what their food contains for reasons of  health. H.R. 42 will provide our citizens  afflicted  with  heart  disease,  kidney  and  other  syn problems,  diabetes,  dromes sensitive to dietary habits with  a stronger sense of security when they  shop for foods.  ",1979
103,,96,0.091,834,3,Mr. RUNNELS.," Mr. Speaker, it was  but a few days past that many a temper  raged as those working in our Nation's  Capital inched their way enroute to their  respective places of employment only to  find streets barricaded or detoured by  the agricultural tractorcade. The farm ers' presence  in Washington seems  to  pervade in many discussions and their  relationship  to  traffic patterns as op posed to the cause for which they have  so diligently been fighting. But it seems  a bit ironic that only a few days ago our  traffic was affected, perhaps more ap propriately dubbed as paralyzed, by a  different phenomenon known  to us as  snow, and if it were not for the gener ous assistance of many farmers and their  four-wheel-drive  vehicles  and  equip ment, this city might still be digging its  way out.  I would like to briefly relay my own  experience with the storm. Upon retnrn fng from my district in New Mexico to  what most certainly may prove to be one  of the most memorable storms to have  ever descended upon this city, I quickly  made tracks to my own four-wheel-drive  vehicle. When I learned of the calls from  area hospitals for assistance from those  with  these vehicles, I  telephoned  the  hospitals offering my assistance and was  advised I should coordinate with the Dis trict of Columbia Police Department.  Upon telephoning the police department  I was advised that the American agricul tural movement was in fact coordinating  these activities and I should telephone  the headquarters office.  In short, it soon became apparent that  the farmers were best experienced and  equipped to lend a hand which they so  generously did. Their help should not  go unnoticed nor unthanked. An edi torial appearing in the Wednesday, Feb ruary 12, 1979, Washington Post best  capsulizes just how great was the farmers  help and we owe  them a big hand of  thanks. I take this opportunity to com mend  this editorial  to my  colleagues  whom I hope will also feel that the farm ers brought to mind an all too often for gotten  principle  of  camaraderie  and  friendship.  THE FARMERS AND THE SNOW  We have a  few further thoughts to offer  you  today about those farmers bivouacked  down on the Mall with their tractors. When  the Great Snow descended upon the city, the  tractors and  the  farm  trucks with  four wheel drive had no  trouble at all moving  around a city that was otherwise almost mo tionless. Those  tractors do not spin, and  neither do they slide. They have been ha.rd  at work over these past few days, helping a.  city in distress. We'd like to thank them for  it.  They have used their equipment to meet  genuine  emergencies-getting  patients  to  hospitals and, perhaps even more urgent,  a.  ferrying nurses and doctors who are needed  there. Some of :the  tractor drivers worked  straight through Monday night and into yes terday. At police headquarters,  line of  badly needed cars got buried under the snow  and then doubly burled when a. city plow  went past. The city's tow  trucks couldn't  rescue them. A farmer with a.  tractor spent  yesterday pulllng them out. He wouldn't give  his name, but only said that he was from  Oklahoma.  You should also know that on Monday a  farmer with a. plow cleared the alley into this  newspaper's loading docks. Not every sub scriber got a. pa.per on Tuesday morning, but  the score was a  good deal better  than  it  would have been without that tractor's help.  Our gratitude to the farmers is not entirely  disinterested.  The farmers have been a.s generous and  helpful over the past days as they were ex asperating and obstructive when they first  came to town. Circumstances changed wtth  that snowfall, a.nd  they have shown them selves to be the best kind of neighbors in a.  storm. We take their performance in the bliz zard as a. reminder of the harsh a.nd uncer tain weather in which farmers carry on their  daily lives. They a.re equipped for severe con ditions, a.s most of us in Washington a.re  not, because they have to deal with snow and  mud and cold routinely, as we do not. It's a  point for city people to remember a.s  they  sit down to dinner.  The farmers came here, tractors and all,  to remind the ca.pita.I of a wa.y of life that is  in danger. Their remedy  is higher SUIPport  for  farm prices. We still  think  that their  remedy  a.  ba.d  idea,  for  reasons  that  threaten  the family farm a.s much as  the  consumer's budget. But  the  farmers have  successfully recalled to this city values that  lie beyond economlcs.e  ls  CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER  PUBLISHERS AWARD  HON. CARLOS J. MOORHEAD  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 28, 1979   ",1979
104,,96,0.465,834,3,Mr. MOORHEAD of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I am pleased to take this mo ment  to  recognize an honor  recently  given to a newspaper in my district.  The recipient of the recognition was  the Sunland-Tujunga Record-Ledger, a  community weekly of long and distin guished standing. The bestower of the  recognition was  the California News paper Publishers Association.  Last month in San Francisco, Mr. Phil  Horwith, publisher of the Record-Led ger, was presented CNPA's prestigious  award for ""Best Special Edition"" in 1978  for weeklies with a  circulation above  13,000.  Because there is only one such honor  given each year, it is not awarded casu ally; nor is it an honor easily garnered  because within the State there are many,  many  newspapers  in  the  community  category.  The Record-Ledger's honored edition  appeared after the destructive and rec ord rains and floods which occurred in  California in 1978.  Elunland-Tujunga  is a pleasant and  predominantly residential community in  the foothills of the San Gabriel Moun tains. Because recent fires stripped the  mountains of vegetation, the following  rains created a  severe runoff, causing  j'Oods and mudslides. The resulting loss  of life and property reached tragic pro portions.  Following the destruction, the Record Ledger  compiled  80  poignant photo graphs, many vivid word pictures, and a  chronology of events. These items were  then meshed into the prize-winning spe cial flood edition.  I have no doubt  that  this edition,  which has had three printings, will serve  in the future, as it is presently doing, as  the definitive historical  record of  the  Flood of 1978.  That my recognition of the Record Ledger's excellence follows  that of the  CNP A in no way diminishes the honor  I  feel in giving it, for it is recognition  well deserved and worthy of repetition.   WATCH FOR GAS RATIONING  HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI  OF  ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 28, 1979  e ",1979
105,,96,0.342,834,3,Mr. DERWINSKI.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  among the many bombshells by the ad ministration of late, was the request for  legislation to impose gas rationing. It is  obvious that the Department of Energy  is attempting to create a panic situation  which will justify their schemes to the  public.  Alex Seith appropriately addresses this  subject in his column in the February  25  Suburban Economist Newspapers,  serving southwest Cook County. I should  like to add for the benefit of the Mem bers, that this is the Alex Seith who was  a Democrat candidate for the U.S. Sen ate  from  Illinois. Since  that laudable  effort, Alex Seith has returned to the  practice of law and to his avocation as  a  columnist  specializing  in  foreign  affairs .  I insert his commentary at this point:  WATCH OUT FOR GAS RATIONING  You may not  remember  the  last  time  America. had gas rationing. But if the De partment of Energy has its way,  the next  time America has gas rationing you won't  forget it. And you won't like it.  Gas rationing schemes have been churning  out of the Department of Energy ever since  that sprawling new bureaucracy of 17,000  ""civil servants"" was created in 1977. Some of  the schemes have been hare-brained. Most  have gone unnoticed. And all would give the  Energy bureaucracy immense power over our  everyday lives.  The last time America ha.d gas rationing  was during World War II. When  the war  ended  in 1945, so did rationing. President  Carter asserted in an April 1977 speech to  Congress that energy presents a crisis which  is ""the moral equivalent of wa.r.""  If so, that raises two unpleasant questions.  Number 1: Would gas rationing last as long  as  the so-called energy ""war?"" Number 2:  can  anybody  predict when,  if ever,  the  energy ""war"" will end?  The time to stop gas rationing is before it  starts. That's why everyone should pay close  attention  to  the  Energy  Department's  latest-and likeliest-scheme for gas ration ing.  Here's the basic plan: You could buy gas  only by presenting a coupon for each gallon.  You would get coupons  two ways-a few  ",1979

Mr. President, I am pleased to join  with the distinguished chairman of the  Finance Health Subcommittee, Senator  in  introducing  legislation  providing constructive reform of the ad ministrative and reimbursement mecha nisms for  the medicare and medicaid  programs. As  the  ranking Republican  member of the Finance Committee and  its Health Subcommittee, I have a par ticular interest in seeing that meaning ful improvements are made in these pro grams. Not only do medicare and med icaid present an inpenetrable maze to  the providers  serving program bene ficiaries, they are now a serious burden  on the Federal Budget. The legislation  introduced today is similar to bills in troduced in both the 94th and 95th Con gresses.

If there is a rollcall  vote, from what I understand the vote  would be very heavily  in favor of his  confirmation. If I have to vote on Gen eral Seignious' nomination, my inclina tion would be to vote for it. I have met  the general, I  think, on two occasions.  From what I have seen of him, he ap pears  to be a  sensible person, a man  with a reasonably sound notion of where  he is going.  My only sense of hesitation stems not  from the merits of General Seignious, but  from the fact that this is something of a  foreign policy question. During the time  when  the nomination of Ambassador  Warnke was before the Senate for con firmation, I pointed out that when we  vote  to confirm or not to confirm  the  nomination of a  person  in a  foreign  policy position, the Senate has an op",1979
111,Senate,96,0.262,990,3,Mr. WARNER.," I  thank the Chair.  There being no objection,  the letter  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  Washington, D.C., March 1, 1979.  Hon. HOWARD w. CANNON,  Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science  and Transportation, United States Sen ate, Washington, D.C.  179,000  DEAR MISTER CHAIRMAN: On Tuesday, the  Nation  learned of  the President's Standby  Conservations Plans, which  include emer gency weekend gasoline  sales  restrictions,  severe  limitations on outdoor advertising,  and a. program for gasoline rationing. Be cause the force and effect of these plans will  fall heavily-and in some instances almost  totally-on the Nation's travel and tourism  industry,  I  respectfully request that hear ings on  those portions of  the President's  overall energy conservation program be held  a.s soon a.s possible by the Senate Commerce  Subcommittee  on Merchant Marine  and  Tourism.  Pa.st experience mandates  this Congres sional oversight. During the 1973-74 Arab oil  embargo, the closing of gasoline filling sta tions on Sundays a.s a. conservation measure  brought disproportionate hardship on  the  travel and  tourism  industry-hardship far  greater than on any other segment of the  United States economy. Because of that pol icy, a.t least 90,000 people--in travel-oriented  Jobs-were  thrown out of work,  others were placed in employment Jeopardy,  and industry revenues totaling $717 milllon  were lost. Sunday-a. family day-is the life line of the small travel operator.  While it would be difficult, on the basis of  the 1973-74 experience, to precisely project  the ha.rm that would be caused to the travel  and tourism industry by limiting closings to  weekends,  one  projection  is  certain:  the  ha.rm will be much greater if the President  exercises his authority to extend the closing  of service stations beyond Sundays to full  weekends-from noon on Fridays  to mid night Sundays.  There is sound evidence that many firms  engaged in tourism in my own state of Vir ginia. suffered a. drop-off of as much as 50  per cent of  their business because of the  1973-74 Sunday-closing policy.  As you know, Mister Chairman, travel and  tourism rank first, second or third in im portance to the economies of 46 of the 50  states. It is second in Virginia., tralllng orily  manufacturing. The Nation's travel and tour ism industry  is an important part of the  United States economy, with earnings of $149  blllion annually and supporting 5 m11lion  Jobs.  If there is,  indeed, an energy crisis-and  that ls a. question much under debate on  Capitol Hill and even within the Adminis tration-it is my firm belief that conserva tion measures must be applied as evenly as  possible a.cross all segments of the economy.  A single industry, such as travel, must not  be subjected to the major brunt of such con servation. While travel must bear a. fair share  of any burden ca.used by a.n energy con servation plan, so must all other segments of  the economy. If closings a.re essential, they  should be done on a rotational basis, which  would spread the burden to all segments of  the economy. Moreover, any plan calling for  station closings should allow the states to  select  the  closing  times  for  the  stations  within their jurisdictions.  Further, such weekend restrictions tends to  impact most severely upon one economic segmen~the middleto  low-income families  who have only the weekend and the family  car for their limited plea.sure.  The Congress must note that, of the four  energy conservation plans presented by the  President,  three of  them will  impact dis astrously on the travel and tourism industry.  Weekend closing of service stations, severe  limitations  on  outdoor  advertising,  and  stringent gasoline  rationing, when coupled  together, place an unfair burden on one  industry.  It is for these reasons, Mister Chairman.  that I respectfully request the earliest pos sible hearing on these matters before  the  Subcommittee on Tourism, so that the Con gress as a. whole and the public can be fully  informed.  Respectfully,  JOHN W. WARNER.  ",1979

116,House,96,-0.139,1055,3,Mr. STRATTON.," Mr. Speaker,  the  March 1979  issue of the Armed Forces  Journal,  published  this  morning,  charges  that between  June 1978  and  January 1979 the Pentagon ""covered up  an unprecedented unexpected and mas sive Soviet strategic arms buildup.""  Specifically,  the  Journal  charges  that-The  Pentagon  knew  throughout  this  period that the Soviets were continuing to  deploy new warheads and ICBM's at about  twice  the  forecast  rate;  that Russia was  developing and flight  testing a new  long range  air-to-surface  cruise  misslle,  and  testing it off Backfire; and that Soviet war heads and ICBM's were not only becoming  more accurate, but more accurate than hatl  been predicted.  The Journal charged that the Penta gon, during 1978, denied legitimate press  inquiries about these improvements, and  moreover, failed to disclose these devel opments  the Congress as  they oc curred. With reference to the new air-to surface  cruise missile,  the  Journal  charged that-to  secretary Brown knew  far back  that the Soviets were developing the missile        yet would not admit  its existence  even to Congress as recently as last January  [ 1979 J in his only comprehensive public sur vey o! the strategic balance.  in 1978  In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Armed Serv ices Committee's 1979  posture  hear ings record shows that Secrm.ary Brown  did not in fact present the details on  this missile to the committee itself when  he appeared before us.  The Journal article concludes that- These discrepancies raise serious ques,tlons  about  the accuracy,  timeliness, and  integ rity of the Carter Administration reporting  to the American public and t-0 Congress on  the US/USSR strategic balance and White  House efforts to sell the new SALT II agree ment.  to  In view of the fact that a new SALT  II agreement is now reported to be sched uled  for  initialing within  the next 2  weeks,  I believe  these serious charges  need to be examined in full at the earli est possible moment. Certainly, any fail ure to have given Congress full and ac curate  information  on  any  unusual  Soviet military buildup over the past 12  months is a serious breach of Pentagon  responsibility,  and  raises  even more  grave questions on the eve of the pos sible signing of a new SALT II agree ment by the President.  Specifically,  the  information said  to  have been suppressed relates  three  separate aspects of dramatically increas ing Soviet combat power:  First, was a report, received last July  1978 by the Journal, of the deployment  ""in the past 6 months [ofJ between 200300 more new strategic nuclear warheads  or modern missiles than U.S. intelligence  estimates last [1977] October said would  probably be fielded by now."" The Journal  said these new warheads represented an  increase of ""20 percent in warhead de ployments in 1 year.""  Second, were reports of ""more accurate  warheads and ICBM's than those being  replaced.""  Third, the Journal said it had informa tion that the Soviet Union carried out  in 1978 seven or eight actual tests of ""a  new long-range air-to-air surface missile  to increase the Backfire bombers stand off distance"" yet Defense Secretary Har old Brown ""would not admit its existence  even to Congress as recently as last Jan uary  [ 1979]  in his only comprehensive  public survey of the strategic balance.""  Mr. Speaker,  these are very serious  charges. They go to the heart of the is sues  the Congress, and especially  the  Senate, will be considering if any SALT  II treaty is presented for the purpooe of  ratification.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I have today  requested  the chairman of  the Com mittee on Armed Services,  the distin guished gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  PRICE) to convene an emergency meeting  of the full committee to examine these  charges. On  the basis of  the Journal  article I have suggested that both Sec retary Brown and the Assistant Secre tary for Public Affairs, Thomas B. Ross,  be  requested  to  appear  as  primary  witnesses.  No doubt  these witnesses will argue  that the details of these Soviet advances  could not be released to the news media,  even the Armed Forces Journal, because  of security considerations. This may well  be true. But certainly there can be no  such excuse when it comes to advising  in timely fashion the appropriate com mittees of Congress. It is not satisfactory  to give  the Armed Services Committee  an update on Soviet capabilities only on  a  once-a-year  basis. Our  committee  should be kept advised of any significant  changes in the military situation as it  progresses, so that Congress, as trustees  of  the people's interests, have an op portunity to respond in time-not just  be caught flatfooted on new and ominous developments, as was the case in  Iran, for example.  Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time  the Pentagon has failed to give Congress  timely notice of very  important, and  ominoqs defense  information  that we  should have known  in order properly  to discharge our responsibilities. It was  not until the Army Times published de tails of a major intelligence error in as sessing the military capabilities of North  Korea that the DIA and the CIA finally  gave a couple of members of the com mittee a briefing on  the subject. Had  that report not surfaced in Army Times I  daresay we would still not know how dif ferent  the  .actual  situation  in North  Korea was from the bland information  being passed out to us by the administra tion.  Congress must vigorously protect its  right to know-and in  timely fashion.  And I certainly hope we will begin here.  Under  leave  to extend my  remarks,  Mr. Speaker, I enclose the article from  the Armed Forces Journal which ap peared on the streets this morning:  '78  '79  PENTAGON COVERED UP UNPRECEDENTED 1978;  U.S.S.R. STRATEGIC ARMS BUILDUP  (By Benjamin Schemmer)  From  last June  thru  late January,  the  Pentagon's official spokesman covered-up an  unprecedented,  unexpected  and  massive  Soviet strategic arms build-up, w,hich leaked  in pa.rt  to the press soon after it became  known to senior DoD officials, but went un reported because the spokesman said that a  story revealing the build-up was wrong. Some  o! the data. in the story was wrong~but not  the most important revelations in it.  JOURNAL REVELATIONS,  JUNE  The story, given to the Pentagon in early  June on a ""confirm or deny"" basis, was to  have appeared in last July's JO'Urnal and re ported in its lead sentence that:  ""Russia has deployed in the past six months  between 200-300 more new strategic nuclear  warheads or modern missiles than U.S.  in telligence estimates last October said would  probably be fielded by now.""  It added that ""among the ominous Soviet  deployments detected in recent months"" were  ""more a.ccura.te warheads andi ICBM's than  those  being  replaced,   and  revealed  that  ""Russia has a. new long range a.ir-to-air sur face misslle to increase the Backfire bomb er's 'stand off' distance.""  PENTAGON REVELATIONS,  JANUA~Y  Late in January, Defense Secretary Ha.rold  Brown admitted in his Fiscal Year 1980 ""An nual Report"" that:  ""The Soviets a.re now estimated to be in troducing new missiles with more accurate  warhe,ads  and  improving  the  a.ccuracy o!  their warheads more  rapidly  than we ex pected a.bout a year a.go."" Elsewhere in his  report,  Brown  acknowledged  that  Soviet  ""force  loadings""  (independently  ta.rgetable  nuclear weapons carried by deployed strategic  missiles and bombers)  ""have  increased by  around 1,000 since last year."" Brown did not  sayi so, but that represents a 20 %  increase in  warhead deployments in one year.  (The rate  Late in January, Defense Secretary Harold  of increase has to be calculated from other  data nearby in Brown's Teport.)  Brown's report also did not reveal  t.ha.t  Russia was testing a new, long range cruise  missile. He said only that ""they may be de veloping a long range cruise missile of their  own  design.""  (ItaJics added !or emphasis.}  Since Brown's statement on  the m.llitary  balance was released January 24th, however,  news that the Soviets, in fa.ct, have tested a  range  cruise missile has  (600nm)  1200km  ",1979

120,,96,-0.391,1094,3,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Speaker, many  of  us  in  the House  expressed  our  regrets last fall when we began really  to understand the impact that the loss  of John Moss would have upon us.  John Moss was one of the most ex emplary Congressmen I have ever had  the privilege of knowing, and I surely  wish he had not decided  to  leave us  try to do  things on our own. His will  be a hard act  to follow, but at least  for  those of us who have been work ing wtih him, we have some method,  some necessity and, most important of  all, some sense of outrage, all of which  are essential  ingredients of any effort  even to try to emulate John Moss.  Earlier  this month, Ward Sinclair  wrote  a  superb  review  of  the Moss  record in Congress; it appeared in the  Washington  Post  on  January  14.  I  heartily  recommend  ""The Man Who  Perfected  Oversight;""  it  probably  should be required reading at the be ginning of every new Congress.  The article follows:  THE MAN WHO PERFECTED OVERSIGHT  (By Ward Sinclair)  It never falls. Just when they find a use  for  the wheel,  the inventor ls not ruround  to explaln  it. So  it goes on Capitol Hill  where this yea.r's reinvention of the wheel  is something called ""oversight.""  The papers will be full of talk this year  a.bout  the 96th Congress being  the Over slgh t Congress. The sense of that term  ls  that enough laws have been passed, enough  Big  Issues confronted and it is now  time  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  for a. pa.use. They wm go back a.nci study  what they have wrought.  The  truth of  the matter  ls  that over sight  ls one of _the  lesser understood and  least exercised functions of Congress. It ls  overseeing the functions of government and  the actions of its officials. In a word, it is  investigation. All congressional committees  hwve  an oversight  role, but  few  take  it  seriously.  It is messy,  it  takes  time and  concentration and, should one dare a cyni cal  thought,  it has  little appeal  to  the  young and chi-chi Boob-Tube Babies who  increasingly inhabit the House and Senate.  So Whatever  the meaning, oversight  is  ""in"" and now  that Congress  is a.bout  to  rediscover this wheel, the pa.st master of the  art--a.nd be not mistaken it ls an a.rt--ha.s  gone home  to retirement in Sacramento.  At noon on Jan. 3,  for  the  first  time  since  1953,  John E. Moss was no  longer  the  representative  from  California's  3rd  District. Too bad. For if this is in fa.ct the  Oversight Congress, as its leaders have pro claimed, Moss would  have been  in  hog  heaven had he stayed.  In many ways, at least in recent  times,  John Moss had to be considered the inventor  of oversight. For two decades, his subcom mittee investigations put a.  relentless light  on almost every imaginable kind of federal  and corporate misdeed. Moss flayed, groused,  flayed, pestered and then flayed some more  as  he  charged  along  on  his  legislative  Rocina.nte.  IMPRINT ON GOVERNMENT  But why John Moss? Why this mild, not  very colorful, onetime appliance dealer and  real estate salesman from the Central Valley?  The best answer seems to be tha. t Moss some how figured  that a  congressman was sup posed to come here and take names and kick  tall. So he did, to a fa.re-thee-well.  By the time Moss left Washington he had  achieved something that others can lay only  spurious claim to: an imprint on the way life  ls lived in the United States, an lmprilllt on  the way government governs.  Almost single-handedly, over enormous re sistance, Moss championed the Freedom of  Information Act of 1966 that opened govern ment  files  to  the  public.  Subsequent  a.mendmelllts in 1975 refined the law further  and opened the process even more. Most of  his colleagues and admirers agree the FOIA  was the brightest of the gems Moss left be hind.  But the laws broadening the scope of the  Federal  Trade  Commission,  tightening  securities  regulation, establishing automo bile  and  tire-safety  standards,  providing  product-warranty protection and setting up  a Consumer Product Safety Commission a.re  among the other major legacies. The list is  more  impressive because Moss never was  chairman of a  full  committee,  the usual  power base of  the super-doer.  The subcommittee level, to which he was  limited by the seniority system was where  Moss a.s overseer compiled his lengthy record  as the House's gadfly. His la.st assignment, as  chairman  of  the Commerce Committee's  subcommittee on oversight and  investiga tions, gave him rein to look into almost any thing that tweaked his pique.  In the 95th Congress, in 1977 and 1978, the  inquiries and investigations rolled at flood tide: the world uranium cartel, FBI foreign  security  surveillance, Air  Force  contra.ct  shenanigans, accountants' practices, hospital  care and unnecessary operations, natural gas  shortages,  drug  costs,  college  athletics,  HEW birth-control policy, pesticide regula tion all came under the subcommittee's ln vestigative eye.  The  results  then, as before 1975, when  Moss directed oversight  investigations by  other  Commerce  subcommittees,  often  meant hearings  that attracted  the press  and reports  that ma.de Moss a  front-page  name all over the country.  March 1, 1979  ASSESSING THE RECORD  In a world where ego-tripping ls de rigeur,  there's an almost sour grapes view among  some of Moss' old House Democratic col leagues, conceding  that he did  some big  things but that all in all he wasn't the most  effective congressman a district might have.  To be sure, Moss made enemies, not a.  few  of them in the House, where he violated the  old-boy codes by calling the drones by their  real names. His detractors-mostly Republi cans and corporate captains-liked  to say  he was arrogant and unfair, publicity-happy,  a power-crazy left winger.  One day before he  left for home, Moss  looked back to ponder the record. The criti cism,  if anything, mostly amused him. He  treated it the same way he treated critical  reactions  to his votes:  ""Too many people  want  to be popular a.round here.  I don't  really give a damn. If it's the right vote,  it wm become popular.""  The notion that he was a.ntlbuslness or a  shlll  for  the  lefties a.mused him equally.  ""Actually"" he said, ""I am very conservative.  People who want to dismantle the regulatory  machinery of government a.re not conserva. ti ves, as many of them claim. They a.re very  radical. That machinery  is  there because  abuses occurred:  the FTC, the Federal Re serve, the Securities and Exchange Commis sion, the Interstate Commerce Commission.  These things, you just don't tear down and  destroy. Those cries come from people who  claim regulation is onerous.""  Typical of his don't-give-a-damn attitude  was what Moss did  in early  1973, when  those early rockets from Nixon's Watergate  started bursting. Moss called on the House  to get the machinery ready to deal with a  presidential impeachment. The House, typi cally, decided to wait a.while after less blunt  but more timorous souls prevailed.  ""The leadership told me I was premature,""  Moss recalled, ""but the thing of concern to  me was that the House do its job ... The  pardon of Nixon  (by Gerald Ford]  inter fered with the role of the House. The House  should have completed its impeachment ac tion. We were less than we should have been  on that occasion. I don't think the country  would have been hurt by an impeachment.  I  like nice clean pages of history.""  PRAISE FROM NADER  to  Ralph Nader, who ls not given to soaring  praise of your public servant,  thinks  the  clean pages of history will show Moss to be  ""one of the greatest members of Congress of  this century."" Before Nader was  inspiring  legions of young  idealists  into  their own  oversight  of  corporate  and governmental  waywardness, Moss had been there already.,  ""Nobody perfected oversight as John Moss  did,"" Nader said.  The curious  thing ls that Moss ca.me  Congress in 1953 with none of the polished  tools one might expect a bulldog lnvestiga.to~  to have. He did have, however, a high indig nation level, a basic sense of right and wrong  and a belief that Congress was intended to  be something more than a rubber stamp for  vested interests.  He was born in Utah,  the son of a coal  miner, but moved  to California. with  the  family as a boy. He attended a Sacramento  college for two years, then went into business  and Democratic politics. He was  a.  state  assemblyman for two years before his elec tion to Congress in 1952.  His victory that year was by four-tenths of  one percentage point and, as Moss remembered it, ""By all that was holy, I was surely  destined to be a one-termer."" He seemed to  seal his fate when he voted against Califor nia's interests, citing constitutional grounds,  on the controversial Tidelands oil legislation.  ""With that, the opposition savored victory.  But, in 1954, I got 62 percent of the vote.  People said they admired my courage and  that became a rule with me-to vote the way  I think I should vote.""  ",1979
121,Senate,96,-0.322,1133,3,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, today, at  the request of the administration, I am  introducing a bill to continue the work  of the President's Commission on Pen sion Policy.  The President's Commission on Pen sion Policy was established by Executive  Order 12071  (July 12, 1978) as amend ed by Executive Order 12100  (Novem ber 17, 1978). The purpose of the Com mission is to conduct a comprehensive  review of  the Nation's Federal, State,  and local retirement, survivor, and dis ability systems and to develop a coordi nated national policy for future growth  of retirement systems that can be used  as a guide by public and private pro grams.  ",1979
122,Senate,96,0.078,1146,3,Mr. HEINZ.,"  I  should also note  in  passing, Mr. President,  that  removing  enforcement of  these  laws  from  the  Treasury  is  consistent with  growing  support for a  complete  reorganization  to  of our trade functions. Senators ROTH  and RrnrcoFF have  introduced  legisla tion to create a Department of Inter national Trade and Investment which  I  am pleased  to  cosponsor. The dis tinguished majority  leader has  indi cated he is developing his own legisla tion along similar lines. An OMB task  force labored long and hard on recom mendations to the same end. I am con fident, Mr. President,  that  trade  re organization is an idea whose time has  come and that one of  these proposals  will shortly be approved, reflecting the  same wides)Jread  dissatisfaction with  the status quo that is implied in our bill.  Flnally, our  legislation amends sec tion 301 of the Trade Act of 1974  to  conform our  law  the  international  dispute  settlement mechanism  estab lished  in  the Subsidies Code. While  effective enforcement of our domestic  unfair trade laws  is essential,  the en tire problem  is  inevitably  a multila teral one that demands collective solu tions. The negotiation of the code itself  is a major step in that direction, but in  addition it is imperative that we obtain  in the process a  strong dispute settle ment mechanism so that our rights can  be adequately protected and enforced  multilaterally and so  that all nations  accustom themselves to the idea of an  economic world grounded in law rather  than blatant self-interest and discrimi nation. To  that end our section 301  amendment continues to allow for do mestic  investigations of alleged unfair  practices or discriminatory  treatment,  but it also provides for simultaneous re fe:.:ral  to  the GATT on  a  dual  time  frame which permits  the President to  act  in  light of both an STR  recom mendation  and  the  recommendations  of any GA TT panel that m:ght be con stituted.  In  this manner we preserve  our right of action while bringing  in  the GATT process at an earlier stage  and permitting it to operate as well.  Mr. President, this is a  long and de tailed bill reflecting what I  am afraid  are complicated and entailed issues. It is  vital, however, that the Congress master  these issues because a significant part of  the world's-and our Nation's-eco nomic future is going to be determined  by the MTN codes and their implement ing  legislation. Our trade deficit alone  is graphic evidence of  the  importance  of the MTN to us and of our need to ex amine what  the  P_dministration  has  agreed to with great care. The Senator  from New York and I offer this proposal  both as a reflection of our own examina tion of the subsidies code and in an effort  to stimulate discussion among our col leagues. Speaking for myself, I believe it  is  absolutely essential  that provisions  such as those we have proposed be in cluded in the implementing legislation if  the code is to have any meaning. Sena tor MOYNIHAN and I will be working to  that end, and we welcome the support  of our colleagues.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a summary of the bill and its  text be printed at  this point  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill and  ",1979

124,,96,0.378,1198,3,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, I  would like to insert the following article  in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD which ap peared in the Los Angel~~ Times, -:7anuary  28,  concerning  the v1s1t  of Vice-Premier Teng Hsiao-ping of the People's Re public of China. The  author, George  Bush, presents a sobering assessment of  the impact of Teng's visit. The article  follows:  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  March 5, 1979  TENG's AMERICAN VISIT: THE PRICE Is  HIGH  (By George Bush)  What's inside the Chinese fortune cookie?  That's  a question  that many Americans  may be asking as we await the celebrated  visit this week of Teng Hsiao-ping, vice pre mier of China, and the opening of a new era  in U.S.-Chinese relations.  To listen to White House officials over the  past five weeks, the President's decision to  re::ognize  the People's Republic of China  should yield three important benefits:  -It should create a strong new network of  interests that will curtail Soviet expansion  in Asia  and  reduce  the Soviet  threat  to  Western Europe;  -It should open the door to a vast expan sion of trade with China;  -And, says the Administration in a dis tinctly lower key, it should enhance Taiwan's  prospects for a secure, peaceful future.  How glorious it would be if all this were  true, but it is not--and the Administration  knows it is not. As one who once represented  the United States  in Peking and believes  we should be friends with that nation, I have  long argued that there are distinct benefits  to be  realized  from normalizing  relations  with China. Those benefits, however, will be  more modest than the Administration pre tends. Indeed, they will be far less than they  could have been had not the Administration  caved in during the negotiating process.  Before we are caught up in all the glamor  of Teng's visit, we ought to engage in a hard,  realistic assessment of what's involved  in  this new  relationship, and  the steps  that  must still be taken in U.S. foreign policy.  Administration spokesmen talk about their  ""playing of the Chinese card""  (a  term the  Chinese  themselves must  find  offensive)  guaranteeing strategic benefit for the United  States in relation to the Soviet Union. The  idea is that normalizing relations with China  will drive  the Soviets to make concessions.  Sadly, the Soviets are not intimidated in  the weeks that have followed the President's  . China announcement, Russian radio trans Initters have continually beamed inflamma tory messages in to Iran.  Soviet Communist  Party  chief  Leonid  Brezhnev has also backed out of a planned  trip to Washington this month and an early1979 conclusion of the SALT talks, to show  his displeasure at  the  idea of being up staged by Teng's visit. And in southern Asia.  some 100,000 Vietnamese  troops-armed  to  the teeth by the Soviets-marched into Cam bodia  and  quickly  swept  aside  the pro Chinese government. It was naked aggres sion, conceived, in part, to humiliate China.  The fact is that the Chinese, though they  have a  large standing army, are no overall  match today for the military juggernaut of  the Soviet Union. It is a delusion to believe  that our new formal relations with the Chi nese, at least in the foreseeable future, will  shift the global balance of power in our fa vor or will cause the Soviets to pull back.  The Chinese can and should play a useful  role  in helping  to stabilize much of Asia.  For many years, Chinese troops posted along  the southern rim of the Soviet Union have  tied down a fourth of the Soviet army. But  we should not expect that full normalization  has added a new, magic dimension to con taining the Soivets' quest for ""hegemony,""  China's favorite phrase.  Similarly, we should be realistic about com mercial prospects with China. With a  tow ering  trade deficit-approximately $33 bil lion last year-it is natural that the Presi dent's spokesmen  should emphasize  their  hope for opening naw marl;ets in China. Yet  the euphoria surrounding this subject is as  superficial as the reaction of English mill  owners a. century ago: ""If we could just add  one inch to the length of every Chinese shirt;  we could keep  the mills running forever!""  There is little doubt that trade and invest ment opportunities with the People's Repub lic will increase after normalization, just as  they did before. Prior to President Carter's  move to normalization, American firxns re ported progress on long-pending contracts in,  among others, the hotel and ore-processing  industries. Moreover, there is hope of oil de posits,  though nobody knows how much,  where or when. It is  in our  interest and  China's to help the People's Republic to de velop their oil resources, and in this regard,  talks between the United States and China  were already well along the way before nor malization.  As the Chinese themselves well know, real  moderinza tion of the Chinese economy will  not come easily or soon. Serious weaknesses  exist in the Chinese  transportation system  and other parts of the industrial infrastruc ture. Per capita income is only $350 a year.  The education and  technical skills of  the  population are also limited.  Further, even  if they could absorb more  of our goods, it is unclear what they could  sell us in return over the next few years.  As President Carter and Teng Hsiao-ping  discuss these matters this week, they will no  doubt address the question of most-favored nation status, as have most of our major  trading partners. With firm guarantees of the  security of Taiwan from the Chinese, in the  overall negotiations,  I would favor the ex tension  of most-favored-nation  status  to  China. By  law, however, both the Chinese  and the Soviets are now precluded from that  status. To grant it to the Chinese, either the  1974 Trade Act must be amended, or special  legislation passed;  in either case, a snub of  the Soviets would be difficult to avoid.  All  in all, we should expect only modest  gains in our trade with the Chinese. Total  trade between our countries runs about $1  billion a year today. No matter how swiftly  it grows over the next five years,  it would  still be significantly  less  than our current  trade with Taiwan, which exceeded $6 bil lion in the first 11 months of 1978.  Moreover,  the Administration seems un willing to acknowledge that much of this ex pansion would have occurred even in the ab sence of  formal diplomatic  ties. Over  the  past year and a half, before recent negotia tions began, the Chinese were ardently seek ing western  technology and our  sales  to  China were rapidly rising. Over the past four  months, the commercial pace has again accel erated and many American companies have  begun making serious plans for trading with  and investing in the mainland. In truth, lt  was exactly this Chinese eagerness for trade  that gave the United States unprecedented  leverage  in our negotiations over recogni tion-leverage that we carelessly tossed aside.  Even if the strategic and economic benefits  of this deal were tremendous, however, they  would hardly justify the way that we handled  the third and final issue upon which recogni tion turned: the future of Taiwan.  For nearly three decades, the United States  has firmly guaranteed the safety and security  of Taiwan, a pledge that has been repeated  by every postwar President. During that time,  the people on Taiwan have created a  rela tively free government and an economy that  is the envy of developing nations. Our un willingness to terminate our treaty with Tai wan offered hope  to small countries  that  wanted  to  remain  free. Our allies  in  the  Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO)  as well as Israel, particularly, noted our de termination that the solution to the Taiwan  problem be peaceful.  In the negotiations that followed President  Nixon's China visit  the American  government always insisted on some guaran tee of a peaceful solution to the Taiwanese  question. Incredibly, it turns out that the  Carter Administration has accepted all of  the demands of the Chinese on recognition  but has capitulated on our single demand rein 1971,  ",1979
125,,96,0.278,1211,3,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker,  for the past 2 years, the Congress has  wrestled with  the problem of how  to  manage Federal  lands  in the State of  Alaska. The  issue  is complex and  the  potential rewards are tremendous: Mil lions of acres to be set aside for protec tion and management of fish, wildlife,  recreation, and scenic values; minerals,  oil, and gas, and  timber  resources  to  improve our balance of trade and sus tain our Nation in this  time of crisis;  settlement of the land entitlement dis pute which will give both the State of  Alaska and Alaskan Natives their land;  and continued opportunity for hunting,  fishing, and maintenance of the Alaska  way of life.  In the last hours of the last session,  3921  a  delicate  compromise  was  nearly  achieved, one which at that time had  the support of myself, Representatives  UDALL and SEIBERLING, Senators STEVENS,  JACKSON, and DURKIN' and Secretary of  the Interior Cecil Andrus. Unfortunately,  one Senator objected and no bill passed  the Congress.  This year, we once again have  the  chance to pass an Alaska lands bill that  meets  the  legitimate national  interest  and still protects the rights of Alaskans.  On Thursday, March 1, 1979, the House  Committee on Interior and Insular Af fairs reported out a bill which sets aside  nearly  100 million  acres  as  national  parks, national forests, national wildlife  refuges, national recreation areas, and  wild. and scenic rivers. In addition, the  bill allows for properly managed develop ment of natural resources and fulfills the  promise made to the State of Alaska by  the Alaska Statehood Act.  Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues to  know that the bill reported by the In terior Committee  is  the same as  that  carefully  crafted  compromise  which  nearly succeeded last year. It sets aside  nearly 100 million acres as conservation  units; it meets the needs of the Nation  and of the people of Alaska. This is a bill  which we can all support, and I urge  my colleagues to do so when it reaches  the floor.  The following is a summary of the bill  which was  reported  by  the  Interior  Committee:  SUMMARY OF ALASKA LANDS BILL REPORTED  BY HOUSE INTERIOR COMMITTEE  The following summarizes the Alaska lands  bill favorably reported by the House Interior  Committee on February 28. The official bill  number is still H.R. 39 because the reported  bill was adopted as an amendment in the  nature of a substitute. However, the measure  is printed as H.R. 2199  introduced by Rep.  Huckaby  (D-La.) This bill  represents  the  compromise agreement  reached by Messrs.  Udall, Seiberling, Durkin, Andrus, Stevens,  Jackson, Hansen, and Young last October.  LAND DESIGNATIONS  The bill affects a total of 120.6 million acres  of land in Alaska or nearly 33 percent of the  State. It creates  (a)  20.5 million acres of  Parks,  (b)  21.6 million acres of Preserves,  (c) 4.7 million acres of National Recreation  Areas, (d) 44.9 million acres of Wildlife Re fuges, (e) approximately 1.5 million acres of  Wild and Scenic Rivers,  (f) adds 3 million  acres to existing Forests, and (g) establishes  3.4 million acres of Conservation Areas. To tal ""new  lands"" set-aside are 99.6 million  acres.  In addition, approximately 19 million acres  of existing Forests, Parks, and Refuges are  reclassified as Wilderness areas. Within the  99.6 million acres of ""new lands"", 32 million  acres are also designated Wilderness;  total  Wilderness is 51 million acres. Lastly, 2 mil lion acres within the existing Tongass Forest  are  reclassified  as  Special Management  Areas.

131,House,96,-0.343,1263,3,Mr. PERKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I move  to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Speaker,  the President  recom mended that all the funds in the Career  Education Act be rescinded;  the com mittee recommended that only $12.5 mil lion be rescinded.  D 1525  The committee recommended the re scission of the $8 % million,  insofar as  postsecondary education  is  concerned,  and $4 million  taken from elementary  and secondary education.  Leaving $20 million in the bill for ele mentary and secondary education was  the committee's recommendation on the  career education bill.  But, Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask  the chairman of the committee a ques tion.  As I understand the committee's ;::.c tion, $12.5 million of the $32.5 million  appropriated  for  fiscal  1979  for  the  Career Education Incentive Act would be  rescinded. And, as I understand the com mittee's report explaining this action, no  to postsecondary  funds would be available under the act  educational  relating  the $32.5  demonstration projects as a result of this  rescission. I understand that $8.5 million  is presently earmarked from  million appropriation for that purpose.  I believe that I understand all of that  correctly, but where I am confused in volves  the remaining $4 million of the  rescission. The committee's report says  that no funds would be available for na tional demonstration projects in elemen tary and secondary education under this  rescission.  I am concerned about that statement  because the Office of Career Education is  presently funding a number of exemplary  elementary and secondary demonstration  programs throughout the country. And,  if we were to send all of the money to  the States and permit no funding at all  for exemplary projects from the national  level, there would be a grave danger that  these programs would have  to be cut  back.  Therefore,  I would  like  to ask  the  chairman of the subcommittee whether  he might interpret the committee's in tention for us. Would outstanding ele mentary and secondary demonstration  programs still be eligible  for  funding  from  the  national  level  under  this  rescission?  ",1979

135,,96,0.372,1289,3,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, growing  concern over the general incompetency  of  the administration's foreign policy  has, predictably enough, created a back lash of sympathy for the President. Re cent articles in the Wall Street Journal  and the New York Times defended Presi dent Carter and castigated his foreign  policy critics.  Is the criticism of the President's for eign policy unwarranted, as some are now  saying? Is the President really a victim  of events beyond his control? Should we  all be applauding his handling of for eign affairs since, as his supporters al ways tell us, we are not in a war?  I  think not. I  think our Nation is  in  serious trouble and there is direct, iden tifiable and clear cause-and-effect rela tionship between the President's incom petence in foreign affairs and our Na tion's growing problems abroad.  Business Week magazine, March 12,  1979, had addressed this question editori ally.  I want  to  insert that editorial ""Why the United States is Losing Power  in the World,"" into the RECORD at this  time in the hope that its calm, persuasive  tone will convince our colleagues  that  President Carter's foreign policy  is in deed a failure.  The article follows:  WHY THE U.S. IS LOSING POWER IN THE WORLD  For almost exactly 100 years-from the end  of the Civil War to the middle of 1965 when  Lyndon Johnson sent American troops into  the Vietnam war-the U.S. exerted rapidly  increasing power in world affairs and com manded growing respect from allies and en emies alike. Since 1965,  the  trend has re versed. There has been an alarming decline  in U.S. strength and a succession of disasters  involving U.S. policies. The erosion of U.S.  power and influence is proceeding so rapidly  ",1979
136,,96,-0.088,1315,3,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Speaker, for sev eral years, I have introduced legislation  concerning a balanced Federal budget.  My current bill (H.J. Res. 11) provides  for a constitutional amendment to re quire  that, except  in  time of war or  economic  emergency declared by  the  Congress, expenditures of the Govern ment may not exceed the revenues of  the Government during any fiscal year.  I have been encouraged by the irowing  call for such a  constitutional amend ment, as evidenced by the fact that 25  State legislatures have passed resolutions  calling  for  the  passage  of  such  an  amendment.  In 1976,  the legislature in my home  State of Florida passed a memorial ask ing Congress to call a convention for the  sole and exclusive purpose of proposing  an amendment  to  the Constitution  to  require a balanced Federal budget. I do  not believe that this memorial has ever  been bought to the attention of the House  and, therefore, I respectfully request that  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the memorial be printed  in  GRESSIONAL RECORD as follows:  the CON A memorial to the Congress of the United  States making application to the Congress  to call a convention for the sole and ex clusive purpose of proposing an amend ment to the Constitution of the United  States to require a balanced federal budget  and to make certai~ exceptions thereto  Whereas,  it  is estimated,  as of August,  1975, that the federal debt at the end of the  1975 fiscal year will be $558.637 billion, and  Whereas,  the  fiscal year deficit  for 1976  will be the largest in our history, between  $70 and $80 billion, and  Whereas, the growing debt is a major con tributor to  inflation,  lagging economic in vestment, excessive  interest rates, and the  resulting unemployment, and  Whereas,  the  economic welfare  of  the  United States and its citizens depends on a  stable dollar and sound economy, and  Whereas, the National Conference of State  Legislatures passed Resolution No. 11 at its  Annual Business Meeting on October 10, 1975,  urging  the Congress  to  take prompt and  affirmative action to limit federal spending,  and  Whereas, there is provision in Article V of  the Constitution of  the United States for  amending the Constitution by the Congress,  on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, calling a conven tion for proposing amendments which shall  be valid  to all  intents and purposes when  ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths  of the several states, or by conventions in  three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other  mode of ratification may be proposed by the  Congress, now, therefore,  Be  it Resolved by the Legislature of the  State of Florida:  That the Legislature of the State of Florida  does hereby make application to the Con gress of the United States pursuant to Article  V of the Constitution of the United States to  call a convention for the sole purpose of pro posing an amendment to the Constitution of  the United States to require a balanced fed eral budget and to make certain exceptions  with respect thereto.

GERALD B. H. SOLOMON  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 6, 1979  e ",1979
137,,96,0.492,1315,3,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, each  year the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the  United States and its Ladies Auxiliary  conduct a Voice of Democracy contest.  This year more than 250,000 secondary  school students throughout  the Nation  participated in  the contest, competing  for five national scholarships. The con test theme this year was ""Why I Care  About America.""  I am delighted to announce that this  year's New York State winner of the  Voice of Democracy contest is a resident  of the 29th Congressional District, Jason  Carleton DeMille of Burnt Hills. Jason is  a  senior at Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake  High School, and will pursue a pre-law  4025  course at Brigham Young University  after graduation.  I am  including a  text of Jason De Mille's winning speech in the RECORD at  this point, and wish him well in the na tional  competition  now  underway  in  Washington.  SPEECH OF JASON DEMILLE  ""The world has set its face hopefully on  our Democracy and, oh, my fellow citizens,  each one of you carries on your shoulders the  burden of doing well for the sake of your own  country and of seeing that the nation does  well  for  the sake of mankind."" Theodore  Roosevelt knew the destiny of America was  to be the abode of liberty, and the only way  to insure that destiny was through respon sive and responsible citizens. God gave us  patriots who, like Roosevelt, inspired cour ageous men to follow  their leadership. To gether  they  forged  a  nation conceived  in  liberty with freedom for all. That freedom is  why I care about America!  Caring for America is more than supporting  the Constitution, voting  in elections, and  paying taxes. Too often we equate American ism with the number of cars, or televisions,  or the growth in the Dow Jones Average. To  care about America is to be fully committed  to her cause. This commitment is the basis  on which Americanism should be measured:  That is, by the integrity of her citizens, their  voluntary service and high personal prin ciples, and by their loyalty. I can show I care  about America by supporting and defending  her high  ideals, by educating myself suffi ciently  to know how  to fulfill my respon sibilities, and by keeping well informed so I  can express a valid opinion. I must commit  myself  to my country's ideals so I will be  ready and willing to defend her in times of  national distress, whether the foe be inflation  or an aggressive nation. I will be part of the  solution-not  the problem! The words ""I  can, I will, I did"" are motivating forces in my  life for apathy and indifference will not be a  part of me as  they have no place  in an  American.  As an American I am morally obligated to  be an honest, forthright citizen: That means  being honest with my fellow man, honest in  payment of taxes, honest in obeying, honor ing, and sustaining the law, and honest with  myself. I owe it to my country to be chaste,  virtuous, benevolent, and patient with those  around me. Of paramount importance is the  virtue of being kind and considerate to all  men, and especially .to my family, for strong  families are the backbone of a strong nation.  I can truly serve America by using my time  wisely, not just in pursuit of gain or pleasure  for myself, but to help others-for service  to others is service to America. I can show I  care about America by living my life so well  that men will be better for having known  me, for every man owes it to his country to  leave it better than he found it. I will, there fore, commit myself to serving my God and  my country because a commitment to serve  is the highest expression of caring.  ""Nothing is more certainly written in the  book of fate than that this people shall be  free."" How much is my liberty worth? How  much  is any man's liberty worth?  I  care  about America because everything that I do  or will do is a result of liberty. Without lib erty I could do nothing. Liberty is truly a  pearl of great price. I care about America be cause I know with assurity that her govern ment is the best on this earth and because  of this, no other nation has ever enjoyed the  growth  and prosperity which has blessed  America. This weal th is evidenced from the  beneficience of our free institutions and free  enterprise. The thing which has made Amer ica great is what her citizens have done with  their  freedom  of  choice. Thanks  to my  Creator and concerned forefathers, I am able  to live my life in freedom.  Freedom is real and must continue! I will  ",1979

139,Senate,96,-0.43,64,7,Mr. DURKIN.," Mr. President, the bill  that I introduce today attempts to cor rect a serious deficiency in the way that  communities with large blocks of feder ally owned land are granted payments in  lieu of taxes.  One of the greatest assets in my home  State of New Hampshire is the White  Mountain National Forest. Almost 700,000 acres in size, the national forest com prises about 12 percellJt of  the State's  entire land mass and contains some of its  most scenic and productive timberlands.  Over the years this Federal domain has  served the public well. It has been able to  accommodate both the recreational needs  of numerous people in New Hampshire  and New England as well as produce a  steady supply of wood for the local tim ber industry.  While the White Mountain National  Forest has added substantially  the  quality of life in the region, its some times overwhelming presence has caused  some consternation among a few of its  smaller neighbors.  I  speak specifically  of the small communities in New Hamp shire that are virtually surrounded by  national forest  land, and, as a  result,  rave no opportunity  to expand  their  property tax base.  To its credit, the Congress recognized  the  revenue problems encountered by  such communities. By passing the Pay ments in Lieu of Taxes Act of 1976, the  Congress set down several formulas by  which individual towns would be reim bursed for all Federal land within their  boundaries.  However, the Congress also set popu lation standards  for  receiving Federal  payments in lieu of taxes. For instance,  a town with a population of 300 can get  a maximum in lieu of payment of $15,000,  no matter how much Federal acreage  lies within its boundaries. This provision  of the law has the unfortunate conse quence of discriminating against New  Hampshire communities-most of them  small-that abut the forest and have no where to turn in their quest for getting  additional real estate on their property  tax rolls.  to  My bill is simple: It merely lifts the  limit on payments for all towns under  10,000  in population. In this way,  the  towns on the fringes of the White Moun tain National Forest and numerous other  ",1979
140,Senate,96,-0.422,116,7,Mr. HART.," Mr. President, the distin guished chairman of the Committee on  Environment and Public Works, Sena tor RANDOLPH, and I are introducing to day the Inland Energy Impact Assist ance Act of 1979.  This revised version of similar legisla tion we introduced in the last Congress  w!ll set up a 5-year program within the  Economic Development Administration  to help State and local governments deal  with  the adverse social and economic  impacts of  energy development. This  program will be a counterpart  to  the  coastal energy  impact program estab lished in 1976.  Senator RANDOLPH and I revised this  bill in close cooperation with the White  House,  the Economic Development Ad ministration, and other executive agen cies. I thank them for their excellent co operation and assistance.  The act will authorize planning grants  to help State and local governments, will  allow better delivery of assistance under  existing Federal programs to meet en ergy impact needs, and will provide Federal seed money for State assistance to  help communities deal with impacts not  addressed by existing programs. After  5 years, when necessary State and local  mechanisms will be in place to deal with  future impacts, the program will end.  The Inland Energy Impact Assistance  Act is a necessary companion to accel erated energy production.  The need to increase domestic produc tion of energy resources  is clear. Two  quick facts underscore this importance.  First, petroleum now  supplies  almost  half of our energy needs. Second, almost  half of our petroleum comes from foreign  countries. The recent cutback in Iranian  exports  and  price  increases  by  the  OPEC cartel emphasizes  the problems  caused by relying on foreign sources.  Faced with this stark reality, nobody  will disagree with the need for increased  use of our domestic  energy  reserves.  The Department of Energy expects coal  production to increase by 50 percent in  the next 6 years, from about 700 million  tons  in 1977  to over 1 billion  tons in  1985. Even before  the recent incentive  of price decontrol, DOE expected do mestic crude oil production to increase by  8 percent in the same time period. Newer  energy supplies, like uranium and shale  oil, are likely to be developed at even  faster rates. To use these resources, al most 600 new powerplants are expected  by 1985, increasing electrical generation  by 40 percent.  While  these domestic  resources are  necessary  to meet overriding national  needs, their development can cause seri ous local adverse effects.  Energy resources are mostly in rural  areas. Typically, the community nearest  the side of the resources is a small town  with a constant or declining population,  a stable life style, a limited tax base, and  almost  nonexistent  governmental  re sources.  Energy  development  drastically  changes the community. A sudden influx  of new specialized workers arrives  to  develop the energy resource. The energy  workers also bring their families, and  create a demand for ""secondary""  jobs  to supply goods and services to the en ergy workers. Because of this multiplier  effect,  the actual population growth is  usually around 2.5 times the increase in  jobs directly related to the energy devel opment. This population surge is most  pronounced at the very first stage of  energy development, when  temporary  construction workers  are  present  in  great numbers.  This boom growth has already hap pened  in many places. Craig, Colo.,  which is in the center of a coal boom,  grew by almost 50 percent in three years,  and will likely double again by 1985.  This  sudden  population  growth  causes severe and complex problems, in cluding shortages in public facilities and  housing. The new residents rapidly over load existing schools, roads, sewers, hos pitals, and other facilities. Commercial  facilities and services cannot meet the  new surge of demand. Not enough hous ing is available for the new population.  Most new workers and their families end  up in mobile homes.  The social and economic disruptions  are worse than the shortages of facilities  and services. The community is overrun  by new pressures and new tensions.  The excess demand for limited goods  and services, paced by soaring housing  prices, creates a high inflation rate. This  inflation hits hardest  the older  resi dents, whose incomes are generally much  lower than the energy works. Sudd~nly  the community's original residents can  no longer afford to live in their town in  the way they have for years.  In a very real sense,  the community  itself does not exist as it did before the  energy development. The small, quiet,  stable, rural  town has vanished  to be  replaced by a booming community dom inated by a new industry and a new pop ulation. The social ties of the town are  severely strained and often break. The  old residents are resentful of the new.  Crime, alcoholism, child abuse, and other  indications of social breakdown become  common. In Craig, Colo.,  for example,  during 3 years of rapid growth caused by  coal mining  and  power  generation,  crimes against people increased by 900  percent, alcoholism cases  increased by  623  percent,  family  disturbances  in creased by 352 percent, child abuse and  neglect cases increased by 130 percent,  and child behavior problems by 1,000  percent.  Together, these problems make up the  well known ""boom town"" syndrome. The  most extreme examples  include Craig  and Hayden, Colo., and Rock Springs  and Gillette, Wyo. The problems, how ever,  are not confined  to  the Rocky  Mountain West, Appalachia, and other  areas of major energy  resources. The  same problems arise from rapid popu lation growth associated with any en ergy development, whether it is a coal  mine or a nuclear generating facility.  Virtually every state will experience se vere  impact problems as our domestic  energy production accelerates.  The nature and extent of these prob lems is well documented. A March 1978,  report  to  the President estimates $80  billion is needed by 1985 for the basic  public facilities and services to support  domestic energy development.  Of course, the local effects of energy  development are not all bad. Although  local enthusiasm for energy development  is waning as people  learn more about  the adverse effects, some communities  still welcome the new jobs and increased  local  tax bases. Some people point  to  this additional revenue, and ask why the  communities cannot use it to meet their  needs. While  this seems reasonable at  first glance, a closer examination shows  why  local governments by  themselves  cannot solve their problems.  The impacted communities' needs far  exceed  their current and expected re sources. As I have pointed out, the towns  near energy resources are usually small,  with limited revenues and a lack of gov ernmental services. For example, of 179  in Federal Region vm  communities  with energy-related impacts, only about  25 have planners. The almost total lack  of expertise to deal with rapid growth  leaves these communities extremely vul nerable.  ",1979
141,Senate,96,0.444,129,7,Mr. TOWER.," Mr. President, babies  born today are faced with a 7 to 8 per cent inflation rate, a 6 percent unem ployment rate, high  taxes, a declining  dollar,  increasing government, and are  $3,300 in debt. This may be one explana tion as  to why  they cry  louder  than  ever, according to C. Jackson Grayson  in a perceptive article appearing in the  April 16 issue of the Dallas Vision. Dr.  Grayson, who heads the American Prod uctivity Center in Houston, observes that  the entire free world is walking a tight rope between high unemployment and  double-digit inflation.  Unfortunately, most of the solutions  being proposed  to remedy our current  economic ills, including high deficits to  stimulate demand, tina tuning, and vol untary restraint to wage and price con trols,  focus  on  symptoms  instead of  causes.  Dr. Grayson calls for an alternative  approach. The crux of the problem is  growth and productivity. Growth creates  jobs and holds down inflation. But, as  Dr. Grayson sees it, because the prime  source of growth is productivity, econ omy-wide real income and job creation  can rise no faster than productivity.  Dr. Grayson's guess is that three main  factors  influence  the slowdown in the  United States of the productivity growth  rate: Slowing capital, and research and  development expenditures; Government  interventions of many kinds; and man agement and labor inattention. But what  concerns him most is that not enough  business.  labor, or Government leaders  are moving to inform themselves about  productivity and then to pursue it as an  answer. His solutions are found in the  following steps:  The President and Congress create  and fund programs for productivity im provement in the public sector;  Labor,  organized  and  unorganized,  help to creat-e productivity programs in  their firms, industries, and unions;  And finally, productivity improvement  programs cross domestic borders and  take cognizance of the growing economic  interdependence of nations.  Because of the timeliness of Jackson  Grayson's article,  request that it be  printed in the RECORD.  The article follows:  I  CXXV--504-Part 7  THE PROBLEM OF PRODUCTIVITY  (By c. Jackson Grayson)  Someone  said  recently  that  the  reason  babies born today cry  louder than ever  is  that they enter the world with a seven-to eight percent inflation rate, a six percent un employment  rate, high  taxes,  a  declining  dollar, increasing government, and are $3300  in debt. It's enough  to make grown men  cry.  The entire free world ls walking a  tight rope between high unemployment and dou ble-digit inflation. Inflation ln the United  States has moved  steadily upward. From  1955 to 1960 the rate was 2.4 percent. From  1967 to 1972 it was 4.8 percent. From 1972  to 1977 it was 7.2 percent. In 1978, lt grew at  an 8 percent  rate. And  in  the  first  two  months o! 1979, the inflation rate increased  by more than 10 percent. A recent survey  by  the National Association  of Business  Economists produced a  forecast by half o!  their members of six to seven percent infla tion annually over the next five years; and  30 percent think it will be more than seven  percent.    The solutions being proposed  to remedy  our current economic ills include high def icits  to  stimulate demand;  ""fine  t1,1ning""  with  spending and  tax programs; money  suppl; manipulation; and income policies of  infinite variety from voluntary restraint to  wage and price controls. Almost all of these  focus on symptoms instead o! causes. They  are short-run, not long-run-oriented. They  increase  the  role of government and are  anti-private enterprise and anti-productive.  Unless  an alternative  approach  is pre sented, I  fear  that fn frustration and de spair  the American people will  insist on  more political guidance over  the economy,  rising protectionism, and more control over  labor and management.  The differences in gross national product  per capita that appear over the surface of  this planet are explained largely by differ ences  in growth. Growth creates  jobs.  It  holds  down  inflation. Because  the prime  source of growth  is productivity, economy wide real income and job creation can rise no  faster  than productivity. Some mistakenly  believe that growth stimulates productivity.  In the short-run that is true; productivity  does rise in a  recovery period. But, 1n the  long-run, it is the other way around: pro ductivity causes growth. So  if we are  to  have growth,  reduce  inflation, and create  jobs, then there must be an increase in na tional  productivity.  John  Kennedy  ran  against Richard Nixon in 1960 on an eco nomic growth  theme. He promised to ""get  the country moving again"". We need that  call today.  Productivity is what you get out for what  you put in. Output over input. And not out put only over labor hours, but also over cap ital input, over energy input, and over ma terials input. We must look at total output  relative to input. And not just for manu!ac uring, but also,  for  services--banking,  in surance,  reta111ng,  doctors, hospitals,  and  government. It sounds naive to some people  to think that labor and management in the  private sector can do anything any more to  influence the economy. There is even anger  by some labor and management leaders that  they should do anything. And,  instead of  acting, too many leaders are searching for  the Wizard of Oz who controls all of this so  they can dispatch the villain. There 1s no  v1llain. American inflation and American un employment were made in America by Amer icans.  Monetary and fiscal policies clearly have  a great deal to do with creating and solving  unemployment and inflation. But there are  limits to what demand-management policies  by themsleves can do, and the ""fine tuning""  of these policies exceeds our ab1Uties to manage the economy with such calibrating ad justments. Anyway, the best monetary/fiscal  targets and goals usually get sabotaged or  exaggerated by politics. Finally, monetary  and  fiscal policies are not understood by  most Americans, nor are they believed to be  within their abillties to intluence.  It 1s time that we focus on fundamental,  long range solutions that are econonilcally  real, that  the average American worker and  manager can understand, and that he can  influence everyday. These solutions grow out  ot productivity.  There is little doubt that the productivity  growth rate in  the U.S. is slowing. For the  past  ten years we have had the lowest rate  of productivity growth of any other mod ern industrial nation in the world. While our  level of productivity remains the highest in  the world, our  long-term growth rate has  been cut in half in recent years. For the pe riod of 1947-1966, our annual average gl'Owth  rate was about 3.2 percent per year. Between  1967 and 1977, our ra~e of growth dropped  to 1.5 percent per year. The difference be tween a growth rate of 3.2 percent and 1.5  percent  is  almost  the difference between  night and day. These figures  indicate that  somethhing is fundamentally wrong. In the  early part of  this decade,  there was  the  standard belief that the decline was caused  by the business cycle. Today there is aJmOSit  unanimous agreement and concern that the  slowdown  is not cyclical but secular. Last  August the Wall Street Journal reported that  ""these sluggish gains  in productivity now  extend back for a decade, strongly indicat ing that a fundamental unfavorable struc tural problem has emerged in the economy.""  Why is our productivity growth rate slow ing? There are many explanations offered,  such as government regulation, nonproduc tive environmental  investments, work dis incentives, aging plants and institutions, and  loss o! will to grow. The answer  is probably  some of all and all of some of these. The  striking fact  is that no one really knows.  For such an important factor central to the  economic well being and future  standard  of living in the U.S., we really don't know  why we are slowing down I My own guess 1s  that three main faetors influence the slow down: slowing capital and research and de velopment expenditures; government inter ventions of many kinds; and management  and labor inattention. What concerns me 1s  that not enough business, labor or govern ment leaders are moving  to inform  them selv~s about productivity and then to pursue  it as an answer. On the contrary, there is too  littJe awareness of these factors: the impor tanbe of productivity  in  job creation and  pri~e stability; the slowdown in productivity  groWth;  the  rapid  ga.lns  in productivity  grqwth by other nations, passing us by in  some  industries;  the dangers of a world wide  slowdown  in growth, and  its conse quences;  the relationship between produc tivity and our standard of living. I suggest  that we begin a national productivity effort  to include government, industry, individual  business (including management and labor).  and international cooperation.  The President and Congress must create  and fund programs for productivity improve ment  in  the public sector. Until  recently  there was an agency in Washington charged  with this responsibillty, the National Center  for Productivity and Quality of Working  Llfe. But Congress allowed it to die last year.  to be a plan to farm  There now appears  out some of its functions to other govern ment  departments,  and  coordinate  them  through a council. But this is not likely to be  effective. No money goes with the farm-outs,  and the council's efforts are likely to be lost  in the shume.  I  recommend  that either  through  legis lation or  through Executive Order a  lead  agency charged with productivity responsl",1979

146,House,96,-0.228,168,7,Mr. BONER of Tennessee.," Mr. Chair man, I move to strike the requisite num ber of words, and I rise in support of the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I had an amendment  that would have called. for an across the-board cut of 8 percent in foreign aid  for this year. That would have, as this  amendment does, excluded  the money  that would be appropriated  to Egypt  and to Israel. This is not only  in the  interest of international peace and co operation;  it  is not a  reward for  the  signing of an historical peace  treaty  and not a singling out of any particular  nation for special attention, but to sup port the activities of two vital nations  to the interest :of the United States.  I have read the Agency for Interna tional Development <AID) congressional  presentation for fiscal year 1980 on the  Egyptian and Israeli security supporting  assistance.  This  economic  assistance  seeks to insure the stability and viab111ty  of Israel's economy, with $785 million in  balance-of-payments assistance for fis cal year 1980. The State of Israel has  begun to emerge from a period of severe  economic difficulty  following  the 1973  war and its trade and current deficits  have decreased and its growth rate is up.  The requested funds will enable Israel  to continue its economic recovery,  in crease its rate of growth, improve its for eign exchange position reducing short term debt, and provide the needed sta bility to make it a bulwark of peace and  security in the region. In addition, the  bill provides for $750 million for Egypt  in fiscal year 198(}, which will finance  essential goods and services required for  Egypt's economic development programs,  and provide for a broad range of devel opment assistance projects  in agricul ture, fertilizer productions, water, sew erage,  telecommunication and the pri vate sector credit. I support singling out  Egypt and Israel in this proposed amend ment for a reduction of 8 percent.  I, therefore, wish to associate myself  with this amendment. In doing that, I  also wish to say that I have the greatest  of respect and admiration for the chair man of  this committee for the efforts  that he has personally undertaken  to  carry the load on this bill, and also for  the members of the committee. They are  to be applauded for their dedication and  the number of hours they have worked  to see that this bill has reached the point  where it is today. I also have the greatest  respect for the Department of State for  its work. I would express my apprecia tion to the members for reporting out  what I believe to be generally an im portant piece of legislation for the inter national relations of this Nation.  The cut that I would have proposed  would have been 8 percent, and in as sociating myself with this 5-percent cut,  t do so  in the spirit that we will not  have a reduction in our moral commit ment to the economic growth and devel",1979

149,House,96,-0.493,194,7,Ms. HOLTZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I  troduced two bills last Thursday which  propose changes in transportation law  for the purpose of improving transporta tion opportunities and alternatives for  our Nation's urban centers.  in The first bill amends title 23 of the  United States Code to increase the Fed eral share for substitute transportation  projects funded by the ""interstate. trans fer"" provision of our Federal highway  law. Under certain conditions enum erated in section 103 (e) of title 23, the  Governor of a State and local govern ments involved can request that Federal  funds reserved for an interstate high way project be used for substitute trans portation projects. Although the Federal  matching share of the interstate project  is 90 percent, the Federal share for sub stitute projects is only 85 percent. This  disparity can often inhibit a choice be tween the interstate highway and sub stitute projects. For example, each $1 in  local funds brings $9  in Federal funds  with a 90 percent Federal share but only  $5.66 in Federal funds with an 85 per cent Federal share.  Equalizing  the Federal share would  encourage State and  local officials  to  make a  choice among alternative uses  for funds based upon  the best use of  Federal and local funds instead of just  how to get the most funds.  The second bill amends section 5 of  the Urban Mass Transportation Act to  target more effectively Federal  funds  used principally for mass transit oper ating assistance by modifying the for mula for apportioning these funds. This  bill raises from 750,000 to 1 million the  minimum population  for  an area  to  qualify for the additional $250 million  which has been authorized by the Con gress for each of the four fiscal years  beginning with 1979 to assist large areas.  The Department of Transportation pro posed  this added assistance for areas  with over 1 million in population because  the Department found that the present  funding  formula  shortchanged  them.  Unfortunately, Congress, while approv ing the Department's proposal of a pro gram targeted at the country's larges~  population centers,  reduced  the eligi bility  level  for population  to 750,000,  despite the fact that areas with popula tions between 750,000 and 1 million are  not shortchanged by the formula.  Presently, our transit system in New  York City  is  struggling  to meet  its  financial commitments. I am disturbed  that the city's transit system serves 30  percent of the Nation's ridership, yet re ceives only 14 percent of Federal tran sit dollars. The Rystem would benefit  substantially by this bill.  This bill would mean that the New  York metropolitan area's transit sys tem would receive as much as an addi tional $10 million annually. Although  some of  these funds would be used in  New Jersey, more than $8 million would  improve  transit facilities  in  the State  of New York.  If this bill is enacted, New Orleans,  Phoenix, Portland, San Juan, Indianap olis,  Providence, Columbus,  and San  Antonio would lose their share of this socalled second tier.  However,  the Department of Trans portation did not find that these cities  were being treated unfairly by the pres ent formula. At a  time when the larger  cities, particularly those 1n the North",1979

Signatories  to  that  accord  agreed  to  facilitate  the  reunification of families which have been  separated by governments and political  borders. The Soviet Union is in no way  living up to that pledge.  The Congress  has  beE-n  concerned  about the existing situation and for the  past several years,  individual Members  have spoken on behalf of specific fami lies who  are  temporarily  stranded  in  Russia.

183,,96,-0.254,246,7,Mr. CARR.," Mr. Speaker, due to the  inquiries made concerning a study I in serted in the RECORD of March 5, 1979,  dealing with  the rankings of  the 96th  Congress House committees by age of  members and terms of service of memApril 10, 1979  bers, I have extended the study for the  two previous Congresses. I have also in cluded the Post Office and Civil Service  and Standards of Official Conduct Com mittees which were inadvertently omitted  from the earlier study.  The charts are set up in two ways; the  first shows all three Congresses set up  side by side so you can follow the changes  in each committee over  time, and the  second separates  the  three Congresses  so you can see the changes in ranking  more clearly. Although I make no par ticular interpretations of the data, cer tain trends in turnover rates of the com mittees do exist.  For example, while certain committees  maintained their positions at either the  top or bottom of the rankings for both  age and service length, such as Armed  Services and Interior respectively, others  were not quite so stable. The Judiciary  and Merchant Marine  and Fisheries  Committees increased notably in terms  of service, while on the other hand, the  Ways and Means and Standards of Of ficial  Conduct Committees  decreased  sharply. It should be noted  that  the  lengths of service are spread out more  evenly and do not cluster in  the high  priority committees as much as they did  in earlier Congresses.

185,,96,-0.218,272,7,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, I am today  introducing a bill  that is designed  to  discourage people with substantial re sources  from  divesting  themselves  of  these resources for little or no considera tion and then applying for public assist ance. The example most often called to  my attention has been elderly people  who give their assets away to their chil dren in order to make themselves eli gible for medicaid and enter a nursing  home at the taxpayer's expense.  The major source of current concern  stems from an oversight in the prepara tion of Public Law 92-603 which estab lished the SSI program. As I understand  it, a ban on eligibility for  individuals  who had transferred property was acci dentally omitted from a  final print of  the bill and was never enacted. The SSI  program  today has no requirement on  resource transfers other than that the  transfer itself shall.be valid under State  law.  This  problem was  brought  to my  attention by the former director of the  Texas Department of Human Resources,  Raymond Vowell. Mr. Vowell, an out standing administrator  said  that  the  problem of people pauperizing  them selves in order to be eligible for public  assistance was  becoming  a  national  scandal. Small town lawyers in my dis trict wrote me of the problem that they  could see in their own communities. I  raised  the problem  in public hearings  last year before  the Ways and Means  Committee and several other Members  April 10, 1979  agreed  that we need  to  take steps  to  solve this prOblem. The administration  has  also  recommended  that  this  be  changed.  My bill would deny eligibility for an  individual or his spouse,  if, within the  12-month period immediately preceding,  the person disposed of property of any  type which had a  value  in excess of  $1,000 for less than its fair market value,  and which  if  retained by  the person  would cause the person to be found in eligible for benefits under this act.  This is simple fairness. The taxpayers  should not be asked to support those who  can easily support themselves.  I  am attaching  a  letter  from Mr.  Jerome Chapman, the present commis sioner of Human Resources  in Texas  that gives a few case examples to give  us an idea of the resources that are be ing transferred.  The letter fOllows:  TEXAS DEPARTMENT  OF HUMAN RESOURCES,  Austin Tex., March 27, 1979.  Hon. J. J. (JAKE) PICKLE,  House of Representatives  Washington, D.C.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN PICKLE: The Depart ment of Human Resources increasingly has  become alarmed at the number of individuals  who have transferred resources in order to  qualify for ~edicaid benefits. The  lack of  legislation in this area increases both state  and federal expenditures for medical care of  individuals who have been financially able to  provide for all or part of  their own needs  before  the disposal of excess  resources  to  qualify for benefits.  Public Law 92-603 requires states to use  the Supplemental Security Income eligib111ty  criteria in determining eligib111ty for ~ed­ icaid benefits. This  is mandatory in states  such as Texas, where  the state elected  to  cover all SSI recipients for ~edicaid coverage  rather than utilize a spend-down provision.  Title XVI of the Social Security Act estab blishes eligibility criteria for  the SSI Pro gram. Under this law, there  is no prohibi tion to the transfer of property to qualify for  federal and state benefits.  An opinion was formally requested from  the Department of Health, Education, and  Welfare as to whether Texas could prohibit  the transfer of property under a State law.  Official response from DHEW indicated that  a  state could not prohibit the  transfer of  property for  the purpose of qualifying for  ~edicaid benefits because such a prohibition  would conflict with the Social Security Act  as amended by Public Law 92-603.  Under the state assistance programs, be fore the implementation of the SSI Program  in January 1974, there was a five-year limita tion  imposed on any  transfer of property.  If any  includible resource had been trans ferred within  five years  from  the date of  application,  that transfer would be evalu ated to determine if the intent was to attain  eligibility  for  assistance. If this were  the  determination, assistance was denied.  The SSI Program has no such restrictions.  Our staff continually encounters applicants  who have excess resources when an applica tion for assistance is tiled. Once the appli cants  are  advised  that  they have  excess  resources and are  ineligible,  they  transfer  the resources and reapply for assistance. The  transfer of resources may involve a few dol lars or, more commonly, thousands of dollars.  The fact that these individuals, who could  provide  for  their own medical needs,  are  eligible while  an  individual who  has  10  cents over  the monthly  income  limit  is  ineligible with no  resources  to rely on,  is  ",1979
186,,96,-0.509,285,7,Mr. BINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, the REc ORD has already  included an excellent  recent editorial by the New York Times  which discussed the shortcomings in the  version of Alaska lands legislation which  the Committee on Interior and Insular  Affairs ordered reported by a one-vote  margin.  For the benefit of all our colleagues,  and especially those from  the State of  New York, I am here having reprinted  recent editorials from Newsday and from  the  Boonville Herald which  rightly  point out just how important this matter  is, and why the House should support  the substitute  that will be offered by  Chairman  UDALL  when  the matter  reaches the floor :  LOOK BUT DoN'T TOUCH IN ALASKA  An Alaskan  lands bill came out or  the  House  Interior Committee  this week  that  would permit oil and gas exploration-but  not production, it says here-on the Arctic  Wildlife Range.  The committee must be kidding. What's  the point of drilling to find oil if you can't  pump out of  the ground? The enormous  commercial pressures already brought to bear  on Alaskan lands would be nothing compared  to the demand to recover the oil if any is  discovered.  The committee bill would allow far  too  much  exploitation  of public property  in  Alaska by mining, drilling,  lumbering and  other commercial  interests. Last year  the  House overwhelmingly passed a  responsible  bill  for  the distribution of Alaskan  lands.  It died  in the Senate, but public and ad ministration support for it remains strong.  We hope it's strong enough to overcome the  predictable  lobbying by oil-state congress men and the would-be exploiters of a unique  American heritage.  A PASSIONATE CAUSE  ""Wilderness values may not appeal to all  Americans. But they make up a passionate  cause  for millions,"" wrote Supreme Court  Justice William 0. Douglas in his book Wil derness Bill of Rights. One of the most pas sionate of wilderness causes has become the  battle to preserve Alaska's wildlands, Amer ica's last great frontier. People in all cor ners of  the nation care deeply. They care  about the primeval rain forests of Admiralty  Island and Misty Fjords, about the fragile  tundra of the Arctic and the soaring peaks  of Wrangell-St. Elias. They care about pre serving the sensitive nesting habitat of the  peregrine falcon and the whistling swan, the  calving grounds of the wide-ranging Porcu pine caribou herd and the forested domain of  the brown bear.  People care even though they may never  personally see this last frontier. It is enough  to know that it exists and will be forever  preserved, for wilderness also dwells in the  mind and th~ heart. Because thousands upon  thousands upon thousands of citizens have  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  taken the time to express their views and  make known  their concern  for protecting  Alaska's wildlands, we are entering 1979 well  on the way to realization of our goal. Our  elected and appointed officials in Washington  are listening and acting in the national in terest on what has become the most signifi cant conservation initiative of the century.  President Carter deserves commendation  for his bold, decisive and visionary action in  establishing 17 new national monuments in  Alaska encompassing 56 million acres-spec tacularly beautiful and  irreplaceable  seg ments of our national heritage. He has also  recognized the critical importance of with drawing another 40 million acres for consid eration as national wildlife refuges, and 11  mlllion acres, of national  forest  land  for  study and possible wilderness designation.  These sweeping measures have ranked him,  along with Teddy Roosevelt, as one of our  great conservation Presidents.  We must also acknowledge the influential  roles played by key Administration officials.  Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus has become  an effective advocate  for conservation and  has worked tirelessly to develop a balanced  resolution to the Alaska lands issue. Agricul ture Secretary Bob Bergland has shown cour age  and  foresight  in  supporting national  monument status for Admiralty Island and  Misty Fjords and in withdrawing other areas  in the Tongass and Chugach National Forests  so they may be seriously studied for wilder ness designation. No aspect of the Adminis tration's Alaska lands proposal has withstood  as much scrutiny or intense, acrimonious de bate as the classification of Southeast's for est lands.  Congress by default threw the Alaska issue  into the Administration court when the 95th  Congress adjourned in October. The Presi dent has responded with major initiatives to  ensure  lasting protection  for  a  significant  portion of Alaska's wildlands, but key areas  remain  vulnerable  and  innumerable  land  classification  and management  issues  are  still unresolved. Responsib111ty for complet ing this work lies once again with Congress.  New legislation must grant wilderness desig nation to qualified and deserving areas. Con servationists are pushing for 88 mlllion acres  in addition to the Wilderness System. Wild  and scenic rivers also deserve protection and  certain critical lands overlooked in the presi dential proclamations  should be  incorpo rated  in  the  national  park  and  refuge  systems.  We can expect continued heavy opposition  from development interests and heated de bate on Capitol Hill. We've come far but  there is a long way yet to go. People who care  must be prepared  to say so again  in  the  months ahead.e  NATIONAL VOLUNTEER WEEK  HON. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 10, 1979    ",1979
187,,96,-0.33,285,7,Mr. TRAXLER.," Mr. Speaker, Decision  Making Information,  Inc.  recently re leased a new national public opinion sur vey on  the attitudes of  the American  electorate  toward crime and gun con trol.  This new and comprehensive study as sesses  the public's views of crime,  its  causes and potential remedies. Its find ings are useful to legislators at all levels  of government  in  the search for solu tions to our Nation's crime problem. As  the DMI survey shows, Americans are  highly concerned about crime, rating it  just below inflation and other economic  ~roblems. The average citizen feels crime  has increased over the past 10 years and  expects  it  to worsen  in  the  coming  decade. Perceived  causes  for  this  in crease include poor economic conditions,  moral and social decay and lenient sen tencing of criminals. Less  than 1 per cent attribute the increase in crime  to  ""too lenient gun laws.""  To the poor,  the elderly, and to  the  residents of our  larger cities, crime  is  especially threatening. The crimes most  feared are, as expected, crimes of vio lence. For example, the poll found that 65  percent mention murder committed  in  the course of another crime as one of  the three most feared crimes, with rob bery /mugging, burglary /theft, and rape  the next greatest fears.  It has been apparent long before DMI  so extensively researched the issue, that  the causes o-f crime are complex, rooted  deep within  the social structure. Solu tions to such complex problems cannot  be found in simplistic proposals as gun  control advocates would have us believe.  ",1979
188,,96,0.178,298,7,Mr. EVANS of Delaware.," Mr. Speaker,  Lewes, Del. is fortunate to have one of  the best harbors of refuge on the east  coast. Because of this unique situation,  I believe Lewes Harbor can become the  catalyst  for new economic growth  southern Delaware. This development  could provide hundreds of needed jobs  in my State, without having any adverse  effect on our precious natural resources.  All that is needed to spur this growth  is the deepening from 9 to 15 feet of the  channel at Lewes. On April5, I appeared  before the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Energy and Water Development to  discuss  the  tremendous economic po tential of the Lewes Harbor. I asked the  Congress to further this development by  providing $700,000 to deepen the chan nel at Lewes. This money would be a wise  investment in the future of Delaware and  the Delmarva peninsula.  The Army Corps of Engineers has in formed me that the benefits of this proj ect would be at least eight times its cost.  I might point out that the Congress gen erally funds projects which have a bene fit cost ratio of only 2 or 3 to 1.  Coupled with its rail service and good  road network, Lewes could be a major  port for fishing fleets, oil development  companies,  recreational  boating,  and  many other industries. I am hopeful that  the Appropriations Committee will make  room in the Federal budget this year for  Lewes Harbor.  Knowing that many of my colleagues  will frequent the Delaware coast in the  coming months, I insert my remarks be fore the subcommittee in the REcORD.  REMARKS  BY  CONGRESSMAN  EVANS,  JR.  THOMAS  B.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity  to address the Subcommittee on Energy and  Water Development Appropriaticns about a  mntter of much importance to my State and  the Mid-Atlantic Region,  the maintenance  dredging  of  the Lewes Harbor of Refuge  Channel  in Lewes, Delaware  by  the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers. This project, which  requires  an  appropriation  of  $700,000.00  would serve as  the catalyst for significant  new private ca'Jital investment in the Del marva peninsula and provide many  full time unsubsidized  jobs  in an area where  seasonal tourism is the principal source of  employment.  The Lewes Harbor of Refuge is located near  the City of Lewes, Sussex County, Delaware,  at the mouth of the Delaware Bay. Lewes is  strategically located along a major shippin(~  lane which provides direct service  to Wil mington and Philadelphia and permits ac ce~s to Baltimore  throu<z;h  the Chesapeake  an<! Delaware Canal. I believe that Lewes has  the potential  to become a  rna 'or  re7ional  port  facility servicing the Delmarva Peninsula and southern New Jersey.  The Lewes Harbor of Refuge Project was  adopted in 1894 to talce advantage of Lewes'  April 10, 1979  strategic position near a major shipping lane  as well as the unique physical configuration  of Cape Henlopen. The project, which was  modified in 1930 and 1935, provided an 8000feet  long stone breakwater, 11  ice piers, a  300-feet long and 15-feet deep channel and  turning basin. The project was completed in  1951 at a  total cost of $5,162,230.00. The  Harbor of Refuge project provided Lewes  with a  safe, deep water, protected harbor.  In the 1950's, the Lewes Harbor of Refuge  became  the center of  the Menhaden Fish  industry.  During this period, a major industrial com plex was constructed at the Harbor of Ref uge site, including piers, terminals, fish proc essing  facilities,  storage  tanks,  residential  quarters, and support structures. At its peak,  this complex served as the home port for over  100 commercial vessels. Unfortunately,  the  Menhaden schools began  to migrate south  in the early 1960's and use of the port facility  rapidly  declined.  The  last maintenance  dredging of the Lewes Harbor of Refuge chan nel  to the authorized depth of 15  feet oc curred during fiscal year 1964 by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers.  Without the prop wash action of the ear lier port traffic, siltation began to clog the  channel. A September 1978 survey indicated  a mean low water depth in the channel of  only nine feet. However, recent developments  have greatly enhanced the potential of Lewes  once again becoming a major regional port  facility. In 1973, most of the predominately  vacant industrial complex was acquired by  Fischer Enterprises, Inc. of Milford, Delaware.  This firm had previously leased a portion of  the site  for  the  transport and storage of  bulk liquid fertilizer. Fischer Enterprises has  now embarked upon a major revitalization  program for the port facility which will re sult  in significant new private capital  in vestment in Lewes, and an increase in unsub sidized private sector  job opportunities.  However, the future of the port facility de pends upon the ability of Fischer Enterprises  to attract deep draft vessels to Lewes. There fore, it is vital that a maintenance dredging  be conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engl neers to restore the Lewes Harbor of Refuge  channel to  its authorized depth of 15  feet.  There are substantial benefits which would  accrue as a result of this dredging. Dredging  to the authorized depth would permit a sig nificant expansion of the transport and stor age of fertilizer in Lewes. These current ten ants who deal in bulk nitrogen solutions will  benefit substantially from a deeper channel  leading into Breakwater Harbor.  Most of the fert111zer brought  into Lewes  originates from Holland and comes  in  the  form of a 30% nitrogen solution (liquid fer tilizer). It is transported to the United States  in large cargo ships. These large carriers have  deep drafts and are unable to navigate the  Harbor of Refuge channel. The shipments  must be  lightered at ports such as Balti more, Philadelphia, Norfolk and Moorhead  City. Here,  the bulk  fertilizer  is  removed  from  the  large carriers and  transferred  to  either barges or to railcars. It is then shipped  to Lewes to be stored in large, above-ground  tanks. A deeper channel wlll perm! t direct  shipment to Lewes of liquid fertilizer.

I have been very inter ested in the discussion between the dis tinguished majority leader and the dis tinguished minority leader on this, and  it may have been that I have touched  on a rather sensitive chord.  I do not know whether this phantom  telephone number that was assigned to  the junior Senator from Nebraska was a  Democratic  telephone or a Republican  telephone or what body was using that  line. I made no accusation at all in that  regard.  I do think, though, and hope that if  either the distinguished majority leader  or the minority leader can shed any light  on the phantom telephone line that was  assigned without authority to the junior  Senator from Nebraska I would appre ciate  their advising  the Sergeant-at Arms, or other authority, so that I can  be informed and also could likewise in form my colleagues.

It was before us because parts of the  armed  services  supplemental and  the  President's supplemental were identical.  Nothing I said could put all of the armed  services supplemental before us.

This bill will pro vide  significant health benefits  to  the  citizens of our own and other countries  through improvement of the health re search enterprise.  The scope of health research presently  encompasses a wide range of disciplines  from fundamental biomedical research,  where the mission is the discovery of new  knowledge concerning life and disease, to  health services research where the goals  include the development and testing of  methods to structure, deliver and finance  health care. These health sciences have  become enormously complex and the cost  of health research has  increased  to a  point where the budget for the National  Institutes of Health alone exceeds $3 bil lion. The  research payoff  in  terms of  health and quality of life for our citizens  has more than justified the effort and ex pense, but if we are to continue to realize  these benefits in a cost-effective fashion  we must develop a national policy and  a long-range plan for health research to  better guide the setting of priorities and  expenditure of public  funds. This bill  provides a mechanism, through a Presi dential Council for the Health Sciences,  for a  cooperative public-private effort  to formulate health science policy and  long-range plans for the Department of  Health, Education, and Welfare com ponents that perform or support health  research. This Research Planning Coun cil will provide the Congress with scien tific expertise, advice, and rational long range guidelines that will aid Congress  in  the difficult  yearly decisionmaking  process for health research budget allo cations.  I would  like to direct my colleagues'  attention to a second important feature  of this bill that provides an initial ap proach to the deregulation of biomedical  research institutions. We will authorize  trial programs designed to maintain fis cal accountability, but reduce the oppres sive paperwork burden that current regu lations impose on biomedical investiga tors and laboratories. Finally, we provide  new authorities for the Director of the  National Institutes of Health. These in  turn will permit the further improvement  of NIH's intramural and extramural re search activities and the preservation of  the NIH role as the world leader in bio  medical research.

194,,96,-0.506,454,7,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr.  Speaker, the President's decision to ap point a  commission to  investigate  the  Three Mile Island nuclear accident is a  welcome step. While it is still unclear  what the scope of this inquiry will be, I  hope that the commission members will  entertain  constructive  suggestions  on  topics to include in this inquiry.  In this vein,  the Los Angeles Times  recently editorialized on some aspects of  this situation that I believe deserve close  scrutiny and careful review. In order to  share  these suggestions with my colEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  leagues, I am inserting the text of this  editorial in the RECORD at this time.  The article follows:  [From the Los Angeles Times, Apr. 18, 1979]  THE NUCLEAR CLOUD  The presidential commission investigating  the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island  has one of the most difficult and important  missions ever given to a group of Americans.  In six short months, it must discover not  only what caused the worst accident in the  history of the nuclear industry but also what  changes can be made in law, regulation and  the technology itself to provide some assur ance that no power plant will come that close  to catastrophe again.  It would be far easier if the 11 members  had been asked to speculate, in some abstract  way, about the future role of nuclear power.  Instead, they must persuade both critics and  many advocates of nuclear energy that they  can live comfortably with the 70 plants al ready operating and  the 90 scheduled for  construction. They must decide,  in short,  whether nuclear power has a present,  let  alone a future.  Some measure of the magniture of the task  of producing a credible report on Three Mile  Island can be found  in the  transcripts of  emergency meetings held by  the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission  in the hours that  stretched into days after the plant got out of  control.  The five commissioners are the high priests  of this mysterious power. Like their prede cessors, they spend much of their time calm ing concerned critics of nuclear energy, and  assuring Americans that the system is under  control.  There  is nothing calming or  reassuring  about  the  conversations  reflected  in  the  transcripts. The commissioners, for the most  part, seemed as bewildered as the next citizen  about what was happening, why it was hap pening,  and whether  the  company  that  owned the plant knew what it was doing.  At one point,  the commissioners heard  their. chief safety expert, Dr. Roger J. Matt son, reporting by telephone from the power  plant that ""no plant has ever been in this  condition ... We saw failure modes the like  of which has never been analyzed.""  The President's commission must resolve  conflicting views of the cause or causes of  the breakdown. The regula tory commissiol!  already has reached a  tentative conclusion  that the fault was largely human, not me chanical. That  is  the view also of Energy  Secretary James R. Schlesinger, who has told  Oongress that he thinks the federal govern ment has spent too much time analyzing the  financial stab1lity of ut1lities that it licenses  to operate nuclear plants and too little time  examining the competence of their engineers  and plant operators.  Yet the accident cannot have resulted en tirely from human error. The accounts of  valves sticking open when they should have  closed and of gauges that gave false readings  made  the plant seem more  like  a  tramp  steamer  limping  through a  storm  than a  stainless steel and concrete monument  to  America's technical ingenuity.  It seems clear that laws governing nuclear  operations must be changed to clarify the  federal government's role in an emergency.  The tug-of-war between the public utility in  Pennsylvania and the nuclear specialists in  Washington during the first few critical days  of the accident must not be repeated  if a  similar breakdown occurs at another plant.  Perhaps the answer for the future lies in a  kind of elite  force of nuclear operatorstrained to and paid at the same high levels  that we demand for intercontinental airline  captains. That is the system envisioned by  Alvin Weinberg, a nuclear-power pioneer who  thinks the country is too heavily committed  April 23, 1979  to nuclear energy  to  turn back, but who  thinks the system needs basic changes.  Whatever the ultimate answer,  the com mission's responsibility is an awesome one,  made more difficult by the fact that Ameri cans will never again accept assurances about  nuclear safety without convincing evidence  to back them up.e  NATIONAL RAISIN WEEK  HON. TONY COELHO  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 1979   ",1979
195,,96,-0.413,454,7,Mr. COELHO.," Mr. Speaker, at a time  when energy is of prime concern to all of  us, my colleague, the Honorable CHARLEs  ""CHIP"" PASHAYAN, and I WOUld like t.o call  your attention to the abundant supply of  energy contained in California raisins,  which will be highlighted during  the  April 27-May 6 observance of National  Raisin Week.  We are convinced that the more than  250,000 tons of raisins produced by the  California raisin  industry in a normal  crop year, if converted to British thermal  units of energy in the form of people  power used in walking or riding bicycles  to work, ,could go far toward alleviating  the Nation's energy shortage.  On a more serious vein, we note that  unprecedented rains last September de stroyed nearly 60 percent of the raisin  crop, leaving the industry with less than  110,000  tons to market, compared with  an average of 250,000 to 280,000 tons of  all varieties of raisins. All of the raisins  produced in the United States and about  one-third of  the world's supply come  from California.  The 1978 crop loss marked the second  time in 3 years that adverse weather re sulted in severe damage to the size of the  harvest.  At first it appeared that the crop was  almost a total loss. But the industry, uti lizing  new  and  improved  processing  methods, was able to save a large enough  tonnage of raisins to supply most needs  of both  the consumer and  industrial  markets in the United States.  The California Raisin Advisory Board,  which  represents  all California  raisin  growers and packers, now estimates that  supplies of raisins should be sufficient to  meet the needs of industrial and insti tutional users  through the spring and  early summer.  Mr. Speaker, we feel  that the raisin  industry  should be  congratulated  for  again dealing so effectively with these  adverse conditions.  High commendation should go to the  California Raisin Advisory Board for its  activities in the fields of advertising, pro motion, and  research. Utilizing  funds  provided by participating producer and  processor members, CALRAB carries on  its program of aggressive advertising and  promotion not only domestically, but in  many countries throughout the world in  cooperation with the U.S. Department of  Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Serv ice.

199,House,96,-0.383,506,7,Mr. BALDUS.," Mr. Speaker, today, I am  introducing a  resolution expressing the  sense of the House of Representatives  concerning an assessment by the Secre tary of Agriculture of our whey supply  situation. I am joined in this introduc tion by my distinguished colleague Jm  JEFFORD,  the ranking minority member  of the Dairy and Poultry Subcommittee  which I chair.  Our resolution seeks to remedy a seri ous problem of dairy farmers and dairy  product processors, while, simultaneous ly, benefiting consumers. This resolution  would require that the Department of  Agriculture: First, assess the whey sup ply situation and report the findings to  the House Agriculture Committee; and  second,  begin a  research program  to  utilize whey more  efficiently  for  the  mutual benefit of both producers and  consumers.  Whey is a byproduct of cheesemaking.  For each pound of cheese produced, ap proximately 8 pounds of whey are also  produced. This abundant natural  re source has significant nutritional value  and has numerous potential uses as a  food constituent. Additionlly, whey has  various potential nonfood uses and has  even been identified as a possible energy  resource.  Until  the Environmental Protection  Agency clean water regulations curtailed  the traditional practice of the cheese in dustry of discarding whey into streams,  the potential for recovery and full utiliza tion of whey was all but ignored. How ever, the clean water regulations, result ing in a search for outlets for the increas ing amounts of whey created by  the  enormous growth in cheese consumption  during recent years, have had the unin tended, though positive, effect of forc ing the dairy industry to consider how  whey might productively be developed.  Unfortunately,  there currently exist  many barriers to the full development  of whey and whey products,  including  antiquated regulatory restrictions. How ever, perhaps  the greatest barrier  to  whey product innovation is our prevail ing state of ignorance about whey and  is  its potential uses. It is toward the elimi nation of  this major hurdle  that our  resolution is directed.  Unless a Government commitment to  research in whey utilization is immedi ately forthcoming, a prime opportunity  for  the development of an abundant,  extremely valuable, and inexpensive nat ural resource, that might otherwise have  to be thrown away, and a rare chance to  contribute substantially to the solution  of the world's food and energy problems,  shall certainly be lost.  Therefore, Mr.  JEFFORDS  and  I  call  upon you to support our resolution as  the first step in what we hope will become  a programed effort to research and edu cation, coupled with an effort to alleviate  current regulatory barriers to the full  utilization of whey.e  e ",1979
200,House,96,0.014,506,7,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. Speaker,  it  rare  that one has  the opportunity  to  introduce a measure designed  to help  contribute to the solution of some of our  Nation's and  the world's most serious  problems through the development of an  underut.ilized and very valuable natural  resource. Today, my distinguished col league, AL BALDus,  chairman of  the  Dairy and Poultry Subcommittee, and I  are introducing such a resolution.  Our resolution would require the De partment of Agriculture  to assess  the  whey supply situation and report  the  findings to the House Agriculture Com mittee, and begin a research program to  utilize whey more efficiently for the mu tual benefit of both producers and con sumers.  Whey  is  an  abundant natural  re f.Ource with several potential food  in gredient uses due to its high nutritional  value. Whey also has potential nonfood  uses including a possible use as an en ergy resource. The best aspect of whey,  however,  is that it occurs naturally as  a byproduct of cheesemaking. For every  pound  of  cheese  produced,  approxi mately 8 pounds of whey result. In light  of  the  tremendous  increase  in cheese  consumption in recent years, the amount  of whey being produced is staggering.  Unfortunately,  the  full potential of  whey has never been realized primarily  because the recovery and development of  whey has, in the past, not proved cost  effective. Instead, the dairy industry has  traditionally discarded whey, as waste,  into our Nation's streams. However, the  Environmental Protection Agency now  prevents the dumping of whey, causing  the industry to seek new outlets for the  cheese byproduct.  Thus, a Government commitment to  research in whey utilization would not  only lead to  the productive use of an  abundant and valuable natural resource  to the benefit of consumers, but would  also  solve  a  very  practical  problem  faced by the dairy industry.  Certainly, at a  time when food and  energy shortages are cited as two of the  world's most serious concerns, a pro gramed effort of  research and educa tion with respect to this readily avail able natural resource, coupled with an  effort  to  a1leviate  current  regulatory  barriers to the full development of whey,  could not be more timely.

I hope that point is re peated often enough so that every Mem ber will clearly understand it.  We assume funding these programs at  current levels.  The committee recommendation also  assumes a pennanent  increase, and I  underscore that, of $200 million for block  grants to States for social services pro grams under title XX of the Social Secu rity Act. Out of this additional $200 mil lion for title XX funds, each State must  provide-and I want to underline tha1r at  least  three  social  services  to  the  elderly. These funds can be spent on  elderly feeding programs if the States  believe these programs are the greatest  area of need.  So there is already room in the budget  for a substantial increase in feeding pro grams for the elderly, depending upon  the decisions that States and Governors  may make.  The National Governors' Association  has  repeatedly  said  that  they prefer  block grants, because they consider funds  that come down with fewer strings on  them are available for the highest prior ity uses and they can use these funds in  a much more efficient way.

217,Senate,96,0.589,779,7,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President, I am  disturbed by  the  revelation  this week  that the Soviet Union has begun to de plov the SS-21 missile in East Europe.  The effect of these medium-range mis siles would be to alter the nuclear tactical  balance in West Europe, particularly in  the countries of our NATO allies.  This most recent development leaves  little doubt about  the  true nature of  Soviet  intentions. The  fact  that  the  Soviets are demanding in SALT II that  the United States restrain its arms pro gram while they continue to introduce  new weapons systems left and right will  most certainly be reflected in the forth coming Senate debate on the SALT II  Treaty.  For that reason, Mr. President, I have  written a letter to President Carter call ing on him to reconsider his position of  last year and immediately order the pro duction and deployment of U.S. neutron  weapons in Europe.  I reminded the President that on April  7, 1978, he indicated that in deferring his  decision on neutron weapons, he would  ultimately be influenced by the degree of  Soviet restraint in the Soviet conven tional and nuclear arms program.  Since that time, however, the Soviets  have shown little, if any, restraint, as the  recent deployment of the SS-21 demon strates.  Mr. President, I  ask unanimous con sent that the contents of my letter to  President Carter be printed at this point  in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the letter  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD  as follows:  THE PRESIDENT,  The White House, Washington, D.C.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: In view of the recent  deployment of  the Soviet SS-21  in East  Europe, I call upon you to reconsider your  position a.nd order the production a.nd de ployment  of  U.S.  neutron  weapons  in  Europe.

On April 7,  1978, you  indicated  that in  deferring your decision on neutron weapons,  you would ultimately be  infiuenced by the  degree of Soviet restraint in the Soviet con ventional and nuclear arms program. Since  that time,  the Soviets have shown little, 1t  any, restraint, as this most recent develop ment clearLy demonstrates.  The  immediate production and deploy ment of neutron weapons wlll help erase  some of the  tactical superiority which  the  Soviet Union and other members of the War saw Pact enjoy. Our firm response also would  demonstrate beyond any shadow of a doubt  that we  intend  to enjoy world peace, but  from a position of strength.  Sincerely,  GoRDON J. HUMPHREY,  U.S. Senator.

219,House,96,-0.095,870,7,Mr. JONES of Oklahoma.," Mr. Speaker,  this morning's news that the Japanese  have refused to budge any further on  opening  their markets for government  procurement and semipublic corporate  purchases is very disappointing to those  of us who want to promote free, open  trade between our nations. This attitude  of intransigence also heightens the pros pects of protectionist legislation aimed  at Japanese products.  As chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee's Task  Force  on United  States-Japan Trade,  I want  to make  these observations: First, we fully sup port Ambassador Strauss' efforts to nego tiate a liberalization of Japanese procure ment policies;  second,  if Ambassador  Strauss' efforts fail, Congress will consid er  reciprocal  restrictive  trade policies  such as standards or quota restrictions  on Japanese telecommunications equip ment, and possibly others; and third, if  the Japanese think that they can wait  until Ambassador Strauss takes up his  new Middle East assignment and that  they will get a better deal from his suc cessor as Special Trade Representative- they are making a sad mistake. Congress  almost unanimously is demanding tough  negotiations to lower the $11 billion trade  deficit we have with Japan. If the ad ministration does not get the job done,  Congress surely will-and probably in a  way that will not promote free trade.  I urge my colleagues to give Ambas sador Strauss and the Japanese another  chance to negotiate a meaningful reduc tion of the unacceptable trade imbalance  between our nations. If they fail, our task  force will recommend specific legislative  programs  that will help  correct  this  problem.  I also urge my colleagues to read an ex tension I will  insert  today which dis cusses  the specific  trade problem be tween Japan and the United States in  the telecommunications field.

220,House,96,0.353,870,7,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, I endorse  the remarks of my distinguished col league,  the gentleman from Oklahoma  <Mr. JoNEs), the chairman of the Com mittee on Ways and Mea.ns Task Force  on United States-Japan Trade. We do  support Ambassador Strauss fully.  In my judgment, the impasse that has  been created by the Japanese could be  the most serious trade crisis this country  has faced at least since I have been in  Congress.  Japan  is  engaging  in  a  game  of  ""chicken"" with the United States that  has broad potential for widespread dis ruption of world trade.  As  the gentleman  from Oklahoma  (Mr. JoNES)  pointed out, Japan, with  its enormous world trade surpluses and  with a notorious  international reputa tion for closing up its own markets to  imports, is badly positioned to be stone walling on these negotiations.  We have not abandoned hope yet for  making some kind of a breakthrough  with our Japanese friends, but we are  running out of patience. If there is no  improvement in the Japanese position,  as the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  JoNES) suggests, I believe the Congress  has the will  to deal with the problem  legislatively. That is not the best way,  but Japan's attitude may make it the  only way.

This incentive is  in the form of a 20-percent tax credit,  similar to those available for other alter native energy sources which were incor porated in the Energy Tax Act of 1978.  For too long, this great Nation, which  imports almost one-half of its need for  petroleum,  has  bemoaned  its OPEC  dependency. Now is the time to develop  this renewable. environmentally safe en ergy source which continues to spill over  these already existing dam sites. This  proposal is intended to complement ex isting plants by providing 5 percent of  the future energy needs of the country15 percent of New England's future needs.  As the President begins to phase out  the control of  the domestic crude oil  prices, this Nation must commit itself to  phasing in a  responsible, viable energy  alternative whose  potential has been  demonstrated.  0  1110  PROVIDING  FUNDS  FOR  SELECT  COMMITTEE ON COMMITTEES  ",1979
222,House,96,0.26,883,7,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to  join my colleagues  in saluting  Rogers Morton. His death is a loss to us  all, but his life was an example of public  service at its best and he will be remem bered and honored for it. He served two  Presidents; he represented the people of  Maryland ior 5 terms in the House of  Representatives: he served as the chair man of the Republican Party. Into each  of these job8 he carried with him the ef fervescence and enthusiasm that were  his hallmarks.  I had the pleasure of serving in the  House with Rog, and I know for a fact  there was not a more competent, knowl edgeable man around. He was always  frien~ly; always accommodating; always  effective. You always had to look up to  him, but even if you got a crick in your  neck you went away smiling. It was a  pleasure to work with him; an honor to  have known him as a friend.  That is  the Rogers Morton that my  colleagues here in the House knew but  he did not discover public service 'only  after moving to Maryland and coming  to the House of Representatives. He did  not pop up 6 feet 7 inches tall out of  Maryland soil. He was a seventh-generation Kentuckian, born in Jefferson Coun ty, Ky. He was a Louisville business man. It was  in Kentucky that he de veloped his taste for public service, poli tics and civic involvement.  So while the Nation has lost a devoted  public servant, and Maryland has lost  a true st.atesman, Kentucky's loss may be  greater. We knew Rogers C. B. Morton  before  the Nation as a whole or even  Maryland, and we have lost more than a  public servant and statesman. We have  lost a great native son.e  e ",1979

In the decade that I have been in this  Congress, few men achieved the respect  and admiration that Rog did.  Rog began his public career in this  Chamber,  a  career  that was  distin guished by selfless and dedicated service  to  the constituents  from his beloved  Eastern Shore in Maryland and to the  Nation.  As a congressman, Rog translated his  love for the Chesapeake Bay and the rich  land of Maryland's Eastern Shore into  successful efforts to preserve these areas.  His efforts  leave a  legacy that will be  enjoyed for generations to come. It was  as a  conservationist--both as a Con gressman and as Secretary of the In terior-that he represented not only his  constituency and his party and his time,  but all the people and progeny of the  country.  Rog was a public servant who had the  rare gift of foresight. As a member of  President Ford's Energy Policy Commit tee, he pushed for programs to develop  more energy, realizing the potential for  the crisis we face today. As chairman of  the Republican Party, he brought his  contagious sense of humor and commit ment to hard work to the political proc ess. He viewed public service as a  re sponsibility, one that he undertook with  enthusiasm and dedication.  But above all this, Rogers Morton was  a warm human being who always had  time to help and encourage others. He  was a source of wise counsel and sound  advice  that was  given warmly.  In a  recent interview he spoke of the people  he served.  I  think I gave the people a sense o! con fidence  that they were well represented in  Washington.  Indeed they were.

229,Senate,96,0.072,974,7,Mr. WEICKER.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join Senator NUNN in intro ducing this legislation to enable SBA to  guarantee debentures issued by local de velopment companies. This bill will help  involve private enterprise in the impor tant task of developing the economic base  of our Nation's urban centers. This legis lation was passed by both the House and  the Senate last year as part of H.R. 11445,  The omnibus small business bill, but was  vetoed by the President.  It has not been politically fashionable,  since the early part of  this decade,  to  closely examine the desperate straits of  our urban areas and their inhabitants.  Instead, we have salved our consciences  by simply throwing money at the cities  and hoping that this would stifle their  cries of despair.  There  is no point in urban renewal  which is not matched by human renewal.  People who feel  they have no stake in  their community will  take no part  in  maintaining it. A job provides the urban  inhabitant with a sense of purpose and  sense of dignity. This sense of purpose  does not come from make-work, or from  experimental Federal programs. Mean ingful employment comes from the pri vate sector.  Ernesta G. Procope, a black business person who  is active  in urban affairs,  summarized this point eloquently in testi mony before  the Select Committee on  Small  Business. Ms.  Procope  stated  thatGovernment must of course guarantee cer tain minimum standards of a decent life for  all. However, minorities have come to recog nize  that government's assurance of some  basic  level of shelter, nourishment, educa tion and health care does not provide real  dignity or the means for social and economic  mobility. It has become  increasingly clear  that the key to unlocking a better life must  be found in the private sector.  The legislation which we are introduc ing today will help to involve small businesses in the urban economic develop ment process. Small businesses provide  an  important  source  of  employment  in urban areas. For example,  in ex cess of 65 percent of all private em ployment in New York City is provided  by small businesses, and over half of the  private sector employment  in Atlanta  and Philadelphia  is provided by small  firms.  Under  its section 502 program,  the  SBA is authorized to make loans, either  direct or guaranteed, to LDC's for proj ects to help small concerns acquire land,  construct buildings, or purchase equip ment and machinery. SBA  financing,  however, is limited to $500,000 for each  small business assisted,  and  the LDC  must procure the balance of the neces sary assistance from other sources.  Last year I wrote  to  the mayors of  America's 100 largest cities to elicit their  comments on the effectiveness of SBA  programs in encouraging economic de velopment  in  their cities. The mayors  were nearly unanimous in their praise of  the local development company program.  However, they stated that a lack of avail able funds prevented the program from  being truly effective. Simply put, the de mand for direct funds for the program  far exceeded the amount available.  Likewise,  loan guarantees under  the  program are difficult to obtain, as few  private  lenders  enter  into  long-term,  fixed asset loans. Thus there is a major  capital gap for urban small businesses  which the LDC's cannot effectively solve.  The legislation which we are introduc ing today, will help to fill this gap. Pur suant to this bill, SBA would be able to  guarantee the full amount of debentures  issued by an eligible LDC. The amount of  the debenture to be guaranteed could not  exceed  one-half  of  the  project  cost,  thereby necessitating that the remaining  half be supplied by private sources. This  approach provides security to the Fed eral Government, as responsible private  lenders will not be willing to assume such  a large exposure in an unsound commer cial deal.  The SBA would still be required to ap prove each transaction made by the LDC.  However, instead of making a direct loan  for  the approved deal,  the LDC would  issue a debenture in the amount needed  for the deal. The SBA would pool  the  qualifying debentures  issued by LDC's  each month, guarantee the pool, and sell  it to the Federal Financing Bank.  To insure that only responsible LDC's  are involved in this program, the legisla tion imposes strict requirements for eli gibility. To qualify, the State or local de velopment company must have: First, a  full time professional staff; second, ade quate  accounting,  legal,  and  business  servicing capabilities; and third, an ac tive board of directors, which meets on a  regular basis and is actively involved in  loan decisions and loan servicing.  Appropriations for this program would  be for the loss reserve on defaulted de bentures. Assuming a  1.5 percent  loss  rate, a $3 million appropriation from the  loss reserve funds allocated to the SBA's  502 Oocal development company) guar antee program would provide for $200  million of guaranteed debentures.

230,,96,0.029,1039,7,Mr. SCHWEIKER.," So we are delud ing ourselves when we say we are setting  up a whole new Department of Education  and then we leave $12 billion worth of  programs out.  You do not have to be a mathematical  genius to figure out that we are leaving  out almost 50 percent of the educational  programs  in  the Federal Government.  That is a sad commentary on the real  feeling of people toward the new Depart ment. We are doing it for political rea sons, we all know  that. The managers  of S. 210 are leaving out the programs  because if they tried to get those other  things into this new Department of Edu cation,  the Senate would have  trouble  passing the bill. Nobody wants  to give  up his own  turf. That  is one of  the  troubles around Washington. Everybody  wants  to keep his own  little kingdom.  He does not want to give it up. He wants  it in his department, and that is what  we are running into here when we have  $12  billion worth of educational pro grams left out. That is exactly why in  the time since this bill was brought up  last year Indian education, Head Start,  and child nutrition were dropped. The  politics are such  that the Government  Affairs Committee did not want to invade  the turf of the educational bureaucracies  in Washington.  That is a poor way to organize a de partment. That is a poor way to say that  we are going to have a good Educational  Department but we are not going to put  billion worth of educational pro grams into it. It is a poor way to say  that we are going to have one unified  approach  to administration of Federal  $12  education programs and we are going to  really save a lot of money because we are  going to consolidate. I sketched some big  programs left out, the National Science  Foundation and  the National Endow ment for the Arts and the National En dowment for  the Humanities, and  the  whole veterans' education,  the GI bill  education programs. Many of these pro grams and others are left out because  supporters of S. 210 do not want to get  the political votes against their transfers  because of the fear that the whole bill  might be defeated.  So the reality is that we are not really  creating  a whole new Department of  Education; we are taking half a Depart ment  of Education  from HEW,  and  calling it the Department of Education.  The whole point of my amendment is  that if we are really creating but half a  Department of Education, let us have the  courage  to  acknowledge  that, and do  something else that makes sense. I think  my amendment does make sense, because  it says, ""we can't make a whole Depart ment because all the other agencies, and  constituencies, the GI bill, the National  Science  Foundation,  and  the Endow ments for the Arts and Humanities, do  not want  to give up  their programs.""  So  let us do  the next best  thing,  the  logical thing, let us put education into  an elevated status within HEW; the half  of the educational programs that are in  HEW now, we will elevate and make  equal with health programs,  so  that  there will be equal  treatment between  health and education in HEW.  Instead of creating a whole new bu reaucracy, we will  logically restructure  the bureaucracy we have to give educa tion a higher status, as it should have,  and also streamline the half of the edu cational programs that are in the De partment of HEW now.  That is in essence what the Schweiker  amendment does. It creates two Under  Secretaries within  the Department of  HEW, one Under Secretary for Health  and Welfare and one an Under Secre tary for Education.  That means that education would have  equal status with health and welfare.  Education programs are elevated to the  point where they have the same recog nition, the same consideration, the same  status, the lack of which has until now  been one of  the  legitimate criticisms  about education in HEW.  It is said that education has been bur ied. With HEW Education  programs  have had confused leadership, because  we had a Commissioner of Education  and we had an Assistant Secretary of  Education, and we were  really never  quite sure who was running educational  policy. That is changed by my amend ment. We no longer have the Commis sioner of Education or an Assistant Sec retary for Education; we have this one  unit structure, in the Under Secretary,  and under this structure we would have  four Assistant Secretaries for Education.  Those four are, first, an Assistant Sec retary  for Elementary and Secondary  Education-that is a rather logical divi sion-for grades 12 and below. Under  him would come seven functions: School  improvement, handicapped and occupa tional education, adult education, com pensatory  education,  bilingual  educa",1979

234,Senate,96,0.1,1117,7,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, the United  States and Canada recently signed an  agreement concerning our Nation's re spective rights and territory on Georges  Banks.  I believe that, as a Senator from Maine,  I have an overriding  responsibility  to  consider the new treaties with Canada  from the vantage point of Maine fisher men. Too often in the past, our fisher men have been presented with plans prepared by outsiders-that were sup posed  to solve all their problems, only  to find  themselves worse off than they  were before.  I believe that these new treaties must  be studied carefully for their domestic  consequences as well as  their interna tional ramifications. For this reason, I  submit for the RECORD a summary and  analysis of the treaties prepared by the  State Department.  The analysis follows:  BACKGROUND-AND ANALYSIS: EAST COAST MARI TIME  BOUNDARY  AND  FISHERIES  TREATIES  WITH CANADA  1. The United States has concluded two  treaties with Canada, one provision for bind ing  third-party dispute settlement of  the  maritime boundary in the Gulf of Maine area  and  the other assigning management  re sponsibilities,  national  shares  and  trans boundary  fishing  access  for  specified east  coast fish stocks. These treaties are the re sult of protracted and Intensive negotiations  necessitated when Canada and the United  States extended national  judisdiction over  coastal  fisheries  resources  to  two hundred  miles and the two claims overlapped in the  Gulf of Maine area.  2. Until 1977 neither the United States nor  Canada exercised or recognized national fish ing jurisdiction beyond twelve miles from the  coast. The control and management of fish ery resources off the east coast of the United  States and Canada was achieved through a  series of bilateral fisheries agreements and  through  the  regime of  the  International  Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fish eries (ICNAF). Under the agreed ICNAF reg ulations, the U.S. harvested the major share  of the important groundfish species on Geor ges Bank and Canada took a minor but sig nificant share. Third countries harvested the  bulk of the herring, hakes, squid and mack erel. These  stocks, particularly  the squid  were  then of much  less  interest than th~  more  lucrative groundfish and scallop  re sources  to U.S.  and Canadian commercial  fishermen and consumers. There was no third  country fishing for scallops and there were  no  ICNAF catch quotas applicable  to  the  scallop stock. During the period 1971-1976,  Canada harvested approximately 85 percent  of the scallops in the Georges Bank area and  the U.S. the remaining 15 percent. This re fiected a major shift that had begun around  1960 when Canada was taking less than 40  percent of the harvest in the area. Until the  mid-1950's Canada had taken only very small  quantities of scallops anywhere on the Bank.  3. Wben canada .and  the United States  published the limits of their newly declared  200-mile fishery zones late in 1976, the claims  overlapped  in  the  Gulf  of  Maine/  Georges Bank  area. The area of Georges  Bank  claimed  by  both  sides  Is  one  of  the  richest  fishing grounds on  the Bank.  An Interim regime was cre.ated for 1977 wh!le  the  two governments continued efforts  to  resolve the dispute through negotiation. Un der that agreement each side was allowed to  continue fishing in waters within the other's  undisputed fishery zone with no expansion  of existing patterns. Both parties fished  in  the disputed area, and both excluded fisher men of  third countries from  that area. A  proposed renewal of that interim regime for  1978 broke down over a number of disagree ments as to management policies and levels  of effort in the Georges Bank groundfish and  scallop  fisheries, as well  .as over  the West  Coast salmon fisheries. As a  result, fishing  by each side in the undisputed fisheries zone  of the other ended in June 1978. Vessels of  both countries have continued to fish in the  disputed area where each side has applied  its own management regime, with the result  that uncoordinated and conflicting policies  are in effect. In the absence o.f overall regu lation, the fishermen of the two countries ex change accusation of attempting to outfish  one another and each side claims the other  is inflicting injury on the stocks.  4. Negotiations continued  through 1978  and  into 1979. Those negotiations have fi nally resulted in the conclusion of the two  interrelated  treaties now being submitted  to the Senate for its advice and consent to  ratification. The treaties are summarized in  the attached announcement. The Fisheries  Treaty covers stocks in the disputed area as  well as other stocks of mutual  interest to  the U.S. and Canada. It establishes a U.S./  Canada East Coast Fisheries Commission to  undertake joint management of some stocks  (e.g., pollock and mackeral),  and assigns  primary management responsib111ty for other  stocks to one nation or the other subject, in  the case of some  stocks,  to adherence  to  agreed management principles. It assigns en titlements  or  percentage  shares  to  each  country for each stock covered, and for some  stocks it allows fishermen of each party ac cess to designated fishing areas off the coast  of the other party. It provides for concilia tion of disagreements and, where necessary,  for prompt and binding dispute settlement  by a  jointly-appointed standing arbitrator.  The Fisheries Treaty will remain in force un til terminated by mutual agreement, or mod ified by agreement of the two sides. Each  party's entitlement share  to  a  particular  stock is open to renegotiation every ten years  primarily on the basis of the ultimate out come of  the boundary delimitation, with  binding dispute settlement if the parties can not agree on the revised percentages.  5. The boundary settlement and fisheries  treatres  are  expressly  linked. Neither wlll  enter into force until the instruments of rati fication for both are exchanged.  6. The treaties promote important national  interests of the United States. They provide  for resolution of new and serious  jurisdic tional confiicts with one of our two conti nental neighbors. The Fisheries Treaty pro vides for sound and cooperative conservation  and management of fisheries vital  to both  countries that cannot be effectively managed  by either country alone. The enabling legis lation will assure full participation in this  management process by the Regional Coun cils. The Fisheries Treaty assigns to the U ..S.  the primary management responsib111ty for  the  important  groundfi!'h  resources  of  Georges Bank and preserves our recent his torical share of those fisheries. It also assures  the maintenance of our scallop  fishery at  current  levels  (which are well  above  the  average U.S. percentage in the five years pre ceding  the declaration of 200-mile zones).

The DOT plan calls  for combining  these  two  routes  into a  single  route.  However,  that  recommendation was  made without ""riding the rails"" of the  new route to see whether or not it was  a better and more economical.  Now, with only 2 weeks of time left in  the 90-day limit for congressional con sideration of the DOT proposals, we find  out that those proposals are more costly  than  the present Southwest Ltd., and  that they would provide poorer service as  well.  That conclusion is stated, though a bit  ambi'giously, in a letter sent Friday from  Amtrak President Alan Boyd to our Sub committee on Transportation and Com merce. He noted in the letter that the  DOT's route would offer ""service that is  longer in endpoint mileage and overall  running  time and  slower  in average  speed."" He said later in the letter that  the new routes should be implemented  only where  they constitute ""improved  service,"" which this route change does  not do.  A call to Mr. Boyd's offi.ce produced  even clearer language. A spokesman said,  ""It would be cheaper in both the short term and the long-term to keep the cur rent Southwest Ltd., and Zephyr, and  that's what we're recommending.""  Not only is this the less costly alterna tive, but it is also the one that offers bet ter service, with some of the best passen ger  train  track in  the entire Amtrak  system, and one of the best stations in  the system at Emporia-which won the  Station of the Year Award in 1977.  With only about 2 weeks left for Con gress to disapprove of the DOT plan, it  is good that this information has finally  come out in a documented form. I hope  that this will move the Congress to act- and that the Transportation Subcom mittee will forward a disapproval peti tion to the full House for a vote. This is  an  important decision, and one  that  should be made by full membership.  If such action is not taken by the com mittee, I hore that the committee will  consider this letter from Mr. Boyd in its  markup session tomorrow. Language can  still be added to Amtrak's authorization  to  provide  the  continuation  of  the  Southwest Ltd. I urge the committee to  doso.e   ",1979

241,,96,-0.398,1234,7,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker,  it is  with a sad heart that I  join my distin guished colleague, JOHN BRADEMAS Of In diana, in paying tribute to a gallant and  courageous woman, Marvella Bayh, the  wife of the Honorable BIRCH BAYH, Sen ator from Indiana, who died after a long  and valiant struggle with cancer. Mrs.  Bayh became a national symbol of cour age for millions of her fellow citizens for  her unflinching devotion to duty in spite  of the debilitating effects of her disease  and the treatment necessary to slow its  progress. Her inspiring example of hero ism in the fact of adversity is a tragic  loss for all the people of our country.  In  spite  of  her  serious  disability,  Marvella Bayh remained stalwart and  loyal in her duties as the wife of a Sen ator, a position that required the greatest  of personal sacrifice and the total dedi cation of her personal life to the demands  of her husband's public office. A normal  family life is almost impossible to main tain in the face of the need for extensive  travel and late, indefinite working hours,  and as we all know, this kind of life is  difficult under any circumstances, even  with')ut a debilitating disease.  Mrs. Bayh ""Marvella Hern"" was born  in Enid, Okla., attended Oklahoma State  University and Indiana University, and  she married the future Senator, BIRCH  BwH, in 1952. She was already an accom plished orator, winning many speaking  contests, and was the first woman to win  the National  Farm Bureau  national  speaking contest in 1951. It was in 1971  that she  found she was stricken with  cancer, and was  forced  to undergo a  mastectomy.  The tragic cancer operation did not  discourage  her  or  her  natural  optimism, and she became a dedicated  dim  April 30, 1979  and tireless speaker for  the American  Cancer Society around the country, giv ing almost 200 speeches as well as radio,  TV, and newspaper interviews too num erous to mention, encouraging the mil lions of Americans afflicted by this dis-  ease, and stressing  the  importance of  early detection and treatment. She em phasized the importance of being hope ful,  living a normal life, and retaining  the belief that even this dread disease  can be defeated by pointing out that al ready 1 out of 3 cancer victims are cured,  and with perserverance, that rate can be  increased to 1 out of 2.  Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Annunzio and I ex tend our deepest sympathy to our dear  and old friend, Senator BAYH, and his  son, Evan, on their great loss.e  1979 SOLIDARITY SUNDAY HAS  SPECIAL MEANING  HON. MARIO BIAGGI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 30, 1979   ",1979
242,,96,-0.339,1234,7,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, as I have  throughout its 8-year history, yesterday  I marched in New York for the obser vance of Solidarity Sunday. However,  this year the march was dramatically  different. In years past, those of us who  marched did so with the fervent hope  that our actions might  lead one  im prisoned Soviet Jew closer to freedom.  This year, our prayers were answered  when Mark Dymshits and Edward Kuz netsov,  two  of  five  Jewish dissidents  freed by the Soviets appeared and ad dressed the 1979 rally.  It was dramatic and poignant moment.  Here were these two men less than 72  hours after being released from the harsh  life of a Soviet prison receiving a thun derous ovation from a crowd of more  than 50,000 persons. Following the ova tion,  the  two men spoke and thanked  the crowed for their work which helped  to lead them to their freedom.  Frankly, the swiftness with which the  Soviet Union acted in this case stunned  most observers in this Nation. However,  we had been noting the gradual soften ing of Soviet attitudes in the area of  Jewish emigration as more visas were  being issued than in the past.  I had a special interest in the Edward  Kuznetsov case for he was my ""adopted""  prisoner of conscience  in the prisoner  adoption  program  sponsored  by  the  Greater New York Conference on Soviet  Jewry. Edward Kuznetsov was arrested  in June 1970 on charges of conspiracy  to hijack a civil aircraft to escape  to  Scandanavia en route to Israel. He was  originally sentenced  to death but his  term was reduced  to 15 years after a  worldwide outcry. During his imprison ment Kuznetsov wrote and smuggled out  of prison a diary detailing his treatment.  An excerpt:  No matter how tragic is your acceptance of  the world, life gives you such degrading blows  that you make grimaces and gestures like a  clown at moments that arc most unsuitable  ",1979
243,,96,-0.511,1247,7,Mr. GRAY.," Mr. Speaker,  the early  months of the 96th Congress have seen a  debate over where the U.S.S. Saratoga  should be overhauled.  In late 1976, during  the Ford ad ministration, the NavY indicated its plan  to perform the overhaul at the Phila delphia Naval Shipyard. I would be more  than happy to share with my colleagues  a copy of the NavY papers to document  this fact.  The documentation is important, Mr.  Speaker, because a few of our colleagues  have made the Saratoga overhaul a po litical issue by alleging, without founda tion, that the Carter administration is  sending the Saratoga and its 3,000 jobs  to Philadelphia as a ""payoff"" to com pensate for the closing of the Frankford  Arsenal.  Nothing could be  further  from  the  truth, Mr. Speaker. Certainly the Phila delphia congressional delegation is anx ious to help replace the jobs lost due to  previous base closings. This  is a  goal  which we would expect the administra tion and every Member of the House  and Senate to share, no matter what city  or State is affected.  But the fact remains that the recom mendation  to assign  to  Philadelphia was made on the merit of  which shipyard could perform the  job  most effectively in terms of cost, per formance, and defense security.  I am aware that we have heard a great  deal about less cost at Newport News,  according to a GAO report.  But we should be aware, Mr. Speaker,  that this same report has been widely  discredited. It was designed in advance  to show only one conclusion. It did not  take into account the millions upon mil lions of dollars in cost overruns--costs  paid  by  the  taxpayer-which  have  plagued Newport News' naval work;  it  did not take into account the tremendous  time delays which the NavY has encoun tered at Newport News; and it did not  take  into account  the  fact  thaJt  the  Philadelphia Naval Shipyard-and not  Newport News-has built a  successful  track record in major overhaul work of  the type needed on the Saratoga.  I might add that independent studies  since the GAO's report of last year have  shown little or no cost difference between  Philadelphia and Newport News.  If any of us, Mr. Speaker, are asked  to vote on this issue on the fioor of this  House or in committee, I would urge us  to become familiar with all of the facts  of the case, and not just the political  hyperbole. I commend to the attention of  my colleagues  the following commen tary on this issue from the Philadelphia  Inquirer of April 24, 1979, and I invite  my colleagues to discuss the questions it  raises with me or with Mr. MYERs of  Pennsylvania, who has so ably directed  EX-TENSIONS OF REMARKS  Pennsylvania's efforts  provide  in formation to us regarding the Saratoga.  to  the Saratoga  ANOTHER DESPERATE TRY To STEAL THE  SARATOGA  There seems to me no llmit to how far the  congressman who represents Newport News,  va., wlll go in bizarre efforts to reverse the  U.S. Defense Department's sound decision to  send the aircraft carrier Saragota to Plhila delphia for overhaul. His current strategy,  absurd on its face, is to deprive the Defense  Department, the White House, and the Con gress of any voice in the decision and let it  be made by  the U.S. General Accounting  Office.  Rep. Paul S. Trible, a second-term Repub llcan doesn't say it in those words, of course.  He is trying to attach to 8. fiscaL 1979 supple mental defense appropriations bill a  rider  that would prohibit expenditure of funds  !or the Saratoga overhaul ""unless such pro gram  is  to be conducted on  the basis of  least cost as confirmed by the Comptroller  General of the United States in his report to  the Congress on Sept. 22, 1978.""  That is the date of the notorious and dis credited GAO report, formally issued by the  comptroller general, which concluded  that  could be overhauled at  the  Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock  Co., a private yard, for up to $105 million  less  than  the work could be done at the  Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The study was  based on faulty assumptions--regarding la bor costs,  for example-and !ailed  to give  proper accounting to some items, including  overhead costs. An analysis of the GAO re port by  tlb.e Wharton School at  the Uni versity of Pennsylvania pointed out numer ous deficiencies and concluded there would  be no significant cost differential between  Newport News and Philadelphia.  Moreover,  the GAO  report did not give  adequate, or any, consideration  to several  important factors other than cost. As a mat ter of prudent defense pollcy it is desirable  to maintain  and  improve  ship  overhaul  capab111ties at the Philadelphia Navy Yard,  which has an excellent record !or ontime,  within-budget performance, and not to be come overly reliant on  the Newport News  yard which has an infamous record of cost  overruns and  late deliveries. Additionally,  there is a question whether Newport News,  with construction work already committed  or in prospect, would be able to initiate the  Saratoga overhaul in 1980 as scheduled and  follow through with overhaul of three other  carriers in a  total of eight years.  Disregarding all such considerations, Rep.  Trible is still trying to keep the carrier work  !rom going to Philadelphia even though that  was  the Navy's original choice and it was  confirmed by the Defense Department after  the GAO  report was  issued. The Newport  News congressman has !ailed thus far to have  his  rider  approved by  the House Armed  Services Committee but has succeeded, with  the help of southern colleagues, in getting it  approved  by  the Senate Armed Services  Committee  as an attachment  to  supple mental defense appropriations.  The Trible proposal has enticing language  in the ""least cost"" phraseology, which is de ceptive in the absence of any firm evidence  that there is significant difference in the cost  !actor between Newport News and Phila delphia. Rep. Trible, who requested the GAO  study in the first place, is trying to hood wink Congress and  the Executive Branch  into abandoning  their own  responsib111tes  and granting blank-check acceptance of the  findings of the GAO, which is not account able to voters.  The Trible rider should be rejected by the  Congress as part of the 1979 supplemental  defense appropriations or on any other bill to  which lt might be attached. Phlladelphia has  9117  been chosen by the Navy for the carrier over haul work, that decision has been approved  by the Defense Department, and the work  should proceed in Philadelphia on schedule.e  AGRICULTURAL  OOMPATffiLE  DEVELOPMENT  WTT.H  STRONG  ALASKA LANDS BILL  HON. ALVIN' BALDUS  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 30. 1979    ",1979
244,,96,-0.383,1247,7,Mr. BALDUS.," Mr. Speaker, the House  will soon be considering  legislation  to  preserve the vast wilderness territories  of Alaska. The Udall-Anderson substitute  to H.R. 39, which I strongly support as  the only satisfactory version of the Alas ka lands bill, provides permanent protec tion to the finest of our northern wilder ness, while also allowing for the coun try's resource development needs. The  Udall-Anderson substitute is a  respon sible and balanced bill.  We have heard-and I am sure we will  continue to hear-an abundance of argu ment that great oil, gas, and mineral re sources will be locked up by passing the  Udall-Anderson bill. Many of these asser tions come from the major oil companies,  with whose impartiality and objectivity  we are already familiar.  I personally am convinced that those  areas with potential for these resources  have been set aside already for possible  development. If there are pockets of these  resources scattered among the vast miles  of the northern wilderness, I do not be lieve it worth the price to chew up and  regurgitate our last unspoiled  frontier  looking for them.  But, as I said, that issue has already  been argued to death. There is another  aspect of the issue, however,  that has  received scant attention. I recently heard  an  argument--a  new  one--that  the  Udall-Anderson substitute bill would ruin  forever the chances for agricultural de velopment in Alaska. As a member of  the Agricultural Committee and a farm er from way baCk,  I decided to check  into this charge. I would like to share  with my colleagues some of my findings.  In analyzing last year's bill, of which  the Udall-Anderson substitute is a care ful refinement, the Interior and Insular  Affairs committee found that with only  one exception there was no conflict be tween  the proposed conservation units  and potential agricultural development  in  the State. That one exception-the  rich Yukon Flats National Wildlife Ref uge in northeastern Alaska-will not di minish the State's opportunity for agri cultural development.  Here is some background on the issue  There are currently only 17,000 acres of  land in Alaska under cultivation: Mata nuska Valley, Tanana Valley and w~t­ ern Kenai Peninsula. Because Alaska 1m ports more than 95 percent of its food,  it is understandable that a number of  residents are eager to increase the State's  agricultural production.  Indeed, State  selection of potential agricultural lands  to date will help realize this goal.  ",1979
245,,96,0.353,1260,7,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, Rev. Joe  Head of Minneapolis,  is properly de scribed as a  ""Preacher of Patriotism"".  The attached article from the Northern  Natural Gas magazine details the suc cess  this 78-year-old patriot has had  with his program to  teach the history  of American  freedom  and  the  fun damentals of free enterprise  to young  Americans in their schools.  Joe Head, a long-time friend of mine  has traveled 25 States in his Liberty-van  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  towing his Liberty Bell replica; 300,000  students have enjoyed his patriotic and  historical presentation.  Despite his active schedule, Joe gives  no indication of slowing down his cru sade. That's a good thing because there  are a lot kids out there who want to hear  his message.  The article follows:  LIBERTY BELL MAN  (By Becky Christiansen)  What's red, white and blue, 78 years old  and holds a world's record in the 100-yard  dash?  Give up?  It's Rev.  Joseph B. Head of  Minneapolis, Minnesota;  better known  as  the ""Liberty Bell Man.""  Joe, a  retired Baptist minister, describes  himself as a ""preacher of patriotism."" And  since 1976 he and his wife, Leona May, have  toured America preaching Americanism  to  over 300,000 students in 25 sta.tes.  Traveling in a red, white and blue mobile  home with an exact replica of the Liberty  Bell  in  tow, Joe visits elementary schools  across the country, allowing children to ring  the bell and presenting his patriotic show.  The idea of the Liberty Bell e~ibit was  created by a group of Minneapolis business men, who formed the Liberty Bell Education  Foundation. Co-sponsoring the program are  the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR)  and  the Veterans of Foreign Wars. As  a  member of the SAR (he is past vice presi dent general and bicentennial chairman),  Joe was the most likely candidate to spread  their message of freedom.  Joe's personal commitment  to  the pro gram grew out of an urge to teach new gen erations of young Americans their heritage.  Teaching  comes  naturally  to  Joe. He  taught high school dramatics and history in  addition  to  performing  duties  as  school  principal. Joe said he has also spent time ag  a submarine quartermaster, college football  and  track coach,  insurance  salesman and  newspaper reporter.  Now he has ""retired"" to full time work on  this latest project. ""I am ringing the bell of  liberty and freedom so  that the American  tradition is kept alive in the hearts of all  our children.  ""I try to teach them the fundamentals of  free enterprise, and the freedoms of speech,  assembly, religion and press,"" Joe said. ""Text books aren't doing the job in my opinion,""  he  continued.  ""There  have  been many  attempts to debunk America's Revolutiotlary  heros and I won't let them. I am going to  tell them how it really was.""  In telllng his colorful version of American  history  to hi&-often boisterous audiences,  Joe blends his red, white and blue blazer  and colonial tri.corne hat with a breakneck  pace to hold the youngsters' attention.  With the energy of a man half his age, he  sprints toward the crowd, wildly waving his  arms, yelling, ""You've never seen a character  like me before."" Strained by the years of  preaching and lecturing, Joe's gravelly voice  echoes through the gym.  Holding  the  stunned  attention  of  his  audience--the same students who seconds  before were squirming and chattering-Joe  continues his frantic pace, stopping only to  select students to dramatize his points and  to hear the audience respond to questions.  ""George Washington ... Thomas Jefferson  . . . Patrick Henry,"" the students chant. Joe  ex>ntinues his lecturing with all the fervor  o! a tent preacher at a revival meeting.  the din becomes a  roar, Joe, clad  in  tennis shoes,  takes off running around the  gym. Stunned silence reigns once again as  the children watch the red, white and blue  streak around the crowd.  As  April 30, 1979  to  Stopping as abruptly as he started, Joe ap pears to be none the worse for his sprint.  Getting down on his knees he offers to share  the secret to his youthful energy and phys ical prowess.  ""It's clean  living,"" he confides. Joe un abashedly notes that he holds  the world's  record in the 100-yard dash for a man over.  70, as proof of his theory.  ""I've never smoked or had a taste of liquor.  I have no hatred for anyone on earth,"" he  adds. ""Keeping in shape is a combination of  work between the body and the soul.""  Joe's daily fitness regimen is the key to his  inexhaustible energy supply. Every morning  he  touches his  toes 50  times, does 20  leg  exercises and several isometric exercises be sides running a mile and a half.  Clearly revealing his enthusiasm, his blue  eyes twinkle as he shouts to the audience,  ""We've got the best country in the world.  Right? Sure we've got problems but we're  going to correct them. Right?""  ""Right,"" comes the resounding reply.  As before, Joe is steering his audience into  the responses he, is seeking.  ""When you get a shiner, do you get rid of  your eye?"" he asks the entranced students.  ""When you hurt your finger do you cut it  off?""  ""Of course not! You fix it,"" 1s the unani mous response.  Having  reached  the appropriate conclu sion, Joe wraps up his program with a rous ing rendition of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" on  his harmonica, marching  in  time  the  music and  the steady clapping of his en thusiastic audience.  Following the show, Joe led the students  outside to his van where  the 2,080-pound  replica of the Liberty Bell stood waiting to  be rung.  To the delight of the students-and con fusion of neighbors, no doubt--everyone rang  the bell once.  ""They  love  to  ring  the bell,"" Joe said,  never flinching despite  the loud tolllng of  the giant bell a few feet away.  The bell was cast by the Paccard Foundry  in Annecy, France,  in 1976. It is an exact  replica right down  to the famous crack.  ""The bell not only serves as a theme for the  program,"" Joe said, ""but it is also a special  treat that memorably expresses what I have  tried to tell the students.""  As proof of his popularity and the pro gram's success, Joe cites the 17,000 letters  he has received from appreciative students  across the country.  He attributes this success to the fact that  he not only believes in his philosophies, but  he lives them in his dally routines.  ""I practice what I preach,"" Joe said. ""I  won't eat at a restaurant that doesn't fiy the  flag in front, because I believe in patriotism;  and I drink mineral water and eat health  food because I believe in clean, healthy liv ing. The kids seem to sense that I am not  just a talker but I am a 'doer' and they re spect me for it.""  Watching Joe's presentation and listening  to his thoughts leads invariably to an ob vious question: where does  a  78-year-old  man--even one who once held the world's  championship in the 100-yard dash-tfiid the  energy  to continue performing at such a  rapid pace?  ""I'm inspired,"" Joe said fiatly, as 1! he had  answered that question many times before .  ""I'm inspired by what I am  trying  to do  for the kids o! America.""  The last child pulled the rope of the bell,  ringing out the final  toll of  the day. Joe  and Leona May said good-bye to students  and  teachers. After  loading up  their gear,  they climbed  into  their van and were off  down  the road for another presentation.e  ",1979

There being no objection,  the state ment was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  JOHN M. DEUTCH  Dr. John M. Deutch was named Acting  Under Secretary of Energy effective June l,  1979.  Dr. Deutch, who was nominated  to  the  position May 25, 1979, by President Carter  and  is awaiting Senate confirmation, had  been serving as Director of Energy Research  and Acting Assistant Secretary for Energy  Tec.hnology.  As Acting Assistant Secretary for Energy  Technology since January 1979 he directed  activities aimed primarily at developing new  energy technologies to the point of commer cial  applications. This  included  research,  development and demonstration programs  involving all emerging energy sources.  As Director of  the Office of Energy Re search, Dr. Deutch oversaw  the basic  re search programs of the department. He held  that position since the creation of DOE in  October 1977.  Dr. Deutch became an assistant professor  of  chemistry  at Princeton University  in  1966, and remained at that institution until  1969. He joined the faculty at MIT in 1970  as associate professor and became chairman  of the chemistry department in 1976.

254,House,96,-0.562,186,13,Mr. ROSENTHAL.,"  I  thank my dis tinguished colleague for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, first,  I  rise  in support  of the motion to instruct. I do want to  acknowledge my deep gratitude  to  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  <Mr.  ZABLOCKI) , the chairman of the commit tee, for both his sense of responsibility  and fairness and for a straightforward  explanation of the parliamentary situa tion. Indeed it is not customary or com mon, nor would I ordinarily support a  motion to instruct conferees, but this is  in fact a very unusual parliamentary sit uation, so unusual that I do not believe  I have ever seen anything like it in the  17 years I have been a Member of the  House.  What happened was that our commit tee,  the Committee on Foreign Affairs  chaired by the gentleman from Wiscon sin (Mr. ZABLOCKI), passed and brought  to the House the full request of the ad ministration for aid for Turkey. There  was no opposition to it in the committee.  We cooperated because all of us under stood the importance of Turkey as enun ciated by  the gentleman from  Illinois  <Mr. FINDLEY). The House passed a pack age of $298 million  in aid  to Turkey,  which is the largest amount sent to any  nation other than that sent to the two  middle-Eastern countries who  recently  signed the peace agreement. What hap pened was that after the House commit tee reported out the Turkish-aid package  and the House passed this legislation, the  administration sent to the Senate only they never sent anything to our commit tee-an additional $150 million supple mental aid package: $100 million in eco nomic assistance and $50 million in grant  military assistance. The Senate Commit tee on Foreign Relations changed  the  administration request and reported out  $50 million foreign military sales in lieu  of grant. On the Senate floor that was  changed back  to  the administration's  original request of grant military aid.  All during this time the House never  had  any opportunity  because of  the  unique parliamentary situation-any op portunity whatsoever-to vote on the sit uation, and the only opportunity under  the parliamentary situation is this mo tion to instruct conferees.  The gentleman from Wisconsin <Mr.  ZABLOCKI)  said  that in respect of his  role as chairman of the committee he  would vote against  the motion  to  in struct, so as not to set a precedent for  the future. On that I agree with him. He  also said he agreed  in substance with  those of us who are opposed  to a $50  million grant for military assistance to  Turkey. We are opposed because mili tary grant would change the character  of our entire relationship with Turkey.  Most of us who have been involved in  the Turkish-Cypriot  situation have  a  deep awareness and sense of responsi bility for the maintenance of the integ rity of Turkey as a viable NATO power.  We are also deeply distressed and con cerned about  the lack of progress on  Cyprus, and we feel  that we cannot in  good conscience, after 5 years and 200,000  refugees being removed from  their  homes forcibly by 40,000 Turkish troops,  return any grant assistance to Turkey  and in fact reward the aggression that  took place in the summer of 1974.  The  gentleman  from  Illinois  <Mr.  FINDLEY) said that there has been prog ress. The fact of the matter is that not  a single piece of land of the 40 percent  occupied by Turkey has been returned,  not a single refugee, not one, has been  returned  to his home, and  that more  than 25,000 Turkish troops still occupy  40 percent of the land on Cyprus. Even  the much ballyhooed talks that the gen tleman  from  Illinois  <Mr.  FINDLEY)  talks about are not really progress since  the head of the Turkish-Cypriot com munity declared himself on May 21, and  I quote: ""We are 180 degrees apart on  negotiations.""  There is not any question that Turkey  is an important ally to the United States.  It is regrettable that they have been in strumental in blocking Greece's return  and  reentry  into NATO  integration.  There were some questions raised about  the use of Turkish air space for U-2  planes, and there have been some other  problems in this area. All of us want to  cooperate  in resurrecting Turkey as a  viable economic unit.  ",1979
255,House,96,0.204,199,13,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, as always, the chair man of the subcommittee <Mr. BOLAND)  has done a brilliant job of explaining the  bill we bring to you today, just as he has  done a brilliant job of bringing this bill  to the floor. This is a bipartisan bill. It is  a tough bill but it is a fair bill. The chair man of the subcommittee <Mr. BOLAND)  has been eminently fair to the minority  members and eminently fair to the agen cies that have come before us.  I also want to extend my compliments  to the members of the subcommittee who  have been diligent and thorough. The  bill is a product of many, many hours of  work, as all of you know. The members of  the subcommittee have worked very hard  indeed.  I  join in complimenting the staff, for  the minority Martina  Pearson  and  Kenney Kraft, as well as the majority  staff, Dick Malow, Paul Thomson, Del  Davis, and Anne Harley. I also want to  compliment the associate staff.  Mr. Chairman, this bill brings $72 bil lion  in new budget authority for  the  Department of Housing and Urban De velopment and the 20 independent agen cies in offices that this bill covers. It is  $506 million below  the budget request  but $4 billion above comparable amounts  appropriated in fiscal year 1979. Still it  is a tough and lean bill and I hope that  the Members of this House will join the .  subcommittee and the committee in re sisting attempts to add what are obvi ously popular programs.  In the Department of Housing and  Urban Development,  the bill contains  $26. 7 billion in budget authority for as sisted housing programs  in fiscal year  1980. $1,160,000~000 in annual contract  authority. This level of funding will sup port up to 313,000 additional rental units  for low-income households, an increase of  approximately 13,000  units  above  the  budget request. It will provide 262,562  section 8 units and 50,000 public housing  units.  Mr. Chairman, in hearings, the Secre tary of Housing and Urban Development,  Patricia Roberts Harris, testified that it  ""could cost almost $19.4 billion on an  annual basis or approximately 3 percent  of the 1980 Federal budget,"" to provide  adequate housing for  the 14.8 million  lowand moderate-income households  with varying degrees of need.  The position of the Department is that  the cost difference between section 8 and  public housing is negligible. Therefore,  the problems of, first, the large number  of people eligible and, second,  the ex pense of  the programs will have to be  solved through changes in authorization.  The appropriations bill is not the appro priate place to make such adjustment.  The Committee on Appropriations has  gone so far as to change the mix within  section 8 of new and substantial rehabili tation units to existing units.  D 1650  Existing units, while not  increasing  the housing stock, are less expensive to  do and hence, can produce more units  for the same amount of money. The mix  has been changed from 66-34 percent, to  60-40 percent. Although HUD estimates  the mix  from  the housing assistance  plans drawn by local communities, the  committee feels that there is enough lee way to accommodate a 60-40 mix.  The bill provides at least $37,500,000  for modernization of  public  housing.  There  are new  public housing  units  backed up in the pipeline. It costs 60 per cent as much to modernize as to build  new. Therefore, it makes sense to bring  uninhabited, but already built units back  on line.  The subcommittee has funded com munity development block grants and  provided $675 million for urban develop ment action grants.  The popular section 312 program au thorizes 20-year loans at 3 percent in terest to owners or tenants of properties  in urban renewal and code enforcement  areas  to bring properties up  to code  standards. We have provided $140 mil lion for these, which is $10 million over  the budget request. Together with an  estimated $55 million from previous loan  repayments, this will make $195 million  available for fiscal year 1980.  The bill contains $10 million for the  neighborhood self-help development pro gram. Startup money was provided for  this program in the fiscal year 1979 sup plemental.  I hasten to point out, this was just an other categorical program,  the end of  which could be accomplished  through  community development block grants or  some other method. We are just starting  in a program  that could be another  bottomless pit.  The committee showed great wisdom  and restraint in not funding the livable  cities program, just another new cate gorical grant program, which would dup licate programs now carried on by the  National Endowment for  the Arts,  in cluding one known as ""livable cities."" We  thought it was something we could do  without in a tight budget year.  In  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  the  committee has  provided  $233,568,000  for  research and develop ment, which is $6 miUion below the budg et request, but $14,749,000 above the fis cal year 1979 level. The Office of Man agement and Budget conducted a cross agency zero base budgeting analysis for  the first time this year. The result was  a new public health initiative, moving  ",1979

259,House,96,0.091,225,13,Mrs. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker,  I want  to thank my colleagues here, and thank  the gentleman  from  South Carolina  for  calling our  col leagues' attention and the public's at tention fa this very unfortunate situa tion, and to set the record straight so  that there is not any misunderstanding.  I trust the facts will rise above the smear  tactic campaign.  Mr. Speaker, I  rise today as one of  several Members of this House who yes terday was  implicated by innuendo by  the self-proclaimed citizens IObby, Com mon Cause, as having had my vote on  the so-called Campbell amendment in fluenced by a National Association of  Realtors contribution to my campaign.  In the Common Cause release,  they  state:  More than $1 million in political contri butions by the National Association of Real tors (NAR) has paid off in a key legislative  victory for the real estate industry.  Clearly, Common Cause intentionally  attempted to leave the impression that  the adoption of  the Campbell amend ment was the result of NAR contribu tions. In my judgment, such an allega tion by innuendo is unconscionable.  As one who received a campaign con tribution from the NAR, I can say very  frankly  that I was unaware until the  Common Cause release yesterday as to  what the Realtors' Association position  was on this issue. I also was unaware  until yesterday of Common Cause's posi tion on the Campbell amendment.  I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this  kind of blind and vicious attack on the  collective  integrity of  the Members of  this House  is unpardonable. Such un substantiated claims indeed are the very  kinds of things that continue to breed  public skepticism, mistrust, and disillu sionment with our process of Govern ment and the people who participate in  it.  Even though there appears to be evi dence to the contrary, I would hope that  Common Cause has not undertaken: the  approach  they displayed yesterday  in  their attempt to lobby for support of  public financing for congressional cam paigns. I would caution them that eft'ec tiveness here depends in large measure  on credibility, honesty, and fairness, and  on a genuine understanding that we all  share  somewhat dift'erent convictions  and  philosophical  views.  Regretfully,  Common Cause is apparently pursuing a  dtlferent course.  I would hope we could expect more  from them in the future.  ",1979

262,,96,-0.387,290,13,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Speaker, on May 22,  1979, I was invited to attend a luncheon  meeting of  the National Energy Re sources organization. The subject of the  meeting was the development of the vast  energy resources of Indian tribes. A sig nificant portion of all strippable coal in  the west is found on Indian reservations;  approximately 40 percent of all known  uranium deposits in the United States is  on Indian reservations; and some Indian  tribes have significant oil and gas and  geothermal resources.  The luncheon speaker was Peter Mac Donald, chairman of the Navajo Nation  and chairman of the Council of Energy  Resource  Tribes.  Mr.  MacDonald's,  speech,  although  slightly  tongue-in cheek, is a forceful, revealing statement  of the position of the Indian tribes re garding the development of their energy  and other resources.   Mr. Speaker, this speech is instructive.  not only w].th respect to the development  of Indian-owned resources, but also with  respect  the general development of  this Nation's resources. Therefore, I am  inserting his speech in tJhe RECORD for the  benefit of my colleagues.  The speech follows:  tJO  FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE TNDIAN RESOURCES  IN THE NATION'S ECONOMY  is a  I a.ppreciate being invited to speak at this  gath:erlng. It is  important itha.t we  try to  increase our understanding of each other  and  that we  speak with respect  for ea.ch  other.  So, instel.d of d~ribing the Cert Tribe or  the Navajo Tribe to you, I should describe  how you appear to us-particularly how you  as government officials appear to the Native  Americans.  We  think the white man's culture  strange one. You have a tribe whose ances tral home  is on  the banks of  the River  Potomac that lives entirely on pa.per. I call  them the paper tribe. They eat paper, sleep  paper and each day they produce more paper  with words, lots of words. And the only real ity they know a.re  those words written on  pa.per. They have a native craft which tliev  are very proud of-they are called regula tions-and just as our people are very proud  of t.ih.e rugs and silver work we produce, so  this tribe is very proud to demonstrate how  they are producing larger and larger sets of  regulations  and other kinds of  artifacts  called guidelines,  instructions to the field,  manuals, position papers, option papers, and  so on. I am told that each day this tribe  produces several thousand pounds of regu lations, and this paper tribe ls now looking  to market this product just as we market  our own handicrafts, and they believe that  the Indian Reservation is a. perfect market  for their arts and crafts.  We, the American Indians, are not of this  tribe of regulation makers. In our hogans we  did not watch our fathers and our mothers  writing regulations-I don't know why, but  that's not what they did. They herded sheep  and carded wool;  some made jewelry, some  did other things. But not even our medicine  men made regulations. And I am told that  this paper tribe has a special public works  program  for  the  regulation-writing  tribe.  they call it the Civil Service, or the Merit  Selection System, but they also have a special private sector program for  this paper  tribe by creating tax incentives for business  and industry-letting them deduct all legal  fees as business expenses. One group writes  the regulations; another group fights them;  another  group  interprets  them;  another  group  dis;putes  thelr meaning-and  they  keep  full  employment  going  by  creJ.ting  more and more regulations and more and  more problems of interpretation and appli cation.  We are not accustomed to the ways of this  paper tribe, but we are told that, to become  truly aicculturated and civllized, we must  emulate their ways and try our best to pro duce similar artifacts. My problem is that  I have never discovered how to cook a regt.. .  latlon, eat a  regulation, wear a  regulation  or how to wrap a  regulation around me to  keep warm-but I hope to learn  these mys terious arts before I  leave this pow-wow.  I am told that learning the arts of  the  paper tribe  i'S very important for the sur vival of my people, for we will be called in competent and corrupt if we do not master  this art. To demonstrate the importance of  this art, I am told about the st-0ry of Lock heed and the aerospace  industry. It seems  once upon a time, this thing called Lockheed  had something called a multi-million dollar  overrun and that it was in danger of extinc tion by a  procefs called bankruptcy, but  because it understood the ways of the regu lation writing tribe, it wws placed on some thing  called  the  endangered  species  list  along with other animals that I know, such  as the whale, and the baby walrus, and it  was fed and nourished and protected with  many more papers called contracts and a  special  transfusion of paper called money.  But we do not understand your ways and  that has caused us many problems-and per haps it would be useful to describe some of  those problems in the hopes that you would  share with us the wisdom of your ancestors  and  the magic potions of your medicine  men.  We, the Native Americans, face many prob lems as we try to survive; to shape our own  destiny, and to preserve our own culture and  traditions. We live upon land that contains  vast natural  resources-fish, wildlife, coal,  uranium, oil, water, gas and other minerals.  We wish to protect the land and its natural  beauty; we wish to develop these resources  in a way that will permit present generations  to survive and  future generations  to  live  without being dependent upon others. We  wish to create  jobs and  industries on the  reservation, and therefore we are trying to  use the resources and governmental author ity we exercise  to ~ecure income, to build  shopping centers and economic growth cen ters, and to create sources of income for our  people. We need to find ways of securing help  without surrendering our sovereignty, our  independence and without giving away our  resources which is the only guarantee of a  secure future which our children and their  children have.  For a long time, we just gave our resources  away--or to be more precise, the BIA gave  them away by signing mineral  leases. And  that meant  that companies came on our  land, stripped it of its wealth, paid us a pit tance, gave us no  jobs, taught us nothing  about mining and then left-often leaving  behind huge and ugly scars upon the land,  sometimes leaving pollution and worse st111,  vast amounts of poisonous radioactive mate rial. We have now declared a moratorium on  such activities and have tried, by creating  the Council of Energy Resource Tribes to get  the knowledge and expertise needed to bar gain with the utillty companies, and to lay  the foundation for joint ventures that wlll  give us the knowhow, the management skills,  the technical skills and the access to capital.  In this connection, we need to make clear  that when  people  talk  about America's  scarce resources, they seem to treat Indian  ",1979
263,,96,-0.473,303,13,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, survival  rates for several forms of cancer have  improved dramatically  in  the  last 30  years, but the statistics on breast cancer  have been less encouraging. The mor tality rate from breast cancer has barely  changed in 50 years, according to Dr.  Warren Cole, a former president of the  American Cancer Society,  the Ameri can College of Surgeons, and professor  and head of the department of surgery,  College of Medicine, at the University  of Illinois  in Chicago. However,  there  has been an  important step  forward:  According to the 1979 American Cancer  Society  facts and  figures,  the 5-year  survival rate for breast cancer has in creased from 53 percent for cases diag nosed  in the 1940's to 65 percent for  cases diagnosed in the 1970's. Many ex perts attribute this change to the higher  proportion of cases diagnosed at a local ized stage-an increase  from 38 per cent to 47 percent during the last 30  years.  A heightened awareness  that early  diagnosis and treatment can not only  save  lives, but extend  life  for breast  cancer patients has led to an important  public information compaign now under way in Los Angeles, Calif. In February  of this year, the first Monday of every  month was declared officially ""Breast  Cancer Control Day"" at meetings of the  Los Angeles County Board of Super visors and the Los Angeles City Council.  Resolutions were sponsored by Super visor Ed Edelman and Councilman Mar vin Braude on behalf of the Community  Cancer Control/Los Angeles, Inc.  Community Cancer Control/LA Board  President Dr. John Hisserich has pointed  out that breast cancer is the single most  important cause of cancer death among  American women. If it were contagious,  it would be considered an epidemic.  It is now well known that women who  practice breast self-examination <BSE>  as a regular, monthly health habit have  a much higher survival rate. Yet, from  a public health standpoint, a  lack of  motivation and interest has been a real  obstacle to widespread practice of breast  self-examination.  To address  this public health prob lem, CCC-LA has launched an intensive  countywide awareness campaign through  posters, pamphlets, bus advertising, bill boards, and public  service announce ments on radio and TV to make women  more aware of the importance of breast  self-examination. So  far, more  than  7,000 posters and 100,000 pamphlets have  been distributed; 400 buses carried ads  for 3 months.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The materials have caused a stir. They  carry  the slogan ""Fight Cancer with  Your Bare Hands. Learn Breast Self Ex amination."" Pictured with the slogan is  a woman's hand and breast. Although  there has been some objection to use of a  photo demonstrating the self-examina tion technique, most health professionals  and community leaders have praised the  campaign as tasteful and effective.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on  Health and the Environment, I strongly  support increasing emphasis on preven tive health programs. A minute per centage-an estimated 2 to 4 percent of  our Federal health dollars-are pres ently devoted to preventive health pro grams rather than treatment of disease.  Yet public health physicians frequently  advise our subcommittee that preventive  health programs are the most cost effec tive we have.  I commend Community Cancer Con trol/LA for its bold effort to impress the  public with the great importance of early  diagnosis and treatment of breast can cer. Hopefully  their fine work will  in spire similar efforts all over the United  States.   COLOMBIA ATTACKS DRUG  TRAFFICKING  HON. LESTER. L. WOLFF  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 21, 1979  to   ",1979
264,,96,-0.264,303,13,Mr. WOLFF.," Mr. Speaker, a  dele gation from  the Select Committee on  Narcotics Abuse  and Control  visited  Colombia last April and observed first hand the efforts of the Colombian Gov ernment, under President Turbay,  stop marihuana and cocaine trafficking.  With U.S. financial and technical assist ance,  the Colombian national law en forcement and military forces are en gaging in a hard fought dedicated cam paign to rid the country of this menace.  When we met, President Turbay con firmed his commitment to take what ever steps are necessary. This is a mat ter of grave concern to him which he  recognizes as corrupting and destroying  his country. He made it clear to me that  his  actions  serve Colombia's national  interests and he is not carrying on his  campaign solely under pressure from the  United States. The Colombian Govern ment now has under study eradicating  the crops, which has been so successful  in Mexico, since despite the major inter diction campaign much of the drugs are  still being smuggled out of the country.  I would like to enter into the record  an article by Charles A. Krause in to day's Washington Post which relates the  efforts  of President Turbay  and  the  problems he faces  in carrying out his  campaign.  The article follows:  [From the Washington Post, June 20, 1979)  COLOMBIA,  U.S.  BACKING,  MOUNTS  WITH  DRIVE ON DRUG TRAFFIC  (By Charles A. Krause)  BOGOTA,  June 18.-Colombia has begun  what aippears to be the first serious attempt  16145  the  in  third  tba.n $4 mlllion  to crack down on criminal activity,  from  drug-running to counterfeiting, that has a  direct impact on the United States.  Since his inauguration last August, Presi dent Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala. has placed the  Guajira Peninsula, which  juts  into  the  Caribbean and has long served as a. major  shipment point for marijuana and oooa.tne,  under the jurisdiction of Colombia's armed  forces American officials say the move has,  for the first time, begun to disrupt the fl.ow  of narcotics to the United States.  The Tur'bay government .also has allowed  U.S. Secret Service agents into Oolombia. for  the first time as part of an effort by the F-2,  this country's version of the F.B.I., to stop  counterfeiting  rings  that  have  operated  freely here until now.  A  raid  last week,  recent  months, netted more  in  bogus dollar and peso notes as welil as false  passports and travelers checks.  The Treasury Department estimates tha.t  a.bout 90 percent of all the counterfeit dollars  manufa.ctured a.broad that successfully reach  the United States  come  from Colombia,  which over the pa.st tJwo ye.a.rs has probably  become the world's leading producer of bogus  currency,  according  to American  officials  here.  It is drugs, however, that rema.in Colom bia's most important illicit export-worth an  estimated $500 million to $1 blllion a. year. It  is estimated that 85,000 acres, mostly in the  Guajira., produce .a.bout 35,000 tons of mari juana a yeJ""r.  The Genera.I Accounting Office has said  that Colombia. is by ifa.r the most important  source for b<>th cocaine and marijuana enter ing the United States.  While Turkey's efforts thus far have not  even come close to stopping the vast drug  trade that has flourish~ in Colombia since  the early 1970s,  the military campaign in  the Guajira. has achieved substantial results,  according to U.S. officials.  Approximately 3,500  tons of marijuana.,  worth an estimated $70  Inillion to Colom bian drug runners and a.bout $280 million  when finally sold in the United States, have  been  seized. About  1,000 Colombians and  Americans have been arrested in the Gus. Jira, and 65  to 70 airplanes and an equal  number of ships engaged in dr~g smuggling  operations have been captured.  The Gus.Jira peninsula is a. rugged, moun tainous region populated largely by Indians  clinging to an ancient pre-Columbia culture.  The valley and villages a.re home to recent  Inigra.nts and peasants who  left southern  Colombia to escape the civil strike of 194958. Such services as sewage, health care and  running waiter are rare, and transportation  outside the towns is virtually impossible.  Col. Miguel Maza Marquez, commander of  the F-2, said  la.st week that his efforts to  stop cocaine traffic in Colombia. has resulted  in  the destruction of 119  cocaine  labora tories, the seizure of 2,639 kilos of cocaine  and the de<;truction of 19,547 kilos of coca  paste headed for  laboratories to be turned  into granules of cocaine.  In all, Maza.  said  the F-2 has arrested  1,069 Colombians and 151 foreigners in con nection with the cocaine raids.  Because Colombian  law enforcement of ficials  have  been  so  corrupted  by  drug  money, however, there can be no guarantee  that all or even most of the marijuana and  cocaine seized has been de<>troyed. Nor can  there be any guarantee that those arrested in  the drug raids have been kept in  jail and  tried-because it  is still relatively easy  to  bribe  authorities here  to  secure  freedom  from prosecution, according  to diplomatic  sources.  Nonetheless, American officials  say  that  Turba.y, who was stung by charges  in the  ",1979

Mr. Chairman, first I would  like  to  commend tJhe chairman of this subcom mittee, Mr. BOLAND, and his committee  for the outstanding work they have done  in preparation of this bill. I would like to  stand in support of the amendment of  adding the additional dollars on, I think,  a very important piece of research that  has to be done in order to meet the needs  of  the water quality demands of  this  Nation.  I do not want to be overdramatic, but  I would  like  to  say,  hopefully  in  a  dramatic way, that many people who felt  the Three Mile Island problem was a  tragic and a calamity situation confront ing our country, something that would  probably be even worse will happen and  occur probably in a very short few years  for many of our populated communities  of this country that depend upon their  water  coming  from  the underground  aquifers. The fact is that many of the  aquifers  are  becoming  contaminated,  and when that occurs these people will  have to move very hastily and very rapid ly because they w111 not have drinking  water for their communities.  I  think it is important for us as we  look at ,the scientific work to realize that  it is not something that can be done over night, but it must be done on a  long range basis. I have talked to a  lot of  scientists .that deal with groundwater re search, and if the information I have  received from them is correct and fac tual, I  think it behooves this Congress  to try to place a little additional invest ment into looking into these aquifers to  make sure that our citizens are protected.  I know you have heard from the east  coast and the west coast and now you are  hearing from mid-America. I  think we  all recognize this is a very important area  of water research that has been over looked in the past. There is 20 times more  water,  according  to  scientists, under neath the ground than surface water on  top.  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1979
269,House,96,0.277,342,13,Mr. WYDLER.," Mr. Chairman, I  in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chainnan, this is one of the many  battles that is going to be fought here  on the fioor of the House over revenue  sharing, and those Members who want to  support  the revenue sharing program,  whether it is at the State level or at the  local level, should well understand what  is at stake in this amendment.  This  is  just the first attack on the  revenue sharing program. It will be up  for renewal next year when the entire  program is going to be under attack.  It is just misleading to say that this  money is for the States only and does not  affect the localities. That is just mislead ing the members of this committee com pletely. Forty percent or more of the  money that goes to the State is in turn  sent by the State government to your  local governments, the municipalities. So  when you cut out these funds, you are  cutting out across this country 40 per cent of those funds which go down to  your local governments-and those funds  are desperately needed. And do not be  rise  misled that all of the States have sur pluses. That is a very misleading state ment for a number of reasons. One, of  course, is that they have surpluses, most  of them, because they get revenue shar ing funds from the Federal Government  Those surpluses, in most cases, are very  small surpluses. We do not require it at  the Federal level, but most State con stitutions require us that they run a bal anced budget. And when a State runs a  balanced budget, it must of course at all  times keep some small surplus in their  accounts. They cannot run it exactly at  dead zero at all times. So those are just  misleading kinds of statements.  Most of the States in our country are  using these funds for very good purposes,  and in a great many cases, passing them  on to local governments for their help.  I just want to say to the Members of  the House that I received today a com munication from the U.S. Conference of  Mayors-the U.S. Conference of Mayors,  not Governors,  but mayors-saying:  Please vote against this amendment, be cause the funds that go to the States are  in turn very often sent to our cities and  other local governments and are desper ately needed by them. By the passage of  this amendment you will in fact be cut ting those funds off to the cities and to  the local governments that are depend ing upon them.  So the Members better realize the pos sible  implications  of what  this vote  means, not just to our States but to our  cities and local governments as well. So  I urge the members of this committee not  to vote for this amendment. It is out of  order, in any event. This program is an  entitlement program. The Congress has  committed itself to pay this money. Most  of the States have already passed their  budgets, relying on the receipt of these  funds which were promised by the Con gress  of  the United States. All  this  amendment tries to do is have us welch  on our word. I hope the Members will de f eat this amendment.  The CHAffiMAN.

273,,96,0.268,368,13,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, few events  in our lives have captured the imagina tion of the world more effectively than  the recent  journey to Poland by Pope  John Paul II. The impact of that visit will  be felt throughout the globe for many  years to come. Indeed, if the prayers of  millions are fulfilled, the papal trip will  prove to have been a  turning point in  recent history, dramatizing the yearning  of peoples everywhere for religious free dom and human rights. It may be too  early to fully assess the significance of  the Pope's bold words and deeds, but we  can already see how he has given fresh  courage to nations and peoples long op pressed.  The worldwide reaction  to  the Holy  Father's sojourn in his beloved home land is evidence of  the way  in which  Catholic, Protestant, Eastern Orthodox,  Jew, and non-Christian alike have moved  toward common understanding in an at mosphere of goodwill and respect. In a  troubled and war-weary world, the sym bolism of  the Pope's return to Poland  has inspired new faith, new hope, new  courage.  Here  in America  these  feelings  are  shared by .many people, but especially by  those of our citizens who trace their an cestry to Eastern Europe and to the Sia v  and Magyar traditions-people who have  learned the price of liberty through cen turies  of struggle:  Polish Americans,  Slovak Americans, Ukrainian Americans,  Hungarian Americans, Czech Americans,  and Croatian Americans-Americans, all  each adding a distinctive cultural and  ethnic heritage to the rich treasure of  ou.r Nation's life.  In the Lehigh Valley, which I repre sent, the spiritual significance of John  Paul II's visit has uplifted the lives of  all, most especially those of us who share  the  rich cultural and ethnic heritage  made known to the world by John Paul  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  !I's courageous return to Poland. The  Pope's journey to his native Polish home land has brought a special sense of pride,  a special sense of fellowship with kin folk in the ancestral homelands, and a  new sense of dedication to the American  ideals of religious freedom and ordered  liberty under law.  For the present, it is strikingly evident  that in Poland, as elsewhere in Eastern  Europe, the people, when given the op portunity, will express their longing for  God and for a just and free society. ""This  Slav Pope"" has expofed the failure of  Soviet-style, atheistic Marxism  to win  the hearts and minds of free men and  women bound by history and ancient  tradition to their native homelands.  As one who shares that ethnic heri tage, I am especially cognizant of the  concerns of Americans of East Euro pean descent. I know  that the Pope's  call  for  civic  and  religious  freedom,  bravely enunciated on Polish soil be hind the Iron Curtain, will find hearty  response not only among  the peoples  of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union  but all over the world.  May  this renewed spiritual heritage  also  fire our own commitment  in  the  Lehigh Valley and through America to a  society in which every human being is  treated with equal dignity as a child of  God. We cannot fail to carry forward the  flame of individual truth and freedom  so bravely rekindled by John Paul II on  his beloved Polish soil.   A PROUD AND RICH HERITAGE  HON. CHARLES F. DOUGHERTY  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 21, 1979  e ",1979
274,,96,-0.018,368,13,Mr. DOUGHERTY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to bring to the attention of  my colleagues and the American people  an event which is to take place on Sun day, June 24, 1979. The German-Amer ican  community  in  the metropolitan  Philadelphia area will hold their Annual  German Celebration Day at the United  German-Hungarian Club  in Oakford,  Pa. This day is a celebration of  their  rich and proud heritage. The proceeds  of the day's activities support the Ger man-American Annual Von  Steuben  Day Parade in Philadelphia.  General Von Steuben left his native  Germany  to  transfer Washington's  freezing ragtag troops into a first-rate,  well-disciplined army; an army which  soundly defeated the British and helped  to give birth to a free nation.  The  German-American  community  has much of which to be proud. From  the first German settler to Philadelphia  in the latter part of  the 17th century  to  the countless others who  left their  German homeland to settle throughout  this  Nation,  the  German-Americans  have contributed much to the growth of  these United States. These immigrants  brought with them their skills as crafts men and entrepreneurs, scientists, and  June 22, 1979  more importantly, a willingness to work  hard and a commitment to strong family  values. These  talents and values were  freely given to the building of America.  German Day is celebrated throughout  our country on various dates in recogni tion of the Central European immigrants  who brought their proud heritage to a  new land of promise and, together with  others, built this mighty Republic. To day I celebrate this heritage with  the  German-Americans of the greater Phila delphia area.   MAJOR FLOOR FIGHT DESCRIBED  BY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  HON. JAMES WEAVER  OF OREGON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 21, 1979   ",1979
275,,96,-0.547,381,13,Mr. ECKHARDT.," Mr. Speaker,  for  several years there has been debate over  whether  the American people  should  have a choice of more than one kind of  safety device in their cars to protect them  from death and serious injury in acci dents. In 1977 Transportation Secretary  Brock Adams  issued a motor vehicle  safety standard <FMVSS 208)  that will  result  in a marketplace choice of air  cushions and advanced safety belt sys tems. Earlier this year the U .s. Court of  Appeals unanimously upheld the Secre tary's  standard  against  challenges  brought by the Pacific Legal Foundation  and by attorney Ralph Nader.  Since, in the minds of some, this re mains a controversial matter, I request  that a synopsis of the court's ruling be  printed in the RECORD.  In addition,  I would  request  that a  short summary of several recent public  opinion polls be inserted in the RECORD.  The argument has been made that the  American public does not want automatic  crash protection. In fact, the polls show  just the opposite-that people do want  advanced safety equipment and adequate  protection in their cars; they particularly  want protection  that works automati cally, without requirements  to ""buckle  up"" to make the systems work, and they  are willing to pay for it.  The synopsis and summary follow:  U.S. COURT OF APPEALS DECISION ON  FMVSS 208  The Pacific Legal Foundation Claimed:  "" ... experimental and real-world data do  not support the Secretary's findings on the  effectiveness of airbags ... ""  The U.S. Court of Appeals found that:  "".  . . Since this rulemaking began in 1969  DOT has conducted over 2,000 crash tests of  airbags,  including 188 with human volun teers in the vehicles, 274 with dummies, and  a handful with cadavers and baboons. Fol lowing  these experiments,  involving speeds  up  to 50 miles per hour,  the agency con cluded that 11! airbags were installed in all  ca.rs over 9,000 fatalities a.nd 100,000 injuries  would be averted ... ""  The Pacific Legal Foundation Claimed:  DOT's conclusion on airbag effectiveness is  contradicted by experience with the 12,000  airbag ca.rs currently  in operation in  this  country.  The U.S. Court of Appeals found that:  ""Indeed,  there have been more fatalities  in  frontal accidents  involving airbag cars  than the statisticaJ projections from expert mental data would have indicated. Neverthe less, in view of the relatively small sample  involved, and  the extraordinary nature of  several of the accidents, this variation does  not undermine the agency's conclusion that  airbags are effective. Moreover, airbags have  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to  been very effective in reducing or preventing  major injuries.""  The Pacific Legal Foundation Claimed:  "" ... the Secretary violated the Safety Act  by fa111ng to consider public reaction to the  ... standard.""  The U.S. Court of Appeals found:  "".  .  . the Secretary did take public reac tion into account and satisfactorily explained  his conclusion  that widespread public  re sistance to passive restraints is unlikely ...  Adams distinguished the ignition interlock  affair from passive restraints on the basis of  the nature of the intrusion on the individ ual. Passive  restraints do not  require  in dependent action by passengers to activate  them ... ""  The Pacific Legal Foundation Claimed:  The Secretary's calculations of expected  benefits from passive restraints fail to take  into account  the possible deactivation of  systems by individual motorists.  The U.S. Court of Appeals found:  ""If Secretary Adams correctly anticipates  minimal popular  resistance  to passive  re straints, petitioners argument has no force.  In addition, experience with approximately  65,000 cars equipoed with passive seatbelts,  which a.re admittedly more  intrusive than  airbags, indicates a  low deactivation rate.""  The Pacific Legal Foundation Claimed:  Installation of passive restraints may deter  use of lap belts.  The U.S. Court of Appeals found:  ""DOT defends  its estimate that lap belt  use will continue at the 20 percent  level,  citing an agency study concluding that with  no further need for more intrusive shoulder  belts,  lap belt use would actually increase  to 26 percent. Petitioners point to nothing  in  the  record  refute  the  agency's  estimates.""  The Pacific Legal Foundation Claimed:  The  rule  ignores  collateral  dangers  to  public safety posed by airbags.  The U.S. Court of Appeals found:  ""The major danger associated with airbags  is inadvertent deployment that might cause  the driver to lose control of the car. There ls  evidence, however,  that such deployments  do not present a substantial hazard. In road  experience  three  such  incidents have oc curred, and none caused a collision or injury,  while  tests with human volunteers have  shown little loss of control by drivers. More over, the agency is optimistic that the causes  of  the  three  inadvertent deployments are  understood and can be remedied so there is  some prospect of reducing their likelihood  in the future. Even without such improve ments, DOT gauges at one in 200 the chance  that in a  lifetime an individual would ex perience an  inadvertent deployment as an  occupant of a car.""  The Pacific Legal Foundation Claimed:  Rapidly inflating airbags also may injure  out-of-position passengers in the front seat,  especially children.  The U.S. Court of Appeals found:  ""New methods of gas generation, however,  permit an initially slower inflation, with the  aim of more gently moving  the occupant  back from the dashboard and out of harm's  way.""  The Pacific Legal Foundation Claimed:  The chemical used  to generate  the gas,  usually sodium a.zide, may present a danger  in its own right, either during the car's life time or upon its demolition for scrap.  The U .s. Court of Appeals found:  "" ... placement of  the  carefully  sealed  chemical  cannister behind  the dashboard  should be sufficiently remote to prevent most  accidents with it, and the cannister could be  removed prior to shredding of the car, as is  currently done with batteries and gas tanks.""  The Pacific Legal Foundation Claimed:  The passive restraint rule violates the in dividual's right to privacy.  The U.S. Court of Appeals said:  ""We  find  no basis  for  this contention.  16223  Passive  restraints  protect  not  only  the  owner or driver of of the car, but also any pas sengers, and thus involve more than a purely  individual concern.  Ralph Nader Claimed:  The Secretary  improperly delayed  imple mentation of the standard and lacked good  cause for permitting car manufacturers  to  introduce passive restraints gradually, rather  than requiring full compliance by the effec tive date.  The U.S. Court of Appeals said:  ""In his decision the Secretary explained the  delay until :nodel year 1982 as an attempt to  assure 'orderly implementation' of the new  standard. The four-year lead-in period, ac cording to the Secretary, grants car and air bag manufacturers breathing room to gear  up production. Moreover,  by  encouraging  voluntary production of cars with passive  restraints before the 1982 models, the Secre tary hopes to increase the public's familiarity  with the systems and facilitate their even tual acceptance.  SHORT SUMMARY OF PUBLIC OPINION POLLS  ABC News-Harris Survey, January 4, 19'79,  ""Despite the public's reluctance toward more  government spending, there are some federal  programs, mainly  those concerning health  and safety, in which Americans would like to  see the government make a more vigorous  effort. These include such programs as those  dealing with air and water pollution, toxic  substances, disposition of solid waste, and  auto safety."" 86 percent of those surveyed  felt that the federal government is ""moving  too slow"" or at ""just the right pace"" in efforts  to make automobiles more safe. More than  half  (51 percent)  said the federal govern ment is moving ""too slow."" 35 percent said  the pace is ""just right.""  The Gallup Poll, July 24, 1977, ""Although  most drivers fall to use their seat belts-and  oppose laws that would fine a person for fail ing to do so-they nevertheless vote in favor  of a passive restraint system in cars in the  form of air safety bags."" 46 percent of those  surveyed  favored  requiring automakers  to  put air cushions in cars. The standard allows  automatic safety belts as well as air cush ions. Had the question been phrased to re flect the flexibility of the standard, no doubt  the number  favoring  the standard would  have been higher.  Teknekron,  Inc.,  1978 Survey of Public  Perceptions on Highway Safety, November,  1978, ""Clearly the American public supports  the 1984 requirement for air bags or similar  safety devices. Support does not vary by geo graphic region, but is strongest among young  drivers and those who regularly wear safety  belts ... 73  percent of American drivers  support  the  passive  restraint  require ment ... The 'government infringement on  personal freedom' argument is leveled against  the requirement  less frequently than it is  against a mandatory safety belt use law.""  Roper Reports, April, 1977, When asked  whether a variety of issues should be settled  by public preference or by experts, 61 per cent of  those surveyed  said  that e,xperts  should decide what safety features should  be required in cars. ""Whatever protests the  public has made about certain inconvenient  or expensive auto safety devices, they don't  want the decision to be left in the public's  hands.''  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,  August, 1976,  ""Nearly 80 percent of  those interviewed prefer crash protection that re quires no activation by drivers and passen gers each time they travel, whether alone or  in combination with some kind of active  protection . .  . In order to obtain increased  automobile crash protection that would save  6,000 lives a year, the interview respondents  say they are w1lling on average to add $12  per month, or $144 per year,  to  their car  payments.

276,,96,0.333,394,13,Mr. ROBINSON.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  to express total disgust about the con fusing, contradictory plethora of Fed eral rules, regulations, controls and re strictions that have contributed so heav ily to the present gasoline crisis.  As far as I am concerned, the current  gasoline shortage represents the chick ens coming home to roost for a recent  succession  of  liberal-controlled Con gresses,  their regulation-happy friends  in the Federal bureaucracy, and their  like-minded cohorts at lesser  levels of  Government. Year after year, they have  paved the way  to the present mess by  piling layer upon costly layer of more  laws  and  controls upon  the  energy producing  segments  of  this Nation's  economy.  Aided and abetted by some misguided  public interest groups, they have raised  Cain over numerous constructive energy  growth proposals for  the  last decade,  completely ignoring the fact that meet ing basic human needs deserves prece dence over curiosities like a  lousewort  plant or a small darter minnow. So they  have stymied construction of essential  oil and gas pipelines, blocked the devel opment of new oil refineries and power  plants. They have prevented rational ex ploration and development of promising  energy fields  in remote  land areas as  well as on the offshore ocean beds.  They have imposed unrealistic stand ards on auto-makers and  refiners  so  that it now takes more oil  to produce  less gasoline. They have scapegoated the  electric power industry, drastically dis rupted the normal management opera tions of  the oil  industry and,  through  new mining requirements, are seriously  impeding  increased production by  the  coal industry.  All  this can hardly be comforting to  millions of citizens stuck in long waiting  lines at the filling stations of America.  But I think the record should be clearly  pointed out. Thanks more  to  the Big  Government crowd than to any oil cartel,  we have been forced  into our present  plight.  We cannot hope to overcome present  energy problems over the long term until  Government in general starts eliminat ing the shortsighted controls that have  handcuffed U.S. energy producers while  rewarding the international oil cartel for  June 22, 1979  its pricing irresponsibility. We have got  to insist that the Department of Energy,  EPA, OSHA, and all the rest of the regu lators back off from trying to manage  every aspect of  the private enterprise  system.  In order to reduce unhealthy demand  on oil as a chief supplier of energy, we  must also move full speed ahead with  alternative energy innovations, like gaso hol production, other synthetic fuel de velopment, coal gasification, oil shale,  solar, nuclear, and geothermal projects.  Given a spirit of cooperation and reason able compromise by both Government  and private enterprise, it should be pos sible to develop these alternative energy  supplies without jeopardizing either the  environment or human health or safety.  The American people are not going to  be forgiving if this Congress continues  to dilly-dally instead of acting positively  to overcome the fuel shortage.   MAJOR CLEVELAND LABOR GROUP  ENDORSES IRISH RESOLUTION  HON. MARIO BIAGGI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 1979   ",1979
277,Senate,96,-0.247,407,13,Mr. RANDOLPH.," Mr. President, in our  State of West Virginia, which is a moun tain wonderland, we have in the high  hills a unique village called Helvetia.  On last Saturday at Helvetia there was  a program of dimension that goes beyond  just the gathering of people. They came  because, in substantial degree, Eleanor  Mailloux, with her talent for coopera tive effort, planned  this happy event.  That section of what is now West Vir ginia was settled long ago by men and  women who came with  their families  from Switzerland. Included were fore bears of Mrs. Randolph. Mary's families  were named Scherr and Babb. Ofttimes,  West Virginia has been referred to as  the Switzerland of America.  These hardy folk from overseas came  to this mountain wilderness. They carved  out for themselves, from the Appalachian  hardwoods, their cabins, their churches,  their places of business.  Many hundreds of people were there,  for a special celebration, the descendants  of the original Swiss settlers and their  friends.  I call particular attention to day-because it is important, even at the  outset of this busy Senate session, with  matters that will be of concern, such as  appropriations and other items-that the  Ambassador from Switzerland, his wife,  Annemarie and members of the Embassy  staff came to celebrate with West Vir ginians. A copy of  the program is in cluded, as follows:  PROGRAM  SATURDAY, JUNE 23, 1979  1 :30 p.m: Arriving Swiss from Washington  will please stop at the Helvetia Community  Hall where you will be greeted by Swiss  speaking Helvetians.

Thank you for  journeying so far to our  small village and !or helping us celebrate  our great honor.  If you must  leave  us,  remember:  ""If I did not depart, how could I return?""  Ambassador Raymond Probst was in formative in his comments, as he recalled  for the more than 500 persons the history  of the settlement. His remarks follow:  ADDRESS BY DR. RAYMOND R. PROBST  My wife and  I, as well as Consul Kurt  Welte and his wife, a.re very pleased to be  here with you  today. As Ambassador of  Switzerland  to  the United States,  it  is  a great joy to see how the Swiss in America  and the Americans of Swiss origin demon strate their attachment to the old homeland.  It ls moving to realize how  they ca.re  for  our traditions and values, and how cleverly  they  integrate them into the new way of  life. I see proof of this repeatedly because I  am not only a Washington-based but just as  much a rov.lng Swiss Ambassador who wit nesses  this special heartwarming devotion  towards my country in the most diverse sur roundings, under blue skies and under grey  skies, sometimes in impressively large gath erings and sometimes among a. ""chosen few"".  Just  last weekend,  I  spoke  to almost  two  thousand American-Swiss from the Midwest  at their Sangerfest in St. Louis/Missouri; on  the same occasion, I visited the little town  of Highland, Illinois, settled. by Swiss immi grants in the first half of the la.st century;  shortly before that I addressed. the SwissAmerican community in New Orleans; and  toda.y,  I  am with you on a West Virginia  meadow, remembering the spirit of pioneers  which inspired your forefathers when thes  laid Helvetla's foundation 110 years ago.  But let me now dwell a. llttle on the reason  why we are here today.  It was  in early spring;  there were stlll  patches of snow on these slopes and meadows,  on the roof tops and under those dark pines,  when an invitation was sent to my office in  Washington DC,  asking  that we  join  the  Helvetians  for  a  very  special  celebration  which should take place once the sun had  brought the leaves and flowers back to life.  The celebration was to joyfully remind us  that, at the end of last year, this delightful  little town was accepted into the National  Register of Historic Places.  What, you might ask, ma.de Helvetia de serve such honors? Well, it ls the people, all  of you Helvetians. Without the courage and  determination  of  your  forefathers  there  would,  first of all, be no ""Helvetia"", and  without  the patriotism and endurance of  your pa.rents and yourselves there would be  no festivities going on right now on this  meadow. No ca.bin would ever have served as  a first modest church, nor would there have  been the laughter and playing of chlldren  a.round the schoolhouse; the sounds from the  blacksmith's shop would never have  filled  this pure air, and the fragrance of freshly  baked bread and the aroma of homemade  cheese would never have enchanted a hungry  townsman's nose.  The history of this settlement is told in a  thin booklet, but some details you should  know. I give them to you in case you haven..,t  done your homework, as I did before coming  here.  One hundred and ten years ago, a. group of  pioneers ventured into the vast forests cover ing the Appalachian Mountains. They had  come from Switzerland and Germany some  years before  and were mostly craftsmen.  Since the Civil War hindered their perma nent settling, they found temporary homes  in Brooklyn/New York with their !a.mi11es.  But as soon as the war was over, some men  were sent out to the newly independent State  of West Virginia., a. State sizably bigger than  Switzerland,  to explore  the possib1lities of  finding a better life there. The endless forests  at first were discouraging, it all seemed such  wilderness, but when they met with the West  Virginians they felt their spontaneous hospi tality, and it induced them to remain.  Very  reasonable  land prices made  their  decision even easier, and before long their  fammes  started  the  long  journey  from  Brooklyn to their unknown destination. In  1870,  a happy group of villagers baptized  their new home and, since the community  consisted mostly of Swiss,  they were  the  ones to choose a name. What would a.ppro prlately  express  their pioneer  spirit  and  their wish  to  build  a  little Switzerland  among these hllls so  far a.way  from  their  old home? They chose ""Helvetia"", the name  which originated from our Celtic ancestors  2000 years ago,  a.  symbol  therefore of en durance throughout the centuries.  While many emigrating Swiss sought out  the  fertile plains of  the Midwest or  the  promising shores of California, families by  the name of Daetwyler, Zielman, Stutzman,  Anderegg, Hofer, Teuscher, Fahrner  and  many others chose  the rugged ""Mountain  State"". After the first 32 !amllies had arrived,  an enthusiastic townsman wrote such glow ing accounts of  this new small world of  theirs  that many more  !amilles came  to  Helvetia.  Imagine, during  the  first  years  there was neither a post office nor a store In  the  town, and since horses were an un affordable commodity  then,  those stalwart  men carried  their  loads on  their backs  to  the next town about 30 miles away.

279,House,96,-0.153,589,13,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker, in recent  weeks,  there have been several reports  along the east coast about proposals to  require licenses or fees for salt water rec reational fishing.  Such re:rorts, quite naturally, are up setting to many people. Salt water fishing  is a vital recreational activity. It pro vides  jobs and income to coastal com munities, such as those along the south  Jersey coast in my congressional district.  It grants direct  financial  benefits  to  charter boat operators, tackle and bait  shops, marinas, resort hotels, and res taurants.  In addition, it is an inexpensive and  enjoyable pastime for thousands of vaca tioners, sportsmen, and families along the  Nation's shorelines.  Consequently, a great number of peo ple are quite dismayed over the reported  proposals to impose salt water fishing li censes and fees. A fee or license require ment would have several bad effects. It  would discourage a large number of peo ple from engaging in salt water fishing.  This would be particularly true for those  who have never tried it before. A recent  study in New Jersey showed that 2 out  of every 10 of the State's fishermen would  not fish if they needed salt water license.  This, in turn, represents a sizable loss  of fisherman and vacationers for resort  communities and fishing towns. The ac companying  financial  harm  to  these  areas would be substantial. For example,  recreational fishing in New Jersey gen erates on estimated $375 million a year  for the State's economy.  In short, saltwater, or ocean, fishing  is simply a vital part of our resort and  recreation industry. It is an invigorat ing and wholesome sport. It is enjoyed  by people of all ages. It provides fresh  air, sunshine, and good exercise. And  best of all,  it  is  inexpensive, with no  licenses or admission fees. That is the  way it should be kept.  Today,  the House is considering two  important fishing bills, the Fishery Con servation and Management Act and the  Anadromous  Fish  Conservation  Act.  These bills are being considered under  suspension;  thus, no amendments can  be offered.  Nevertheless, I am today introducing  legislation that would prevent the Fed eral Government and discourage the in dividual States from requiring licenses  or fees for saltwater recreational fishing.  My legislation would block imposition  of saltwater fishing licenses at the Federal level by amending the Fishery Con servation and Management Act. It would  amend the act to stipulate that no re gional management council could  re quire recreational fishing licenses as part  of  any  conservation  or management  measure.  My bill also would cut off grant as sistance under  the Anadromous Fish  Conservation Act to any State that re quires a  fee  for saltwater recreational  fishing.  In addition,  it would cut off  grants from the Dingell-Johnson funds  to any State imposing saltwater recre ational fishing fees.  The Merchant Marine and Fisheries  Committee, on which I  serve,  is  today  beginning a series of oversight hearings  on the Fishery Conservation and Man agement Act. The hearings are expected  to extend over the rest of the year. I am  hopeful that the committee will devote  part of these hearings to a  look at the  recreational fishing  industry.  I  intend  to work hard during these hearings and  during all future action on fishing legis lation to insure that recreational fishing  in saltwater is not subjected to licenses,  fees,  or other bureaucratic  entangle ments at either  the Federal or State  level.   e ",1979
280,House,96,0.16,589,13,Mr. CLAUSEN.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  Fishery Conservation and Management  Act is commonly known as the 200-mile  limit bill. Its goal is to conserve and en hance our coastal fishery and  to limit  fishing by foreign fishing fleets.  I  believe we have moved  toward a  more stable fishery through the imple mentation of the act and we do not now  fear foreign depredation of our coastal  fishery as much as we did before we  assumed jurisdiction.  Now our goal must be to refine our  management decisions bY. improving the  data  collection upon which  they  are  based  and  by maintaining  vigorous  stocks  of  the various  fishery  species  through  research and other biological  investigation.  The committee recognized  the prob lems we have uncovered and the need  for a greater effort on the part of the  management councils by increasing the  authorization  level above  that recom mended by  the administration. I  fully  concur in this action and hope it will  be approved by the House.   ",1979

283,House,96,-0.345,602,13,Mr. STAGGERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of the passage of Senate Joint  Resolution 14 as reported by the Com mittee on Interstate and Foreign Com merce. This measure contains a series of  needed technical amendments to several  public health bills enacted during  the  95th Congress, and to the Public Health  Service Act.  I commend the members of the Sub committee on Health and the Environ ment and particularly its chairman and  ranking minority member, for their dili gent work in reviewing existing legisla tion to :find the needed technical changes  provided for 'by this resolution.  I urge my colleagues to join me in vot ing for passage of these technical cor rections to health laws.   ",1979
284,House,96,-0.373,615,13,Mr. NOLAN.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  support of H.R. 4303, and urge its imme diate adoption by this House.  As a member of the subcommittee that  worked on  this  legislation,  it was my  hope that this bill would be broader than  it is. The legislation amends the Food  Stamp Act of 1977 and corrects some of  our oversights by adding a medical de duction, and improving the excess shelter  deduction, for the elderly and the dis abled. I  feel  that it is wrong to single  out the elderly for this kind of assistance,  and  I  argued unsuccessfully  that  the  medical  deduction  and  shelter  relief  should be applied to all households that  needed such assistance. I was outvoted  by my colleagues and, as a result, I am  afraid that many poor people who are  experiencing severe nutritional problems  will remain unserved. I intend to address  this issue again when we consider future  legislation  regarding  the  food  stamp  program.  However, I still intend to-vote for H.R.  4303 as it does make gains for households  with elderly and disabled members. It  does help to correct some of the problems  created by the 1977 law. But this legisla tion will only help people if the Depart ment of Agriculture promptly and prop erly implements this provision. I know  they did not favor adoption of this pro vision, so I would like to make sure they  do it as we intended.  The most important job for USDA is  to note the amendment I offered in the  subcommittee that requires the legisla tion to be in place and in operation by  January l, 1980. I do not mean by this  that it simply be promulgated as regula tions. or that only a notice be sent to  the States. This legislation must be im plemented no later than January 1, 1980,  so that eligible households are receiving  the benefits under this new legislation on  that date. We also intend that the bene fits reach people in reality and not just  on paper. I understand that under the  old law, which had a medical deduction,  many people who were entitled to a de duction never received one because the  food stamp office did not act on it quickly  enough.  Therefore, we want to make sure that  once an eligible household indicates that  it has been billed for allowable medical  expenses, using the same definition as in  the old regulations and instructions, and  the office determines that the household  is entitled to a deduction, it actually re ceives that deduction-to the extent the  billed amount exceeds $35. If it is not  possible  to give  the deduction for  the  month in which the household was billed,  we want to make sure that it is taken  into account in the computation of bene fits  and  eligibility  in  the  following  month, with the household suffering no  loss of any benefits to which it was en titled. When it comes to something as  important as recognition of medical bills,  there should be as little delay as possible,  and then only to comport with the limi tations of what a  local office can do in  the shortest amount of time.  Again, I am disappointed we could not  do more for the many households that,  like the elderly, have expenses that re duce their ability to purchase an ade quate diet. However, I reluctantly sup port this overly narrow bill as an effort  to provide some relief as quickly as pos sible to at least some people who need  it.   e ",1979
285,House,96,-0.339,615,13,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, the Food  Stamp for  the Elderly ~ct considered  here  today has my  full  support. The  measure is similar to legislation I have  cosponsored  and  have  been  backing  since early  this year. The bill would  restore food stamp benefits  to elderly  persons who  lost part or all of  their  benefits as a  result of  the changes in  determining  eligibility which  became  effective earlier this year. We must enact  this legislation before us today;  if not,  we will  force  substantial numbers of  elderly  poor  to make  cruel  choices  between adequate  food, medical care,  heat, and other necessities.  Implementation of  the Food Stamp  Act of 1977 resulted in the termination  or reduction of .benefits to many elderly,  blind, and disabled persons.  Its main  provisions set new criteria  for deter mining eligibility by:  Eliminating  deductions  for medical  costs  in excess of 30 percent of  the  household's income;  Establishing  a  20  expense disregard;  Establishing a  standard deduction $ 70 as of July 1, 1979; and  Establishing a combined excess shelter  cost and dependent care cost deduction  for expenses over 50 percent of net in come, with a ceiling-$90 as of July 1,  1979.  H.R. 4303 would:  Restore  a  medical  deduction  of  expenses which exceed $35 per month,  and  Also for deduction of all shelter costs  in excess of 50 percent of net income  without any regard to any ceiling.  percent  work  Expenses in the areas of medical costs,  shelter and food consume a dispropor tionate  share of  the  elderly  persons  budget. On  the average 58 percent of  the elderly person's budget goes for costs  in these three areas. At the same time,  these same costs consume only 49 per cent of the younger person's budget.  Medical care, shelter, and  food are  essentials of life for everyone. However,  the elderly require more medical care,  adequate room temperatures, and good  nutrition in order to maintain a state of  well-being. For example, 85 percent of  the elderly population suffer  from at  1least one chronic condition. The per  capita medical costs for the elderly are  3.5  times higher than for  those under  65.  In 1976, medical costs were over  $1,500 per person for those over 65 and  less than $500 for those under 65 years of  age.   Since so m3.ny of  the elderly suffer  from chronic and other disabling dis eases, adequate room temperatures are  necessary for the health and safety of  the individuals. Low temperatures, even  in the sixties, can be fatal. At the same  time, rapidly rising fuel and heat costs  are increasingly difficult to meet on fixed  incomes.  The net result of H.R. 4303, by allow ing deductions for  these very real ex penses, would be to increase the income  of many poor elderly. And, if increased  food benefits are available there will be  more  room  in  the budgets  for other  necessities.  We must pass H.R. 4303 if we are going  to enable our elderly persons to maintain  adequate standards of living, after all,  the health and welfare of our low-income  population was the reason for establish ing the program in the first place. The  least we can do is assure that those who  need the benefits can participate in the  program.   e ",1979

290,Senate,96,-0.142,680,13,Mr. BOREN.," I  thank the Senator. I  would  like to join in the pleas of  the  Senator from Mississippi and the Sen ator from Kentucky to the Senator from  Connecticut  to withhold his point of  order.  He said we have allowed the situation  to go on for a long time and, therefore,  there is no need for urgency. I would sug gest that the fact that. it has gone on for  a long time is all the more reason why  we must act. We are not dealing with the  usual situation. We are not dealing with  just a pressure group or one group or an other in the country that wants some  kind of assistance. We are dealing with  people who literally, within a split second, have seen their entire life's work  wiped out.  I think of one experience I had with a  citizen who was in his late sixties in the  midst of what had been his home literally  a minute  or  2 minutes  beforehand.  Everything was wiped out, his entire  life's work, his home, his business.  Here had been a hardworking, taxpay ing citizen. The work of his entire adult  Hf e was wiped out in a split second by  an intense storm.  Then we continue to tell these people  to wait. I do not think we are opening  up an undue precedent when we say we  can get the wheels of Government to re spond to the needs, the intense needs, of  the people who are afflicted with a situa tion like this. I would urge the Senator  from Connecticut to lay aside his point  of order and to consider, as the Senator  from Mississippi said, on the basis of  human  feelings,  the  needs  of  these  people.  I know he is very sincere about the  procedures involved in this case. I under stand what he is saying. I would normally  agree with him when we are dealing with  a very normal situation. But here we  are dealing with people who are in gen uine distress and I urge him to reconsider  his point of order.  ",1979

295,House,96,-0.165,810,13,Mr. FITHIAN.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in support of H.R. 3930.  America's security must not be mort gaged to the foreign oil-producing na tions. It is  time to harness American  ingenuity to lessen our dependence on  foreign imports and create an American  energy source-synthetic fuels.  Today, America is far too vulnerable  to the demands of foreign oil-producing  nations. Foreign nations threaten to cut off their oil exports to us unless we take  certain actions. This is nothing less than  blackmail. The United States has the  resources, technology, and capital to ren der those threats meaningless by mak ing our Defense Establishment energy  independent.  The bill  emphasizes  this  country's  great f orte-pr<>duction. This legislation  gives the President the authority to es tablish a synfuel industry in the United  States that could reduce our need for oil  imports.  Some synfuel technologies are well established. Germany waged World War  II on a  synfuel produced !rom coal.  Sou~h Afri?a has been producing a syn thetic oil since 1955. Synthetic fuels de rived  from  biomass  feedstocks-most  notably alcohol-are now beginning to  be produced and sold  throughout  the  United States.  As a long-time supporter of synthetic  fuels derived from biomass, I applaud the  provisions of H.R. 3930 which permit  biomass synfuel technologies to compete  on an equal basis with coal gasification  and liquefaction, shale, lignite. and other  mineral  liquefaction or gasification. I  strongly urge the Departments of En ergy, Commerce, Defense, and the TV A  to give equal consideration to each tech nology in implementing the law. The in tent of Congress is clear in this regard  Only if we have a clear idea of the com~  parative costs of each can we make in telligent  decisions  on  future  synfuel  policy.  ) But at the same time, I firmly believe  that we need to do more in the area of  advanced  research,  development,  and  demonstration  of  near-term  biomass  synfuels  technology.  This  effort  is  needed, in part, because Federal support  for biomass synfuels R. & D. has, tra ditionally, lagged far behind support for  competing technologies, and in part be cause of  the tremendous potential of fered by biomass synfuels.  It is, therefore, my intent to offer an  amendment to the Department of En ergy authorization bill which will help  place biomass synfuels on a more equal  footing with other synfuels technologies.  Only if this additional support is offered  can we expect a  true test of the cost eff ectiveness of competing technologies  to emerge from the synfuel program con tained in the bill now before us.  Of all DOE's renewable energy pro grams, biomass development has been  one of the most neglected by DOE and  other agencies. Yet, biomass' potential to  meet U.S. and world energy needs puts  it in a class by itself. According to the  administration's recently  released do mestic policy  review on solar energy,  wood and other forms of biomass cur rently contribute between 1.8 and 2.4  quadrillion Btu's <quads) of the Nation's  78 quad energy budget. By 2000', biomass  is projected to contribute more energy  than any other renewable source: 3.1  quads in the $25/bbl base case, 4.4 quads  in the $32/bbl base case, 5.5 quads in the  intermediate case, and 7 quads in the  high case.  Biomass' promise remains unfulfilled  partly because biomass programs--par ticularly  those centered on near-term  applications-are underfunded and part ly because program management has  been  inadequate. Most of  the impedi ments  to biomass development could,  however, be eliminated and all could be  alleviated. Making this resource live up  to its awesome potential requires alloca tion of additional funds and the bring ing  together of a DOE staff with the  skills and determination needed to re dress neglect of this major energy source.  Under my amendment,  the Federal  Government would begin or add to pro grams in nine specific areas which would  help us achieve the tremendous poten tial of biomass. These programs are de rived  from  internal DOE  and USDA  budget requests-requests which, in most  cases, were irrespansibly slashed by these  agencies or OMB before seeing the light  of day on Capitol Hill. My amendment  will reinstate nine programs which were  well conceived and carefully thought out  by  program managers  at DOE  and  USDA.  1. POWER SYSTEMS PROGRAM, $18.3 MILLION  The objective of this program is to de velop, demonstrate, and commercialize  near-term biomass  applications using  agricultural and forest residues. Inter mediateand  small-scale  gasification  and direct combustion systems will be  developed. Specifically,  it  is proposed  that $3.1 million  support  the design  and implementation of safety and per formance standards for residential wood  stoves-expected to be used in 15 million  residences by 1985-to support the de velopment of advanced high-eftlciency  stoves, to support the implementation of  the proposed  tax credit; $10.2 million  will fund the development and. demon stration of low-Btu gasification units in  industrial applications.  This program was originally proposed  as a part of DOE's Fossil Fuels Utiliza tion Division. Program documents  in dicate that 4 quads could be produced  annually by 1985,  if the program were  implemented. However, DOE, oblivious  to the program's potential decided to cut  it in fiscal year 1980.  2. GASOHOL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,  $7 MILLION  DOE's fiscal year 1980 budget request  projects a  slight  relative  increase  in  funding  for  fermentation development  above fiscal year 1979  levels. However,  this increase does not adequately sup part  the  technology,  considering  its  significant patential-it may provide up  to 0.33 quads or 4 billion gallons of  ethanol by 1985. The $7 million increase  should suppart further R. & D. for such  nearto mid-term concepts as acid hy drolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, as well as  on-farm  fermentation,  an application  which has been ignored by DOE.  3. COMMERCIALIZATION, $8.4 MILLION  DOE has recently chosen wood com bustion-and  gasification-as  being  ready  for  commercilization  and  has  designated  a.  ""resource manager""  to  oversea the Agency's wood commerical ization program. However,  almost no  funds or staff have been allocated  to  this program. Moreover, DOE has ta.ken  a narrow view  in choosing only wood  combustion as a commercializable bio mass technology. For these reasons, $8.4  million is earmarked for a comprehensive  commercialization activity supporting a  host of near-term bioenergy applications  including fermentation, gasification of  forest and agriculture residues, and di rect combustion  in utility and  indus trial applications. The program will be  complimentary  to  the  technology de velopment effort in the power systems  program discussed above.  4. ON-FARM SYSTEMS,  $3.5 MILLION  An area which has received very limit ed suppart from DOE or USDA is the de velopment and  implementation of on farm energy production systems. The $3.5  million designated for this program is to  fund design studies and demonstration  projects which integrate food, feed, and  fuel production. Particular attention will  be given to comparing integrated farms  with conventional farms as to net energy  conserved, net profit, and soil and water  conservation effectiveness.  5. ANAEROBIC DIGESTION, $2.3 MIL'LION  DOE has historically promoted the de velopment of large scale anaerobic diges tion units having limited application. A  $2.3 million amount is designated to sup port development work on onfarm diges tors which can provide 0.3 quad in the  near-term, and which can have signif",1979

317,,96,-0.658,888,13,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr.  Speaker,  on  Wednesday, June 27, when  the House  begins  its consideration of H.R. 4389,  the Departments of Labor /HEW appro priations bill, an amendment may be  offered  to  reverse  the  earlier  action  taken by the Appropriations Committee  to bar incarcerated off enders from re ceiving  1980 Comprehensive Employ ment and Training Act <CETA)  funds.  The Appropriations Committee  took  its action after  learning that 27 pris oners at the Washington, D.C., Lorton  Reformatory had been paid Federal job training funds, and that some of these  prisoners were not eligible  for  release  until after the year 2000. The Depart ment of Labor has initiated an investi gation into. these alleged abuses at the  Lorton Reformatory, and it is my under standing their final investigation will be  concluded in a few days.  In my  judgment,  the action of  the  Appropriations Committee is overbroad.  It would punish all prisoners who are  working in CETA programs rather than  focusing on the few governments <prime  sponsors> which may be misapplying  CETA funds. The Secretary of Labor has  the authority to require the repayment  of misspent funds, and the Department  of Labor is proposing strengthened regu lations which would  further  restrict  payments  to prisoners,  thus obviating  the need for further legislation in this  area. Moreover, no evidence has been  shown to indicate a national problem. It  is premature  to enact broad Federal  legislation  to remedy a single incident  of abuse  in  the District of Columbia  without knowing the precise extent and  nature of the problem.  It is  estimated  that approximately  150,000 prisoners will be barred  from  participating in CETA programs as a re sult of  the Appropriations Committee  action, and it should be noted that of a  national  civilian  labor  force  of  100  million persons,  fully 25 million meet  DOL's definition of offender.

318,,96,-0.564,901,13,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, I recently  introduced  two  pieces  of  legislation  which would effectively eliminate one of  the most disturbing and ominous social  concerns  facing our Nation-an enor mously high rate of youth unemploy ment.  The first of  these bills <H.R. -4534)  would create an effective program of full  employment, vocational  training,  and  job placement for all young Americans  in need of work.  Although both the Carter administra tion and the Congress have made im portant and commendable commitments  to job initiatives for young persons, the  extent of the problem is such that fur ther and more comprehensive efforts are  urgently required. Indeed, only a very  small proportion of all  jobless young sters are currently being assisted by any  Federal work or training project. The  persistence of unemployment rates for  all youngsters in the 17-percent range  and for black youth at a level twice as  high should be sufficient proof that we  must do more and that we must do it  quickly.  H.R. 4534, the Youth Employment Act,  seeks  to  insure,  through a variety of  mechanisms, full utilization of all public  and private employment and  training  programs.  The bill will move the Nation toward  full employment for all persons in the  16 to 24 age bracket by creating within  the Department of Labor a National  Youth Full Emplovment Board. This  body will work with  the Secretary of  Labor and prime sponsor planning coun cils to achieve a significant reduction in  the employment differential among var ious  population groups  and  place  large numbers of currently jobless young  people in productive work positions.  The legislation stipulates that within  1 year of its enactment the overall job lessness rate for all American youngsters  must not exceed 10 percent. Likewise, the  bill requires a further reduction to an  unemployment rate of 3 percent within  2 years of its passage and to genuine full  employment by  the  third year.  Jobs  must. at the end of this period, be sup plied within a  reasonable period to all  young people who are able and willing  to work, the legislation states.  These objectives will be accomplished  through the provision of financial as sistance to the States, localities, private  and nonprofit 011ganizations, and  the  Youth Job Guarantee Office which  is  to  ",1979

320,Senate,96,0.337,953,13,Mr. JEPSEN.," Mr. President,  today I  would like to give you a brief lesson o::i  how to create an energy shortage. Any  resemblance between my scenerio and  is, ot  actual U.S. Government policy  course, coincidental.  The first thing that needs to be done  is to put price controls on oil and nat ural gas, the two major sources of en ergy in the United States. Care should  also be taken to make sure that the price  is set significantly below the price which  would occur on a free market.  This action simultaneously does  two  important things which will insure that  a shortage results: It reduces the poten tial return on investing in the explora tion, development and production of oil  and gas while at the same time encour aging consumers to use more oil and gas  than they otherwise would have if the  price had been set by the market instead  of the Government.  Next, it would be a good idea to en courage other nations which produce  significant amounts of oil for export to  band together into a cartel. This cartel  could  then quadruple  the price of oil  within a very short time. Needless to say,  under the guise of protecting consumers  the price of domestically produced oil  will be prohibited from rising.  ",1979

There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 1438  Be  it enacted by  the Senate and House  of Representatives of the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That not withstanding any other provision of law, the  Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to lease  real property including office space, storage  space and such other building space as he  determines to be necessary to carry out the  programs of the Department of Agriculture:  Provided, That space requirements in Wash ington, D.C. and space requirements of more  than 5,000  square feet in Standard Metro politan Statistical Areas, as defined by the  Office of Management and Budget, should be  obtained through the General Services Ad ministration.

A bill to prohibit States from  enforcing  certain vehicle weight  and  length limitations on the national system  of interstate and defense highways dur ing the current period of fuel shortages;  to the Committee on Environment and  Public Works.  UNIFORM WEIGHT AND LENGTH LIMITS FOR  TRUCKS   Mr. CUL VER. Mr. President, I am to day introducing legislation to establish  on an emergency basis uniform weight  and length limits for trucks using the na tional system of interstate and defense  highways. This legislation is designed to  help conserve currently limited supplies  of diesel fuel.  Under current law, trucks using inter state and defense highways must con form to limits set by the States for length  and weight. Such limits are discretionary  up to a federally determined maximum  of 80,000 pounds and 60 feet. Most States  have limits at or near these levels.  Ten States have set lower limits, how ever, and truckers often are forced  to  make costly detours when  they  reach  their borders. The rising costs and de clining availability of diesel fuel have al ready placed many independent truckers  in a precarious economic position. The  lack of uniform Federal regulations, by  requiring  unnecessarily  longer  routes,  strains both limited diesel supplies and  the ability of truckers to stay in busi ness.  The legislation I am introducing would,  for  the period of  the current energy  emergency, raise the weight and length  limits in all States to a national stand ard of 80,000 pounds and 60 feet. In so  doing,  it would contribute to the con servation of diesel fuel. According to the  Department  of  Transportation,  Iowa  alone would consume 7 .8 million fewer  gallons each year under such an ap proach.  Under . this  bill,  the higher  limits  would remain in effect until the Secre tary of Energy. certifies that supplies of  middle distillate  fuel are suffi.cient  to  meet such basic national requirements  as home heating, agriculture, transpor tation, and industry. Legislation with a  similar purpose is pending in the House  of Representatives.  While the current shortage is a strong  argument for taking action on an imme diate temporary basis,  it is quite pos sible that the uniform standards on a  permanent basis are in the national in terest. The Department of Transporta tion is currently studying this matter, as  mandated by the 1978 Surf ace Transpor tation Act. I am writing Secretary Brock  Adams  to urge that this study be ac celerated with a  report to Congress by  the end of this year.  Mr. President, raising the length and  weight limits for  trucks  to a national  standard is a partial answer to both the  diesel fuel shortage and to the problems  threatening  numerous  independent  truckers. I hope that this body will give  it prompt and serious attention.   e ",1979
322,Senate,96,0.115,1070,13,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. President  I wou~d e~courage my colleagues to read  an editonal from a Minnesota newspa per, the Princeton Union-Eagle, written  by the Honorable El:mer Andersen, for mer Governor of Minnesota. The Governor reminds us that the issue of re drawing  the boundaries of State and  congressional electoral districts will soon  be on the agendas of State legislatures.  Within a few months, the 1980 census  will begin and  the population  figures  that will serve as a basis for congres sional reapportionment will be gathered  by the Census Bureau.  It is essential that everyone be counted  and  that  the  congressional  districts  drawn on the basis of thait count be as  fair as possible. ""Fairness"" means that  the electoral districts must be drawn so  that each voter's ballot will count equal ly.  Under our present system of redistrict ing, fairness is not assured. Congression al district lines, in too many States, are  drawn to protect incumbent Congress men and their political parties. They are  drawn to dilute the voting strength of  minorities  and  to underrepresent  le gitimate geographic and socioeconomic  interests. Gerrymandering  lessens  the  competition between political parties it  diminishes  the  incentive  for  parties  to.offer their best candidates; it prevents  fair representation of diverse interests.  It robs individual citizens of their right  to representation.  The Committee on Government Af fairs recently held hearings on S. 596,  am a  the Antigerrymandering Act.  I  cosponsor of that bill, because it would  establish national standards for draw ing the boundaries of congressional dis tricts  and  it would  require  an  in dependent citizen commission to develop  the reaPPortionment plan.  A plan similar to that of S. 596 was  recommended in Minnesota in 1972 by  the Minnesota  Constitutional  Study  Commission. Former Governor Andersen  served as chairman of that commission.  This  year,  t;h.e Minnesota  legislature  came close to enacting the commission's  recommendations, but differences  be tween  the house and senate versions  could not be reconciled before the ses sion ended. Governor Quie has set en actment of a redistricting bill as a top  legislative priority for the next session.  If the Minnesota legislature enacts such  a law, it would join a handful of States  that are striving t.o insure that the basic  tenet of democracy-the right to equal  representation-will be protected.  The editorial follows:  ""ONLY ONCE EVERY 10 YEARS""  It is the essence of representative govern ment that the representatives be honestly  and equitably chosen. One important part of  that process in Minnesota is the reapportion ing of legislative districts af.ter each 10-yea.r  census. Next year is census year so in 1981  it will be incumbent upon our legislature  to recast our legislative districts to reflect  shifts in population.  In the legislative session just ended bllls  were considered to place the reapportioning  job in a. commission created for the purpose.  Different proposals received favorable consid eration but no consensus was achieved and  no blll passed. A constitutional study com mission which  included  several  legislative  leaders wa.s  unanimous  in  recommending  that such a. commission be created.  Our last reapportioning wa.s done by computer under court jurisdiction a.s a. result of  problems over acts passed by the legislature.  The result wa.s equity in population but in sensitivity to keeping legislative dlstrlots a.s  nearly a..s possible coincident with other units  of government. Some districts were estab lished with parts of several counties, a.s our  Senate district, instead of trying to follow  county and municipal boundaries.  Some concern has been expressed at put ting political party officials on the commis sion. It should be recognized that this politi cal arrangement and people with experience  in elections are well equipped to know some  of the practical problems and how to cope  with them.  There is a move in Congress to pass a. fed eral law relating to reapportioning of Con gressional districts which is done every 10  years only if there ha.s been sufficient change  in population to increase or decrease a state's  representation in the House of Representa tives. It ls not expected that the 1980 census  wm change the number Minnesota is entitled  to have.  In seven months the  legislature wm be  back in session. It should be an important  priority to enact a. law providing for a com mission to reapportion legislative dlstrtcts.e  A  vario~  AMERICA'S ENERGY  FUTURE:  TIME FOR DECISION   ",1979

Indeed, this has been the history  of Federal ~nergy policy at least since the  Arab oil embargo.  Harvey Kapnick, chairman of Arthur  Anderson & Co., offered some perspec tive on this issue in a speech given June  11 at the Finance and Accounting Con ference of the American Petroleum In stitute. While I do not endorse all of the  views expressed, it is a thoughtful, rea soned and comprehensive discussion of  the  issues, and  I  commend  it  to my  colleagues.  M~. President, I ask that Mr. Kap nick s speech be printed in the RECORD.  The speech follows:  AMERICA'S ENERGY F'uTURE: A TIME  FOR DECISION  Energy problems in the United States have  been, and wlll continue to be, critical unless  we as a. nation develop a coordinated na tional energy policy. Since 1973 three Amer ican presidents have stressed our need for a  coordinated  national  energy  policy and.  longer term, for energy independence. Still  we have no energy policy worthy of the name.  As our problems continue to intensify, the  political  rhetoric accelerates. We  a.re  told  that the American oil industry has schemed  to stage ""the biggest ripoff in history"" and  that the industry has excessive profits. We  are told how best to allocate current short  suppliea by government decree.  Meanwhile,  the public protests the high  price of gasoline, which to many typlfles the  entire energy issue. None of this helps solve  the problem of making more energy available  or of developing the needed national energy  policy. In fact, not only have we failed over  the la.st six yea.rs to develop a. coordinated  national energy policy that would lead us  toward a  solution  to our  immediate and  long-term problems, but in many ways we  have  lost ground.

324,House,96,0.425,1122,13,Mr. LOEFFLER.," Mr. Speaker, it has  come to my attention that the adminis tration and the Department of Energy  are attempting an ""end run"" by imple menting and enforcing mandatory build ing  temperature  restrictions  in  early  July.  The  the majority of  intent of  the  Members of Congress  in passing  the  ""standby authority"" provisions of Stand by Conservation Plan No. 2 was that the  President must first find that a ""severe  supply interruption"" exists, or that the  action is necessary to meet our obliga tions under  the  International Energy  Agreement. Neither such condition now  exists.  The Department of Energy and the  administration, in taking such precipi tous actions to implement the standby  authority without showing clear basis  for such action is certainly in violation  of the intent of Congress, and appears  to be  in direct violation of  the terms  of the legislation under the ""severe sup ply  interruption"" or IEA commitment  sections.  While I strongly believe that we are  currently facing a serious energy crisis  in this country, imposing such a manda tory program at this time, and doing so  with clear disregard of congressional in tent, will certainly incur the wrath of  all Americans, work against the purposes  of the program, and will, I believe, be  a waste of the Department's energy.

328,House,96,-0.552,1148,13,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Chair man and members of  the Committee,  there is some likelihood th':l.t efforts will  be made to restrict funding for OSHA  or to limit OSHA's jurisdiction----iwhich'  of course, ought to be out of order. Thi~  exclusion would likely be achieved in one  of  several ways:  first,  limitation  by  number of employees 00, 19)  second  limitation by type of employm~nt <SIC  codes) ; or  third,  limitation by  injury  rates <7/100).  OSHA'S RECORD  Major changes have occurred as a re sult of  administrative  and  legislative  changes within the past several years  Administratively, there has been a com-  prehen,sive effort to eliminate petty rules  and to focus on a ""worst-first"" inspection  priority list. In one case, 400 pages of  standards have been reduced to just 30.  Over 900 rule.s have been eliminated For  small businesses, there have been sp~chl  changes,  including  the elimination of  recordkeeping for businesses employing  10 or fewer. Paperwork and its costs have  be~n cut by as much as 75 percent. Pen alties are not as.sessed for less than seri ous violations when  totaling less  than  $50. At the same time, the focus of in spections has shifted to the more hazard ous areas, and the number of small busi nesses due to be inspected in 1979 is a  reduction of 69 percent.  SMALL BUSINESS EXCLUSION  Despite popular opinion  to  the con tra~y, small businesses are not neces sarily safe place,s to work. Nearly half of  all :workplace injuries occurred in small  b1;lsmesses. Some businesses-metal can mng,  equipment,  and  and  equipment-have  larger mJury /illness rates among small less than 19-employers than for larger  motor. v.eh1cl~s  tran,~portation  businesses. There are over 11 million  workers at over 3 million  job sites at  which 10 or fewer workers are employed.  Those 11 million workers constitute 79  percent of all OSHA covered workers in  about 90 percent of all workplaces.  Between 1973 and 1977,  fatalities  in  workplaces employing 19 or fewer work ers increased by an astounding 88 per cent.  By  contrast,  fatalities  actually de clined in those industries where OSHA  inspections occurred. Dr. Robert Smith  of Cornell University has estimated that  OSHA is responsible for a 16-percent re duction of on-the-job injuries.  INJURY RATES AS BASIS FOR EXCLUSION  The growing concern about environ mentally  induced  illnesses,  especially  cancers, with long latency periods ought  to warn us against basing OSHA exclu sions on today's injury rates. An exclu sion on the basis of 2-digit SIC and 7 per  100 injury rate would leave unregulated  about 22 million exposures to high risk,  carcinogenic substances. Some occupa tionally induced cancers, such as those  attributable to asbestos inhalation, can  take as long as 30 years or more to be come manifest. Yet if based on injury  rates, asbestos workers in 1950 may have  been excluded from OSHA; now we are  told that 67 ,000 people will die annually  from  the  effects  of  asbestos-related  diseases.  If exclusions from OSHA were based  upon injury /illness rates, the following  cancer-prone workers ought well be ex cluded  from  coverage:  coal miners  chemists; textile workers; metal miners;  coke workers;  lead, rubber, leather and  pesticide workers; as well as those en gaged  in oil  and gas extraction and  petroleum and coal production. All of  these industries have been identified as  increasing a worker's likelihood of con tracting cancer.  Focusing on industrywide injury rates  also overlooks the possibility of unsafe  conditions in a particular region or site.  Nor does the injury rate take into ac count the likelihood of injury.  For example, the industrywide injury  rate among grain elevator workers has  not been very high. But, as we learned  tragically in just a matter of days, in juries can and do occur with suddenness  and  in great numbers. Moreover,  the  fiuctuating injury rate from year to year  could wreak havoc with employers, leav ing them unsure whether they were cov ered or not in a particular year.  Excluding from coverage workers  in  3-digit SIC  codes with  injury  rates  under 7 per 100 would, for example, ex clude 15.3 percent of currently covered  workers, or nearly 10 million men and  women in 3 million <72 percent) of the  covered establishments.  Perhaps an injury rate of less  than  7 per 100 seems minuscule to some. Let  us translate it into human, rather than  mathematical terms. Such an exclusion  would exempt trucking <local and long  distance) workers because their injury  rate is just 6.8 per 100 among small (less  than 10)  employers. This would result  in 135,000 workers  losing coverage. It  would also exempt 16,000 oil and gas   workers,  92,000  masons  and  stoneworkers, 14,000 warehouse workers and  tens of thousands more.  It would  exclude  automotive  shop  workers because their injury rate is only  5.4. But that translates into 10,469  in jured, disabled, or killed workers. It ex cludes  13,546  injured  in  eating  and  drinking  stores;  4,700  in  lumber and  building materials;  13,354  in gasoline  dealers <an increasingly hazardous job) ;  9,152 truckers, and tens of thousands of  other  maimed,  injured  or  disabled  workers.  OSHA coverage extends beyond  the  inspection and penalty provisions which  aro usually attacked. Removal of OSHA  coverage would deny  small employers  safety  training  and  educational pro grams; free consultations on how to im prove workplace safety; loans and other  assistance to  improve safety,  including  small business administration loans.  To  assist  small  employers  better,  OSHA has increased matching funds for  consultations from 50 percent to 90 per cent from 1978 to 1979.  Loss of OSHA coverage also would  deny employeesThe right to protection from discrimi nation for exercising rights under the  OSHA Act;  The right to accompany inspectors on  OSHA inspections;  The right to contest the length of time  an employer  takes  to correct a viola tion;  The right to have OSHA investigate  accidents and  fatalities  in  the work place;  The right to complain to OSHA about  hazards in the workplace;  The right to request OSHA to issue a  standard  pertaining  to  a  workplace  hazard;  The right to training and education  programs designed to broaden awareness  of safety and health in the workplace;  The right to access to employers' logs  of occupational  injuries and  illnesses;  and  The right to safe and healthful work ing conditions.  It is important to note that many em ployees in small businesses are not mem bers of unions, and therefore have no  formal means of protesting unsafe or  unhealthy working conditions. Remov ing their appeal to OSHA means that  millions of workers are  totally unpro tected and without any voice to press for  an improvement of hazardous working  conditions.  At a time when. the labor department  reports that the number of job-related  injuries and deaths will increase by 300,000 this year, and that fatalities will in crease by 20 percent-or 5,000 workers  killed-it would be unreasonable to re duce worker  safety protections,  espe cially  in  light of OSHA's continuing  efforts to assist small businesses, reduce  penalties for minor violations, and dras tically  cut down  on  regulations  and  paperwork.  Remember  that  the  percentage  of  ""serious, willful, and repeat violations,""  as a percent of all violations, is about  the same (23-24 percent) for employers  with less than 25, less than 10, and less  than 5; in each category, the percent has  ",1979
329,House,96,0.342,1161,13,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. Chairman,  in   testimony before the House Select Com mittee on Aging we hear much argument  to  the effect  that Congress should do  more for the elderly. From the viewpoint  of various interest groups, it is true that  Federal legislation and funding fail to  address some of the problems that affect  some of the elderly.  On the whole, however, Congress has  shown  itself  to be highly alert to  the  needs of America's senior citizens and is  thoughtfully  generous  in  addressing  those needs. H.R. 4389  testifies  to the  attention and  the concern which  the  elderly enjoy in the particular array of  agencies and programs which this bill  encompasses.  For example, title I of the bill, which  relates to Labor Department programs,  provides funds to promote private sector  job initiatives under CETA. This provi sion  is  related  to  a  section  of  the  Amended Older Americans Act of 1978  which insures that elderly workers will  enjoy the benefits of this program.  Title I also contains a specific provi sion for older Americans' employment  which will enable a 10-percent increase  in the number of subsidized jobs for older  workers.  Under  the HEW  title of  the bill,  $1,366,700,000 is added to the 1979 level  of Federal grants to the States for medic aid. More than $1 billion has been added  to the fiscal year 1979 level for SS! and  other directly funded social security pro grams. In addition, the funding recom mended for the Administration on Aging,  which deals exclusively in programs for  the elderly, is $626 million or $117 mil lion above currently available funds.  The ACTION older American volun teer programs, which include the retired  senior  volunteer program,  the  foster  grandparents program and  the senior  companions program, are increased tin der this bill by $213 million to approxi mately 150 percent of the fiscal year 1979  level.  The programs I have mentioned are  those which provide direct and measur able assistance to older Americans. How ever, the elderly will also receive direct  and highly beneficial rewards from very  substantial increases in federally funded  health care and health research.  As we look down the list of measures  covered by this bill, we find that more  line items are concerned with the elderly  than with any other segment of our so ciety. Yet it has been hardly more than  15 years ago that the only item in such  a list which applied solely to the elderly  was social security. We have come a long  way in a short time. I think the Congress  can be proud of itself in this area and  I think that America's elderly should be  proud of their Congress.   ",1979

Although  these  changes allowed many elderly persons to  to participate for  the first  time,  there  were some unintended consequences. In  the attempt to simplify the program, a  series of eight itemized deductions were  reduced to three:  First, a monthly standard deduction  which is presently $65 per household:  Second, 20 percent of all earned in come; and  Third, shelter payments if the month ly  amount exceeds 50 percent of  the  household's income after all other de ductions have been subtracted, and can not exceed $80.  The 1977 Food Stamp Act eliminated  the previous deductions for medical costs  in excess of $10 per month and shelter  costs in excess of 30 percent of the house hold's income. It was the elimination of  medical expenses and the recalculation  of household expenses, two areas under going spiraling inflation, that caused the  termination or reduction of benefits to  many elderly, blind and disabled people.  r believe that H.R. 4303 will correct  2 The word ""Catholic"" can be substituted  with Methodist, Baptist, Jew or whatever  denomination is required.

345,,96,0.425,1265,13,Mr. LOEFFLER.," Mr. Speaker, earlier  today, I  spoke on  the floor about the  fact that the administration and the De partment of Energy are attempting an  end run by  implementing and enf orc ing mandatory building temperature re strictions in early July.  While I strongly believe that we are  currently facing a serious energy crisis  in this country, imposing such a man datory program at this time, and doing  so with clear disregard of congressional  intent, will certainly incur the wrath of  all Americans, work against the purposes  of the program, and will, I believe, be a  waste of the Department's energy,  I would  like  to make a part of the  RECORD  a  letter which I have sent  to  Secretary  Schlesinger  regarding  this  matter, along with a statement made by  one of my constituents, Craig Johnson  of San Antonio, Tex., which I feel would  reflect the thoughts of a great number  of Americans should this plan be  im plemented:  TOM LOEFFLER,  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, D.C., June 22, 1979.  Hon. JAMES R. SCHLESINGER,  Secretary of Energy,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR MR. SECRETARY: It has come to my at tention  that  the Administration and  the  Department of Energy are intent upon im plementing and enforcing mandatory build ing temperature restrictions on or about the  first of July. The implementation of these  regulations,  ""approved""  by  Congress  as  Standby Conservation Plan No.  2  solely  through swift parliamentary maneuvering in  the House, will impact on virtually all Amer icans. I strongly feel that the American pub lic will not take kindly to its provisions as  they now stand.  Through the enactment of the Energy Pol icy and Conservation Act  (EPCA), Congress  recognized that this country faces the grow ing challenge. of meeting our energy needs  without depending on vulnerable  foreign  imports. Today, we have no guarantee that  supplies of critical fuel will not be interCXXV--1076-Pa.rt 13  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  is  rupted by one crisis or another occurring in  an area of the world which has been in tur moil for half a century, and where more than  50 %  of  the world's oil  travels  through a  narrow strait which can be totally blocked  off by the most primitive of techniques.  The plan,  therefore,  laudable  in  its  intent. However, in authorizing the develop ment  of  standby  conservation measures,  Congress stipulated that the President must  find that a ""severe energy supply interrup tion"" exists or that the plans are necessary  to meet our obligations under  the  Inter national Energy Agreement. While supplies  of crude oil are presently ""tight"" to quote  an ongoing DOE assessment of the situation,  the current shortfall  is nowhere near  the  12 to 15 percent claimed as the ""trigger level""  by DOE during testimony before the Energy  and Power Subcommittee. Further, President  Carter has stated publicly that the United  States has already met its obligations to re duce consumption by 5 percent, as agreed  to by  the member nations of  the  IEA.  I,  therefore, question the need  to implement  such a mandatory plan at all.  With regard to the specifics of the building  temperature plan, it is patently unnecessary.  According to the General Accounting Office,  DOE intends to rely almost entirely on vol untary conservation, but the American tax payers will still be billed $8.1 million in ad ministrative costs. Further, DOE's presump tions of energy savings, up to 300,000 barrels  per day of oil, assume 100 percent compli ance. This assumption is wholly unrealistic  itself,  not  including  the  fact  that DOE  would assign only ""three to five agents"" per  state to enforce the plan, which would lead  to inequitable and selective enforcement at  best.  Another factor which DOE  largely over looked  in  its assessment of energy savings  was that less than 20 percent of the elec tricity generated  in  the United States  is  currently oil-fired. Texas, for  instance, has  already greatly reduced  its dependence on  oil  to produce electricity  in the last year,  doubling its output of power from coal and  hydropower plants while reducing industrial  oil use by more than 50 percent.1  Considering the current energy situation,  I believe that we should ask for and expect  both businesses and in di vi duals to seek re ductions  in energy use. However,  to  think  that you can take several million buildings  and say that all  temperatures must be at  ""x"" degrees is ridiculous.  If DOE is earnestly seeking a plan which  will  effect  employment  to  the minimum  degree through a program which is easier and  less costly to administer, I believe there are  other, more practical steps which should be  taken. First, it is imperative that this Ad ministration must convince  the American  people that there is a true need to conserve  energy-and, while I certainly believe that  we are experiencing an energy  ""crisis"",  I  know from 11he  constituent mail  I  receive  and through talks with others that there is  broadbased disbelief in this concept which  must be overcome. Secondly, once a need to  conserve  is  realized by  the public,  I have  faith in the patriotic instincts of Americans  to do the things which must be done to solve  the problem. A voluntary program adminis tered by State and local governments, such  as that now being implemented in Texas, will  assure  far greater compliance and acihieve  much greater savings than any Federal man date.  Imposing  a mandatory program at  this  time, and doing so in a manner which is at  best taking advantage of a  technical ""loop hole"", will certainly incur the wrath of all  Americans, work against the purposes of the  1 ""Energy Data Reports"" DOE/EIA-0034/  11(78)  17107  program, and will, in essence, waste the De partment's energy.  Thank you for the opportunity to express  my views on this important issue.  With best regards.  Sincerely,  TOM LOEFFLER,  Member of Congress.  STATEMENT OF MR. CRAIG  JOHNSON OF SAN  ANrONIO DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY HEARING,  DALLAS, TEXAS, JUNE 18, 1979  Thank you!!  My name  is Craig Johnson and  I  have  come from San A,ntonio to express my per sonal  views  concerning  the  ""Emergency  Building Temperature Restrictions"" as pro posed by the Department of Energy.  First a few facts:  The Government Accounting Office  has  gone on record as saying that this proposal  is ""a token effort at best,"" and has harshly  criticized DOE's estimated savings, even a.t  100 percent compliance, as wholly unrealistic.  Further, Federal Judges Edwin Menchan  of Albuquerque, N.M.  and  Joe Fisher of  Beaumont, TX have already threatened to  adjourn their respective courts for the sum mer if indeed such a proposal becomes fact.  Judge Fisher went on to describe the pro posed 80 degree summer minimum as, and  I quote, ""insufferable"".  Lastly,  the Minority View of  the House  Committee on Interstate and Foreign Com merce has described this plan as being, and  I  quote  ""unnecessary,  unenforceable  and  therefore an untenable expense to taxpay ers.""  Ladies and gentlemen,  I  submit  to you  that  your  proposed  energy  conservation  measures  in  this  area  a.re  ill-conceived,  . poorly designed and basically without sound  foundation as to any realistic savings goal.  In the discussion of the proposed regula tions, as presented in the Federal Register  of June 1,  1979, not once did DOE offer  any concrete estimate of the savings to be  realized. It did however state, and again I  quote, ""we believe that the regulations will  be sufficient  to reduce  the nwtional HVAC  energy consumption by as much as 10 per cent, although no such goal was established.""  Further, you go on to state that, ""the objec tive  is to minimize the HVAC energy con sumption with the constraint of keeping the  occupant in a workable environment.""  In face of such total lack of documenta tion and projected savings goals, why would  DOE even think that the American people  would willingly participate in such a pro gram? After watching the DOE:  1. Pump miltions of gallons of reserve crude  oil  into  salt  domes with  no means  of  recovery;  2. Cut off a vast source of crude oil  Mexico because of its inept management;  3. Create an artificial shortage at the fuel  pumps by interfering in the normal distribu tion process; and  4. Reverse its position numerous times on  numerous direCJtives.  I cannot help but believe that you do not  have any coherent energy plan whatsoever.  You are trying  to manage a  shortfall of  supply, whether real or conceived, instead of  developing  a  long-range plan of  increased  self-sufficiency and conservation.  You continue to propose stop-gap regula tions that do not fit any understandable and  comprehensive energy po1icy, although ap parently you believe you do have one. Al though Congress and  the President must  share the responsibility for this absence of  a  long-range policy on energy, you are the  ones  to whom  I  speak  today, because you  are the ones who propose, write and imple ment specific policy and it is you who will  be responsible for the consequences of your  directives.  A few more facts:  in  ",1979

348,House,96,-0.246,1291,13,Mr. HOLLAND.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the chairman of the committee  for yielding me this limited time.  I do not make many speeches in the  House, so I wish all the Members would  listen to this one. Most people pay large  honorariums  to hear  them,  and  the  Members are getting this one free.  I may be the only expert on this issue  who has not had something to say about  it. All through our committee delibera tions I only listened and voted.  I  think my good friend,  the gentle man from Louisiana (Mr. MOORE) has a  good point when he attacks the fact, the  real fact, that this piece of legislation is  not going to create any energy. I think we  should have heard thait for the last time  today, because it is the truth. The Com mittee on Ways and Means was not de signed to create any energy.  This tax is a response to the outcry of  the past 2 or 3 years from the oil indus try for decontrol. We acted. Then the  President acted to allow the one thing  we have been told would create energy decontrol.  There was a huge hue and cry by the  interests of my good friends from the  Northeast and by so-called consumer rep resentatives around here  that  the oil  companies were going to get big windfall  profits, and so the Committee on Ways  and Means in its wisdom and through the  procedures of this House was called upon  to tax, to do something about what was  about to be a huge consumer ripoff and  to recapture some of that money for the  Treasury of the United States.  That is why we are here. The question  is not whether or not the gentleman from  Louisiana <Mr. MOORE)  is going to have a  windfall pro:fi ts tax. The Members know  that as well as I. I think it is astounding  that he is here today asking for only a  60-percent  tax. The committee said it  should be 70 percent. and some others  said 85 percent. I think the other body  will get it back more in the area the gen tleman  is  talking about before we are  through.  So the issue today is not creation of  energy. We are responding to something  we were told would create energy, and  that is decontrol. I support decontrol. I  also support the fact that the Treasury  of this country and the people should be  the beneficiaries of at least part of the  vast unearned profit that is going to de rive from that decontrol.  How much should it be? That has been  the question asked by the committee that  struggled with this. Seventy percent to  me is about right. That leaves 30 percent  of literally billions of dollars of unearned  money around. That is a benefit of de control that is going to solve our energy  ",1979
349,House,96,0.523,1304,13,Mr. CHENEY.," I thank the gentleman  and I rise in opposition to the Ways and  Means Committee bill.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  H.R. 3919, the Crude Oil Windfall Profit  Tax Act of 1979.  All of us know the public distrusts the  oil industry. All of us also know that the  public distrusts the Government. I think  the public is tired of being mislead. We  ought not to tell our citizens we are pro tecting their interests when we are not.  All of the consumer rhetoric in the world  will not conceal the fact that this bill,  which is not even honestly tilted, serves  the interests of the Government, and of  the OPEC cartel.  This legislation will harm American  national  security. There  is  today no  more critical aspect of our foreign policy  than  insuring the security of our na tional energy supplies. The administra tion appeared belatedly to recognize this  fact when it proposed the decontrol of  domestic crude oil in order to stimulate  domestic production. But H.R. 3919 will  eliminate most of  the production  in crease which would have flowed  from  decontrol of prices, and thus maintain  our dependence on imported crude oil.  In case it has not come to the attention  of the supporters of this bill, I will note  that our imported oil comes from some  of the most politically unstable areas on  the face of the Earth. Those who abhor  American military  involvement abroad  would do well to consider whether this  legislation  increases or dec!'eases  the  chances for such involvement.  This  legislation will  dampen  the  growth of our economy and injure com petition. By shifting revenues away from  the private sector to a Government trust  fund,  this bill promises  to further in volve a clearly incompetent Government  bureaucracy in the field of energy pro duction. By forcing small energy pro ducers to bear the burden of the tax,  this  legislation will  likely  increase the  market power and dominance of  the  major oil companies.  This legislation is unfair. It is unfair  to  the consumer,  since  the consumer  ought to get additional supplies of en ergy in return for paying higher prices  for energy. It is unfair to the investor  who had the foresight to invest in energy  production.  This legislation fails all the basic tests  of good  legislation. This bill promises  a painless solution to a pressing prob lem. This bill is designed to buy off peo ple who believe price controls should  never have been taken off in the first  place. The fact of the matter is that the  intellectual justification for this bill  is  precisely  the same as  the  intellectual  justification for price controls.  The public should know that people  who vote for this bill are voting for con tinued Government control of the energy  industry,  even  though  the history of  Government control  is  the history of  shortages.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to  vote down this legislation, which is so  clearly detrimental to American foreign  and domestic interests.  ",1979

368,,96,0.12,1434,13,Mr. PURSELL.," Mr. Speaker, earlier  this month, during consideration of the  proposed Department of Education bill,  I spoke out on the importance of em phasizing  the  training aspects of  the  Comprehensive Employment and Train ing Act <CETA). CETA's long-term ob jective should always be preparation of  participants for lasting, meaningful and  productive jobs.  Today. I would  like to speak briefly  about the employment side of CETA and  more specifically about the type of job a  participant holds while  receiving  the  needed training for a more permanent  position.  Because most jobs are found in the  private sector, the most significant way  to make progress against unemployment  is to increase employment opportunities  in private industry for the jobless and  economically disadvantaged. In recogni tion of this, the CETA Amendments of  1978 <Public Law 95-524) established the  private sector initiative program  (title  VID under which prime sponsors must  set up private industry councils <PIC's)  to encourage private sector participa tions in CETA programs.  Prime sponsors responded quickly by  establishing over 160 such PIC's, while  another 200 to 250 are expected to be set  up before the end of the month. This ac tion to get the program underway was  funded through the reprograming of $75  million in existing fiscal year 1979 funds.  Meanwhile, the Department of Labor has  requested a funding level of $325 million  for fiscal year 1980. The House Appro priations Committee and its Labor /HEW  Subcommittee has approved this request  and it is included in the bill before us  today.  During House consideration last year  of what is now Public Law 95-524, there  was so much criticism directed toward  CETA that the legislation was pulled otI  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the floor and delayed for several weeks.  The  final  result was a bill extending  CETA for another 4 years, while incor porating extensive changes aided at ad dressing the criticisms voiced during that  intensive period of debate.  One of the changes that should be to  the liking of both CETA supporters and  its critics is the new private sector initia tive program (PSIPJ. For supporters, it  is a  logical extension of  the original  CETA program; and for critics, it otters  a chance to turn the program around  and shift emphasis from public to pri vate employment.  Meanwhile, not only have prime spon sors responded quickly in the establish ment of PIC's, but the business commu nity has shown a great deal of interest  in the program and employers through out the country are working hard to be  cooperative in these et!orts. In fact, my  om.ce has received more contacts indi cating support for the proposed appro priation from various chambers of com merces and other business associations  than from any other segment-public or  private.  This enthusiasm and active participa tion is essential if the focus of CETA is  to be directed toward the private sector.  As a recent Department of Labor white  paper pointed out:  Four out of every five jobs in the American  economy are in the private sector. Employer  involvement can assure  that new workers  are  trained  to meet  the  requirements of  available entry level  jobs, and the current  workers can upgrade their skills to fill ex panding opportunities for higher skllled and  supervisory workers. Private employers can  supply managerial and  supervisory  talent  not available in the public sector, assuring  that these programs produce graduates with  the type of training and discipline suitable  for regular jobs. Access to employer facillties  and equipment can improve the quality of  training programs and provide work experi ence in a  realistic setting.  Most  importantly,  individual  employers  can play an essential intermedhry role be tween government and  the private sector.  On the one hand, they can effectively con vince  their  counterparts  in  the  business  community that government programs serve  their needs. On the other hand, they can in form program operators of  the needs and  problems of private employers, and assure  that programs are designed to meet  these  needs.  If these benefits are to be achieved,  the momentum that has been built up  over the last few months must be main tained. The PSIP program was designed  as a $400 million program for the up coming fiscal year and DOL maintains  that its $325 million request is a mini mum  figure. Reductions would  have  grave consequences for  the success of  the program and its credibility with the  business community, which traditionally  plans on more  than  a  1-year basis.  Furthermore,  legislative  and  design  changes would be required if much less  than full funding were provided.  For  these  reasons  and others,  the  Labor /HEW Subcommittee, on which I  serve, and the full Appropriations Com mittee have overwhelmingly approved  DOL's $325 million request. I want to  take this opportunity  to strongly urge  my colleagues  to support this funding  June 28, 1979  level and take a giant stride toward the  goal of lasting, meaningful employment  for any American who wants to work.   SANCTIONS AGAINST AID TO  VIETNAM  HON. VIRGINIA SMITH  OF NEBRASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1979  ",1979
369,,96,0.238,1434,13,Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like to call to the attention of  my colleagues a letter and news item I  have just received from my friend, the  gentleman from Florida <Mr. YouNG). As  the ranking minority member of the Ap propriations Subcommittee on Foreign  Operations, BILL has done a remarkable  job of uncovering waste and ripoffs in  our foreign aid programs. Beyond  the  abuses, he has spent a great deal of time  informing the Congress of examples of  U.S. tax dollars going to countries whose  policies are repugnant to the people of  the United States. Countries like Viet nam.  Two and a half years ago BILL tried to  prohibit any U.S. dollars from going to  Vietnam directly or indirectly. While he  was successful in prohibiting aid to Viet nam directly, his prohibition on indirect  aid was not agreed  to in the Senate House Conference Committee. He  tried  again last year and he will probably try  again this year. Each time the adminis tration has fought his attempts with a  big lobbying campaign. They pulled out  all the stops. Members were lobbied by  the Cabinet, the leadership, and virtually  every special interest in town from the  chamber of commerce to the League of  Women Voters.  As a result, Vietnam enjoys the world  status of being an indirect recipient of  U.S.  foreign aid and,  in fact,  receives  assistance from many other nations as  well. How has Vietnam repaid the world's  generosity? By  invading  its neighbor  with military troops and by pushing hun dreds of thousands of its own people into  refugee camps for the rest of the world  to care for. They have also created the  tragedy of those human beings we have  come to identify as the boat people, hu mans risking their lives at sea in crowded  leaky boats with no destination in sight.  Now according to the Washington Post  the  administration  seemingly  admits  that BILL YOUNG was right in the first  place. The Post quotes an administration  official as saying that ""nothing short of  aid sanctions will persuade the Vietnam ese to treat their people more kindly.""  That is the same thing BILL YOUNG has  been saying all along. Why reward the  barbaric actions of a nation with mil lions in foreign aid?  My  constituents do not want  their  hard-earned tax dollars going to Viet nam any more than the constituents in  any other district in the Nation. BILL has  led the fight to stop this ridiculous ex penditure and I want to commend him  for his work in that effort. If we had tak en his advice  in  the  first place, who  ",1979
370,,96,-0.153,1447,13,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker, on July 7,  1979  the residents of Barnegat Light  will 'celebrate the 75th anniversary of  the  incorporation of  their community  into  a  borough. The  rich history of  Barnegat Light can be traced all the way  back to 1609, when the explorer, Henry  Hudson, sailed up  the Jersey shore in  his vessel, the Half Moon.  Hudson discovered an inlet along the  shore which he named Barendegat, and  noted in his ship's log that this was ""a  faire place to fall in with."" The inlet,  and the town which grew up across the  bay, still bear an almost identical name  today.  The first settlers appeared in Barnegat  between 1700 and 1720, and erected their  homes upland, near the meadows. Prior  to this, Indians had inhabited the area  in the summertime, when they clammed  on the beaches to stock up their supplies  for  the coming winter. New England  whalers had used Barnegat as a way  station and  lookout point  for many  years.  As early as  the Revolutionary War,  the inhabitants of Barnegat were noted  for their seamanship. Barnegat trading  vessels sailed to New York with cargoes  of  ceder  rails and pine wood. When,  years later, the supply of pine wood be gan to fail, the seamen turned their at tention to the charcoal trade. Next, the  seamen would  turn  into  traders, and  would employ their ship.s in the trans portation of freight from New York and  New England to Virginia and on South  to Florida. By the Civil War, when this  trade was at its height, the vast majority  of Barnegat's inhabitants were either  masters of vessels, or sailors and mates  of others' ships.  In 1834, the U.S. Congress authorized  the erection of a lighthouse at the north  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  end of Long Beach, and appropriated  $6 000  for  that purpose. The original  lighthouse was washed into the sea in  1857. The present Barnegat Lighthouse,  which  is  the second  tallest  lighthouse  tower in the United States, was commis sioned  in  January of 1859,  and has  served faithfully for over 100 years illu minating the New Jersey coast. This has  enabled vessels  to navigate  the area  safely and enter into the inlet for pro tection during periods of storm. In 1950,  the  lighthouse was purchased by  the  State of New Jersey and has since been  proclaimed an historic  landmark and  State park.  Today the borough of Barnegat Light  is the ""tilefish capital of the world."" In  1978, approximately 5 million pounds of  tilefish were captured in this region. The  fishing industry is still an intricate part  of Barnegat's economy. Almost 25 per cent of the permanent residents of the  area are employed in some aspect of this  industry, in the capacity of commercial  fishermen, charter boat men, dock crews,  and shippers.  Let me take this opportunity to con gratulate the residents of the borough of  Barnegat Light and join them in cele brating this glorious anniversary. Barne gat Light  is  truly, as Henry Hudson  stated, ""a faire place to fall in with,""  and I am grateful to have the opportu nity to call the history of this region to  your attention today.   COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY FARM  BILL  HON. TOM HAGEDORN  OF MINNESOTA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1979  e ",1979
371,,96,0.308,1447,13,Mr. HAGEDORN.," Mr. Speaker,  the  warm summer weather here in Wash ington is a welcome relief from the rigors  of what was an unusually harsh winter  for  this area. During this past winter  season, official Washington had more  than snow and cold to deal with as there  were  thousands of  farmers who came  here to lobby on behalf of higher prices  for their farm products so they will be  able to save their investments in land,  equipment, and buildings.  The underlying  theme of  their plea  for higher prices wa.s  the need to save  the family farm. There was no evidence  of  representatives of large agricultural  corporations or large farm owners being  here to plead for higher prices. Due to  the mas.sive size of 'those types of op erations,  those particular owners and  operators  do not  face  the  financial  problems that the smaller owners do. The  individuals who came to Washington in  January and February represented what  is becoming a  rapidly vanishing breed  of  rugged Americans who  truly care  about their work and are willing to put  up with a multitude of probleIIl.3 and  uncertainty because of their concern for  the land and the food and fiber produc tion that is absolutely vital to the future  of our Nation.  17289  t?e  I am a  farmer from southern Min nesota and although I am privileged to  represent  the  citizens of  .the  sec:ond  Congressional District here m Washmg ton  I still return to my farm to plant,  cultivate, and harvest certain crops. My  father farmed this land and I pur~hased  it from hlm to keep it in the family and  because of my love for this type of work.  Because of my close  involvement with  the concept of family  farming,  I per sonally realize the value and benefi~ that  this  institution has  for our Nation.  The future of the family farm must  concern  every Member  of  Congress  whether he represents a rural o~ urban  area. Family farms cannot contmue to  operate at a  luSS or on a break-even  basis they must operate at a p!'ofit or  else iarge corporations wil: buy up the  farms  and  could  conceivably  gain  a  monopoly over the supply o_f fo.od. ~on­ sumers in the cities are faced with high er  food  costs every week  and  if  family farm becomes extinct, the price  of food would be even higher. Without  the farm as a source of employment and  income, many rural citiz~ns would be  forced to move into the city and would  contribute to the already crowded conditions there.  .  To help insure the future of the f arruly  farm, I have today introduc~d a compre hensive bill designed to assi~t o~r farm  families in being able to mamtam their  possession of our most valuable natu.ral  resource--productive  farmland  bemg  worked by those who love it.  .  .  The bill deals with four prmcipal sub jects. The first subject concei:is changes  in the estate and gift tax marital deduc tions. Before  the passage. of  the Tax  Reform Act of 1976, increasmg land costs  and capital  requirements  for modern  farming,  infiation, and estate tax pro visions  that have been unchan?ed for  more  than 30 years had combmed  to  impede  the  intergenerational  transfer  of family farms. The 1976 act brought  changes in taxes f o: spouse_s to help meet  the problems associated with the transfer of farms to spouses.  .  The previous marital deduction w~s  half of the adjusted gross estate. This  was increased to the larger of $250,000 or  half of  the decedent's a~juste~ . gross  estate. This is, of course, ii;i addition to  the usual  tax credit available  to  all  estates, but it is limited to. the a:mount  the  spouse  actually  receives  if  the  marital deduction  bequest. There was al~o a special mari tal  deduction  for  gifts-a  complete,  unlimited deduction for the first $.100,000  in lifetime  transfers, no deduction for  the next  $100,000  and  a  50-percent  deduction for all subsequent gifts.  A new rule was also passed ~or the  determination  of  estate  taxatio_n  of  property held in joint tenancy. Pnor to  the 1976 act, farm widows felt they were  bearing an unnecessarily large share of  the  tax  load.  They  claimed  that,  although  the  estate  tax  had  been  intended as a  tax on intergenerational  transfers, high  farm values, outdated  . exemption limits for interspousal trans fers  and the method of governing the  attribution of  ownership  of property  held in joint tenancy for estate tax purlarger ~han t~e  is  ",1979
372,,96,0.303,1460,13,Mr. BAFALIS.," Mr. Speaker, last night  a historic event occurred in the House of  Representatives-the discharge petition  was successfully used as a means of re leasing important legislation from  the  grip of an unresponsive committee.  Discharge Petition No. 1 received its  218th signature last night. This releases  House  Joint Resolution  74  from  the  Committee on the Judiciary and clears it  for House consideration on July 23.  This  is only  the  third  time in  this  decade that  the discharge petition has  been used successfully in the House. In  1970,  the equal rights amendment was  brought to a vote in the House. In 1971,  a  contitutional  amendv:ient  allow  prayers in public schools was released  from committee and brought to a vote.  And now, in 1979, the way is cleared for  a House vote on a constitutional amend ment  to  preserve  the  neighborhood  school.  In fact,  in reviewing  the history of  the discharge petition, it is significant to  note that since the present House rule  was adopted in 1935, only 22 bills have  been brought to a floor vote through this  vehicle.  Congressman MOTTL and I joined ef forts to secure necessary signatures on  Discharge Petition No. 1 because we did  not feel it was right for committee and  subcommittee chairmen  to  ignore  the  concerns of the American people.  Busing has long been a matter of con cern in this country. Studies have shown  that the efforts of the last two decades  to enforce arbitrary racial quotas in the  classrooms across this country have not  improved  the quality of education. In  fact, test scores are on the wane and the  feeling  of  ""community""  in our  local  school systems subject to busing is com pletely lost.  Year after year we have tried to se cure hearings on this issue-a forum for  the people to express their concerns and  desires to their Representatives.  But, year after year, the leadership of  the House Judiciary Committee turned  a deaf ear on our pleas and pigeonholed  this issue.  Well, the will of the majority cannot  be thwarted forever. The matter of pres ervation of neighborhood schools will be  brought to a vote in the House on July  23.  The successful use of  the discharge  petition is the action of the U.S. House  of Representatives at its best. The will of  the people has come to the halls of Con gress.  While it is a shame we could not get  the response necessary from  the com",1979

To have been selected for this award is  without doubt, a definite reflection of  outstanding unity, leadership, and devo tion to duty demonstrated by each mem ber of the 63d SPS. These men have dis tinguished  themselves as  true profes sionals.  Recognition for this accomplishment  must also be given to Lt. Col. Frederick  Nowak, the Commander of the 63d SPS  and  to Col.  Reginald W.  Shaleski,  Commander of Norton Air Force Base.  In addition to taking pride and pleas ure in this unit and its accomplishment  it is assuring to know that competenc~  and  excellence  in  the Air Force  is  stre~~ed and rewarded. This type of rec ognition is, I am sure, a stimulous to per form to the best of one's capacity and  one method by which to keep our country  militarily prepared.  Again, it is a privilege to personally  commend the members of this squadron  for their dedicated service.~  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ACTION NEEDED ON NICARAGUA  NOW MR. PRESIDENT  HON. LARRY McDONALD  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1979   Mr. McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, time is  becoming a woefully short commodity in  Nicaragua. On previous occasions, some  of us here  in  the Congress have at tempted to get the President to see this  situation more clearly. In this connec tion  see pages  15831,  June 20, CON GRESSIONAL RECORD, and 15124, June 15,  1979,  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD. At  this  point I would like to place in the CON GRESSIONAL RECORD a letter on the situa tion in Nicaragua that w111 be delivered  to the White House today.  The text of the letter follows:  CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,  House of Representatives,  Washington, D.C., June 28, 1979.  THE PRESmENT,  The White House,  Washington, D.C.  large  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: The crisis in Nicara gua ls now most grave. lt has been over two  weeks since a  large body or  the Congress  wrote to you, urging that you take action to  stop the fiow of arms to the revolutionary  insurgents called the ""Sandlnlstas.""  Indeed,  .the letter signed by a group of  dlstlnguJshed Senators  asked  the pointed  question as to whether or not it was the  policy of our Government to give support to  the Communists in Nicaragua.  Since the sending of those letters, the situ ation in Nicaragua has worsened and ls now  critical; and in part this ls due to your action  in having Secretary ot State Vance withdraw  American support tor the legal elected gov ernment of Nicaragua. at the Organlza.tlon of  American States meeting, and your inaction  in not taking steps to stop the arms fiow to  the revolutionaries.  Mr. President, concern centers on a  number or key areas:  ( 1) Your ""Human Rights"" program has  untor.tunately caused many to view our for eign policy as ""slapping our friends and kiss ing our enemies."" Particularly in Nicaragua,  ""Human Rights"" does not include the ""right""  to  riot, kUl and destroy with  the aim of  establishing a  totalltarian Marxist state.  And yet,  the Marxist Sandlnistas have  commenced such actions in a manner omi nously reminiscent ot the kangaroo courts ot  revolutionary Iran. The London Dally Tele graph has reported a. Sandinista. communi que announcing the killing of six persons tor  the ""crime"" of supporting the legal govern ment. These victims were a customs omctal,  his  son,  a  bodyguard,  two alleged police  agents, and a pro-government  radio com mentator; and the New York Times reports  ""revenge"" k1111ngs by Sandlnistas of at least  three Deputies. Also brutally kllled by the  Sandlnlstas was Pedro Espinoza, a distin guished writer tor Novedades; his death went  u:qmarked by the State Department.  Mr. President, as you must know, when  an American newsman was shockingly k1lled  by a National Guardsman, the legal govern ment arrested the Guardsman and are hold ing him tor court-martial according to the  18/W. The contrast between the Sandinista  executions for ""thought-crime"" and the due  process of law c.arrted out by the government  headed by President Somoza even under the  most dlfticult circumstances  indicates  the  rule of law under President Somoza versus  the barba.rtc terror under the Sandlnistas.  17315  (4)  (7)  (2) The governments ot Costa Rica and  Panama have knowingly allowed their sov ereign  territory to be used as supply an<1  staging areas tor the current Sandinista in vasion. This dangerous and irresponsible ac tion threatens the stab111ty of the Western  Hemisphere. Your omcl.al policy ls sllence.  (3) The  international brigades assisting  the Sandinlstas, openly referred to by their  Panama.nian  leader, Hugo  Spadafora.,  as  ""Communist  International Brigades"",  are  made up of hard core revolutionaries trom  numerous Latin American  countries and  Europe.  Increasingly  there  ls  evidence of  weapons coming from Cuba, Venezuela and  lllegally, from the United States. Your omclal  policy appears to be one of lndltference.  So-cal1ed ""Third F'<lrce"" alterna.tlves  have been disastrous in Vletna.m, Guyana,  and Iran. Our Department of State ls pro moting this concept and calllng for a coaU tlon with ""all parties concerned"", including  the Ouba.n-oontrolled Sandlnistas.  (5) Your Department of State ls promot ing the so-called ""Third Force"" alternative,  attempting to deal with a ""National Recon struction Government  which consists, by  their own admission, of Daniel Ortega and  Moises Hassan, armed Sandinista guerrlllas,  Violeta Chamorro, a middle-aged housewife,  Alfonso Rdbelo, a  frightened ""liberal"", and  Sergio Ramirez, whose sons are Communist  guerrillas. It ls clear that such a group wm  be dominated by its armed element.  (6) The !a.ct that several hundred CUban  troops a.re now in Costa Rica, having arrived  by way ot Panama, has been confirmed by  the State Department, but only .after this  tact became a matter ot common discussion  in the Painam&nla.n press, and several months  after they had become aware of the facts.  Instead, your government demands  that the legally-elected President of Nicara gua abandon his omce and his country to  Communist-dominated  invaders.  Mr. President, we do not wish  to  see  another American  foreign policy blunder.  The people of our country have witnessed the  steady retree. t ot freedom 1n East Europe,  China, Asla., Cuba, Africa and the Middle  East. Are Nicaragua and Central America  to be next? Is it the policy olf the United  States Government  to  collaborate  in  re newed Castroite adventurism in Latin Amer ica? Do we indeed prefer Nicaragua as a oas trolte base in Central America, from which  the Communists can move northward against  other small nations?  We respectfully urge you to take the fol lowing steps:  (a) By diploma.tic or other means, cut off  the  fiow o! we.a.pons and supplies  to  the  revolutionaries through Panama a.nd Costa  Rica.  (b) By every honoraJble representation in  the Orga.nlzatlon or American States, urge  a  ce.ase-fire  in Nicaragua and gain hemi spheric support  tar halting the spread o:t  revolution  and  terrorism.  Specifically, we  urge you to take the necessary steps to ter minate the protected sanctuaries used bY  the terrorists in Costa Rica, and their sup port tram Cuba.  (c) We urge support tor the elected gov ernment of Nicaragua. Specifically, we do not  support the imposition or an imposed gov ernment coalition that would include total1ta.rtan Marxists Who  reject  the  electoral  process.  (d) We urge the resumption of a.rms shLp ments under the Foreign M111tary Sales Pro gram to the Government of Nicaragua.  Finally, Mr. President, we urge you to act  in a resolute manner. The sa.nds of time are  running out !'Or liberty and representative  government  in Nica.ragua.

379,Senate,96,0.575,120,18,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President, the issue  of foreign investment in U.S. real estate  has troubled Congress for the past several  years. We know that foreign investment  in the United States is on the increase,  but until recently many questions regard ing the extent and nature of foreign in vestment in the United States have re mained unexplored. One of  the more  troublesome aspects of the foreign invest ment issue are the tax code and tax trea ty provisions  that allow  foreign  inves tors to escape paying capital gains taxa tion on the sale of farmland and other  forms of real estate. The problem posed  by this exclusive tax advantage is that  the tax break prevents our own farmers  and investors from competing effectively  in bidding for farmland.  At the request of Senator TALMADGE,  chairman of the Senate Agriculture Com mittee, the General Accounting Office has  recently published a report shedding ad ditional light on the question of foreign  ",1979
380,,96,-0.443,146,18,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, over 4  years ago, the Securities and Exchange  Oommission  administratively  ""deregu lated"" the commissions charged by stock brokers. Previously, brokerage fees hap  been set by the exchanges, and !brokers  were thus able to ""fix"" their fees at a  uniformly high rate.  At the time the Antitrust and Monop oly Subcommittee began its investigation  of ratemaking practices in the regulated  trucking industry, in late 1977, trucking  industry  spokesman cited  the alleged  ""chaos"" in the securities industry which  resulted from deregulation. That situ ation,  they said, would occur in their  own industry if trucking firms were sim ilarly for bidden to fix prices. Upon closer  examination, however, the ""chaos"" they  saw turns out to be nothin~ more than  -normal price competition in a free mar ketplace. Unlike the situation that ex isted when  commissions were  fixed,  brokerage fees now more fairly refiect  the actual services provided by brokers.  The salutary effects of deregulation  have been amply documented. Between  1975 and 1978, commission rates plum meted by an average of 16 percent for  individual purchasers and 48 percent for  institutions. ""Discount brokers"" entered  the market and now charge rates as  much as 50 percent below the old :fixed  rates, providing low-cost service for cus tomers who desire fewer services. Cus tomers, for the first time, can select an  appropriate rate and level of service from  a variety offered by different brokerage  houses.  The end of regulatoo commission rates  also caused chan'ges in the membership  l'..>f the New York St-ock Exchange, as well  as a drive for increased efficiency within  firms in the market. By 1978, 93 firms  had exited the exchange, 24 of which re mained members of the National Asso ciation of Securities Dealers. and 62 new  firms joined the exchange.  A  recent article  in  the Washington  Post by the senior vice president of Bat terymarch Financial Management Cor poration of Boston. Mr. James Gibson,  graphically illustrates what deregulation  has meant for the securities industry. I  think  that  the  view of  a  securities  spech't.list like Mr. Gipson will be of con siderable interest to Members of the Sen ate, and I ask that the article be printed  in the RECORD.  I would also ask that a.  subsequent letter Mr. Gipson wrote to  me,  in which he specifies the implica tions of securities deregulation for the  trucking industry, be printed as well.  The materlal follows:  [From the Washington Post, June 3, 1979)  WALL STREET SURVIVES COMPETITION  (By James Gipson)  Wall Street remembers Ma.y 1, 1975, with  the same feelings the U.S. Navy reserves for  Dec. 7, 1941. After generations of preaching  the rigorous virtures of competitive capital ism wh1le practicing the pleasurable vices of  monopoly and pr1ce fixing, Wall Street met  its Pearl Harbor in the form of price com petition within its own ranks. The capable  brokers and the emcient firms have survived  the shakeout that began that May Day, but  Wall Street,  unlike  the Navy,  has  little  chance to achieve redemption or to infiict  revenge  for  the calamity  that has over taken It.  To understand the present upheaval, one  must understand the old order that preceded  it. The club that was to become the New  York Stock Exchange was formed nearly two  centur1es a.go under a buttonwood  tree In  lower Manhattan. The club was based on  three  principles  that  remained  inta<:t  through booms, busts, wars and the growth  of th'e country from a  few former colonies  huddled on the Atlantic Coast to the most  powerful nation  in  the world. The  three  principles were: a club monopoly of trading,  limited club membership and a fixed 1 per cent commission.  Shortly after the club was formed, Colonel  Bronk rode in from the area that now bears  his name  (belonging to the Bronks family,  corrupted  to  the Bronx)  and  tried to go  around the club in selling some securities.  He falled, and no one ser1ously challenged  the club a.gain untll the late 1960s. The club  proved to be one of the most durable in stitutions in the country, and many people  thought it would last forever.  Of course, nothing lasts forever. The third  market undercut  the  club's monopoly of  trading by conducting transactions in listed  stocks away from the New York Stock Ex change. The most serious challenge to the  club ca.me on the critical issue of commis sions, however.  The fixed-commission schedule of roughly  1 percent yielded a bonanza. to brokers in  the 1960s as both stock prices and stock  volume  rose  to set records. Many brokers  ma.de six-figure incomes while still in their  20s. The spectacle of  this  largesse  led  to  pressures to cut commission .rates, particu larly by  large  institutional  investors such  as  bank  trust  departments  and  pension  funds whose own employes did not share  in the bonanza.  Under prodding from  the Securities and  Exchange Commission,  broker  commission  rates were made negotiable on large trades  of more than $500,000. Much to the dismay  of brokers, competition quickly forced large  discounts. As a  result,  there was consider able apprehension at the approach of May  Day 1975 when the SEC ordered that all rates  be made negotiable. A  few major Institu tional brokers announced they would limit  discounts to 8 percent off the old fixed rates  and then sat back to see what would happen.  Nothing happened, and that was the prob lem. Brokers who offered small commission  discounts to institutions found their phones  stopped r1nging. Other brokers offered more  generous discounts in an admirable display  of competition in action. In a matter of days,  even  the major brokerage  firms cut  their  prices drastically, too. Instead of a.n 8 per cent discount off the old rates, discounts of  50 percent became common, and ones of 80  percent to 90 percent were not unusual.  Any Industry which slashes its prices that  sharply is In for a shakeout of the less em cien t  firms. Many brokerages were managed  as badly as old law firms, with an abundance  of prima donnas and an absence of cost con trols and emcient procedures. The weak and  1nemcient  firms  that  survived under  the  umbrella of  fixed  prices  simply dissolved  under the downpour of price competition.  At first,  the benefits of negotiated com missions went  to  large Institutional inves tors, but slowly  they became avalla.ble  to  individual investors as well.  Today even a small investor who needs only  trading services and who can dispense with  a broker's advice can save 50 percent or more  by going to a discount broker. As with the  deregulation of a.1rl1nes, the resulting price  competition generated lower prices for the  public.  Unlike  the  case with airlines, however,  competition came as a result of more gov ernment regulation, not less.  The results of price competition lived up to  the hopes of its advocate:> and to the fears  of its opponents. The advocates thought Wall  Street was overcharging the publ1c and hoped  rates would  fall but few dared hope  that  rates would fall as far as they did.  The opponents of price competition feared  that the  inemcient firms would go out of  business and, in fact, some did. Wall Street  has not collapsed, however, but has become  leaner and much more emcient than before.  It does a better job of executing trades and  does it with fewer employes. Many brokers  still feel a fond nostalgia for the bygone era  of fixed prices and large profits but, for the  investing public  that benefits  from  lower  rates  through price competition,  these a.re  the good old days.  BATTERYMARCH FINANCIAL MANAGE MENT CORPORATION,  Boston, Mass., June 21, 1979.  Hon. EDWARD M. KENNEDY,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR  SENATOR KENNEDY: Thank you  for  your letter on my piece in the Washington  Post concerning Wall Street's experience with  the deregulation of commissions. What fol lows are  some additional observations on  Wall Street's experience that may be relevant  to your efforts  to deregulate  the  trucking  industry.  Wall Street's resistance  to  competition  confirmed the adage that the last progres sive thing the New York Stock Exchange did  of its own free wm was to move its opera tions indoors to get out of the rain. Brokers  predicted that terrible things would happen  if their fellow brokers were free to set their  own prices. Some otherwise intelligent men  even maintained  that  rates would  rise  the floor on rates were removed. Simllar preif  ",1979

AMENDMENTS OFFERED BY MR. BAUMAN  ",1979
382,House,96,-0.225,198,18,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of the amendment.  I want to compliment the gentlewoman  from New York and all the other mem bers  of  the  subcommittee who  have  worked so hard on this. One of the things  I really want to bring to the attention of  this body is what is happening to the  refugees once they get here, because this  is a very important piece of the equation.  I do not  think we have  really  taken  enough responsibility for it at the na tional level.  I have not visited any of the refugee  camps, but I was in my district all last  month; and things got very, very tense  there. As you know, once the refugees  get to America, they may go anywhere to  settle.  We can recommend they go to certain  places, but if they want to go somewhere  else, they certainly are free to do that.  I come from Denver, Colo., where we  have been very, very heavily impacted  by  the  large numbers moving  in and  great tension has been caused becaJUSe of  the pressure on services that are already  really overstressed and understaffed. We  cannot forget a portion of that equation.  Getting the refugees here is only part of  the problems.  I am very worried because the minimal  funding that is there is running out at  the end of this month. I think one of the  things we have done traditionally in this  country is_ say, ""Give me your tired, your  poor,"" and once they get here, we have  not paid enough attention  to  them.  I  hope  that  this body does not  forget.  Helping  the  communities  adopt  anu  adapt these families and bring them into  America and really make them a part of  the country  rather  than  just getting  them here and throwing them in to com pete for really valuable resources against  other groups who already feel they are  being shortchanged is very important.  I compliment everyone who has worked  so hard on this amendment, but also say,  ""Don't forget,"" the money is running out  September 30 and we must act on that,  also. I think we are really under the gun.  Mr. MARRIOT!'. Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I would  just like  to  make a point that if we want to get a  testimony of the problems of the refu gees, we  should have  spent  the  last  month with the gentlewoman from Il linois <Mrs. COLLINS), and others, and  myself  included,  in  Congressman  WILSON'S delegation as we visited the ref ugee camp at Ban Van Ai up near the  Mekong River  and  also  the  refugee  camps in Hong Kong.  We spent a half da.y helping refugees  off the trucks and seeing the problems  they are faced with and trying to under stand the problem.  I  think after that experience, I can  honestly say that I sincerely believe that  the money, additional money of $207  million, would be well spent to help these  people.  Pol Pot in Cambodia has executed at  least 2 % million people. Ethnic Chinese  now who are leaving North Vietnam pri marily are drowning at sea. The last  count was about 60 percent of those peo ple are drowning before they find refuge.  I  think we ha.ve an obligation to do  all we can to help that situation. I think  a good Point has been made that we  should also encourage other countries to  do their share in helping these refugees.  Japan, I  think, has not done enough.  Australia has not done enough. I think  a point to be made, though, is many of  the countries in Southeast Asia cannot  do any more than they are now doing.  Some of the people in the refugee camps  are  living better than the farmers  in  Thailand, for .example. I think that we  then have the greatest resources to help  these people.  I want to ma.ke just one other point  in support of this amendment.  I think, Mr. Chairman, the solution to  the refugee problem is not in running  around the country trying to encourage other countries, who have problems o1  their own, to take in these refugees. The  problem is  through the United Nations  and through the governments of all of  the countries to put the pressure on the  Communist Government in Hanoi, as the  gentlewoman  from New York  stated  earlier,  to stop  the ungodly condition  that is resulting in the proliferation of  these refugees. I  think that is the bot tom line in terms of solving this problem.  Until we get to that point, I support  and congratulate the chairman on his  amendment. I think it is absolutely nec essary.  .

385,House,96,-0.398,250,18,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  month of September marks the 40th an niversary of the invasion of Poland and  the beginning of the most tragic and de structive war in the history of the world World War II. On September l, 1939, the  forces of Nazism  invaded Poland from  the West and on September 17, the forces  of communism invaded Poland from the  East.  Throughout history, Poland has served  as a bulwark of Christian civilization in  Europe, restraining the Tartars and the  Turks as  they plundered and pillaged  across the continent.  In the fall of 1939, there was no one  to protect Poland or to preserve her civi lization, and this long-suffering land be came a nation without a state, a tyran nized and persecuted country, deprived  of half its territory and millions of its  people. Alone and unaided,  the 830,000  soldiers and officers of the Polish Army  fought heroically against the overwhelm ing odds and inhuman terror unleashed  by the invaders.  Thousands of Polish  infantry, Navy,  and Air Force troops, forced to flee the  military might of  the  invaders,  joined  the allies and took up arms once more  in France, Norway, North Africa, Italy,  and Sicily. As  the regular army slowly  disintegrated with the country, an un derground movement developed, directed  by the Polish Government-in-exile. Stray  divisions of  the Polish Army  together  with civilian men, women, and children,  intrepidly destroyed enemy planes, am munition dumps, bridges, and other mili tary installations.  Often forced  to survive for months,  or even years, in forests and mountains,  members of the resistance and the Polish  populace at  large  reacted consistently  with spirit and conviction. Refusing to  betray  their national honor and col laborate with the enemy, 6 million Poles  preferred  self-respect  and  death  to  capitulation and cringing life. The na tion  lost close  to one-quarter of her  population, and the romantically beau tiful city of Warsaw, the Polish Capital,  was leveled to the ground.  Millions of Poles suffered deportation  and  imprisonment  in  labor camps  in  Siberia and Asiatic Russia, as the Com munists  systematically  attempted  to  destroy Polish  cultural  and  religious  life. Even in 1945 there was no peace for  Poland. Absorbed by Soviet  imperial ism,  the Poles have continued to fight  for personal  liberty and national  in tegrity.  Those who have  emigrated  to  the  United States have brought with them  their love of liberty and their respect  for law and order. They have contributed  much socially, economically, politically,  and culturally,  to the advancement of  our Nation, and have helped make the  United States one of the greatest coun tries in the world.  I  take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker,  to give recognition to the great number  of Polish Americans who reside in the  11th District of Illinois whom I am proud  to represent in the Congress. They form  a substantial part of the group of solid  hard-working American citizens who are  the backbone of our country. As we  again observe  this anniversary  in  the  House of Representatives, I am honored  to join Americans of Polish descent in  Chicago and all over the Nation in their  hopes and prayers  for  the  reentry of  Poland into the community of free na tions. The long-suffering Polish people  still look to a strong America for moral  support in their continuing struggle to  achieve their just aspirations to national  liberty.  Mr. Speaker, free peoples all over the  world must never weaken their vigilance  against the encroachments of Commu nist  totalitarians, and George F. Will  recently  wrote  a  thought-provoking  article on this subject in the August 30,  1979, edition of  the Washington Post.  His article on the spiritual weakness of  the Western nations on September 1,  1939 follows:  WESTERN WEAKNESS AND WAR  It is  regrettable,  if understandable, that  Sept. 1 will pass with much  less notice  in  the United States than in Europe. At dawn,  Sept. 1, 40 yea.rs ago, German troops crashed  into Poland. Seventeen mlllion combatants  and many millions o! civilians would die in  the next six years. But John Lukacs, the his torian, writes:  ""The outbreak of no other  great war in the modern history o! Europe  caused so little surprise."" And unlike in 1914,  Europeans went  to war with  resignation  rather than enthusiasm.  It is arguable  (and A. J. P. Taylor does  argue)  that the Second World War actually  beg31Il  in April 1932, when Mao Tse-tung  declared war on Japan in the name of the  Kia.ngsi  soviet. Americans  think  the war  began Dec. 7, 1941.  What did begin 40 years ago was (in the  words of the title of Lukacs' superb history)  ""The Last European War: September 1939/  December 1941."" This war, as Lukacs says,  was the decisive phase of the larger war. If  Hitler had beaten Britain or Russia then, he  would have won the war.  He came close in Russia. On Oct. 15, 1941,  there was the first traffic jam in the history  of the Soviet Union as government officials  and others privileged enough to have cars  fied east. Others scrambled to buy German Russian  dictionaries. Lukacs  believes,  ""A  single GeNnan para.chute  :regiment  could  have taken Moscow."" After 1941, with  the  United States in the war, Hitler could not  win, and since 1941 the destiny of Europe has  depended on two extra-European powers, the  United States and the U.S.S.R.  In 1917, Germany sent Lenin into Russia.  In 1939, Germany, with the Nazi-Soviet pact,  brought Stalin into Europe. These two deeds  help explain why, as Lukacs says, the rising  importance of  the eastern,  relative  to  the  western, half o!  the continent  is a major  theme o! European history in this century.  The war  in  the West began slowly. Six  years before Hiroshima,  the British pulled  300-year-old howitzers from museums,  the  French sent to Finalnd some guns used in  the Crimean war, and the Norwegian navy  included a warship commissioned  in 1858.  King George VI practiced pistol shooting in  the garden at Buckingham Pa.lace.  British and German troops did not meet  until April 20, 1940, in Norway. In the first  15 months of the war,  there was only one  small Allied victory on land, at Na.rvik, Nor way. But Hitler's victory in Norway brought  Churchill to power, and his invasion of Nor",1979
386,,96,-0.171,302,18,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to bring to the attention of  my colleagues  some correspondence  I  had recently with Richard Celeste, the  Director of the Peace Corps. This cor respondence was prompted by a very  thoughtful and detailed letter from a  Peace Corps volunteer.  This volunteer described some serious  problems and concerns regarding Peace  Corps recruitment and placement, com portment of volunteers in-country, poli cies on medical evacuations, wasteful  activities, and poor supervision of vol unteers. The criticisms were presented  in a constructive way and I attempted  to relay  them  to the Peace Corps for  consideration.  I am pleased with the response from  the Director of the Peace Corps because  he  took  the criticisms  seriously, was  aware of most of  the problems, and  claims some corrective actions have been  undertaken. Some of Mr. Celeste's state ments on Peace Corps policy regarding  certain matters will be helpful in clari fying the disposition of the Peace Corps  when volunteers in foreign countries find  themselves in difficult situations.  I have always believed  that part of  the vitality of the Peace Corps depends  on volunteers feeling free to share their  evaluations and criticisms of their ex periences and on a positive receptiveness  and responsiveness by Peace Corps ad ministrators  to  such  feed-back  from  volunteers.  The correspondence with the Director  of the Peace Corps follows:  Washington, D.C., July 30, 1979.  PEACE CORPS,  Hon. LEE H. HAMILTON,  Chairman, Subcommittee on Europe and  the Middle East, Committee on Foreign  Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR MR. HAMILTON: Thank you for your  inquiry of July 9 concerning issues raised  in a letter to you from a Peace Corps Vol unteer.  I wlll address  these  issues within  the same format as you presented them in  your letter.  1. Recruitment and. placement .-All Vol unteer assignments are agreed upon by the  in-country Peace Corps staff and officials of  the  appropriate host  agency. Agency of ficials specify the qualifications they desire  for each position and only those individuals  with appropriate backgrounds are recruited.  I  do not believe  that cases of Volunteers  being ""mismatched"" to their assignment are  as frequent as your letter would imply.  However, the question of Volunteer suc cess or  failure  is  frequently not one of  whether the Volunteer is qualified for  the  work she or he is assigned to do, but rather  whether the Volunteer is able to meet the  unique challenges presented to Peace Corps  Volunteers who must live as a part of the  host community at approximately the same  level as the people with whom they work.  It is my firm belief that the majority of  Volunteers are successful  in meeting  this  challenge. We, however, are concerned that  every Volunteer  sent  overseas  have  the  greatest possible chance for successful servSeptember 5, 1979  ice and we have made and continue to make  significant progress toward this goal.  During the past two years, several initia tives have been implemented to improve the  quality and  suitab111ty of  the Volunteers  which  the Peace Corps attracts. Recruit ment materials have been  redesigned  to  emphasize commitment to Volunteer service  and to provide more precise and complete  information concerning  the Volunteer ex perience. Careful  attention  is now being  given to the screening of applicants through  personal interviews with recruiters. We are  increasing pretraining programs and pro viding more in-depth country and assign ment specific information. A major focus of  these screening procedures is motivation. A  variety of administrative improvements also  have been initiated within both the recruit ment and placement operations, all of which  are aimed at freeing recruiters and place ment officers from  time consuming paper work so that they can give more time and  personal  attention  to  getting  the  right  Volunteer into the right assignment.  An important factor  in providing quali fied and effective Volunteers is the training  they receive. We have made significant prog ress in upgrading Peace Corps training dur ing  the past year and  this will continue  to be a priority during the coming months.  The  average  length of  training programs  w'ill  increase  substantially  from  about  weeks to more than 12 weeks in FY 1980.  As the Peace Corps moves to recruit from  a  broader spectrum of educational back grounds,  increased emphasis will be placed  on technkal sk111 training. As we place more  Volunteers in rural areas, where the poorest  citizens of a country are usually located, we  are giving increased attention to local lan guage  training and cross-cultural orienta tion.  In  general,  the  amount  of  time  devoted  to  language  training will  increase  significantly.  Volunteers will  also  receive  training  in  secondary skills, personal health skills and  perspectives on women in development. And,  once a Volunteer is placed in the field, we  a.re providing more  in-service  training  to  ensure his or her ongoing effectiveness. We  will continue to seek new ways of improving  training so that all of our Volunteers will  arrive at th.eir assignments with the insights  and sk1lls necessary to their success.  I am <:onvinced that these efforts wlll ha.ve  a major  impact  in  reducing  the  level of  Volunteer attrition. In addition, I think it is  important to note that Peace Corps Country  Directors are reporting significant improve ments in the quality of Volunteers they are  receiving, especially in the areas of commit ment a.nd fiexib111ty.  8  2. Comportment of volunteers  in-coun try.-It has been and will continue to be the  Peace Corps' policy that any Volunteer found  to be involved with the use of illegal drugs  will be  immediately  terminated  from  the  Peace Corps and  returned  to  the United  States. Volunteers are repeatedly made aware  of this policy during both recruitment and  training. Overseas staff members are aware  th111t enforcement of this policy is an import ant responsibility. Realistically,  I am sure  that there are some Volunteers who do use  drugs  just  as many other Americans  do  despite all public and private efforts to dis courage  such  activity.  However,  in my  opinion,  the vast majority of our Volun teers are  .aware of  the potentially serious  social, political and  legal impact of illegal  drug use and, therefore, avoid such activity.  All Peace Corps Volunteers are subject to  the laws of the country in which they are  serving. If a Volunteer  is arrested for any  reason,  including on drug-related charges,  the Peace Corps does not interfere with es tablished legal procedures but does continue  to provide the Volunteer with every appro priate form of support,  including the pro vision of legal representation if necessary.  We have a. professional staff in each of the  ",1979

389,,96,-0.387,484,18,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, this  month the final hearings on SALT will  be held and, in all probability, the SALT  II treaty will be reported by October 1  to the full Senate. I hope that during the  remainder of  these hearing3 attention  .is directed  to several essential  issues  raised in the foregoing article by Messrs.  Pincus and Kaiser. Some of these issues  are:  First. The wisdom of tying defense ex penditures  to arms control: SALT II  and defense spending are both important  parts of our national  security policy.  Thus, each should be evaluated on the  contribution  it makes  to our national  defense independent of the other. After  all, none of the defense challenges we  face will be easier to solve without SALT;  in fact, they will be harder to solve with out SALT.  Second. The actual need for the MX  and its effect on arms stability inasmuch  as  such  a  counter-force weapon will  make  the Russian  ICBM force  totally  vulnerable: <Soviet ICBM's constitute 70  percent of  their strategic  forces;  our  ICBM's constitute oniy 30 percent of  American strategic forces.)  Third. The need for a multiple aim  point system or mobile missiles-whether  it be  the new MX ""racetrack"" basing  mode, making the Minuteman Ill mis siles mobile, or otherwise: If the United  States makes  its ICBM's mobile, what  choice do the Soviets have other than to  make  their ICBM's mobile? And what  will that rc:Io to verification?  Fourth. What is the real risk to the  United States of the appearance or per ception of a Soviet strategic force ad vantage or a Soviet capacity to engage  in a strategic ""surgical"" strike or first  strike? In fact, does perception of Soviet  or U.S. strategic power affect the out come of conflicts between Soviet and  U.S.  interests in other areas? Was this  true in Iran? Or Angola? Or Afghanis tan? Or in the Chinese-Vietnamese war?  The list could go on. But I question the  validity  of  this perception  argument,  both  from  a  review  of  past United  States-Soviet  encounters  and  from  a  consideration  of  possible  future  en counters.  Fifth. Is the ICBM vulnerability a real  or a mythical possibility? What are the  realistic possibilities of the Soviets ever  either conducting such a surgical first  strike or being able to use the capacity  to conduct such a  first strike to their  advantage  in  other  areas  of United  States-Soviet conflicting  interests?  The entire SALT debate  to date,  it  to me, has tended to  seems  ignore the  nature of these things called ""strategic  weapons."" The fact is they are nuclear  weapons of unprecedented and unimag inable power for death and destruction.  The fact  is  that the human race has  never possessed such means of self-de struction and nuclear contamination of  all life on Earth. The application of con ventional theories of war and defense to  nuclear weapons appears to be an ab surdity at worst, and highly dangerous  and questionable at best.  listened to the low-keyed testi mony of Mr. Nitze, Dr. Kissinger, and  others about the prospects of limited nu clear war and the exchange of a first strike by  the Russians and a counter strike by  the United States, I noticed  the lack of attention given to the scope  of destruction and  the magnitude of  death involved. Nuclear weapons are new  and unprecedented scientific creations,  yet we continue to apply traditional and  shopworn concepts of geo-politics and  diplomacy in an effort to solve this unique  problem: The actual capacity of two an tagonistic nations to destroy each other  as functioning societies. How, then, can  anyone  subscribe  to  a  doctrine  of  ""limited"" nuclear war? Once  the first  nuclear warhead is launched, how likely  is  it,  really,  that  there will be  some  stopping point short of holocaust? I be lieve the only sound doctrine is one of  preventing any nuclear exchange.  This  fundamental weakness  in  the  ""limited"" war or surgical strike doctrine  of the opponents and critics of SALT II  As I  ",1979
390,House,96,-0.377,510,18,Mr. MOFFETT.,"  The  Ambassador  points out the heavy civilian  toll,  the  Lebanese women and children included  in the casualties from  the air raids. I  would hope that we would be cognizant  of the facts. I am not sure these air raids  are accomplishing anything. It is one  thing to say that Israel is defending it self; but a public relations firm trying to  devise the worst possible P.R. campaign  for Israel would include these air raids  as a major component of it. It is  just  simply not in Israel's interest. I -think  many Israelis share this feeling.  There is a debate in Israel on this very  question. It is only fitting to ask there be  a debate in the U.S. Congress, then, over  whether the raids are worthwhile. As my  friend  from West Virginia points out,  there may well be violations of U.S. law  involved here.  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  ",1979

393,House,96,0.496,523,18,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  mvself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I want at the outset to  compliment  the chairman of  the sub committee,  the gentleman  from Texas  <Mr. PICKLE)  for the outstanding work  that the gentleman has done on this bill  and all the members of the subcommit tee, the chairman of the full committee  and the ranking Republican on the full  committee and all the members of the  committee because  as was mentioned  earlier,  this bill was unanimously ap proved by the subcommittee which repre sents,  I believe, a cross-section of  the  philosophies in this entire House. It came  out, as has been mentioned earlier, by a  voice vote out of the full committee.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3236 is not a per fect bill. It does not. solve all of  the  problems, as I see them, in the disability  insurance program. If the legislation had  been written to my own specifications, it  would be different from the measure be fore us.  But if the bill had been tailored to my  taste only--or to that of any other MemAccordingly, this bill would:  Require that applicants be given an  individual statement of the reason for  the decision in their case  Increase payments f~r medical evidence  Ren'.istitute a comprehensive review of  cases;  Give the Secretary of HEW regulatory  authority to establish and enforce stand ards of operation;  Transfer  full  authority  for  the  re habilitation program for social security  beneficiaries to the regular VR program  and institute instead a bonus system of  awards from the trust fund based on suc cessful returns to work;  Require an HEW study of how State  employees would be protected if a State  agency ever relinquished operation of the  program; and  Institute a review of all dis1ability cases  at least once every 3 years so that a per son would not be left on the rolls long  after he or she may have recovered.  Let me make one  final note. Some  State agency employees had expressed  concern about the bill as it emerged from  subcommittee because there was no pro vision in it to protect their rights should  the Federal Government ever have  to  assume the responsibility of running the  program in any State.  3236.  ber-it might not have progressed so  far. H.R. 3236 has survived. It has passed  all  the  tests: Unanimous approval by  subcommittee, and voice vote endorse ment by the parent committee.  The bill has succeeded, Mr. Chairman,  because it represents a workable compro mise, an appropriate blending of shared  objectives. H.R. 3236 does not make as  many changes as some of us would like;  it makes more than others want. But, it  is realistic, it is feasible, and it does in clude a number of significant and long needed improvements in one of the two  programs comprising our Nation's basic  social insurance system.  First,  the bill provides for disability  benefit levels that are more reasonable  and more equitable. Second, and equally  as important, H.R. 3236 makes it easier  and more attractive for a disabled bene ficiar~r to return to work, if at all possible.  Actuaries have estimated that the bill  would reduce outgo from the social se _curity  trust funds by $184 million  in  1981. The ""savings"" would escalate an nually, reaching a yearly level of more  than $1 billion by 1984. The long-range  deficit in the combined old age survivors  and  disability  insurance  trust  funds  would be cut 14 percent, from 1.4 to 1.2  of taxable payroll.    Although these ""savings"" are signifi cant, I  think they will be further en hanced  if  the added work  incentives  which the bill provides are fully taken  into account. I believe  that H.R. 3236  will help more people return to the labor  force,  thus producing more income for  both  the Treasury and  the social se curity trust funds.  I also am convinced that these same  provisions will bring about an even more  important ""savings""  in human  terms.  Too many persons who are deemed to  be disabled wind up on the shelves of our  society. Through its improved work in centives  and  related provisions, H.R.  3236 should help many of these people  to get back into productive pursuits, to  rejoin the mainstream, and to enhance  their own personal self-respect, a major  key to happiness.  One of  these provisions stems from  my own  long-held concern that some  severely disabled persons have been dis couraged  from  returning  to  full-time  jobs because of the high cost of special  equipment they need just to get around.  Although they may be able to earn good  wages, when  they subtract from  their  earnings the special expenditures which  allow  them  to function at work,  they  find they would be better off financially  if they stayed home and continued re ceiving maximum benefits.  Section 5 of this bill would eliminate  that disincentive  to work. It provides  that extraordinary expenses incurred by  the severely disabled to keep them func tioning will not be counted as earnings  that will  cause  them  to  lose benefit  status.  Other work  incentives provided by  H.R. 3236 would: Expand the trial work  period  from  tc 24 months;  extend  medicare coverage for 3 years to the dis abled who return to work; and elminate  the second 2-year waiting period  for  those who  try to work, but find  they  9  ",1979

400,,96,0.336,588,18,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker, during  the August r~cess, the Washington Post  published an editorial which I feel every  Member should read and consider. Pro posed legislation  to regulate standard ized admissions tests is under considera tion by the Elementary, Secondary, and  Vocational  Edu::ation  Subcommittee.  The Post writes thatfirst glance,  it's a  terribly appealing  At  idea.  However, the editorial continues with  a well reasoned and balanced analysis of  the dangers of hasty Federal action in  this area. Similar legislation was recently  enacted in New York State and is sched uled  for  implementation  in  January  1980. It would certainly be prudent to  evaluate the results in New York before  embarking on a grand scheme for the  Nation.  We are not in a ""testing emergency.""  There is no crisis. Therefore, we do have  time for a careful analysis of the pros  and cons on this issue. We must not be  stampeded by rhetoric but rather pur suaded by the honest deliberation of the  committee process  before  considering  action on this issue.  I recommend to each of my colleagues  the following Washington Post editorial  of August 27, 1979:  SCORING THE ADMISSIONS TESTS  At  first glance,  it's a  terribly a.ppealing  tdea. A House subcommittee is now briskly  proceeding with a blll giving student& a legal  right to see their college entrance examina tions, with the questions and the corrected  answers. For good measure,  the b111 would  also establish broad federal supervision over  all admissions testing. On a. second and closer  look, this legisla.tion becomes less appealing.  Some of  the suppor.t  for  lt comes from  people who simply think that students ought  to be able  to  review  their exams and see  where they fell short. But some comes from  people who want to change the nature of the  tests, and the whole admissions process, on  grounds that these a.re tilted against the poor  and the minorities. Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.),  the author of the principal bill under consid era.tion, says that he doesn't wa.nt to regula.te  the tests. But his bill clearly lays the founda tion for a regulatory system.  Young Americans take these tests by ;the  m1llions every year for admission to college  or professional school. The most widely used,  the College Boa.rd's Schola.stlc Aptitude Test,  is given more than 20 times a. year through out the country and abroad. Ea.ch new edition  picks up a good many questions from  the  previous one, to ensure that the scores on a  test given on one date will be comparable to  those of another.  But Mr. Weiss' bill would require the Col lege Board, after each test is scored, to give  the student both  the questions  and  the  answers. Since the questions would immedi ately be passed around to other students, they  could ha.rdly be used again. The cost of the  tests would go up, a.nd the reliab111ty of the   ",1979
401,Senate,96,-0.41,627,18,Mr. CULVER.," Mr. President, I oppose  the amendment offered by the Senator  from Arkansas. The amendment offered  by Senator BUMPERS is a modification of  S. 111 which would amend section lO(e)  of the Administrative Procedure Act of  1946. As I understand the amendment, it  would remove the presumption of valid ity which Federal courts give  to any  agency  rule or  regulation  and would  direct the courts to strike down any chal lenged  rules or regulations unless  the  agency could support their validity by a  preponderance of the evidence.  This amendment would do nothing  less than repeal more than 30 years of  experience in the area of administrative  law and nearly 200 years of common law  practice.  I am sympathetic with the goals which  I believe the distinguished Senator from  Arkansas is trying to achieve. I believe  he is concerned that agencies often issue  unnecessary and burdensome regulations  which may even be outside the intent of  the Congress.  I am certain he is con cerned with the delay in the administra tive  process which prevents  ultimate  resolution of the interpretation of con gressional mandates: and I am certain  that  the distinguished Senator would  like to see major overall changes in the  Federal administrative process.  However,  the amendment before us  today, as the distingushed Senator from  Maine has so eloquently stated, repre sents a classic case of throwing the baby  out with the bath water.  I want the Senator from Arkansas to  know that I share his concern that the  administrative process is not working as  well as it should, and I believe that it is  the responsibility of the Congress to en act major changes in its operation.  Moreover,  the Subcommittee on Ad ministrative Practice and Procedure, on  which I serve as chairman, has been do ing exactly that for several years. In the  94th  and  95th Congresses,  extensive  hearings were held on  improving  the  Federal administrative process.  And now in the 96th Congress, we are  on the verge of enacting one of the most  important administrative reforms ever  proposed. This year, our subcommittee  and  the Committee on Governmental  Affairs have conducted weeks of hearings  on a  range of legislative proposals de signed to improve the Federal regulatory  process.  Among the proposals before our sub committee are measures to improve the  overall management of Federal regula tory agency activities-this is essential to  reduce overlap and duplication in agency  regulations.  We have been working on proposals  to  reduce delay  in  the administrative  process.  We have heard proposals to reform the  administrative law  judge system which  is central to factual decisionmaking in  the agencies' adimnistrative process.  We have sought different ways of in creasing public participation in the regu latory decisionmaking.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly,  we are looking for ways to require that  the agenices consider the cost and bur den their decisions will impose on small  businesses and local governments.  If we were to adopt the amendment  before us  today, we might just as well  turn our back on the efforts of the past  several years because this proposal would  do away with the administrative process  as we know it.  As we all know, under the Administra tive Procedure Act, Federal courts can not strike down a Federal rule or regula tion unless the challenger can demon strate that the agency was arbitrary or  capricious  in  its  interpretation of  the  statute or in its application of the facts  to the statutory requirements.  Mr. President, we do not lightly accord  such deference to agency decisionmak ing. It is a core concept underlying the  allocation of power between courts and  agencies that judges are generalists while  administrators are specialists.  Nothing could be more wasteful and  more deleterious  to  the coherent ad ministration of a  regulatory program  than having courts duplicate the efforts  of agencies in applying legal concepts to  every  individual situation  that comes  along.  The consistency of those legal concepts  with the mandates of Congress should  be, and is, scrutinized by the courts with  :the deference to the agency's construe . tion as the circumstances warrant.  But when  that  task  is completed,  I  believe  it  is appropriate  to  leave  the  implementation  of  those  judicially  declared  guidelines  primarily  to  the  specialists. This implementation process  can still be reviewed under  the abuse  of discretion  test and,  in certain cir",1979
402,,96,-0.145,640,18,Mr. NUNN.," I agree with the Senator  completely. I think it is abundantly clear  that the witnesses before our committee,  before we had anybody  testify against  the treaty-the people who were testify ing for the treaty, Secretary Brown and  the Joint Chiefs and other administra tion witnesses-made the exact case that  the treaty itself did not do the job, that  we were going to have to increase our  defense efforts.  The Joint Chiefs went so far as to say,  in answer to questions by me and others,  that the treaty itself would not be a plus  for this Nation unless we increased our  own defense spending together with the  treaty. Not because arms control is hope less, but because we are losing every day  our  leverage; and  the SALT II treaty  is more or less a photograph of where we  now stand vis-a-vis  the Soviets.  I am  afraid that SALT III, if we reach SALT  III, also will be a photograph, and that  photograph  is becoming  less and  less  favorable  to  the United  States  of  America.  ",1979

Harry Snyder is one such indi vidual. Harry was  the county clerk of  Warren County, N.J., for 18 years. He  distinguished himself with his profes sionalism in that position.  His peers elected him as the president  of the New Jersey County Officers Associ ation. He was one of only four county  clerks chosen to standardize the absentee  ballot system for the whole State of New  Jersey. He was instrumental in the for mation of the driver education system in  the high school systems of Warren, Sus sex, and Hunterdon Counties.  But Harry did not leave his talents and  civic mindedness at the office.

A SALUTE TO COLONEL MICHAEL  KOVATS DE FABRICY  HON. MARIO BIAGGI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 6, 1979   ",1979
412,,96,0.346,900,18,Mr. LEE.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take  this opportunity  to  call  to  the  attention of you and my distinguished  colleagues an article that appeared in  the September 2, 1979, issue of Parade  magazine about a unique and very spe cial educational institution, the George  Junior Republic, in Freeville, N.Y.  Under the superb guidance of its cur rent director, Mr. Frank Speno,  this  institution has done much to help many  young people turn from delinquency to  become productive members of society.  The article follows :  A NATION RUN BY Kms  (By Reynolds Dodson)  The 17-year-old magistrate of the world's  smallest  republic  banged  his  gavel  and  ordered the courtroom to silence. The de fendant, a girl of 15, had been charged with  1llegal use of  tobacco--an offense against  the republic's laws for designated smoking  areas.  ""Since this  is your second offense,"" said  the  black-robed magistrate,  ""I  have  no  choice but to fine you $10. If you're caught  smoking  in an undesignated  area  a.gain,  you'll get another $10  fine plus a day  in  jail.""  In  the currency of  the George  Junior  Republic  in Freeville, N.Y.-a mini-nation  run by  teenagers for  teenager&-$10 is the  equivalent of 3Y2 days' pay. And although  Jail does not mean physical  imprisonment,  it does mean that the offender will be denied  privileges suoh as conversation with other  citizens, the use of soft furniture, and stay ing up to the regular bedtime of 9:30.  Every day at 4 : 30,  the court metes out  justice  to offenders against  the republic's  society.  It  employs  an  attorney  general,  prosecutors,  defense  lawyers  and police none of whom is over 19.  Life had not always held so much respon sibility for Bruce, the young magistrate. The  product of a broken home, he spent his ea..rly  teens in rebellion <against all authority. The  schools had washed their hands of him, and  he'd he.d several brushes with the law. The  local family court had finally recommended  his enrollment in the 84-year-old republic.  When Bruce first arrived at the beauti fully  manicu~ed campus, he might have  thought he was in an exclusive Eastern prep  school. There were only 170 students, 63  of them girls. Many wore coats and ties, all  were properly groomed, and no e.dult was  ever addressed without the proper ""Mister""  or ""Miss."" But beyond that, any resemblance  to a pTep school was purely coinctde.n:ta.l.  In  the  filrst  Pl:a.ce. Bruc&--11ke all  the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  September 7, 1979  of  ta.x on  republic's ""citizens""-was allowed to arrive  with only a  few luxurtes ;and a pre-set list  of clothing. He could accept no gifts from  the outside wodd without paying a.  them. He would be expected to work or go  to  school at  least  35  hours a week,  for  which he would be paid a modest starting  salary of 40 cents an hour,  repuibllc cur rency. He would 11 ve by an ironclad rule:  ""Nothing without labor.""  If these had been  adult-imposed  laws,  Bruce wouldn't have listened. But these laws  were made by teenagers like himself and had  been passed down  through genera.tions of  ""town meetings""  in which adults had no  say.  The effect on Bruce-as on all newly ar rived citizens-was both confusing and pro found. Now when he rebelled, it was against  his own peers and against  laws which he  himself would have  a  voice  in  formulat ing.  Slowly, the light began to dawn. After a  period of adjustment, Bruce wrote his father  that ""things seem to be going better now.  There's a position of magistrate open and  I'm going to try for  it. It'll be tough, be. ca.use  it'll take me wbout  two months  to  pass my bar exams.""  To understand what  a.11  this meant  to  Bl""uce, you have to go back to the republic's  founding and to a  remarkable ma.n named  William  ""Daddy"" George,  a  jewelry  box  maker. In 1881,  the old New York Tribune  initia.ted one of the first ""fresh air funds""  for city kids, and George began taking un derprivileged boys for vacations to his farm  in upstate New York.  But George beoame disench:a.nted. Many  the kids, he felt, were coming only to  take advantage of the free food ,and dona.ted  cLothing. And they were stealing from ea.ch  other.  One day George declared that henceforth  everything would have  to be earned. You  could clear a field or help build a cabin, but  that was the only way you were going to get  shoes and clothes. As for  the  thievery, he  called  the kids  together and asked W'hat  they thought should be done with the of fenders. The boys hu~dled for hours and  finally came up with a kind of crude police  system and a set of punishments to flt the  offenses.  In 1895,  the George Junior Republic was  officially founded, with a constitution, by laws, and a tripartite system of government  similar  to  that of  the U.S. Through  the  years many  laws have  1been changed and  new ones added, but no law has ever been  imposed  against  the  citizens' will  by  a  ""tyrannical"" adult.  In governing this mini-nation, its citizens  have had to deal with such weighty issues  as taxation, national budget, road and sewer  construction,  cons ti tu tional  amendments  and-more  recently-narcotics  smuggling  and drug abuse.  A youth with a history of failure in school  may rebel at first and announce that he has  no intention of going to classes. Imagine his  surprise when he learns that school is not a  requirement at the George Junior Republic.  A boy can work in the carpentry shop, in  the garage, or on the 500-acre farm. A girl  may choose one of these activities, or dress making, or helping in the kitchen.  But here's what happens. The boy in the  garage is handed an automobile manual and  told to make all the necessary repairs on a  carburetor. He discovers that he will never  be a mechanic unt11 he learns to read. The  obvious solution? Go back to school.  To be admitted to the republic, a young ster must be between 13 and 17 and o! suf ficient potential to be helped. The program  is long and arduous. For it to have any effect.  the average would-be delinquent must stay  18 months, and 24 months is recommended  for optimum results.  Nor is it cheap. The cost per student is a  little under $20,000 a year, much or it from  public funds, some of it from fund-raising  by the republic itself.  The republic's alumni include at lea.st one  Pulitzer  Prize  winner,  several  Academy  Award winners, and a slew of successful doc tors, lawyers, professors and businessmen.  As for Bruce,  the young magistrate-he's  left the republic, has a high school diploma.  and a steady job.  Bruce is the first to admit that he owes a  great deal to William ""Daddy"" George and  the spirit of  the George Junior Republic.  As Bruce's father, so do I.e  LOVE AND DEA TH  IN NICARAGUA  HON. MICKEY LELAND  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 7, 1979   ",1979
413,,96,-0.596,900,18,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to insert in the RECORD an article  from the Washington Post of August 9,  1979, by Colman McCarthy, describing  the effects  of  the recent Nicaraguan  struggle on two individual lives.  The sufferings of the people in a na tion immersed in a violent struggle are  well known to us all. Yet all too easily we  depersonalize  them-nameless  soldiers  and obscure villages are dismissed as sta tistics, facts remote from and unrelated  to our  lives. But for  the families and  friends of those whose lives are destroyed  in such a struggle, it is all very personal.  The stories of these people, people like  Enoc Ortiz and Kay Stubbs de Ortiz,  bring a little closer to home the tragedies  of any war. Their stories could be our  stories, and, in a sense, they are.  I commend the fallowing article to the  attention of my colleagues:  LOVE AND DEATH IN NICARAGUA  (By Colman McCarthy)  Between  10,000  and  20,000 Nicaraguans  died in the struggle to end the violence of  the Somoza regime. Few Americans knew the  details of the revolution as it unfolded, and  fewer still were personally  touched by  the  individual  tragedies  of  ea.ch  Nicaraguan  death.  An exception is Kay Stubbs. Her story ls  worth knowing because most of the qualities  currently said to be in dwindling supply hopefulness, a spirit of sacrifice, commitment  to ideals-are brimming in her. This fullness  is also a means of sharpening our focus on  what has been happening these past years in  Nicaragua and what better  things may be  happening in the future.  Kay Stubbs went to Nicaragua. in 1968. She  was a high school student from Middletown,  Ohio, who  traveled with her  local Baptist  church group to work in health projects. She  found spiritual reward in getting to know the  families and their culture. It wasn't the dab bling of the in-and-out do-gooder, because  every summer after, she returned.  At home, she graduated from the Univer sity of Tennessee. She came to Washington  to study at the Antioch School of Law, grad uating in 1977. In her first week, she met  Enoc Ortez, a Nicaraguan in his early 20s.  He was the youngest of 12 children of a  small  coffee  farmer  in Nueva. Segovia.  in  northern Nicaragua. With one brother,  a.  priest and  two sisters  in  the convent,  the  family sent Enoc to a seminary in Managua..  But he loved the open life in the mountains  of his village, and came home. Later he went  to the national univernity in Chile to study  economics. He was held in prison and tor tured for six weeks by the Pinochet regime.  Everything that Kay Stubbs had found so  ",1979
414,,96,-0.295,913,18,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to share with my colleagues a com mentary concerning the 40th anniver sary of the infamous German invasion of  Poland on September l, 1939. Col. An thony K. Podbielski, Historian of  the  Bayonne Chapter of the Polish American  Congress, has spoken often about  the  contributions of Polish Americans and  other ethnic groups in the United States.  I am deeply impressed by the pride of the  millions of Americans of Polish descent.  Pope John Paul II's recent visit to h.is  native Poland has inspired the world. It  is all the more significant that His Holi ness while celebrating Holy Mass at the  site ~f the notorious Nazi concentration  camp in Auschwitz, Poland, called atten tion to the horrible slaughter of 3 % mil lion Polish Christians and 2 % million  Polish Jews. Therefore, I would urge that  this  commentary be  included  in  the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  as  further evi dence of the tragedy of World War II.  Mr. William Kowalski, president of the  Bayonne Chapter of the Polish American  Congress, Bayonne, N.J., declared that:  Polish Remembrance Day is the official title  for  the anniversary of  the Nazi attack on  Poland. Poland was the first naition to meet  and resist the powerful Nazi military chal len""'e on her soil. After seventeen days of in ces~ant and unequal  struggle,  communist  Russia invaded Poland from the east in ac cordance with  a  previous,  premeditated  agreement with Germany. At this point, the  Polish struggle went underground with the  brave Poles fighting alongside the American,  British and French allies across North Africa  and in Europe.  CXXV--1496-Part 18  How ignominious were the final fruits of  Allied victory, when the Polish Armed Forces  were denied the right to participate in the  many victory parades in London, Paris and  Rome. Further humilirution  followed with  Poland being ""sold down the river,"" at the  secret  conferences of Teheran, Yalta and  P6tsdam. These conclaves sealed the doom of  Eastern Europe, bringing millions of people  under communist domination.  Deprived of participa.tion in the post war  Marshall Plan, Poland nonetheless rose like  Phoenix from the ashes of destruction. De spite a government not of their choosing, the  people of Poland serve as an example of faith  and dedication to the ideals of freedom.  On September 1, 1979, Poles and their de scendants all over the world will  join with  Pope John Paul II in fervent prayers for the  never-ending struggle for Poland's right and  will to live.  The day will be a solemn one with religious  services predominating on this tragic anni versary. We  take pride and encouragement  that here in the United Staites, the millions  of Americans of Poland descent will pause to  pray for the victims of Nazi and Communist  oppression and that we will continue to con tribute  to the well-being of our nrution so  nobly begun and exemplified by those first  famous Poles  in the Jamestown colony  in  1608 .

415,,96,-0.61,913,18,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Speaker, tomorrow  marks the anniversary of an institution  with a long and august record of achieve ment and distinguished service  to  the  community of Los Angeles. On Septem ber 8, the Los Angeles Athletic Club will  begin its historic centennial year and can  reflect back upon the past 99 years with  justifiable pride for the contribution it  has made to achieving the goals it set in  1880  to support amateur athletics and  promote physical fitness.  Notable among the achievements that  combine  to constitute  the club's rich  heritage wa~ the 1932 Olym'pics-the  first Olympiad ever held in the United  States-which was  attracted  to  this  country largely through the efforts of the  then Los Angeles Athletic Club presi dent, William May Garland. and other  members. These  same dedicated club  members also devoted their time, talents,  and energy to actively participate in the  organization and operation of the 1932  games.  The Los Angeles Athletic Club's history  is steeped in a tradition of Olympic sup port and participation. Many of Amer ica's amateur Olympic competitors have  performed under the auspices of the club,  including such Olympic champions as  swimmer Buster Crabbe,  yachtsman  ",1979
416,House,96,-0.293,939,18,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  strong support of H.R. 4986,  the Con sumer Checking Account Equity Act of  1979. As a cosponsor of this legislation,  I think it will have a positive impact on  our  financial  institutions, and  I urge  its passage.  As many of us are aware, banking is  one of the most regulated industries in  this country. There are different reasons  for these regulations, but the effect of  many is to protect financial institutions  from the effects of competition. A neces sary result has been a reduction in the  choices available to consumers. As I am  sure my colleagues are aware, the Dis trict of Columbia Court of Appeals re cently ruled that banks and other sav ings  institutions cannot off er  interest bearing checking accounts such as credit  union share drafts accounts and NOW  accounts. When I learned about this de cision, I was extremely concerned about  its  impact. A great many people have  taken advantage of share drafts and  NOW accounts, and this prohibition on  their use makes no sense. Savings banks  in New England and New York are per mitted to off er interest on demand de posits-but are precluded from doing so  in every other State. This patchwork ar rangement benefits no one, and only adds  confusion  to an already confusing in dustry.  It seems to me that consumers should  have the right to choose what they want  from a bank. If they are interested in  getting free checking, free checks, and no  interest on their money, they should have  the ability to find a bank to meet their  needs.  Similarly, if a consumer is more inter ested in receiving interest on demand de posits-and  perhaps  p'aying  for  the  checks-they should be able to make that  decision.  This  freedom  of  choice  is  available in most other sectors of our  economy, and I see no reason why fi nancial  institutions should be  treated  differently.  By overturning the court decision and  authorizing  interest bearing  checking  accounts, this legislation is a victory for  consumers-allowing them the freedom  of choice they deserve from their finan cial institutions. I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 4986.   e ",1979

McMillan. As a school-age  youngster in the tobacco belt of South  Carolina, my first memories and asso ciation with politics and public service  were through the work of Congressman  McMillan. Even then, in his initial years  as a Congressman in the early forties, he  was establishing a  record of service to  his constituents and of hard work in the  Nation's Capital.  When I first began my own career of  public  service as a State  legislator  in  1962, the man known as ""Johnny Mac""  had established himself as an institution  in  the annals of South Carolina poli tics. I supported him then and worked  hard on several of his campaigns, though  it was rare when he was ever challenged  during  that  period.  John McMillan  taught me much of  the kind of spirit  and public dedication  that is  required  of a successful public official.  I must admit here that I was aware  of the criticism that was voiced about  Mr. McMillan because of certain posi tions he took on issues concerning the  city of Washington in Congress. But I  knew  then as  I  believe many ofJ his  critics know now  that most of  those  stands  represented  philosophical  dif ferences and were certainly not repre sentative of  the work and dedication  that Mr. Mac devoted to this city.  It is quite apparent to anyone living in  this city that the fine hospitals, police,  and  fire  departments, museums  and  monuments have not come about since  the enactment of home rule. They are  part of the firm base that was established  through  the work of John McMillan  during his service as chairman of the  District Committee.  Mr. McMillan and I had our differ ences. But I am proud and happy to say  that no one was any stronger a support er or a better adviser to the Sixth Con gressional District  than Congressman  John L. McMillan. I considered it a privi lege to call him friend and I know thri.t. I  express  the feelings of all of my col leagues here when I say he will be missed  by all of us.   GROTESQUE FRIVOLITY  HON.

Mrs.  Nancy Lichtenthaler has been installed  as  the first woman commander of an  American Legion Post in  the State of  Missouri. I extend my congratulations to  Commander Lichtenthaler and the Wa verly American Legion Post No. 580, on  this most noteworthy installation.  Reprinted below is an article from the  June 29, 1979, edition of  the Waverly  Times which describes  the memorable  ceremony:  NANCY M. LICHTENTHALER INSTALLED AS  COMMANDER OF AMERICAN LEGION POST  History was made Saturday, June 23  in  Waverly when Nancy M. Lichtenthaler was  installed as commander of the Waverly Amer ican Legion Post, No. 580  in an impressive  ceremony conducted at the Legion Hall. The  lnstalllng otftcer was David Blackburn of  Malta Bend, 7th District Commander. Mrs.  Llchtenthaler ls the first woman in Missouri  to be commander of a. legion post and ls also  the first woman to be a. member of the Vet erans of Foreign Wars in t1'e state. She saw  service in 1945 in India. with the Air Force  Command  in World War II. Her husband,  Charles D.

428,,96,-0.444,1238,18,Mr. STUDDS.," Mr. Speaker, today I  have introduced in the House of Repre sentatives the National Fishery Devel opment Act. This bill, filed earlier this  year by Senator EDWARD KENNEDY in the  Senate, is intended to establish a com prehensive program to promote the de velopment of our domestic fishing  in dustry.  Essentially, the bill more clearly de fines the allowable uses of the so-called  Saltonstall-Kennedy fund which was es tablished in 1954 to help stimulate our  domestic fisheries. Congressional action  in this area is sorely needed to prevent  the continued use of this money for per-.  sonnel salaries in the National Marine  Fisheries Service, where it has, in effect,  become part of the agency's base budget.  I do not believe that this use of the fund ing was ever intended, nor do I believe  that  a  fishery  development  account  should be drained to support another  government bureaucracy.  The provisions in the bill I have in troduced will guarantee  that at  least  ",1979
429,,96,-0.042,1251,18,Mr. ATKINSON.," Mr. Speaker, our en ergy problem has proven to be monumental and it shows no signs .. of becom ing alleviated in the ne~. f\lture. OPEC  has raised prices, and will do so again.  The oil  companies  seem  to be more  closely tied to Mideast commercial policy  than to the American national interest.  Even the President has  recognfzed .the  necessity of strong Government partici pation in the field of energy.  On June 28, I introduced a bill which  would create an Energy Oompany of  America. I believe  this company could  be the strong and effective implement of  Government energy policy. The Energy  Company of America would gain reliable  operating information more accurately  than a Federal department. It would also  be able to influence the private oil com panies through direct competition rather  than regulation. In short, it is just the  type of forceful and long-lasting Gov ernment implement which is needed to  effect American energy policy.  I would like to insert in the RECORD  an  editorial which  appeared  in  the  Beaver County Times on July 29, 1979.  The editorial, by Tom Waseleski, graph ically illustrates many of the arguments  for the Energy Company of America.  The editorial follows:  (From the Beaver County (Pa.) Times,  July 29, 1979)  ATKINSON'S INVITATION TO THE OIL BUSINESS  (By Tom Waseleskl)  While you were  reading your newspaper  this week and wincing, Gene Atkinson was  smiling. Not that he takes any pleasure in  your pain, though. It's just that Atkinson ls  the Beaver County congressman who intro duced plans for an Energy Company of Amer ica. in the House la.st month.  Getting a look a.t the billfolds of the multi national oil compalnes again proves a sober ing experience--even for gasoholics. Second  quarter profits over the same period last year  were up 70 percent for Boron, 65 percent for  Gulf, 36 percent for Amoco, 38 percent for  Mobil, 61 percent for Standard of California,  55 percent !or Shell, 90 percent for Cities  Service, 132 percent for Texaco ...  Figures like these don't make us wonder  why no one set up a federally owned energy  company in this country before-they make  us enraged. While some may think Atkinson's  bill befits a. dream concocted at ra. slumber  party  for burned out Roosevelt-Kennedy Johnson liberals, Atkinson does not intend to  throttle free enterprise. As a matter of fact,  his aim ls to spread competition to an indus try that has never known it.  Big 011 has built a legend around operat ing from secrecy. Consider the consent decree  it hia.s with the Department of Energy. The  Federal Trade Commission has been investi gating the sales practices of various oil com panies for possible violations of federal law.  Officials  in DOE have been privy  to confi dential information from Big Oil so long as  they agree not to pass it on to, say the FTC,  which needs it to assemble its case.  Such an agreement was put to the test a  month ago when DOE wa.s called before a.  House subcommittee. Despite some tense and  charged moments,  the secrets between  the  oil companies and the Energy Department  were not compromised, even under the glare  of TV camera lights and the eager scribble  of the Capitol Hill press.  We've come to expect this sort of official  arrogance  from private executives  in  the  name of profits, but when it mushrooms into  collusion with government employees sal aried by  the public,  it becomes a  sordid  Washington  practice  that  ha.s  no  equal.  That's one of the things that so riled Rep.  Atkinson  that he became convinced  tha.t  the government needed its own energy com pany not only for obvious benefits to the fuel  supply picture but for firsthand and incon trovertible information what it a.ctually costs  to buy, sell, discover and refine oil in an era  of eclipse.  His proposed Energy Company of America.  would do a.ll this and more. Besides having  the power and federal funding to engage in  the same energy ventures as private oil com panies, ECA would deposit its profits in the  U.S. Treasury, negotiate on the government's  behalf with other nations  (probably non OPEC)  for beneficial  fuel  supply arrange ments and act as a feisty maverick in a field  where the commodity sellers are more agree able to the whims of a foreign cartel than the  needs of domestic consumers.  Atkinson figures ECA would need $100 mil lion in federal outlays, plus bond sales, to be  established in three years, at which time it  could commence drilling for oil, negotiating  overseas for natural ga.s, etc.  Other western nations already have na tional energy companies competing with the  private sector. The biggest success, and for tunately  the one whose  country's import  situation most nearly duplicates that of the  U.S.  is Petro-Canada. Only three years old,  Petro-Canada  has  dramatically  increased  that nation's supply of natura.l gas by the  discovery of a  large source off Nova Scotia,  where the private companies had never drill ed.  It has also been  in  the  forefront of  Canada's search for new domestic oll wells.  Last year Petro-Cana.da sunk 16 of 26 new  holes drilled nationwide. This year lt wlll  own 11 of 13 new drlll sites.  Petro-Canada is presently negotiating en ergy des.ls with Mexico, China and other non OPEC countries to circumvent the cozy and  costly oortel-co['J)ora.tion embrace.  It nevertheless isn't going  to return our  northern neighbors to the days of gasoline at  50 cents or even 75 cents a gallon. What it  will do ls turn the energy industry into a free  market, causing companies to use exorbitant  profits for competition in energy exploration  and development rather than side acquisi tions  like Anaconda Copper, which ARCO  bought in 1977 for $700 mllllon. A lot of help  that was at the pumps.  Atkinson's ECA proposal  is bound  to be  attacked a.s more of the fashionably maligned  government  bureaucracy. What  obviously  doesn't faze these people ls that Exxon and  Shell are hardly Mom  'n' Pop operations  either.  Energy is a thorny problem and it begs a  comprehensive  solution. The $100 million  ECA startup cost ls loose change compared to  the $20 bllllon Congress wants to sink into  synthetic fuels.  Sen. Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, who intro duced  the ECA proposal  to the Senate  in  Ma.reh-which in terms of energy was a less  harrowing time-cautioned that ""it is foolish  to leave international negotiations to entities  accountable to themselves a.nd foreign gov ernments----e.nd not the American people.""  When energy prices  force  inflation  into  double digits while Big Oil chooses to use  only 84 percent of its refining capacity; when  gasoline costs soar at an annual rate of 61  peq-cent while Big 011 cows the White House  into kllling a World Bank proposal to fund oil  exploration in non-OPEC countries; when a  poorly fielded Energy Department ca.n frolic  under the covers with the industry it ls as signed to regulate while its approe.ch to the  problem must be forceful in tone e.nd inter national in scope, it behooves the government  to take matters into its own hands.  The Energy Oompany of America could be  the best thing to come down tlie pike since  the TVA. And if Big 011 doesn't like it, weH,  there's always na.tionallzation.e  ",1979
430,House,96,0.32,1316,18,Mr. SPENCE.," Mr. Chairman, the main  reason for any federal or central gov ernment is to protect its people against  aggression from outside sources. People  band themselves together for this pri mary purpose. We can disagree over  what and how much governmeillt we  should have. otherwise, but our main  and our principal job-yours and mine ........  as Members of Congres'S, is to defend our  country against our enemies, foreign and  domestic. Also, we have to do our best  to prevent wars, and to keep ourselves  strong enough to defend our country if  war comes.  I submit that we have not been living  up to our responsibility in this respect.  Let us  look for just 1 minute at what  has happened  to us since World War  II, when we were the undisputed lead er of  the world. We had more Navy,  for example,  than all  the rest of  the  world put together. We could have made  slaves out of every person on the face  of  this earth had we wanted  to. We  had  the power  to do  it. We were the  acknowledged  leader of  the world. We  were strong militarily; we were respected  beoause we were strong; and we had the  will and resolve necessary  to back up  whatever position we took in this world.  Since that time,  the world has seen  us in Korea fight a war with one hand  tied behind our back. They have seen us  prevent  our military  from  bombing  enemy air bases. Can you imagine what  would have happened in World War II  had we not been able to bomb Germany?  We would still be fighting  the war, or  would have lost it by now.  In Vietnam the picture haunts me even  today of those last days on top of the  U.S. Embassy  in Saigon, when hands  were reaching up for the wheels of that  last helicopter leaving Vietnam, where  we abandoned billions of dollars worth  of military equipment, and bases that  we had constructed, leaving the field to  the enemy in the eyes of many people  in this world who do not realize that our  military were not defeated-they were  not allowed to win by our own civilian  leadership.  We have engaged  in unilateral dis armament. Our Navy is down from over  2,000 ships to less than 500 ships. Since  1954, the percent of our gross national  product for defense has declined from  12.7 to 5.2 percent, while Russia has in creased from 8 percent to 18 percent.  The percentage of our budget for defense  has gone down from 65.3 percent to 23.5  percent.  Our foreign policy has been one of pre emptive concession. We abrogated our  alliance with Taiwan. We have deferred  deployment of our neutron weapon with out obtaining any concession in return.  In many cases, we have abandoned our  allies, or  taken positions  contrary  to  them when they faced problems. People  say that having us as an ally invites trou ble. Ask  the people in South Vietnam!  But, Russia and Cuba help their allies.  Ask the people in Africa about that!  Since that time, we have seen one of  our Navy ships taken on the high seas,  and we did nothing in return. We have  seen two of our Army officers  literally  chopped to death, with their own axes,  in Panmunjom by the North Koreans,  and we did not do anything about it.  Our men did not draw a weapon to de fend themselves, and this is the charac terization of us in the world today. We  will not even lift a hand to def end our selves, and we can be kicked around by  anybody and everybody.  We have seen an ambassador of ours  killed recently in Afghanistan. We have  seen our Embassy in Tehran overrun, our  flag shot up, and the Marines not even  allowed  to defend the Embassy. Other  friendly nations will not even allow us  to use their air fields or overfly their air  space because  they are worried about,  not us and our reaction to their refusal,  but the other side if they allow us to  ",1979
431,House,96,-0.429,1329,18,Mr. PRICE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 5  minutes  to  the gentleman  from Mis souri (Mr. SKELTON).  ",1979
432,House,96,-0.172,1329,18,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of H.R. 4040, the Department  of Defense authorization bill for fiscal  year 1980. The chairman, the gentleman  from  lliinois  <Mr. PRICE),  and other  members of  the House Committee on  Armed Services have done an excellent  job in drafting this bill. If approved, the  programs and procurements authorized  by  this bill will help  to maintain  the  strategic balance of power and preserve  our national security.  I would be remiss if I did not begin by  stating that I  listened carefully to my  colleague, the gentleman from California  <Mr. DELLUMs) who just spoke. I  think  and I know that what he says he means  most sincerely. But when  it comes  to  studying the world situation, finding the  terrible increase in the military posture  of a potential enemy, I find that I must  respectfully disagree with my friend.  Specifically, Mr. Chairman, I want to  compliment the committee for the pro vision expressing the sense of Congress  that maintaining  a  survivable  land based ICBM is vital to the security of  this country. I certainly hope that this  body will proceed with the development  of the MX missile and its basing modes.  It is encouraging also that the admin istration has taken the position that it  has recently announced to back this pos ture. Moreover, Mr. Chairman, the com mittee is to be congratulated for sup porting a strong Reserve force and par ticularly for rejecting the administra tion's recommendation to drastically re duce the Naval Reserve. This should be  kept in mind because we do need a strong  Reserve all across the board, and to have  the NavY Reserve cut back as has been  recommended by the administration is  not right for our national defense.  I also wish to point out that I agree  with the bill regarding the nuclear air craft carrier and not choosing a small  one. I made an independent study on  my own, and I have concluded that a  smaller carrier would not be cost eff ec tive but that the nuclear carrier over a  period of years would be the one that  we need for national defense and the  one that we need to be cost effective.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, I want to com ment on the committee's action regard ing civil defense. The committee quite  correctly  recognized  the need  for  in creased authorization for civil defense.  We have too long ignored the necessity  for an upgraded program. The $138 mil lion recommended in the bill will enable  us to begin-I say ""begin""-an appropri ate civil defense for our country, and yet  the committee's recommendations do not  go far enough. Our current civil defense  program is  inadequate in part because  it has not been given proper direction;  it has not been given proper goals. Multi year authorizations have not been au thorized. When we consider title VII of  this bill, I will off er an amendment which  will correct both of these deficiencies.  D 1320  It will direct the President to develop  and execute a  truly multipurpose civil  defense program which could be used in  the event of nuclear war, it could be used  in the event of natural disaster as has  happened to my district, tornadoes and  floods within 1 year, and also it could be  used regarding nuclear accidents similar  to that which occurred at Three Mlle  Island.  The Skelton amendment specifies the  elements which are to be included in civil  defense;  it spells out  the goals of the  program; and it provides for a 5-year  authorization period. The amendment  would also recognize the contribution of  civil defense to the overall st!'lategic bal ance of our country.  Mr. Chairman, I direct attention to the  chart on my right. On this chart, the 39  potential prime targets in America are  set forth in the event of a nuclear at tack. The Fourth District of Missouri  that I represent has 150 ICBM missiles.  We are  told by  the authorities  there  would be some 300, 1, megaton bombs ex ploding in the district that I represent  should we have an attack.  Mr. Chairman,  the adaption of my  amendment will help solve the problems  to protect the people, some 10 million  people in these 39 areas. It will enable  us to start a program of effective national  civil defense. It will also provide for crisis  relocation for  those who  live  in cities  and in urban areas.  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, let me  reiterate my support for this bill. There  are certainly, of course, amendments that  might help to improve it and they deserve  the support of the Members. My amend ment, I feel, is one of the these. However,  on the whole I recommend this bill, I in tend to support it and I recommend it  for a strong national defense.  ",1979

434,House,96,-0.32,1368,18,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise on  this bill in  support of the Schroeder amendment and  would like to do so from a slightly dif ferent standpoint. Most of the people who  have  been  talking  in  favor  of  the  Schroeder amendment are opposed  to  registration and opposed to the draft and  believe that this is one step in that di rection or believe that it would not be  necessary.  I come to it from the standpoint of  believing that we probably do need a reg istration,  that  if you  look-and I  am  agreeing with some of the things that  some of the people have said on the other  side, particularly  the gentleman  from  New York <Mr. STRATTON)' was saying  about the need to have some people avail able, what  the gentleman from Texas  <Mr. RoBERTs) was just saying about the  need to have a manpower pool-the Vol unteer Army was never envisioned as a  force that would be able to fight a war  without a draft. It was always anticipated  by those that were in the Gates Com mission which recommended the Volun teer Army recognized that a draft would  be needed if war was declared.  I  think that if one looks at what is  happening  in  the manpower  require ments, I come to the conclusion that we  probably do need registration. I think the  case has to be laid out a little bit better.  I am very much inclined to the view  that we probably do need a registration.  I, however, am in favor of the Schroeder  amendment for a couple of reasons. One  of those is that the amendment, the way  the bill is written now, we have only one  form of registration which it implements.  It implements  registration which  is  what is called face-to-face registration,  the old registration where you, upon turn ing 18, went down to the Selective Serv ice Office and filled out the forms to be come registered.  There are now in the modern tech nology a lot of other ways that we might  register people and ways to register peo ple which are less onerous and less likely  to produce confiict with the younger gen eration than this way. We could register  by mail. We could register by comput ers comparing various  lists. We could  do lots of other registration forms. I think  that  is what needs  to be studied. We  ought  to  look at the various ways  in  which we can have a  registration and  then make some kind of determination.  A second point in that is that the bill  itself does not institute registration until  January 1. 1981.  We would, if we knocked out that pro vision and  left  in  the study, which  is  what the Schroeder amendment does, we  would still be in time to institute regis tration next year in time to begin it on  January 1, 1981. We would not lose any  time by taking it out at this point.  What we would do by taking it out at  this point is taking.out face-to-face reg istration.  We may find, after our study,  that  face-to-face  registration  is no  longer  necessary. It is very costly to have all of  these draft boards of Selective Service  Board around  the  country. There  is  probably a better way to do it, and if we  had a study which showed another way  was better, then the law that we pass  today would be obsolete because the kind  of registration that we are ordering to  take place on January 1, 1981, is this one  form of registration which  is  face-to face registration.  I think that I am very much inclined  to believe that we do need registration  in this country for a strong defense. We  do need to have a manpower pool avail able, for if war breaks out, we are for  sure going to need to draft people; and  it would be better to have a registration  system in place so that we can use that  manpower  pool  effectively when war  breaks out.  However, there are lots of ways to ac complish that registration, and as long  as we are not going to start registration  until January 1981,  anyway, why not  take the time to do the study and decide  which form of registration would be the  best form.

In my estimation, any bill which ends  the  longstanding prohibition  inter est bearing demand deposits and will  drastically alter consumers' habits re garding :financial services, is of such im portance as to be deserving of considera tion under the regular rules of the House,  rather than under a suspension of the  rules.  I happen to be a cosponsor of H.R.  4986 and a proponent of the provisions of  the bill which authorize the continuation  of share draft accounts for credit unions  and electronic funds transfers for com mercial banks. However,  I am equally  opposed to the section of the bill which  provides nationwide  aUJthorization  for  NOW accounts.  If this bill would have been consid ered under an open rule, Members of this  body would have had an opportunity to  express themselves on each of these vital  provisions. I have always served in this  body under  the assumption  that only  minor bills are considered under suspen sion of the rules-not :financial measures  of serious magnitude and repercussion.  Had the suspension tactic not been used,  I would  have  strongly  supported  an  amendment to delete the authorization  of NOW accounts. Once on record on this  particular issue, I would have then cast  my vote in favor of share drafts and au tomatic funds transfers.

443,House,96,-0.359,37,22,Mrs. BOGGS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  call attention to a very important meet mg scheduled to be held in New Orleans  next month. The First InterAmerican  Conference on Renewable Sources of En ergy will take place November 25 through  29.  The Conference will focus on the real ity of alcohol fuels, the incentives that  Government should provide for private  enterprise, the economic benefits of vari ous crop sources and their byproducts,  the creation of an efficient marketing  s~'stem, and the necessity for rapid im plementation of programs to encourage  the development and use of alcohol fuels.  This forum will be of great interest to  the agricultural interests of America, to  the Nation's consumer, and to the many  countries of  the Western Hemisphere  that are dependent upon imported petro leum.  The participants and the invitees to  the Conference will  include people of  varied backgrounds and interests: Econ omists,  researchers,  representatives of  participating countries, officials of State  and regional organizations, chemical and  industrial engineers, representatives of  marketing companies for equipment for  sugar mills,  factories, distilleries, and  processors.  The goal of the First InterAmerican  Conference on Renewable Sources of En ergy is to draw together all of these in terests and to conclude with a consensus  for the implementation of the objective  of developing viable sources of renewable  energy resources in the Western Hemis phere.  Last week the organizers of the Con ference issued ""A Call to Action for Al cohol Fuel Production."" I insert the call  for action at this point in the REcoan:  A CALL To ACTION FOR ALCOHOL FuEL  PRODUCTION  The First  InterAmerlcan Conference  on  Renewable Sources of Energy, to be held in  New Orleans, Louisiana  (U.S.A.) November  25-29, will bring together policy-makers in  government and industry from  throughout  North and Latin America to formulate a plan  of action for alcohol fuels (gasohol) produc tion.  ""The latest technologies and most relevant  set of economics will be presented as a foun dation on which  to base a  specific alcohol  fuels policy"",  said Louisiana State Repre sentative deLesseps S.

The State of Louisiana is joined as sponsor  of  the Conference by the Organization of  American States (OAS), United Nations De velopment Program, Cordell Hull Foundation,  and the U.S. Agency for International Devel opment (AID).  ""This Conference will bring together the  very best expertise with prominent govern ment and industry leaders who are in a posi tion to influence policies in their respective  states and nations"", Morrison added. ""They  1n  will have an opportunity to exchange knowl edge and experiences.""  Ranking members of  the United States  Congress and Senate will discuss ""The Politi cal and Economic Realities of Alcohol Fuels""  as well as current and future U.S. policies on  renewable sources of energy. The challenge  of  the Conference  ls  to  forge  a policy of  ""Energy  Interdependence  the Western  Hemisphere"".  Industry and government  officials  from  Brazil, Central America, India., Austria. and  the Caribbean will share their expertise and  plans for alcohol fuel production. On  the  smaller scale,  the benefits of ""Appropriate  Rural Technology"" as it applies to farmers  and farm co-ops in the U.S. and Latin Amer ica will be reviewed.  Experts from  throughout  the world wm  discuss  the ""Cost Effectiveness of Alcohol  Fuel Production"" and ""The State of Technol ogy"" as it pertains to sugar, starch, and cel lulose based fermentation alcohols.

As most of us know, one of the major  reasons  that we were able  to get the  Congress to pay attention to this prob lem has been because this problem has  arisen in our urban communities.  0  1610  Unfortunately, in many of our State  capitals, we  find  that  the  legislative  bodies are located in the rural areas, and  now we  find ourselves  in  the city of  New York, as well as other major cities,  with concentrated problems as relates  to drugs, being unable to have input in  the development of these plans. What I  would hope that this amendment would  be able to do is to have $5 million to be  allocated  to make  certain  that  our  local officials have an opportunity to par ticipate and to develop plans, and where  there is a minimum population of 175,000  people, to be able to put a cap on grants  to be awarded to these municipalities and  counties of $300,000 to deal with a prob 1em which is basically urban. The re lationship between NIDA and the local  government is something that I know  even the chairman of the subcommittee,  who has worked very hard to develop  this  legislation would agree, once  the  sensitivity, the understanding as to what  the local problems are.  It is my hope that we can go along  with the Conference of Mayors and the  organization that represents municipali ties and allow those that have the re sponsibility of taking care of their own  the opportunity to have input and to de velop these plans and to present them  to our Federal Government.

457,,96,-0.406,297,22,Mr. MURPHY of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, in his August 2, 1979, environ mental message to Congress, the Presi dent directed that legislation be intro duced to overcome the obstacles which  inhibit law enforcement efforts in con trolling  illegal  trade  in wildlife  and  plants. The bill, ""To provide for the con trol of interstate and foreign commerce  in fish and wildlife"" is designed to im prove our law enforcement capabilities  and  to strengthen the laws regulating  trade in wildlife.  Following  is  a  brief explanation of  the need  for and background of  this  legislation, which was  included  in the  executive communication, No. 2629, sub mitted by the Department of the Interior  on October 11, 1979:  This proposal  repeals  the present Black  Bass Act, as amended  ( 16 U.S.C. 851-856)  and sections 43 and 44 of the Lacey Act of  1900, as amended ( 18 U.S.C. 43 and 44), and  replaces them with a single, comprehensive  statute which we recommend be codified in  Title 16.  The current Black Bass Act prohibits the  fish  importantion or transportation in interstate  or foreign commerce of black bass and other  fish in violation of foreign, State, or other  applicable law, or the purchase of such fish.  As written, however, it does not adequately  deal with the problems in this area. For ex ample, it only comes into play when the law  of  the State of origin has been violated.  Thus,  the shipment of white amur  (grass  carp)  from Arkansas to California. is not a  violation  of  the Act,  notwithstanding  a  California  law  finding  this  injurious  to its environment, because Arkansas has no  law prohibiting shipment of such fish. The  criminal penalties in the Black Bass Act are  also unsatisfactory. The maximum penalty is  $200 or three months in jail. These penalties  provide no real deterrent  to a  commercial  violator and the stands.rd of proof of crim inal intent which is required is so high that  law enforcement officials have no real incen tive for strict enforcement.  Section  43  of  the Lacey Act prohibits  transportation and certain other activities  involving wildlife  and parts  or products  thereof (other than migratory birds, which  are  protected  under  the Migratory Bird  Treaty Act, as amended ( 16 U.S.C. 703-712) )  taken,  transported, or sold in violation of  Federal, State or foreign  laws and regula tions. Section 44 of the Lacey Act provides  for  laibeling  (or otherwise  identifying  the  contents)  of packages containing wildlife  transported  in  interstate or  foreign  com merce. Like the Black Ba.ss Act, section 43  of the Lacey Act may be interpreted to re quire criminal  intent standards which are  very difficult  for  the prosecution  to meet.  The  legislative history of the Act may be  read  to  require  that  the defendant have  knowledge of  the applicable foreign, State  or Federal  law. This has proved  to be a  standard which is nearly impossible for the  prosecution to meet. In addition, section 43  of the Lacey Act contains no provision for  assessing civil penalties without a showing  of knowledge or  lack of due care on  the  part of the defendant. Our bill proposes a  ""strict liability"" provision which  imposes a  moderate penalty following conviction. we  believe that this provision wm be particu larly helpful in cases where forfeiture or a  civil penalty would be a sufficient deterrent  to prevent further violations. The bill also  authorizes criminal sanctions of up to $20,000 in fines and/or 5 years in jail. Further more,  the present  law  provides  only  for  judicial forfeiture. Our proposal provides for  an administrative  forfeiture procedure  for  items of low value similar to the one found  in  the Endangered Species Act and other  wildlife  laws which have  incorporated  the  forfeiture provisions of the customs laws.  We also recommend that legal protection  be extended to species of wildlife not now  covered by  the Act. For example, current  Federal  law apparently does not permit us  to investigate unlawful interstate and for eign traffic in coral, although it is protected  by some State and foreign laws. We encour age the States and foreign governments to  protect a broad variety of species; our legal  mechanisms should be supportive of those  governments  in the  interstate and foreign  commerce area.  The. proposed  legislation  also  broadens  the coverage of  the present Lacey Act  to  include wildlife and wildlife parts or prod ucts taken in violation of Indian tribal law.  This was done  because many  tribes have  management  authority  over  substantial  wildlife resources within their tribal bound aries.  A  reward provision has also been added  that would allow  the payment of rewards  for  information which  leads  to a criminal  conviction,  a  civil penalty assessment or  the forfeiture of property. The amount of  the  reward  if any,  is not  to  exceed  the  ",1979
458,,96,-0.245,310,22,Mr. JONES of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  rise today with sadness to express my  deep regret at the recent passing of one  of Tennessee's greatest conservationists,  Mr. Rudolph Jones. Mr. Jones died at  Baptist Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., on  October 9, 1979.  Without a doubt, Rudolph Jones was  a man far ahead of his time. Long ac tive in civic affairs of Shelby County,  Tenn., he knew full well the need to re place some of the resources we extracted  from the soil as progress was being made.  Having  served on  the Shelby County  Commission for 16 years, he was consid ered a local expert on soil conservation  and flood control, talents that were very  useful in Memphis, a city located on the  Mississippi River.  Rudolph  Jones  took many a  lonely  stand in his efforts to conserve our great est natural  resource as Memphis de veloped and progressed. He was not  afraid of taking those stands, opposing  uncontrolled  development,  because he  knew the importance of following basic  conservation practices. His passing will  certainly  leave a  void  in the Shelby  County area and I want to express my  ",1979
459,,96,0.056,349,22,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President,  the  widespread image of Herbert Hoover as  a President clinging to old ways in the  face of the new necessities brought about  by the Great Depression has been chal lenged in recent years by a  revisionist  theory. This  theory places Hoover as  the forerunner of the tremendous gov ernmental changes which his successor,  Franklin Roosevelt,  expanded.  Impor tant in this discussion is Hoover's per formance as an administrator: Hoover's  one and only elected omce was as our  31st President, whereas he spent many  years in senior administrative roles.  Dr. Peri E. Arnold, of  the Depart ment of Government and International  Studies, Notre Dame University, has  written an essay discussing the longest  and most  intensive administrative as signment of Hoover's life-as Secretary  of Commerce during the Harding and  Coolidge administrations. The essay has  been submitted to me for inclusion in  the series of essays being printed  to  commemorate the 50th anniversary of  the inauguration of Hoover in 1929. Dr.  Arnold  concludes  that Hoover's ""ap proach to the problem of administration  is wholly modern,"" rather than that of a  traditional administrator  in  the Wil sonian mold. Thus, Dr. Arnold supports  a revisionist view of Hoover.  Hoover attacked his new responsibili ties at Commerce with typical verve. He  was given the choice of two Cabinet posi tions by Harding-Interior or Commerce.  Harding had campaigned for the Presi dency on two themes--A return to nor malcy and bringing the best minds into  his administration. His offer to the pres tigious Hoover was entirely consistent  with the latter plank. Hoover's selection  of the Commerce post reflected his be lief  that the country's chief problems  concerned economic stability and recon struction.  What Hoover discovered at Commerce  was an amalgamation of omces and nar row programs brought together for the  purpose of satisfying the call of business  for Cabinet-level representation, with no  common substantive purpose. The broad  and amorphous organic charter of the  Department was of no assistance in shap ing its programs. Symbolically, the De partment represented business; in prac tice,  its  job, as described by an early  Secretary, was ""turning out the light houses at night and putting the fish to  bed."" Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of  Commerce struggled with the problem of  lack of purpose, but his efforts were  stymied by the creation of the War In dustries Board, which became the prime  arena for the Federal Government's re lations with business from 1917 to 1919.  Seizing upon a  climate  in which a  positive  relationship between business  and Government was developing, Hoover  sought to make his Department an in strument for voluntary cooperation be tween  them.  In an attempt  to make  available  leading American  busil)ess  voices to the Department, Hoover invited  leading businessmen to form an ad :visory boa.rd. However, so many sought  :membership that  the plan had  to be  scrapped.  experience  convinced  Hoover that there was no single homog enous business interest which could be  voiced  through  a  single unit  in  the  department. As a result, Hoover created  within the Bureau of Foreign and Domes tic Commerce 17 separate divisions, each  focusing on a major commodity, and  staffed them with experts from the in dividual industries or trade associations.  These units carried out Hoover's pro grams for each of the industries covered.  This  Hoover's major goal  as Commerce  Secretary was to foster market stabiliza tion through cooperation. The Depart ment's contribution would be to provide  the organizational strength to encourage  industries to organize to achieve stabili ty, and to gather and disseminate or ganimtional statistics to aid industrial  planning. Individual industries and trade  associations had been unsuccessful  in  obtaining industrywide data. In a state ment which  should put  to  rest any  thought of Hoover as a laissez-faire ad vocate, Hoover told a  trade association  executive:  We have reached a. state o! national de velopment of such complexlty .  .  . that we  must have a. national planning of industrv  and commerce.  As ambitious as his pl01n  to create  cooperative Government-industry groups  to stabilize and reconstruct industry w~  Hoover's plan to eliminate the economic  waste of a lack of stan.dardi:ziation within  industry. Hoover established a division  of simplified practice within the bureau  of standards to accomplish this purpose.  The division worked cooperatively with  industry,  rather  than coercively,  and  achieved substanti-al success.  One of the means Hoover utilized to  effectively achieve his ends was a very  active public  relations program. This  was e8Sential as his goals involved re shaping the behavior patterns of Ameri can  business.  Hoover  brought  ex perienced  journ.alists and public  rela tions veterans into the department, both  as personal assistants an.d as heads of  operating units. He maintained close re lations with an  important  circle  of  Washington journalists, and used these  individuals as conduits for information  to the outside.  He initiated regular conferences with  the business press, for the same purpose.  Mr. President, Dr. Arnold's essay, ""The  'Great Engineer' as administrator: Her bert Hoover and Modern Bureaucracy,""  presents a highly interesting examina tion of Hoover's remaking of the De partment of Commerce, and of his ad ministrative style.  I  request  that  the  essay be printed in the RECORD at the  conclusion of my remarks, along with  a brief biographic sketch of the author.  The material follows:  BIOGRAPHIC SKETCH OF PERI E.

461,House,96,0.183,388,22,Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois.," Mr.  Speaker,  thank the gentleman from  Missouri for yielding.  There have been several references in  the debate thus far to the Harvard Busi ness School study and it has been made  to appear that perhaps that study was  opposed to any limitations bein~ placed  on PAC contributions. Let me quote some  language from that study:  I  The  study  group  carefully  considered  whether this increasing presence-Speaking about PAC moneymay prove detrimental to the polltlcal sys tem. The arguments whlch seem to us most  cogent are as follows. First, as is frequently  noted, PAC money ls Interested money ....  Second, not so widely observed  ls that a  troublesome aspect of PAC growth has been  the nationalization in the sources of money  avallable  to federal candidates. Candidates  now rely more heavily on money from out side their districts or states.  Does that make this a more repre creasingly dependent on sources of funds  to have candidates in sentative body  outside of  their own State, outside of  their own districts? I think not.  Now, the charge has been made that .  this is a proincumbent bill, that those of  us who support this rule are doing so  so that we can lock into these chairs the  Members who are already seated here.  Nothing could be further from the facts.  The pure, simple fact of the matter is  that more than three times as much of  that PAC money is going to incumbents  as is going to the challengers who would  like to win a seat in this body. In the  last election, in 1978, 176 candidates for  the House of Representatives received in  excess of $50,000 in contributions of this  kind, 32 percent of the contributions that  were received by incumbents last year,  and there was one case which may have  been ref erred  to earlier in the debate  where one incumbent received more than  70 percent of his campaign funding from  public interest group,s, from political ac tion committees.  It has been suggested that somehow  we do violence to the procedures of this  House with the adoption of this rule. One  Member even ref erred to the rule as an  outrage.  Let me tell you what the American  people are really outraged about, that is  the  fact  that  campaigns  are  being  financed in the way that they are and  we, comfortable  in our own ways, go  along, unwilling to examine the problem  and change  it before  scandal breaks  upon us. There is the outrage.  Now,  if you could prove and demon strate  to me for one moment  in one  instance, document for me, that with the  growth of  these political action com mittees, with the explosive growth that  has taken place in the percentage that  they contribute to the total financing  campaign, that there has been this great  rise  in voter participation,  that more  people  than ever before were fiooding  into campaigns and were working, I  for  one would view  this less of a problem  than I do; but the evidence is lacking  to that effect and the evidence, I think,  is quite  to  the contrary,  that as  the  gentleman  from Wisconsin  has  sug gested, if we want to continue to find  ourselves at the mercy of single  issue  politics, if we want to transfer the power  to individual groups and causes in this  country to dominate congressional cam paigns and dominate the debate in this  body by focusing  time and time again  on  their narrow discreet  issue alone,  then defeat this rule.

464,,96,-0.232,466,22,Mr. CAVANAUGH.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased that the House is today consid ering amendmen~ to the Federal Cam paign Act in an effort to bring under  control the ever increasing domination  by powerful special interest groups over  the Congress.  I believe it is high time  that this body consider returning Gov ernment to the people where it properly  belongs and out of the hands of special  interest groups where it is now.  believe the Obey-Railsback bill, as  well as the amendments which were of fered to it, were just and fair to both  business political action committees and  to labor union Political action commit tees, which will all be treated equally  .under this legislation, with no slant in  either direction.  In  the 1978  congressional elections,  labor unions contributed $10.3 million,  while other political action committees  contributed $24.8 million. To see the ef fects of these contributions one had only  to read the August 20, 1979, Washington  Post that stated in June, when the House  Ways and Means Committee watered  down the windfall profits tax, 95 percent  of the members of that committee who  got more  than $2,500 from oil PAC's  voted  the  industry  line-against  the  American consumer and for the oil in dustries.  When this same windfall profits tax  bill came before the full House, of the  236 Congressmen who voted for the po sition of the oil industry 83 percent had  received oil-related PAC money. In view  of these statistics, as well as other data,  October 17, 1979  0  I believe our lack ot a._. g~,qQ. strong en ergy policy can be directly attributed to  the contributions of oil companies and  aftlliated industries. This is just one in:..  stance of where excessive special 1interest  contributions are dictating policy and in juring the public at large.  I have noticed in the mail I have re ceived  in recent weeks on  the Obey Railsback bill the groups who have writ ten in opposition  to  these changes  in  campaign contributions limits have been  the groups with the largest political ac tion coffers and a record of the highest  contributions to the Congress. On  the  other hand, the people who have written  in to me supporting the bill have been  individuals from my district who have  requested that the Congress release itself  from the hold of narrow special interest  groups.  On many occasions I have had the per sonal experience of people in my con gressional district  telling me of  their  support or opposition  to a  legislative  initiative and then having the special in terest group that they belong to which  is typically headquartered here in Wash ington  tell me  that  the  i)eople were  wrong-that they misunderstood. the is sue. I do not think this is the case at  all. I have great confidence in the abili ty of my constituents to think for them selves and to reach rational decisions on  what is good for them as citizens, Ameri cans and Nebraskans.  The growth of special interest groups  in recent years has been  tremendous.  In 1974 there were 608 special interest  political action committees; today there  are 2,000. In 1974 political actions com mittees contributed $8.3 million to can didates for elective office;  in the last  election in 1978 these PAC's contributed  $35.1 million. This trend is frightening  and detrimental to our democracy.  fully recognize the value of special  interest groups petitioning the Congress  on issues which effect their industries  and I invite their input; however, I do not  believe  that  the power of  the PAC's  should be greater than that enjoyed by  individual citizens. I feel the restrictions  provided under the Obey-Ra.ilsback bill  are a much better  approach  toward  restoring the independence of Members  of Congress to make well thought out,  rational decisions on public policy than  wa.S  the suggested public  financing of  campaigns which would have used tax  dollars and which I  firmly opposed in  testimony presented to the House Ad ministration Committee.  Some of the arguments given by the  special  interest  groups  against  the  Obey-Railsback bill have been that it  will  restrict  the voluntary  individual's  contributions. This is hardly the case.  Members will now be forced  to go out  into their districts and solicit both con tributions and votes  from  the people  they represent. This has been my practice since becoming a candidate for elec tive office. The primary financial sup port for -any elective office should come  from the congressional district residen~.  not from Washington based special in terests. Some of my colleagues who have  relied on PAC money rather than small  individual contributions may find themI  ",1979

COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAms  e ",1979
467,,96,0.322,518,22,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, yesterday  the carter administration set into oper ation its new Pay Advisory Committee,  comprised of representatives of business  and labor. The theme of yesterday's in augural meeting was that labor should  desist from pushing for wage increases  to catch up with prices and that busi ness, likewise, should resist pressure for  suoh wage increases. Alfred Kahn,  the  President's dhief anti-inflation spokes man said that wage increases in excess  of p~oductivity ga;ins merely contribute  to the inflationary spiral.  Mr. Kahn's statement  is not wrong,  but the administration seems to be look ing at the wage question through  the  wrong end of a telescope. Moral suasion  to restrain wage demands can never be  as effective as changing the policies that  encourage high wage demands. For ex ample, take the familiar analogy to the  football  stadium where one spectator  stands up to get a better view of the  game. Because that spectator blocks the  view of others, more people stand up  until  the entire stadium  is  standing.  Everyone is on their feet, but no one has  a better view than before. They are just  maintaining their position, as workers  try to do vis-a-vis inflation.  The administration's strategy is like  telling the man in the last row  to sit  down  in order to break up the trend.  While it is possible that the man's ex ample might spread, there is no guar antee that it will. The correct answer is  to get the guy who started it all to sit  down so that others need not try to see  around him. Where  inflation  is  con cerned, that man in the front row is the  Government, which encourages  the fi nancing of wage and price  increases  through the :financing of a burgeoning  Federal deficit.  Fortunately  the  administratdon  is  showing signs of focusfug on the real  problems, and we will have to wait to  see whether they can adhere to fiscal and  monetary restraint. The Pay Advisory  Committee may be best understood as a  sort of psychological backup to the real  anti-inflation process. But the adminis tration, if it is serious about wage re straint, ought to consider eliminating a  major disincentive to such restraint.  It is simply this: Inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets, raising their  real tax  liability, and thus puts  them  farther behind than the inflation figures  alone would suggest. This phenomenon  is  taxflation, and it is a major reason  why people feel compelled to push for  higher wages to maintain their standard  of living. There is no excuse for allowing  such an incentive for high wage demands  to continue in times of high inflation.  Mr. President, the Senator from Kan sas has introduced the Tax Equalization  Act, S. 12, which would end taxflation.  The Tax Equalization Act would require  adjustment of  the  tax brackets, zero  bracket amount, and personal exemption  to compensate for fille effec1ts of infla tion. Taxflation would cease to add to  the :financial difficulties of our citizens,  and they could better afford to moder ate their pressure for higher wages.

468,,96,-0.169,518,22,Mr. STONE.," Mr. President, I believe  that it is essential that any energy as sistance program take into account the  needs of ""warm weather"" States. I ask  that a copy of my letter to the chairman  of the Senate Committee on Labor and  Human Resources, expressing my con cerns with regard to  this program, be  printed in the RECORD.  The letter is as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  Washington, D.C., September 28, 1979.  Senator HARRISON A. WILLIAMS,  Chairman, Senate Committee on Labor and  Human Resources.  DEAR MR. CHAmMAN: For  the  la.st  three  days your committee has held hearings on  the development of a new program to help  low-income households meet the sharply ris ing costs of home energy. I commend your  leadership in this area and strongly support  such a program.  The citizens of my state, and in particular  our large senior citizen population, have been  severely impacted by rising energy costs. Six ty-six percent of all ""low-income"" house holds in Florida are headed by a person re ceiving Social Security Income. As the testi mony before your committee has confirmed,  low-income elderly families will be forced to  spend between one-fourth and one-half of  their income to meet their home energy costs.  In fact, Florida has a large number of house holds in every age group which will be forced  to choose between  the basic necessities of  life, without an energy assistance program.  I a:m very aware of the importance of meet ing  the heating needs of  the  low-income  citizens of our country where the choice 1s  often ""to heat or eat"". However, it ls im portant to point out  that while air condi tioning ls often viewed as a  luxury, it ls a  necessity for thousands of citizens who re side  in Florida and other southern states.  Our elderly in particular suffer disease and  death as a result of exposure to heat. There fore, I believe that it ls essential .that any  energy  assistance  program  reflect  energy  needs beyond just home heating.  It ls especially important that any agency  assistance program  take  into account  the  needs of  ""warm weather""  states because  Florida's utility rates are among the highest  1n the country. This is so in large part be cause of Florida's  historic dependence on  imported residual fuel oil to generate elec tricity.  In summary, I respectfully submit that  in  developing any energy assistance program,  criteria for assistance should be based on:  (1) ab1lity to pa.y for necessary energy;  (2)  need to protect health and well-being; and  (3)  actual cost  increases of energy. These  criteria. will insure that all citizens who need  assistance to meet their basic energy needs  will be provided with the necessary assist ance regardless of their geographic location.  Warm personal regards.  Most cordially,  RICHARD  (DICK) STONE .   S. 1241-THE STATE-BY-STATE  ALLOCATION  e Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President, Sena tors MOYNIHAN, DuRENBERGER, JAVITS, and  I hold a great interest in moving forward  on a more effective water resources devel opment program. Our proposal is S. 1241.  we are pleased with the interest it has  stimulated. Unfortunately,  there  has  been a good deal of misinformation float ing about regarding the effect of S. 1241  and the way money under this bill is al located among the States.  I  recently asked that the Library of  Congress compile a  table showing  the  breakdown of S. 1241 by States. It must  be recognized that there would, of oourse,  be additional funds in the water program  as a  result of regional projects under  s. 1241.  I ask that these tables be printed in  the RECORD.

The statement addresses  the recent  reporting of a so-called ""rift"" between  American blacks and Jews. While accept ing  that differences exist between the  two  communities,  the  statement  re affirms  the commitment of  the signa tory organizations to continue working  together to achieve the shared goals and  purpooes of the leadership conference to  encourage a  just and equitable society.  Free expression of views is at the heart  of our democratic society; coalition poli tics  is  the strength of our democratic  system. This statement confirms  these  two tenets.  The statement follows:  JOINT  STATEMENT  BY  BLACK  AND  JEWISH  ORGANIZATIONS  IN THE  LEADERSHIP CON FERENCE ON CIVIL RIGHTS  For  The undersigned Black and JewiSh orga nizations a.re deeply concerned over recent  reports of a.  rift between Blacks a.nd Jews.  That we have our differences is clear. But to  suggest that such differences constitute a.n  irreparable  rift  is  to misunderstand  tlhe  nature of a. coalition and of our relationship.  The essence of our plural democracy  is  that it encourages every group to express its  views  on whatever  issues  it  chooses  in  accordance with its own values and judg ment.  It  is out of  such differing values,  judgments and priorities th.alt the temper of  our society is forged.  A  free plural society dema.nds not  the  eliinina.tlon of differences but the expression  of differing views without rancor, racism or  an tl-Seinitlsm.  30  yea.rs we,  together with other  groups, have worked  through  the Lea.der ship Conference on Civil Rights in further ance of its stated purpose: to esta.bllsh ""an  integrated,  democratic,  plural  society  in  which  every  individual  ls  accorded equal  rights, equal opportunities a.nd equal  jus tice witlhout  regard  to  race,  sex,  religion,  ethnic origin, handicap or age; and 1n which  every group  is  accorded an equal oppor tunity to enter fully into the general life of  the society with mutual acceptance and re gs.rd for difference.""  In pursuit of that goal, as members of the  Leadership Conference, we have committed  ourselves to support, ""as a. ma.tter Of rlght a. useful  job at a. decent wage for all who  a.re employable or who can be made so by  training or retraining;  income sufficient to  provide  a.11  others with  the essentials  for  living  in dignity and self-respect;  decent  housing  in a. decent environment for all;  medical care for an in health, sickness a.nd  C:XXV--1814--Part 22  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  disa.b111ty; and education to the limit o! ea.ch  person's capacity to benefit from it.""

475,,96,-0.516,609,22,Mr. SABO.," Mr. Speaker, the Railroad  Retirement Act of 1974 provides for the  disbursement of pension checks on the  28845  first day of each month to qualified rail road  retirees. For many  retirees  this  check represents the major portion of  their monthly  income. Financial di1Il culties arise when the check arrives on  a weekend or holiday and banks are not  open.  Unlike  the  social  security  system  which allows for checks to be delivered  prior to the first day of the month if such  date coincides with a holiday or week end, the Railroad Retirement Act pro vides for no such arrangement. A recent  example of this problem was Labor Day.  Due to the Labor Day holiday, retirees  who  received  their  railroad  pension  checks on Saturday, September 1 of this  year had to wait 3 days; until Tuesday,  September 4, to cash their checks. Cer tainly these people had little opportunity  to enjoy their Labor Day holiday.  For this reason yesterday I introduced  H.R. 5606, a bill to amend the Railroad  Retirement Act of 1974 to make monthly  annuities payable before the first day of  the month when the first day is on a  weekend or holiday.   A TRIBUTE TO A. H. ""BILL"" GAL LARDO, ORANGE COUNTY HIS PANIC LEADER  HON. JERRY M. PATTERSON  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 18, 1979  e ",1979
476,,96,-0.367,609,22,Mr. PATTERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  in  each community there are a  few good  people who are known for getting things  done. They are the ones you can rely on  to roll up their shirt sleeves and dig in to  get the job done. For the past 20 years,  A. H. ""Bill"" Gallardo has been one of  those people. His involvement in the His panic community and his many achieve ments on behalf of the working person  have made him a local legend in Orange  County. On November 2,  the LULAC  Council and the Tiempo Sobre El Tiempo  will salute Bill Gallardo for his dedica tion to the local community and his many  accomplishments during his career.  Bill began his career as an apprentice  to  a  plasterer  in  1945,  and worked  throughout the county before becoming  a  business  representative  in 1953. He  served in that capacity for 18 years be fore  becoming  the  representative-co ordinator for the California Labor Fed eration of the AFL-CIO.  In addition to his many years of com mitment to the union and to working  people, Bill has been very  involved in  the Committee on Political Education,  and has earned  the reputation of the  man most likely to get out the vote. His  involvement  in voter registration pro grams. voter education projects, and get out-the-vote efforts have made him a  friend to campaigners in Orange County.  His tireless dedication and commitment  encouraged others to invest that extra  ounce of effort which so often can draw  those few critical votes to tum the tide.  Within the Hispanic community, Bill  ",1979
477,,96,-0.324,622,22,Mr. HARRIS.," Mr. Speaker, one of the  most disturbing trends in national poli tics over  the  last several years  is  the  proliferation of special interest political  action committees and their rapidly ex panding influence in elections, and on  public policy.  I,  like most Members of  this body,  vigorously encourage  individuals of all  persuasions to become active in politics- to contribute and to work for the political  party, candidate, or cause of their choice.  This  grassroots  involvement  is  the  essence  of  American  participatory  democracy.  The flood of PAC money however, is  drowning  the  individual, crowding out  the influence that one person can have  on politics, and replacing concerned citi zen  involvement with  the overbearing  presence of special interest money. These  funds  flow  to congressional campaigns  and can dominat.e elections. Whether we  have  the guts  to admit it or not,  the  pervasive presence of  special  interest  PAC money  is altering  the course of  public policy.  We must limit the influence of PAC  dollars  and  redirect  political  debate  from narrow issues to a broader consid eration of public policy. By passing the  Campaign Contributions Reform Act to day, we can take a  small, but positive  step  to preserve an important role for  the individual in American politics.  There are now nearly 2,000 PAC's in  existence-an increase of 300 percent in  the last 5 years. In 1978,  these PAC's  funneled $25 million  to House candi dates, an  increase of 70 percent over  1976. Even more frightening, 162 House  candidates received more than half of  their campaign funds from political ac tion committees in 1978. This overbearing  presence  threatens  to undermine our  grassroots political structure.  Some have referred to this Congress  as ""the best that money can buy."" Sun day's Washington Post carried an ar ticle  entitled  ""96th Congress: Where  Money Begets Power."" That article legiti mately points out that we, as Members  of Congress, cannot ignore the presence  and the power of special interest money.  October 18, 1979  Under  today's  laws, newspapers can  write stories like the Post article, rais ing the specter of a direct tie between  PAC money and votes on the floor.  Our reputation as individuals, and as  a Congress  is at stake here. But far  more  importantly,  the ability of Con gress to legislate with the confidence of  the people is at stake.  We must not continue to permit special  interest PAC money to cloud our motiva tions,  encourage  speculation  by  the  media, and destroy the grassroots struc ture of American politics. By passing this  bill, we will make it clear that we are  responsive to the people-to the public  interest--and not to the narrow, self-in terested groups that dump millions into  political campaigns.  This is a compromise bill. It preserves  the legitimate role of organized citizens  to present their views and contribute to  campaigns, but  it  limits  the  role of  special interest PAC's to a manageable  scale. It preserves the role of individual,  and will begin to restore our standing  with the American people. It is an impor tant step that we must take. I urge my  colleagues to support the Campaign Con tribution Reform Act, and to  reaffirm  their commitment  to our open demo cratic system.   HYDROGEN FROM COAL  HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY  OJ' IOWA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 18, 1979  e ",1979
478,,96,0.342,622,22,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  last  month I sponsored H.R. 5399 <Hydrogen  Fuel Development and Use Act of 1979>  and asked my colleagues for their sup port of this legislation.  A great deal of discussion is now talt ing place in Iowa to produce hydrogen  from high sulfur content coal for the  generation of electricity.  I  feel  this  is  not only  a  positive  step  forward  for  Iowa, but many other States as well.  The DOE and Jet Propulsion Labora tory  sponsored  a  seminar  recently  in  which preliminary figures were compiled  on the cost of producing hydrogen from  coal. Because of my keen interest in see ing this legislation go forward, I would  like to present these findings to my col leagues and their staffs.  The findings follow:  COST OF HYDROGEN FROM COAL  What  is  the cost of hydrogen from coal  and the para.meters used in calculating the  cost of hydrogen from coal?  COST  The ""first year costs""  for a  large  sea.le  ""grass  roots  type""  coal  gasification plant  are estimated to be $4.07 per million BTU  higher heating value (HHV). This translates  to 24.8 cents per pound hydrogen, hence 25  cents per pound hydrogen.  PARAMETERS  1. First year cost estimates  include de preciations on the total ca.pita.I requirement,  interest, return on equity,  taxes, insure.nee  and investment tax credit !or the first year  of operation.

479,,96,0.391,648,22,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, Sen ate bill 10 is currently before the Judi ciary Committee. This bill would grant  standing to the U.S. Attorney General to  initiate suit against any State institu tion which does not comport with his  idea of what  institutional  conditions  should be. S. 10 would also authorize the  Attorney General  to  intervene  in any  suit which has been ft.led by an inmate  or patient of a State institution.  Mr. President,  this bill  reoresents a  very serious danger to State-Federal re lations. While  the conditions  in some  Federal institutions continue to be atro cious, Federal officials assume they can  best tell State institutional care profes sionals how to run State institutions.  It should come as no surprise,  then,  that State officials are very concerned  about the intrusive nature of S. 10. These  State officials are concerned about their  citizens, and they are fearful that a Fed eral policy of  confrontation,  through  lawsuits,  is going  to be more harmful  than a  policy of cooperation,  through  consultation and aid. If conditions need  to be improved, why should we force the  States to waste valuable needed resources  in protracted litigation. It is in the best  interest of everyone, especially the  mates, to have a coordinated Federal at tempt at cooperation with  the States  without Federal control.  '  Over the last several months, I have  been in communication with many State  Governors and attorneys general and I  in would like to share with my colleagues  the responses from these officials in 29  States. Without exception, the responses  which I have received have expressed op position to the approach authorized by  S. 10. I ask unanimous consent that these  responses be printed in the RECORD.  I  hope  that my  colleagues will  review  these responses and will check with the  officials in their States in order that they  will be able to understand the serious  problems which would be caused by S. 10.

STROM THURMOND,  U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SENATOR THURMOND: This Office has  reviewed the referenced bill and agrees with  your observation  that it may well strain  federaJ.-state relationships in the absence of  any federaJ. funding to permit states to com ply with equitable a.ffirma.tive relief ordered  by federal courts. In addition, since  indi vidual plaintiffs may bring actions under  imposing a  present  law  lesser burden of  proof, the need for this legislation is dubious.  'I1ha.nk you for giving this Office the oppor tunity to  review and comment upon  this  measure.  Yours truly,  FRANK B. NEWELL,  Administrative Assistant.  0cTOBER 3, 1979.  Hon. STROM THURMOND,  Russell Senate Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SENATOR THURMOND:  I  a.m writing  concerning S. 10 which proposes to authorize  the Attorney General to institute lega.I action  on behalf of  institutiona.Iized persons  in  cases Where  such persons a.re purportedly  deprived to rights, privileges or immunities  provided by the Constitution or Laws of the  United States.  It is important to note that the Justice  Depa.rtment already has adequate authority  to act  in  those cases where  it is deemed  necessary, and  that existing controls and  regulations ad.ministered by other Fed.era.I  agencies, vis  a. vis the Developmen ta.I Dis abilities Act, Medicaid and Medicare regu lations, Educa.tion of a.11 Handicapped Chil dren's Act (94-194) provide sufficient protec tion far residents of state-run institutions.  Furthermore, Connecticut,  through  its  proteotive services, and advocacy laws, and  other statutes protecting the handicapped  already has sufficient authority  to protect  the rights of the institutionalized and it is  cUITently exercising it, a.s evidenced by re cent federal court action Initiated by eon necticut's Office of Protection and Advocacy  of  the  Handicapped a.nd Developmentally  Disabled Persons in a. case concerning the  ca.re of mentally retarded persons within this  State.  Should the bill be approved. by the com mittee, I would urge you to consider these  existing remedies prior to making a. decision  on the bill.  With best wishes,  Cordia.Uy,  Ham J. Scott, Attorney Genera.I of the State  of  Illinois. Mr. Scott  recently underwent  coronary bypass surgery or he would have  answered your  letter personally. He sends  his regrets and has asked me to respond for  him.  I  agree with your conclusion  that SlO  would give the United States Department of  Justice too much oversight authority with  respect  to the operations of state institu tions. Section 1 of the Act gives the Attorney  Genera.I of  the United States almost un llmited discretion to decide when to inject  the United States government into the op erations of State facllities. That is not to  say  that some  involvement a.t  some  time  might not be  required because  there a.re  instances where the rights, privileges, and  immunities secured by the Constitution a.re  being violated, but the Bill as it now stands  would give  the Attorney Genera.I  of  the  United States the independent discretion to  make that type of finding. Further, Section 2  of  the Act gives  the Attorney Genera.I of  the United States the authority to virtually  mandate and require sovereign states to do  those actions which the Attorney Genera.I of  the United States, in his opinion, feels a.re  required when  they may not actually be  required.  It is difiicult for state and local govern ments to operate institutions in a. manner  which best  serves not only  the  residents  of its institutions but also the taxpayers who  a.re  required  to support those  institutions.  Adding  yet  another  federal  bureaucratic  taskmaster is not the answer and unless SlO  is modified it would seem to be a. poor Bill  in its current posture.  Again, Mr. Scott had desired  to answer  your  inquiry personally but that was  im possible and if there is anything more that  can be done by  this office please contact  me a.t the above address or call me a.t  (312)  793-3117.  Very truly yours,  FRANK M. GRENAJU>,  Executive Assistant.  DEPARTMENT  OF  LEGAL  OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GEN ERAL, THE CAPITOL,  AFFAIRS,  Tallahassee, Fla., May 14, 1979.  Hon.

481,House,96,0.087,700,22,Mr. ANDREWS of North Dakota.," I  yield to my friend from Washington.  Mr: FOLEY. I know  the gentleman  from Massachusetts <Mr. CONTE)  is in terested in the accuracy of the inf orma tion that he gives to the House, as al ways. He  is a distinguished and able  Member. His statement  that the  raw  value of sugar is 7 .5 cents a pound should  be compared with today's price, the world  price  published  in  the  newspapers  throughout the country of 12.44 without,  without adding any additional fees or  duties.  ",1979
482,House,96,-0.465,700,22,Mr. SHANNON.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong opposition to H.R. 2172. It is  an avowedly protectionist bill designed  to advance  the special  interests of a  small sector of the population at the ex pense of  the majority.  It should be  rejected.  At the present time, the U.S. Govern ment  through a system of import fees  and duties, guarantees that the price of  imported raw sugar will not fall below  15 cents per pound. According to testi mony given before the Ways and Means  Subcommittee on Trade, this price sup port is already costing consumers in ex cess of $2 billion. H.R. 2172 will raise  that price objective to 15.8 cents a pound  through a system of new tariffs and fees.  This amount will be permitted to rise 7  percent annually during the life of this  bill. At the very least, and I believe this  to be a conservative estimate, this will  raise the price tag to consumers by a  quarter of a billion dollars.  This is a simple case of Congress legis lating higher inflation, Alfred Kahn, the  Chairman of the"" Council on Wage and  Price Stability, asked that ""an embar rassed silence"" be noted as his reply to  the question of what this bill's inflation ary effects would be. And this inflation  will hit hardest  those Americans who  already must  spend a  large percent age of their income on food. In a year  where Congress has already legislated an  increase in oil prices, it would be sheer  folly for this House to add to the burden  of the consumer by voluntarily raising  the price off ood.  This bill has another onerous effect. It  seeks to reward an ineftlcient and un competitive domestic  sugar cane and  beet industry with protection and subsi dies, while it penalizes an emcient and  internationally competitive industry, the  American refiners of imported raw sugar.  It has been said that America needs a  domestic industry. I will not debate this  point. The argument has been made time  and again by special interest groups look ing for government subsidies that their  particular industry is crucial to either  the security or the well being of  this  country. I submit that the administra tion already has ample authority to deal  with the sugar problem under existing  statutes. Under section 301 of the Agri culture Act of 1949, the Secretary is au thorized  to provide price supports for  beets and cane through loans and pur chases. The President may already im pose a 50 percent ad valorem duty on im ported products which are  interfering  with the operation of a domestic price  support program. Congress has already  given much att.ention to the fewer than  14,000 sugar farmers in the country. I  believe it is time for the Congress to begin  paying attention to America's 212 million  consumers.  Mr. FOLEY once commented on  the  .floor of this House that it was free and  expanding trade which has given Amer ica her economic greatness and strength.  I submit that the United States should  do all  it can  to reassert her position  among nations as the most productive  and the most eftlcient. Using protection ist laws to exclude inexpensive foreign  raw sugar, using protectionist  laws  to  raise the price of food and to exacerbate  inflation, and using protectionist laws to  reward an inefficient industry while pe nalizing an efficient one, i.s not in the best  interests of  the United States. I urge  this House to reject H.R. 2172.  ",1979

Although  that is quite a ways away, if any Mem bers from the Senate are interested in  attending that meeting now would be a  good time to start thinking about it.

SENATE RESOLUTION 262-0RIGI NAL  RESOLUTION  REPORTED  WAIVING CONGRESSIONAL BUDG ET ACT  Mr. NUNN,  from  the Committee on  Armed Services, reported the following  original resolution, which was referred  to the Committee on the Budget:  S. RES. 262  Resolved, That pursuant to section 402 ( c)  of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the  provisions of section 402 (a) of such Act are  waived with respect to the consideration of  S. 1918, a bill to amend title 10, United States  Code, to revise and make uniform the pro visions of law relating to appointment, pro motion, separation, and retirement of reg ular commissioned officers of the Army, Navy,  Air Force, and Marine Corps, to establish the  grade of commodore admiral in the Navy, to  equalize the treatment of male and female  commissioned officers, and for other purposes.  Such a waiver is necessary because section  402 (a) of the Congressional Budget Act of  1974 provides that it shall not be in order  in either the House of Representatives or the  Senate  to consider any bill or  resolution  which, directly or indirectly, authorizes the  enactment of new budget authority for a  fiscal year, unless that bill or resolution is  reported in the House or the Senate, as the  case may be, on or before May 15 preceding  the beginning of such fiscal year.  For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to sec tion 402 ( c) of the Congressional Budget Act  of 1974, the provisions of section 402(a) of  such Act are waived with respect to S. 1918,  as  reported by  the Committee on Armed  Services.

488,House,96,0.194,804,22,Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee.," Mr. Speak er, as a cosponsor of the bill before us, I  rise to express my support.  Today we are considering legislation  that is very important to my State, the  region, and the Nation. '.!'he Tennessee  Valley Authority is requesting that its  borrowing authority be increased by $15  billion, so that its self-financed electric  power system may continue its successful  operation for years to come.  I hasten to point out to my budget conscious colleagues that we are not con sidering  additional  outlays. This  in creased authority merely allows TVA to  borrow for the purpose of operating the  TV A power program mandated by the  Congress in 1959. Under this program,  the TV A power system is paid for entire ly by the consumers of TVA power.  To keep pace with  the growing de mands made on the system, additional  construction is made possible by the sale  of taxable, AAA rated bonds to the pub lic.  In addition, the Federal dollars origi nally appropriated  to develop the sys tem, are being repaid to the Government  under the terms set forth in the 1959  Self-Financing Act. This amoun1:8 to $20  million a year, to which can be further  added another $75 million a year from  TVA consumers  in a payment  the  Treasury equal  to  the present cost of  money to the Government multiplied by  the balance of the appropriations invest ment.  In the 80,000 square mile area it serves,  the Tennessee Valley Authority alone has  the responsibility to supply its custom ers with the electric power they require  at the lowest I>OSSible cost. Given this  obligation, and the requirements I have  noted,  it is necessary on occasion for  the borrowing authority to be increased.

497,House,96,-0.336,1207,22,Mr. BONKER.," Mr. Chairman, the dis tinguished chairman of  the Merchant  Marine and Fisheries Subcommittee on  Fisheries, Wildlife Conservation and the  Environment has proposed a.n  amend ment  to H.R. 2218 which  raises some  questions about the timing, manner, and  potential effect if adopted by the com mittee. I welcome the spirit of consulta tion represented by this compromise and  intend to vote in favor of the amend ment. But I wish to make it clear that I  do so reluctantly.  The compromise amendment  to  the  endangered  species  authorization  bill  offered by Mr. BREAUX is an improvement  over the original amendment to be sure,  but this amendment places the United  States in violation of the spirit of the  Convention on International Trade  in  Endangered Species <CITES)  to which  the United States is a party. Indeed, the  Department of S.tate has  commented  that Mr. BREAux's compromise would not  be ""an express violation of CITES"".  Let me briefly discuss the reasons for  which I believe Mr. BREAUX's amendment  is not in strict conformity with U.S. in ternational  legal  obligations  under  CITES. The convention intends that the  Endangered Species Scientific Authority  (ESSA), which each country party to the  treaty is required to establish, make in dependent scientific determinations on  whether international trade will threat en the existence of an animal or plant  species. The purpose and  function of  ESSA are clear: It is to act as a check  and balance with the Management Au thority. Although CITES does not spe cifically require the Scientific Authority  to be independent, the Executive order  that established ESSA designated it as  a semi-independent body. Contrary to the  will of the Executive order, Mr. BREAUX  would have the Secretary of the Interior  serve as both the Scientific and Manage ment Authorities, thereby removing the  autonomy of ESSA and raising questions  as to the independent scientific judgment  of ESSA.  Mr. Chairman, the United States has  traditionally exercised a strong and posi tive influence in international activities  concerning endangered species. CITES  was initially drafted by us, and was nego tiated in Washington, D.C., in 1973. We  were the first country to ratify the con vention in 1975, and were,  therefore, a  party when the treaty entered into force  on July 1, 1975.  In  summary, placing  the Scientific  Authority under the jurisdiction of the  Secretary of the Interior could indicate  to the 53 other countries now party to the  treaty a weakening of our commitment  to protect endangered species, and un dermine our leadership in international  efforts  to conserve  the world's endan- gered animals and plants. Moreover, cur tailing ESSA's independence could nega tively affect any future attempts to im prove  American  implementation  of  CITES.  will,  therefore,  not  oppose  the  amendment offered by Mr. BREAUX, but  hope that my colleagues will recognize  the possible negative international im plications of its passage.   The CHAIRMAN. Are  amendments to the bill?  If not, under the rule, the Committee  rises.  Accordingly the Committee rose; and  the Speaker having resumed the chair,  other  there  I  the  Mr. FLIPPO, Ch'airman of the Committee  of the Whole House on the State of the  Union,  reported  that that Committee,  having had under consideration the bill  <H.R. 2218)  to authorize appropriations  to carry out  the Endangered Species  Act of 1973 during  fiscal years 1980,  1981, and 1982, pursuant to House Reso lution 417, he reported the bill back to  the House with an amendment adopted  by the Committee of the Whole.
