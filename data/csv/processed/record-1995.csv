0,Senate,104,0.287,4,3,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr.  President,  I  thank my good friend for permitting  me  to make  that unanimous-consent  request.  Mr. DOMENIC!. The Senator is wel come.  ",1995
1,Senate,104,-0.443,4,3,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, yes terday  the Speaker of the House ad dressed the American Hospital Associa tion. His comments should be reviewed  by every Member of the Senate and by  the American people as well, because  they are an unmistakable preview of  what we can expect  if the constitu tional amendment before us is enacted  and of what the Republican Contract  on American really means.  The  Speaker  said  that Medicare  would be ""rethought from the ground  up."" He  said  that he would  ""make  every decision within  the context of  getting to a balanced budget.""  I am not surprised by the Speaker's  words, because  the  fact  is  that you  can't balance  the budget, protect de fense spending, and provide billions in  tax cuts for  the rich without savage  cuts in the Medicare Program. If Social  Security is kept off limits, the Treas ury Department estimates that Medi care would have to be cut by $77 billion  by 2002---an almost unthinkable 31 per cent of projected program outlays. If  Social Security is also cut, the reduc tions would still be 21 percent of pro gram costs-nearly $2,000 less Medicare  for every senior citizen.  Speaker GINGRICH and the other au thors of the Republican contract don't  seem to know or care how dependent  senior citizens are on Medicare. Even  without any Medicare cuts, senior citi zens spent an average of $2,800 out of  their own pockets for heal th care last  year. This  is  four  times what non elderly Americans spent. Just 7 years  ago,  in 1987,  senior citizens had  to  spend 15 percent of their  income for  medical care-and that was too much.  Today, that proportion has soared to 23  percent-almost $1  in every $4 of lim ited incomes that are already stretched  to pay for food, housing, heat, clothing,  and other essential expenses of daily  living. Senior citizens should be paying  less for medical care, not more.  A word we  are hearing more and  more from our friends on the other side  of the aisle is restructuring the Medi care Program. All of us are interested  in improvements in Medicare, but re structuring is a barely disguised euphe mism for forcing seniors into managed  care and cutting benefits. Senior citi zens should have  the opportunity  to  join managed care plans-as many do  today. They should be entitled to share  in any savings from managed care in  the form of better benefits and lower  premiums-as many do  today. But we  should vigorously oppose any scheme  to balance the budget by cutting Medi care and  forcing senior citizens  into  managed  care  programs  that  deny  them the freedom to go to the doctor of  their choice.  When Speaker GINGRICH and his allies  talk about  a  balanced budget,  they  don't seem to be very concerned about  the budgets of American families-and  particularly the limited budgets of our  senior citizens. When they talk about  freedom  from big Government,  they  don't seem to be very concerned about  the freedom of senior citizens to go to  the doctor of their choice. But I say  those are the budgets and the freedoms  that we ought to be protecting, not at tacking.  The  distinction  between Medicare  and Social Security is a false one, be cause Medicare is a part of Social Se curity. Social Security and Medicare  are the twin pillars of retirement secu rity  for millions  of  senior  citizens.  Like Social Security, Medicare is a sa cred compact between the Government  and the people. It says, ""Work hard all  your life, pay your dues, and we will  guarantee you  security  in your old  age."" We have an obligation to protect  that compact, not only for today's sen ior citizens but for their children and  their grandchildren, for all of us, if we  are fortunate, will some day be old.  When Republicans  in  other  years  tried to break the promise of Social Se curity, senior citizens and their fami lies all over  this country  told  them  that  the answer was ""no."" And  the  Congress responded. Today, it is time  to  say  to NEWT  GINGRICH  and  his  friends that, when it comes to breaking  the promise of Medicare, the answer is  just as  resounding  and  just as un equivocal. And once again, the answer  is ""no.""  ",1995
2,Senate,104,-0.123,4,3,Mr. BREAUX.," I thank the Chair. Mr.  President,  I would  like  to  take  this  time to comment on the event that oc curred this weekend on Saturday and  congratulate the President of the Unit ed States for calling, for the first time,  a bipartisan summit on  the  issue of  welfare ref arm.  The President of the United States,  President Clinton, spent almost 5 hours  sitting  in an all-day meeting at  the  Blair House, and in that meeting were  Republican  Governors,  Democratic  Governors, Republican Members of the  House, Democratic Members  of  the  House, Democratic Members  of  the  Senate, as well as Republican Members  of the Senate. It was truly a bipartisan  effort  to discuss,  I  think, one of the  most pressing problems that is facing  ",1995
3,Senate,104,-0.583,17,3,Mr. WELLSTONE.," His piece begins  with an interesting quote:  We propose * * * to restore the bonds of  trust between the people and their elected  representatives. That is why in this era of of ficial evasion and posturing, we offer instead  a detailed agenda * * *.  This is a direct quote from the House  Republicans' Contract With America.  And  the following comes from House  Majority Leader DICK ARMEY, on Meet  the Press:  The fact of the matter is that once Mem bers of Congress know exactly. chapter and  verse,  the pain that the Government must  live with in order to get a balanced budget,  their knees will buckle.  I  Mr.  President,  yesterday,  in Min nesota, I called on the legislative lead ership in our State to put together a  task force to assess the impact of a bal anced budget amendment on the State  of Minnesota.  did  this, Mr. Presi dent-and  this has been met with a  positive response by legislative leader ship-because last week I came to the  floor with an amendment based upon a  resolution  from my State  of Min nesota.  This  resolution was  passed  unanimously  by  the  State  Senate,  Democrats and Republicans alike, al most unanimously by  the House  of  Representatives, and signed by our Re publican Governor, Governor Carlson,  on January 20.  What  this  resolution  said  was,  ""when""-! changed my amendment to  ""if""-the  constitutional  amendment  passes  the Congress, Congress should  send to the States, send to Minnesota,  an analysis of the impact of this bal anced budget amendment on State and  local government and on the people in  our State.  That amendment was defeated by es sentially a party-line vote. I think I re ceived 45 votes  for  that amendment.  Talk  about  the  right-to-know: my  amendment simply said that if we pass  a balanced budget amendment, before  we send the amendment to the States  we should provide an analysis of its im pact on  the people of  the different  States. I  think every single one of my  Republican colleagues voted against it.  Talk about  the  importance of being  straightforward,  stepping  up  to  the  plate, being direct with the people we  represent. Talk about the importance  of  the  right  to know-people  should  have the right to know what the im pact of this balanced budget amend ment will be on their lives before we  pass it. Talk about the sort of crazy  proposition that before you buy a used  car you shouldn't lift up the hood and  look at the engine.  I was really dis mayed that  this amendment was de feated.  What I am now saying is very con sistent with, I think, responsible public  policy. My fundamental disagreement  with some of my colleagues on  the  other side of the aisle is that I  think  we owe it to people in this country to  lay out a detailed 7-year plan as  to  where we are going to make these cuts  before we pass this. I  think the reason  my colleagues do not want to do this is  because  they do not want  to  lay out  their plans.  Let me give some context, which I  think really gets to the heart of this.  Using conservative estimates, the Con gressional Budget Office estimates that  the interest savings that would come  from the cuts-let us factor that in, let  ",1995

7,Senate,104,-0.397,43,3,Mr. SIMON.," If I may respond, on the  one man-one-vote case, which grew out  of the State of Tennessee, there was no  explicit jurisdiction claimed solely by  the legislative bodies. And here we are  going to claim that we have the juris diction.  If I may respond just to a few other  points that my friend from Louisiana  made, he said-and a  lot of my col leagues will disagree with what I have  to  say here, probably  including my  good  friend  from Utah. The Senator  said, ''This is a good time to take good  bites out of the deficit""-! wrote down  the Senator's words-talking about the  Federal Reserve Board. But the reality  is we are competing with each other  trying to get a tax cut right now.  ",1995
8,House,104,0.54,82,3,Mr. KINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker, what a  great week last week was. The House  took a major and crucial step toward  fiscal responsibility by passing the bal anced budget amendment. If the Senate  does  the  same,  then  fiscal  restraint  will be the law of the land.  But also important last week was the  fact that the Republican Party deliv ered on a campaign promise. This is a  lesson that all politicians need to learn  in today's society. But a second thing  that was very important about it was  that it was done with a bipartisan vote.  We had about 70 to 80 Democrats vot ing  for  this, and as we  look at  the  other elements of the Contract With  America  that we will be considering  this month,  finalizing  the unfunded  mandates bill, passing  the  line  item  veto, criminal justice reform, review of  our national  security situation, and  regulatory  reform,  let us hope  that  that same bipartisan spirit still pre vails, because as the speaker before me  said, we have a major  trade deficit  problem. We need to work on that.  Mr. Speak er, we need to work in a bi partisan  fashion. We  always  do  so  much better when the Democrats and  the Republicans work together.  INTRODUCTION  OF  LEGISLATION  TO  ELIMINATE  THE  CIVILIAN  MARKSMANSHIP PROGRAM  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1995
9,House,104,-0.386,82,3,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  President called for a smaller, leaner,  smarter government.  I  think we all  agree. So today I am introducing a bill  to eliminate the dumbest program in  the entire Federal Government, the Ci vilian Marksmanship Program.  This piece of petrified pork was put  in the budget in 1903 during the Span ish-American War, Mr.  Speaker,  to  teach Americans how to shoot straight.  Ninety years later high-tech weapons  have replaced rifles. It is time to de clare victory and delete this wasteful  program.  While we are fighting very hard  to  get guns off the street, Mr. Speaker,  this  program  hands  out  40 million  rounds of free ammunition, sells sur plus  guns,  and  conducts  an  annual  shooting match. We have  too much  debt and too many needs. to subsidize  recreational shooting.  This program is nothing more than a  special interest boondoggle. Any Mem ber who has ever campaigned against  special interest politics should be em barrassed to vote for it.  TIME FOR THE HOUSE TO STOP  BICKERING AND LEGISLATE  (Mr. HOKE asked and was given per mission  to  address  the House  for 1  minute.)  ",1995
10,House,104,0.338,82,3,Mr. HOKE.," Mr. Speaker, how silly we  must  look  to  the people beyond  the  beltway. They sent us here to govern  and to make changes, but what do we  do? We bicker, we quarrel, we argue.  And over what? The  things  that the  American people really want? No. We  argue over pointless points of order, we  offer  a  multitude  of meaningless  amendments. We bicker over supposed  insults to each other's honor and integ rity in ways that make many people  wonder whether we have either.  To  the folks back home  this place  must  seem more  like  the children's  playground than the people's House.  Mr. Speaker, it is time for the minor ity to get over it and get on with the  business of the people, because if we  continue  to make  this august body  look more  like a playground  than a  legislature,  the American people who  have already lost  their patience will  also lose their hope. The time for play  is over.  Let us get down to real work.  INTRODUCTION  OF  LEGISLATION  TO ALLOW HOUSE MEMBERS TO  RETURN  SURPLUS  FUNDS  TO  THE TREASURY  (Mr. ROEMER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1995
11,House,104,-0.165,82,3,Mr. ROEMER.," Mr. Speaker, yester day Speaker GINGRICH  said  that he  wanted to start a new idea in the House  of Representatives and call it ""Correc tion Day."" He said  to  the American  Hospital Association that he wants to  start 1 day a month where Congress  can act on  a  list of ""the dumbest  things  the  Federal Government  is  doing and just abolish them.""  I would  give  the Speaker  a  rec ommendation that starts right here in  this body. I have introduced a bill, H.R.  26,  that has 52 Democrats and Republicans as cosponsors on it which would  say that when we as Members of Con gress save money in our office accounts  and return money to the U.S. Govern ment, we can have that money go di rectly to the U.S. Treasury to reduce  the deficit  rather  than back  into a  slush fund that is spent on other Mem bers of Congress who exceed their mail  accounts.  Mr. Speaker, let us look in a biparti san way to pass H.R. 26 and continue  our efforts as we started last week to  balance this budget.  THE UNITED NATIONS TAKES  OVER IN HAITI  (Mr. GOSS asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute, and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1995
12,House,104,0.421,82,3,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Speaker, I read in the  paper this morning that the United Na tions is going to take over tbe Haiti  mission because things are stable and  secure in that country now. Of course,  they are still going to rely mainly on  U.S. troops down there, but there will  be new  rules of engagement. We are  only going to use weapons in self-de fense.  But then we read on a little further,  and our Ambassador to the United Na tions, Ambassador Albright, says, ""But  if this U.N. force is pushed, it has the  leaders,  the mandate,  the  firepower,  and the will to push back.""  Now, I call that doublespeak. That is  the kind of  thing  that confuses our  troops, it confuses us, it confuses our  allies, but it probably does not confuse  our .enemies.  It raises  the specter of our  troops  under  foreign  command  in  another  country, under U.N. command, under  Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and it causes  us problems because we do not know  what their mission is.  Ambassador Albright also said that  Aristide has wide popular support, and  that is true. But she failed to say that  apparently the United Nations is un aware that there is intense brutal op position to Aristide as well. So all is  not well, and we should keep our eyes  on foreign policy in Hai ti.  WHAT IS TRULY BEHIND THE $40  BILLION?

13,House,104,-0.216,82,3,Mr. CLEMENT.," Mr. Speaker, what is  truly behind  the $40 billion  in  loan  guarantees  to Mexico?  Some  have  called it a bailout for Mexico, but I  might call it a bailout for the banks  and wealthy financiers and investors in  the Mexican markets.  Mr. Speaker, there is risk involved in  every  investment. These  institutions  and  individuals knew  full well what  was in front of them. They made the  ",1995
14,House,104,0.333,95,3,Mr. RIGGS.," Mr. Chairman, I  the gentleman for his comments.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the chair man of the California Legislative Task  Force,  the gentleman from California  [Mr. DREIER].  ",1995
15,House,104,0.478,95,3,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  my friend for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise simply to reit erate what was stated by my friend,  the vice  chairman of  the California  congressional  delegation,  that being  that our delegation is strongly behind  this. Clearly, the issue of litigation, as  we  look at this question of unfunded  mandates, should be a priority. It has  been demonstrated that there is major  concern and controversy over a number  of particular i terns.  It seems to me that as we  look at  those, ACIR should be in position to in  fact place those items at the top of the  priority list. The Riggs amendment is,  I believe, a very wise and helpful per- fection  to  the Schiff amendment.  I  strongly support  it, and  I know my  California colleagues join in extending  their support.  ",1995
16,House,104,-0.103,95,3,Mr. CONDIT.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the amendment.  I  think  this  is a good amendment.  The fact  that California and several  other States are  involved in lawsuits  and the fact that litigation exists is an  example of proof that the issue of un funded mandates is an extreme prob lem for State and local governments. I  think this is one of the ways for us to  expedite the problems of litigation and  legal problems by getting it before this  Commission and hopefully getting it  resolved.  Mr. Chairman, I  think it is a good  amendment, one that we should adopt,  and I ask my colleagues to support it.  ",1995
17,House,104,0.51,95,3,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I stand in support of  this amendment  that  the gentleman  form California [Mr. RIGGS] and I craft ed.  The  issue here  is very simple. Re gardless of  the views of Members of  this Chamber on the issue of unfunded  mandates, I am sure that they know  full well that this bill is going to pass,  and that everybody in this body would  want to make sure that those matters  have the first attention of the Commis sion during the study of those matters  that are presently in the hands of the  courts or may be in the hands of the  courts later on.  The purpose of this amendment is to  state that because litigation is exist ing, this means that the issue of study ing unfunded mandates in  those par ticular situations is paramount.  Therefore, Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  to  urge the Members of this body to vote  in favor of the Riggs-Manzullo amend ment.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the perfecting amendment offered by  the gentleman  from California  [Mr.  RIGGS]  to  the amendment offered by  the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr.  SCHIFF], as modified, as amended.  The  perfecting  amendment  to  the  amendment, as modified, as amended,  was agreed to.  ",1995
18,House,104,-0.292,95,3,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman,  I will not use very  much time, but I wanted to discuss this  with the gentleman from New Mexico.  On  the amendment  that was with drawn by  the gentleman from Mary land [Mr. BARTLETT], I would just say  that I support the gentleman in what  he is trying to do. The auto emission  testing is a major issue certainly in my  State and in my home city of Houston.  While I support the goals of the Clean  Air Act, we have found that the imple mentation of the program has not gone  as planned, and it is something that  has been  a  problem. There  are not  enough stations, and the lines are long.  the  car  fails  the  testing,  the  consumer must pay for repairs, as well  as return for another test, and that is  quite a bit to ask, particularly when  they are asked to get other tests under  State laws as well.  So, Mr. Chairman, I support the in tent to have the ACIR look at this.  ",1995
19,House,104,0.196,95,3,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1995
20,House,104,-0.592,95,3,Mr. PAYNE of New Jersey.," Mr.  Chairman,  I move  to strike  the req uisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  amendment offered by my colleagues,  Representatives  SCHIFF,  GEJDENSON,  MORAN, and MEEK to delete the provi sion in H.R. 5 that establishes the Com mission on Unfunded Federal Mandates  and would instead require a similar re view of unfunded mandates by the ex isting Advisory Commission on Inter governmental Relations.  This bipartisan body was established  to ensure coordination between the dif ferent levels of government. As a mem ber of the Advisory Commission, I have  been impressed with the ability of the  26-member bipartisan panel which in cludes Members of Congress, members  of  the  executive branch, Governors,  and other State, county, and local offi cials to develop consensus on issues im portant at every level of government.  Mr. Chairman, the Advisory Commis sion  is  currently  in  existence  and  equipped to carry out the mandate pre scribed by H.R. 5. The Advisory Com mission  on  Intergovernmental Rela tions is uniquely qualified to provide  us with the expertise to give technical  assistance on unfunded mandates. This  agency  has  garnered  an  impressive  body of research on this issue.  The Commission has already com pleted a comprehensive analysis of the  impact of unfunded mandates at every  level of government, especially at the  localities where  the  impact of regu latory burden is focused and felt.  It does not make sense to expend lim ited resources to create a new bureauc racy, while we  sit up here  talking  about dismantling a bloated one, when  there is already an existing agency cur rently functioning in the proposed ca pacity.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  to support this very important meas ure, because in all the rhetoric of cut ting unnecessary government machin ery, we have lost sight of the fact that  ",1995
21,House,104,0.382,108,3,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  unanimous consent  to withdraw  amendment.  The CHAIRMAN.  Is  there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Ohio?  There was no objection.  The CHAIRMAN. The amendment is  withdrawn.  Mr. BONI OR. Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment  that was  just with drawn by  the gentleman  from Ohio  [Mr. OXLEY], and I take the time of the  House  to speak on this because it is  such an important issue to those of us  who reside on the Great Lakes.  The Great Lakes are the largest sin gle body of fresh water in the world.  They are an important environmental  and economic resource for this Nation  and for  those of us who live on their  borders.  In 1990, we passed the Great Lakes  Critical Programs Act which included a  measure to level the playing field of all  States that border  the Great Lakes.  The Great Lakes Water Quality Initia tive, or the GLI as it is known, requires  Great Lakes State governments to de velop and adopt uniform water quality  standards, and it is imperative that the  overall mission of the GLI not be un dermined by the amendment that we  were about to consider. This is a clas sic case where the Federal Government  is needed to ensure that each State is  playing by  the  same  rules,  that we  have a  level playing  field,  that one  State does not disadvantage another  State.  The GLI eliminates the competitive  advantage a State might derive by set ting relaxed pollution standards. Now  different States share  resources, and  one has a different approach to manag ing  the resources  than another. Who  mediates the dispute? Logic would sug gest the Federal Government.  I do not always agree with my Gov ernor, Gov. John Engler of Michigan,  but  in  this case he understands  the  need to replace conflicting water pollu tion control  rules  that widely vary  from State  to State with a uniform  comprehensive and enforceable set of  standards, and in this instance I hope  that others of his party will follow his  lead in the future.  While  I do not believe  this amend ment is germane, and it obviously is  not because it was withdrawn by the  gentleman from Ohio  [Mr. OXLEY] at  the suggestion of the gentleman from  Pennsylvania  [Mr. CLINGER],  I would  have opposed it anyway. Good respon sible governing does not  try  to gut  every Federal rule that has ever been  made. It is about resolving issues that  States cannot  resolve on  their own.  This is one instance where the Federal  Government  should and must  inter vene,  and  I  hope, when  this debate  unfolds in the future, that we will re member this issue and we will not give  up on a program that works, is needed  and will help mediate the problems be tween the various Great Lakes States.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  submit  for  the  RECORD an editorial from  the Detroit  Free Press: ""Ban on Federal Mandates  May Even Hurt Great Lakes.""  [From the Detroit Free Press, Jan. 30, 1995)  BAN ON FEDERAL MANDATES MAY EVEN HURT  GREAT LAKES  If you want an example of the mischief  that can be done in the name of heedlessly  doing away with unfunded mandates, con sider an Ohio congressman's move to throw  out the proposed Great Lakes water quality  standards.  The Great Lakes Initiative [GLI) has been  painfully hammered out by business, regu lators,  governors  and  the  environmental  community. The result didn't satisfy every body, but its stunning virtue is that it would  apply  the same rules  to all players: Steel  mills in Illinois, auto plants in Ohio and sew age plants in Wisconsin would have the same  water quality rules as their counterparts in  Michigan.  That protects the Great Lakes, and also  eliminates  the  competitive  advantage  a  state might derive from winking at pollu tion. The principle is critical for Michigan,  which has had tougher water quality stand ards than many of its neighbors. The GLI has  the firm support of Gov. John Engler.  That protects the Great Lakes, and also  eliminates  the  competitive  advantage  a  stage might derive from winking at pollu tion. The principle is critical for Michigan,  which has had tougher water quality stand ards than many of its neighbors. The GLI has  the firm support of Gov. John Engler.  Enter Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, with an  amendment to the unfunded mandates bill  that would turn the GLI into advisory guide lines, rather than rules. That would get Ohio  off the hook and gut Great Lakes protection.  And bad as the Oxley proposal is, it is only  one of scores of similar amendments  the  trash-the-rules gang is lining up to tac.k onto  the measure.  Clean lakes? Safe drinking water? Worker  safety? Consumer protection? Not  if the  mandate-bashers have anything to say about  it. Rep. Oxley's  amendment emasculating  the GLI is bad enough. A rigid, unthinking  prohibition of any form of federal mandate  would be far worse.  D 1420  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. TRAFICANT  ",1995

29,House,104,0.47,147,3,Mr. HUNTER.," I thank my friends for  continuing  to  discuss  this  issue.  I  think  there  is an even greater issue  now  that I hope all of Congress will  start looking at and the American peo ple will look at, and that is the whole  underpinning of this blind adherence to  free  trade that those in the executive  branch and many of our colleagues and  friends  in Congress have adhered  to  over the last 10 years or so. If it is true,  if  these  apocalyptic  claims  by  the  Goldman-Sachs representatives of the  world are true, if you want to have a  poor person Mazatlan send me a  thou sand dollars,  if that is  true  that we  really have tied the United States and  the well-being of our people to the for tunes of a Third World nation which we  cannot control,  then  there  is a  fun damental flaw in our free trade philos ophy.  What  that means is we have hand cuffed ourselves pursuant to the deep  breathers, the free trade advocates, to  a  drowning swimmer,  somebody who  cannot swim.  I am talking about Mexico and other  Third World markets, so-called emerg ing markets  that our  investors have  put billions of dollars into. That is not  a  fundamentally sound economic pol icy for the United States to follow.  So  the people  that helped engineer  NAFTA I think have to answer a cou ple of questions. First,  they have  to  prove that this is an apocalyptic situa tion-and I do not think it is-and I  think Bill Siederman and other respon sible conservatives, moderates, and lib erals in the economic world have made  good statements with respect to that.  But  if our free  trade philosophy has  handcuffed us  to  these nations  that  cannot swim, has put us in the deep  water and said ""Have a nice day,"" then  that  is  fundamentally  unsound  and  fundamentally  flawed and we  should  rethink free trade for that reason.  I  think the gentlewoman from Ohio  [Ms. KAPTUR]  the lady with the rose,  who has always had such an articulate  viewpoint on this very important issue  and keeps coming and coming and com ing on  this issue on  the House floor,  trying  to persuade our colleagues  to  take a seek look at this blind adher ence to free trade. I think in the after math of NAFTA and this debacle a lot  of Members are starting to disengage  themselves from their idealistic philos ophy and look at the real world.  the  gen Mr.  thank  I  thank the gentleman from Oregon  [Mr. DEFAZIO]  also  for his work be cause he has been here night after  night working on  this issue.

30,,104,0.284,160,3,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, today I reintroduc ing  legislation to preserve the Civil War sites  in  the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. The  Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields Part nership Act, which enjoyed wide bipartisan  support  in  the 103d Congress, provides us  with an excellent opportunity  to preserve an  integral piece of American history.  In  response  to a congressional directive Public Law 101-628--the National Park Serv ice  [NPSJ undertook the task of studying the  Civil War sites in the Shenandoah Valley. The  NPS identified significant Civil War sites and  determined  their condition, established  their  relative importance, assessed short-and long term  threats  to  their  integrity, and provided  general alternatives for their preservation.  The Park Service discovered that 15 of the  326 documented armed conflicts in the valley  between 1861 and 1865 were of particularly  high significance. Because many portions of  the valley  retain a high degree of historic,  rural, and scenic integrity, the NPS concluded  that they should be preserved. The two major  valley campaigns-the Thomas J. ""Stonewall""  Jackson Valley campaign of 1862 and the de cisive Philip Sheridan campaign of 1864-are  the major Civil War battlefields not yet pre served. This Congress has an historic oppor tunity to capitalize on  the overwhelming mo mentum of support for this legislation.  Unfortunately, the NPS did not recommend  a  specific preservation  strategy.  Therefore,  some  local valley residents accepted a chal lenge by Park Service staff to devise a plan to  preserve  these  historic  lands. Their efforts  were remarkable. Their dedication and perse verance unflappable. This was  truly a grass  roots effort.  Local residents began to meet and discuss  how these hallowed lands could be preserved  for future generations to learn from and enjqy.  They are eager to share the stories of the val ley-not just battle maneuvers and formations,  but the stories of people dislocated by a brutal  war. They want to share the story of how the  city of Winchester, VA, changed hands be tween North and South at least 73 times, and  how that turmoil affected local residents.  January 31, 1995  After  countless meetings  and  telephone  conversations,  in which  the National Park  Service was consulted, a consensus began to  form around a partnership concept where Fed eral, State, and  local governments, private  landowners  and  preservation  groups  could  work together to preserve these lands. After a  draft bill was ready, we held discussion meet ings  in  the Shenandoah Valley on  the pro posed legislation. These meetings provided an  opportunity for thorough review and comment  by valley residents and officials on this legisla tion. These meetings, attended by  local gov ernment officials,  landowners, business peo ple, and preservationists, served as a vehicle  to refine, modify, and  improve the  legislation  with  the  input and advice of citizens  from  throughout the Shenandoah Valley.  What  I found during those public meetings  was  unprecedented  unanimous  support  for  this legislation. I served at the Department of  the  Interior  in  the seventies under Secretary  Morton, and  I can't  recall ever gaining such  widespread support for a park bill. The legisla tion before  this subcommittee has been en dorsed by every local government where core  battlefield properties are  located. Moreover,  we have a broad, bipartisan coalition of inter ests united to preserve these treasures of his tory. The list that follows my statement, com piled over a year and a half ago, comprises  those persons and entities who endorsed this  partnership approach  to preservation. There  have been many others since this list was put  together.  This House should know that the work of  valley residents did not end with  the drafting  and  introduction of this legislation. There has  been great activity in the past year. The Fred erick County Board of Supervisors and Win chester City Council have appointed a battle field  task  force whose  responsibility  it  is  to  prepare a strategic plan for the protection and  use of the battlefield sites. They have devel oped an  interim action plan which designates  the most critical and significant sites and rec ommends  immediate  actions  to  be  taken.  Frederick County and  the city of Winchester  have also successfully convinced a trustee of  a battlefield property at Kernstown to postpone  a planned auction. Moreover, they have pur chased a $500,000 2-year option  to buy  the  land. Not only have  the  local governments  dedicated time and personnel to planning the  preservation  of  the  battlefields,  they  have  committed scarce resources to protect these  lands. This is an overwhelming demonstration  of  their commitment  to  the successful  imple mentation of a preservation plan.  Local  governments  alone  can't  preserve  these valuable resources; they need a partner ship with the Federal Government to preserve  these  lands. Even  the most well  intentioned  friends of battlefield preservation will find it dif ficult  to keep  the  threats of  residential con struction, commercial development, highway  construction,  and  industrial  development at  bay.  Interstates 66 and 81  bring  increasing  pressure on this rural landscape and threaten  to consume more battlefield land. As the NPS  study  indicates, some critical properties have  already been lost.  Since  the Civil War, most of  the Shen andoah Valley has remained in the same type  of agricultural use, but, as  the Park Service  ",1995
31,,104,-0.267,173,3,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, there is  almost nothing in Government worse  than to have people do significant work  and get almost no credit  for  it. So  today, as  the Federal Reserve Board  once again closets itself in its concrete  temple, locks its door, goes in the se cret room, and makes decisions about  interest rates that every single Amer ican will pay, I figured maybe we ought  to give credit to those who are going to  do the work and cast the votes. I do not  know what is going to be announced in  the next couple of hours, but I am told  by almost everybody who thinks they  know that the Federal Reserve Board  will increase interest rates for the sev enth time in less than a year; for the  seventh time in less than a year they  will increase people's mortgage rates.  I met a  fellow  the other day who  said, ""I am paying $115 more now for  my home mortgage now because of the  Fed."" In the past year, the Federal Re serve has  increased people's interest  rates on credit cards and has increased  the Federal Government's deficit by  $125 bHlion over 5 years just to pay the  interest on the debt.  So they take action that has a sig nificant impact on this country. I want  to tell the American people who they  are. Lord, it seems  to me if you are  doing work  this  important, you at  least need to get credit for it. Let me  tell the American people who is going  to do  this today. This is the Federal  Reserve Board on this chart,  the  top  line of pictures. These people are all  appointed by  the President and con firmed  by  the Senate.  So  they  go  through  the Senate for confirmation.  But  they are  joined  in  that room which the public is kept out of, by the  way-by presidents of the Federal Re serve banks  in  the country,  the  re gional Federal banks.  These people are not appointed by  the President. They are not confirmed  by the Senate. But they are going to go  into  the  room on  a  rotating basis.  There will be five of them in that room  today who will actually cast votes on  monetary policy  and  interest  rates.  They are not appointed by anybody,  not confirmed by anybody. They owe  their jobs to the regional Federal Re serve bank boards of directors, the ma jority of whom are their local bankers.  These folks will go into the room rep resenting the local bankers' interests.  They will take action to increase inter est rates for this country.  The four,  today, who will vote-it is  a  rotating vote-are Mr. McDonough  from New York, Kathy Minehan from  Boston, Michael Moskow from Chicago,  Tom Melzer from St. Louis, and Tom  Hoenig from Kansas City. They will,  with  the Board  of Governors,  cast  votes.  Let me, without being disrespectful,  say  thi&-and I emphasize  that I am  not being disrespectful. I do not have  any idea what is in their heads down at  the Federal Reserve Board. I would like  to have those heads examined to find  out what facts are rattling around in  those heads that persuade these people  that there is a new wave of inflation  somewhere on  the horizon. What per suades them to put the brakes on the  American economy? Who has appointed  them to become human brake pads to  decide  to  slow  down  the American  economy? And whose divine notion is it  that unemployment in America should  never  fall below 5 percent, and eco nomic growth should apparently never  go above 21/2, 3 percent. Where on Earth  did these notions come from?  If this country faced credible infla tion problems, I would not be here at  all  criticizing  the  Federal Reserve  Board. We  have had  four  successive  years of decreasing inflation. There is  no-I emphasize no-credible evidence  that we have a new wave of inflation  on the horizon. Yet, today, and again,  if the pundits are correct, the Federal  Reserve Board will take one more step  that most surely will put the brakes on  the economic progress we have  seen  and probably move this country toward  a recession.  This  is not a  newfound concern of  mine. The Federal Reserve Board oper ates by itself, in secret, and no, I am  not saying let us put politics in mone tc..ry policy. I am not saying give to it  the Senator from Utah to handle or the  Senator from North Dakota or my col leagues in the Senate or the House. But  here is a copy of the Constitution. The  copy of the Constitution begins with  these  three words: ""We  the people"" not we the bankers, the central bank ers or we the Federal Reserve, but ""We  the people."" A question this important,  that affects economic growth  in  this  country and the pocketbook of every  single American, and especially coming  at a  time when all of the credible evi dence would seem to me to imply that  the Fed's policies are wrong, leads me  again  to ask  the question: Why does  this continue? By whose authority does  this continue?  I hope one day soon that we will dis cover a Federal Reserve Board that un derstands that you have two twin eco nomic goals in America. Yes, two: price  stability, absolutely, which has been a  goal in this country for decades. Price  stability and  full employment. Price  stability and economic growth are the  twin economic goals  in  this country,  only one of which  this board cares  much about. And even at that, when it  cares about price stability, it fights the  wrong fight at the wrong time.  I have young children who  look for  dragons under  their bed at night be cause they hear noises and they wonder  where does it come from, where does it  lurk? Then they read books like Tony  the Dragon. When you look at all of  the credible evidence, where are  the  dragons  this board  looks  for? What  fights does the Fed wage, that it wins  because it has no opponent?  I hope one of these days the Amer ican people will get better news from  that Federal  agency,  that  dinosaur  that still operates in secret when the  watchword of American democracy  is  ""openness."" Maybe one day there will  be enough of us here who care and  enough of us here who think alike to  believe  that  reform-yes,  reform ough t to touch this institution as well.  A CALL FOR REFORM  ",1995
32,Senate,104,0.536,199,3,Mr. ASHCROFT.," Mr. President, when  our ancestors were on the verge of a re volt against the British Government,  Edmund Burke  rose  in  the House of  Commons to urge his fellow Members  of the House of Parliament to refrain  from using  force  to  impose  taxes on  those in the United States, which were  then  Britain's  American  Colonies.  Burke had the courage and the wisdom  to speak for conciliation. He foresaw  what no one else did-that if England  persisted  in  taxing  this  country,  it  would lose its empire and would fight a  long war for a bad cause. Burke told  the Members of Parliament that in at tacking America  through  taxation,  they were really attacking their own  British liberties.  As we discuss  the balanced budget  amendment, we usually talk about the  impact of  runaway  spending on our  economy and on our future. Those are  our  fundamental  considerations. But  we also must not lose sight of consider ations that are far more fundamental  and profound. Protracted deficit spend ing empowers the central Government  with the means to undermine our basic  liberties.  We hear it said in this Chamber, and  by the media, that the American peo ple are selfish because  they want the  benefits of Government without  the  cost of taxes. We forget that the power  to impose taxes is a standing threat to  freedom.  Mr. President,  the acknowledgment  that we can only control Government  by controlling its capacity to take our  money is as old as the idea of democ racy. Money was-and is-the source of  the Government's basic power. The tale  of history  bears  testament  to  this  truth. The Magna Carta  prescribed  that the King could not impose taxes  except  through  the  consent  of  the  Great Council. Charles I was executed  because he  tried  to govern without  seeking the consent of Parliament in  spending public money. Let us not forget that the American Revolution it self was rooted in the relationship be tween taxation and representation.  Congress today does not have to vote  to raise more revenue in order to spend  more money.  Instead, our  legislature  takes the debtor's path: Spend and beg;  spend and plead; spend and borrow. Our  current system  lets  the Government  spend on credit and sign the taxpayers'  name on  the dotted  line. When  the  credit card bill comes due,  it is  the  American people who are confronted  with  the dilemma. They  can either  send more money to Washington to pay  the bill or default on the debt incurred  in their name.  When  the American people express  the belief that Government is out of  control-as they did  in this past No vember's election-they,  indeed,  are  correct. For too long, this body has as sembled to satisfy the appetites of nar row interests at the public's expense.  The American people are fed up with a  Congress that spends the yet unearned  wages of the next generation.  Mr. President, deficit spending is not  only a threat to our prosperity and our  children's future,  it is the method by  which Washington's imperial elite has  circumvented the public, the law, and  the Qonstitution. Deficit spending al lows beltway barons to run this coun try without  regard  for  the  people.  Whether it is pork projects or political  payoffs,  the Washington  elite  know  how to play the game.  That must end. A balanced budget  amendment will compel  the Members  of this body to raise taxes if they want  to spend more money. What better way  to restrain spending than that? A bal anced budget amendment will make it  clear to all that the special interest is  rewarded when the citizen is penalized  and that we should refrain from penal izing citizens to reward special inter ests.  What will a balanced budget amend ment mean? It will mean accountabil ity to  the Constitution and restraint  on our spending-in short, it will mean  integrity in Government. It will right ly return the power of the purse to the  people.  Two centuries ago, in a nation across  the sea, Edmund Burke reminded his  fellow Members of Parliament of a fun damental principle. Burke said:  * * * the people must in effect themselves  * * * possess the power of granting their own  money, or no shadow of liberty [can] subsist.  Mr. President,  if we  truly wish  to  preserve  the  liberties  first  inscribed  into the Magna Carta and then brought  to these shores-and preserved through  the blood of revolutions on  two con tinents-it is  imperative  that we  re turn  to  the people  the power of the  purse.  We must take the American Express  card away from the Congress and elimi nate the expense account of the belt way barons. We must make the Mem bers of this body accountable  to  the  ",1995

THE HEALTH PARTNERSHIP ACT  ",1995
34,Senate,104,-0.231,225,3,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, many  people count the death of health care  reform as being in 1994, when the Con gress failed to adopt the proposals that  had been adopted as submitted by the  President, by various factions within  the Congress  itself, by  some groups  that were external to  the Congress. I  personally think that is the wrong date  for the death of health care reform in  America. I believe the appropriate date  for health  care  reform's demise  oc curred 20 years earlier, in 1974.  Prior to 1974 we in fact had a very vi brant,  innovative,  creative  set  of  health care reform initiatives. They all  had one principal characteristic, they  were emerging from the States. We had  a decentralized  federalized  system of  heal th care innovation.  The State of  the Presiding Officer  was one of  those States  involved  in  those early efforts of heal th care re form, as was my State and the State of  Oregon,  the State of our  colleague,  Senator HATFIELD. Maybe  the  best  known example of  those  innovations  that occurred prior  to 1974 was  the  State of Hawaii.  The State of Hawaii set some objec tives  in  terms of increasing  the per centage of its population covered,  to  reduce the cost of health care, and to  focus attention on  the prevention of  illness rather than crisis intervention.  Hawaii, as an example, has achieved al most all the objectives that were estab lished two decades ago.  ",1995
35,Senate,104,0.331,251,3,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to offer a  piece of  legislation  which will be known, I hope, when it  becomes  law  as  the National Park  Service Concessions Policy Reform Act  of 1995.  This particular act is cosponsored by  two of my friends on  the Senate En ergy and Natural Resources Commit tee, the former chairman of that com mittee, Chairman BENNETT  JOHNSTON  and Mr. BUMPERS, DALE BUMPERS, from  Arkansas, who was the chairman of the  subcommittee that handled this legis lation in the previous Congress.  Mr. BUMPERS has been pursuing re form  in  the Park Service concession  policy for, I think, his entire career in  the Senate. I was delighted to join with  him last year and bring about the pas sage of this bill in the committee and  the Senate. It was reported out by the  committee by a vote of 16 to 4, a major ity of Republicans and a majority of  Democrats both supporting it. And it  was passed on this floor a year and a  half ago by a vote of 90  to 9,  dem onstrating tremendous bipartisan sup port for this.  Unfortunately,  our  friends  in  the  House did not act with the same dis patch  that we  did  and,  as  a  con sequence, it got hung up  there,  trag ically, for enough months to mean that  when  the conference report came be fore this body, it ultimately got caught  in the trap of the yearend logjam, traf fic jam and, as a result, the conference  report was not adopted.  So it is necessary for us to introduce  it again this year. l think this year we  will see it move rapidly through both  the Senate and the House and become  law.  The bill that I am introducing is very  similar  to  the one  that passed  this  body 90  to 9 last year, and the argu ments in favor of it are  the same as  they were on that occasion. Very spe cifically, Mr. President, our national  parks, like everything else in life, are  changing. That is, the number of visi tors to the national parks is going up.  As a consequence, the need for services  is changing.  If I can refer to a national park in  my own home State-and we  in Utah  are proud of the fact that we have as  many  national  parks  as  any  other  State in the Union, it is a particularly  gorgeous place in Utah-Zion National  Park in the last 10 years has seen the  number of visitors go from 1.4 million  in 1983 to 2.9 million in 1993, doubling  in a 10-year period. Obviously, in that  kind of a circumstance, the sort of con cession policy that you had 10 years  ago needs to be examined in the light  of this increase.  There, of course, are other reasons  why  this needs  to be examined. The  Park Service  is  itself running out of  money. It is one of the tragedies that  we have  the crown  jewels of the Na tional Park System being starved for  resources just as more and more Amer icans want  to  take advantage of the  beauty  of  these  parks. As  a  con sequence, one of the places people are  looking  for money  is  to  the  royalty  payments  to come  from  the conces sionaires.  Oh, say some, well,  that means the  Government is trying to beat up on the  concessionaires,  the Government  is  trying  to punish  the concessionaires  for being successful. I do not think so.  What we are trying to do in this legis lation is open up the concessions for  competitive bidding and let the mar ketplace determine what these conces sions are worth.  I come from the business community.  I have listened to the concessionaires  as  fellow business people when  they  come and say to me, Senator, you can't  change  the  rules. Well,  the  rules  change all the time as markets change.  I knew that when I was in business. I  reminded them of that in their busi ness circumstance.  But  the most  important reason we  need to change this is because we do  need the power of competition to help  set the rates. We do need  the oppor tunity for new blood and new ideas to  come  in,  even  if  the  concessionaire  does not change. I say to those who are  saying, We're going  to  lose what we  have now under the new policy you are  proposing, Senator, we're going to lose  the concession that we have, I say,  No you are not. If, indeed, you are as capa ble as you say you are, and I believe you are,  if you have the expertise of 10, 15, 20 years  experience as you say you have, you will be  able to compete.

This  administration  has  a  serious  credibility pro bl em. It has ignored the  American people and done a deliberate  end-run around the Congress. I do not  care what obscure  law  the President  cites for his authority. There  is out rage  in my  district,  and  I  suspect  throughout  the State of North Caro lina.  We have rescued the Mexican econ omy  several  times  since  1976.  Each  time we have done  so,  the Mexican  Government has refused to reform it self.  Bailing out investors stuck with bad  pesos is not  the  job of the  taxpayer.  Why should Main Street bail out Wall  Street? What sort of message  is sent  when holders of high-yield securities  are bailed out by the taxpayers?  When Mr. Rubin was chairman of  Goldman, Sachs, his firm did not so cialize domestic profits it earned when  it was speculating. The same system  that rewarded his old firm should work  to penalize his former colleagues who  gambled and lost.  I ask this administration to tell Main  Street, Dunn, NC, it has to pay for Wall  Street's mistakes and a corrupt regime  in Mexico.

37,House,104,0.464,277,3,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Speaker,  the  Environmental Protection Agency  is  just one of the many Federal agencies  that are stiffing local and State gov ernments with bills  they do not pay  for.  For instance the EPA wants the city  of Dallas, TX,  to  totally redesign its  4,500 mile long sewer system. This rede sign would cost $3 billion. This figure  equals roughly three times their yearly  budget.  This is one of the many examples of  an unfunded mandate. There are prob ably thousands more just like it.  Mr.  Speaker,  unfunded mandates  must be reformed because they impose  a  crowding-out  effect  on State  and  local governments. Instead of funding  the basics  like  fire and  rescue, hos pitals, highways, and law enforcement,  local and State governments are forced  to fund excessive, and sometimes ex otic, Federal regulations. We must act  now to curb these excesses and return  to  the Federal Government  the prin ciples of fiscal responsibility.

39,House,104,0.521,277,3,Mr. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr.  Speaker,  over the last 40 years, the Congress has  perfected a new dance-the 10th amend ment shuffle.  The music for this dance starts play ing when the Congress runs out of Fed eral tax dollars to spend, but still has  several key projects on their wish list.  Rather than sitting out a dance, Con gress has instead sidestepped the 10th  amendment and forces States and lo calities  to pay  for  its projects and  dance to its tune.  A classic shuffle is the motor-voter  bill, an unfunded mandate estimated to  cost States some $58 million.  Mr. Speaker, it will cost my State,  Nebraska, over $700,000 to recruit more  people to get registered on the voting  files in a State which already has one  of the highest voter registration rates  in the Nation. It is time to pull Con gress' dance cards and put an end to  Federal unfunded mandates. H.R. 5 will  do  this.  I urge my colleagues to sup port this and make sure we no longer  have to live under the unfunded man dates that the Congress continues  to  send.

42,House,104,0.176,303,3,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, very briefly, I would  like to express my gratitude and appre ciation to a number of people who have  been involved in this now 7or 8-day long debate, which I think has been a  very open, a very constructive debate,  really the first debate that we have had  on the new federalism.  I think what we are seeing is the be ginning of a constructive dialog about  what the relations of the various levels  of government are going to be.  We do not pretend this is a perfect  solution to what may be the new para digm. But what we do suggest is the de bate is necessary. We really have to get  to the point where we are beginning to  analyze which governments need to do  what and which governments can do  them best.  [Mr.  But in  the process of the debate,  I  have got to recognize, first of all, as  has already been indicated, you have  done a superb job in chairing the com mittee during this sometimes conten tious but, I  think, always helpful and  educational discussion we have had.  Second, I thank the gentleman from  Ohio [Mr. PORTMAN], who is a prime au thor  of  this  legislation,  who  has  worked  tirelessly  to bring  it  to  the  point we  are at now. And  the gen tleman from Virginia [Mr. DAVIS], who  has been so effective as a very, very  junior freshman Member and has hit  the  floor  running and done a  superb  job. The gentleman  from California,  [Mr. CONDIT],  the other sponsor, who  has been a  leader  in  this effort  for  many, many years before it really was  an issue that was on anybody's radar  screen. The gentleman from Virginia  [Mr. MORAN], who has made some very  constructive  additions  to  this  bill,  some of which were not accepted. Also,  the gentleman  from New York  TOWNS], who worked on this matter in  the past Congress. And the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr.  GOODLING].  There are so many  that I  really am  afraid I am going to overlook someone.  They have all been outstanding.  D 1530  There are three people that I want to  specifically  recognize. They are staff  members who often are not heralded in  these halls but who, in this case, I can  vouch from personal experience deserve  most of the credit for the fact that this  bill has gotten to where we are today.  This  is Kristine Simmons, who  is on  my staff and the Committee on Gov ernment Reform and Oversight,  and  John Bridgeland, who is with the gen tleman from Ohio [Mr. PORTMAN], and  Steve  Jones, who  is with  the  gen tleman from California [Mr. CONDIT].  They have done an absolutely superb  job  and worked  incredible hours  to  work on this legislation. So my thanks  to all of them for all  the work  that  they have done.  Mr. Chairman,  if you listen closely  today you can hear State and  local  governments  around  the  Nation  breathing a sigh of relief. Today we are  at last ready to vote on final passage of  H.R. 5, a vote I think which is going to  bring at least the beginning of an his toric change  in  the way  the Federal  Government  does  business with  its  State and local counterparts. This bill  will  restore State and  local govern ments to their true places as partners  in our federal system.  Mr. Chairman, I express, again, my  appreciation to the gentlewoman from  Illinois [Mrs. COLLINS], the ranking mi nority member. It has been a pleasure  to work with her on this matter. To all  who participated in this really initial,  most substantive and most important  debate, I  think I would reference the  gentleman from California. This is an  important debate. We are involved in  very important issues here. This is his tory in the making. We do have dif ferences, but I think the debate is what  counts.  The resolution, I hope, will be pas sage of this bill.  If you listen closely, you can hear State and  local governments around  the Nation breath ing a sigh of relief today. We at last are ready  to vote on  final passage of H.R. 5, a vote  which will bring historic change in the way the  Federal Government does business with  its  State and  local counterparts. The Unfunded  Mandate Reform Act will  restore State and  local governments to their true places as part ners in our federal system.  Debate on this bill was rigorous and I want  to congratulate many of my colleagues, on  both sides of the aisle, for casting tough votes  in the interest of stopping this mandate mad ness. Attempts  to weaken  this bill were  re jected consistently and soundly,  reflecting a  majority opinion that imposing unfunded man dates without knowledge or funding  is wrong  and it must end.  I also would  like  to  thank my colleagues  who are not in support of the Unfunded Man date Reform Act,  for  their contribution  to  the  fair and open debate we have had during the  7 days of debate on  this bill.  It has been a  spirited exchange, but a healthy one and  I  thank my colleagues.  As we prepare to vote on final pas sage,  I ask each Member  to consider  the adverse  impact  the cost of man dates has had on your constituents.  Ask yourself if it is fair to raise their  local property taxes and to cut commu nity services so the local government  can afford programs we  think are im portant. Ask yourself if your priorities  are only important if a State or local  government pays to carry them out.  This vote  is about information and  accountability.  It is about changing  Washington ways for the better. It is  an affirmative statement that we will  stop  ourselves  before  we mandate  again.  Please vote ""yes"" on final passage of  H.R. 5.  ",1995
43,House,104,-0.165,303,3,Mr. BROWDER.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I will be brief. I rise in  support of H.R. 5,  the Unfunded Man dates Reform Act of 1995, of which I  have been a strong supporter.  Since coming to Congress, I have had  the opportunity to make decisions on a  variety of good idea that Congress felt  would help improve the lives of its citi zens and help make Government work  better. Of those ideas, the Motor Voter  Act was a Federal mandate costing the  State of Alabama $500,000 a year with out the funding to comply with it.  The Safe Drinking Water Act, an other bill with good  intentions,  re quires local officials to test the water  supply for 25 substances without regard  to the region or the types of substances  used there.  As a result, Alabama water systems  had to test their water supply for pes ticides used to protect pineapple crops.  ",1995
44,House,104,-0.28,316,3,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to com mend my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle for bringing this bill to the  floor under an open rule. I am a fan of  open rules because I  think the Amer ican people deserve full and fair debate  on issues of importance, and issues on  which there are areas of disagreement.  I plan to support this rule on the floor.  However,  feel  compelled  to point  out that at yesterday's Rules Commit tee hearing there appeared to be no op position to this bill. A bill identical to  this one was included in last year's om nibus  public  lands  bill-H.R.  4746which passed the House by voice vote  on October 3,  1994. The current bill  under consideration-H.R. 400-was fa vorably  ordered  reported  from  the  Committee on Resources by a unani mous rollcall of 40 to 0 on January 18,  1995. There were also no witnesses in  opposition to this bill before the Rules  Committee.  It would  seem  to me,  therefore,  that  this bill  could have  been moved through the process in an  expeditious way by simply suspending  the rules or perhaps by asking unani mous consent.  Mr. Speaker, even though this bill is  a noncontroversial one, it is neverthe less an important one for Alaska Na tive landowners and the people of Alas ka. The bill provides for the exchange  of lands within the Gates of the Arctic  Park and Preserve.  It also settles a  longstanding and difficult dispute be tween  the National Park Service and  Alaska Native landowners over the use  of all-terrain vehicles [ATV's] by  the  local residents of Anaktuvuk Pass.  As I  indicated, we do have an open  rule on this bill which I hope my col leagues will join me in supporting.  ",1995
45,House,104,0.492,316,3,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from Colorado  [Mr.  MCINNIS] for yielding this time to me,  and I could just say to my good friend  from Missouri, as my colleagues know,  he says, ""Now I'm not saying  this,""  and, ""I'm not saying that,"" but it is  the inference out there, and the gen tleman knows that really does bother  me.  But as my colleagues know, there are  three  reasons why  these  bills were  scheduled, and I would just like to take  a minute to tell the gentleman.  First our leadership, the Republican  leadership,  the gentleman from Geor gia  [Mr. GINGRICH], our Speaker, has  committed to fewer suspensions since  the process does prohibit amendments,  and we all know that, and we have to  keep in mind that there are, as my col league knows, half of us here  today  that are new Members  in  the  last 2  years, half of us, and those Members, if  they want  to offer amendments, we  want to try to open up this process. We  want to be as open and as fair and ac countable as we possibly can.  D 1640  We want to be open. We want to offer  open rules whenever we can.  Second,  to ensure  that  the suspen sion process is not abused, the leader ship has erected more procedural re quirements before a chairman can even  request that a bill be considered under  suspension, and that is very important.  Third,  there  are  some measures  which may be even non-controversial  enough to consider by unanimous con sent, not even on the suspension cal endar. We have one of those. One of  them was naming a building after one  of the most respective Members of this  body, Bob Lagomarsino. That ought to  be brought up under unanimous con sent, just to show we all agree. So we  did not put out a rule on that. So we  are being selective.  Last, we just went through a process  on  the unfunded mandate bill. There  were 171 amendments offered  in that  bill. There were some stalling tactics  involved, some dilatory tactics, which  the gentleman knows, striking the en actment clause, moving to rise, things  like that. But the House came back to  its senses, there was good comity, and,  because of that, we now will have a  rule of the floor tomorrow morning on  one of the most important issues com ing  before  this  body,  the  line-item  veto, and it is being brought here under  a completely open rule. So, Members,  whether you are Republican or Demo crat, conservative or liberal, you are  going to be able to work your will on  the floor of this House, which is very  important to some Members, especially  the more liberal Members perhaps, be cause they have concerns about it.  So let us not try to shoot down the  sincerity on our part in offering these  open amendments. We are going to do  that as often as we possibly can. I just  had to say that, Mr. Speaker.  ",1995
46,House,104,0.428,329,3,Mr. WAMP.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  come  today as a  freshman Member of this  body with a burden on my heart  to  speak  to  the American people abbut  this crisis in Mexico. I think it points  out that we have a crisis in Washing ton, because some people are still not  listening to the American electorate. I  think the people out here deserve  to  know some of what we are privy  to  know here in Washington, DC, relative  to the Mexican bailout and the actions,  in the last few hours, of the adminis tration.  Today  I was briefed at the Repub lican policy meeting by our Treasury  Secretary, Robert Rubin. While I have  a  tremendous amount of admiration  and  respect  for Mr. Rubin,  I  realize  that he is in a very difficult situation  because he was thrown into, as our new  Treasury Secretary,  this unfortunate  situation in Mexico.  Mr. Speaker, many people in our con ference, in the Republican Conference,  believed for the last 2 weeks as the ad ministration came  to us, Mr. Green span, Mr. Rubin, and made their case  for why we needed to consider a $40 bil lion bailout of Mexico's peso, we be lieved that Congress was the only way  that they could come and tap into the  resources necessary to try to achieve  their objectives.  We did not believe,  from  the ques tions  that we asked at the meetings  which we attended, that the Stabiliza tion Fund was  even possible  to  tap  into. We continued to believe that as  the administration continued to work  with  our  leadership  for  the  last  2  weeks, and proposals were brought be fore us, that they had to come through  Congress where  the money  is appro priated in this country to get even a  little part of money, let alone 40 billion  dollars' worth of money. The Stabiliza tion Fund was off limits.  Today  I  asked Mr.  Rubin,  ""Mr.  Rubin, exactly when and why was the  Stabilization Fund decision made  to  tap into this fund and to use an Execu tive order from the President to take  this $20 billion?"" He gave me three an-  swers.  I  think  the American people  need to hear them.  First of all, he said he  recognized  that it was preferable to come to Con gress for this money. I think it is pref erable. That is an understatement. It is  preferable to come to Congress for a $40  billion loan package to anybody, any  time.  Second, he  said  ""Until  the  Inter national Monetary  Fund,  the  IMF,  raised their commitment from $7-some odd billion to $17 .5 billion, using this  fund was not an option because collec tively it did not get to 40 billion dol lars' worth of guarantees,"" which  is  what they needed in order to meet the  problems in Mexico.  Third, Mr. Speaker, and most impor tantly, he said  the crisis got out of  hand. On Monday the crisis got out of  hand and it required quick and decisive  action.  I  tip my hat to him. Clearly  this is quick and decisive action.  However, Mr. Speaker, let me make  some points representing this freshman  class that was just elected to the 104th  Congress.  Many questions are left unanswered.  Today, still no answers to these ques tions: How  long  is  the  term on  this  debt? Three years? Five years? How  long?  Exactly how is it going to be repaid?  Are these direct payments or are these  loans? Again, today they could not give  us a definitive answer.  What are the conditions that Mexico  must meet in order to receive this fi nancial commitment? Still left unan swered,  yet  through  this Executive  order, $20 billion  is pulled  from  the  Stabilization Fund.  Mr. Speaker, I have not been in Con gress very long, but I was in the real  estate business for a long time before I  got  to Congress.  I can  tell Members  that  if our Government was  in  the  banking business-and I don't think we  ought to be-if we were, we would have  required a pro forma, a first mortgage,  good credit history, on and on and on,  none of which we got.  Mr. Speaker, this is a bad deal for the  American people.  I come to the floor  today outraged for the American peo ple  that,  first,  they have overlooked  the citizens of this country, who spoke  loud and clear on November 8 that they  are  tired of the Government running  off anywhere without them, that this is  their House of Representatives, this is  their Congress,  this  is  their Govern ment, this is their country.  Second, Mr. Speaker,  the Congress  has been circumvented in a major way,  with billions and billions of dollars. I  am a populist conservative freshman. I  represent, I believe, the majority wish es of the Third District of Tennessee,  and  in  fact,  I believe  this  freshman  class represents the heart of the Amer ican electorate. We  are upset about  this.  You  know  one  reason  they  cir cumvented Congress? They knew they  could not get  this  through  this Con gress because  they  ran  into  a wall  called the freshman class of the 104th  Congress, which I believe stood 80 or 90  percent against even talking about a  multibillion-dollar bailout to Mexico.  Mr. Speaker, who is to say this is not  going to happen again? We know that  it is. It is high time, Mr. Speaker, that  the American people have a voice  in  Washington, DC, on either end of Penn sylvania Avenue. It is time we listened  to you. I am here to carry the torch for  the American people.  THE  PRESIDENT'S ACTION WITH  REGARD TO THE MEXICAN ECO NOMIC SITUATION  ",1995
47,House,104,-0.402,329,3,Mr. COLEMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to com mend President Clinton's action today to help  stabilize  the Mexican economy by Executive  order.

69,,104,-0.473,381,3,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I ask you and  our colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating  Morton A. Schrag on  the occasion of his re tirement as director of  the Westside Jewish  Community Center in Los Angeles.  As a  long-time member of  the Westside  Center, and as the congressional representa tive of a substantial number of  its members,  beneficiaries, and staff, I have profound grati tude for all Mort Schrag .has done for the cen ter and our entire community.  During  the nearly  two decades  that Mr.  Schrag served as  the center's director,  the  constituency  it  served  underwent  radical  changes. A previously Anglo area realized a  sharp increase in the number of African-Amer ican families.  In addition, a Jewish community  consisting primarily of Jews who emigrated  from Europe decades ago or were born in this  country experienced an enormous  influx of  newly  arrived  refugees  primarily  from  the  former Soviet Union and Iran.  An  individual  less  brilliant,  creative,  and  dedicated than Mort Schrag would have been  overwhelmed by  the challenge of so many  radical changes occurring over such a short  period of time. Mort Schrag welcomed these  challenges and used  them  to vastly expand  the range of the Westside Jewish Community  Center's programs.  Under Mort Schrag's  leadership,  the dec ades old  educational and  recreational  pro grams were sustained and expanded.  Inten sive new programs were instituted to help im migrants acquire English language skills, mas ter the culture of their new land and, in count less  cases,  achieve  the  coveted  status of  American citizen.  Two of Mort Schrag's innovations attracted  national attention and emulation. He estab lished a Senior Adult Day Care Center  that  addressed  the  special  social,  cultural,  and  interpersonal needs of  individuals whose ad vancing age  led  to  their social  isolation and  limited  their ability  to  continue activities  in  which they were previously involved.  Mr. Schrag also established a Community  College  of  Jewish  Studies  that  brought  Westside Center together with five area syna gogues. This was  a bold move and  rep resented a dramatic collaboration of two tradi tions-the once  secular  centers movement  and the traditional synagogue institutions-that  had previously cooperated only at a minimal  level.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask you and our colleagues  to extend  to Morton Schrag every wish  for  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  good health and success in all future endeav ors, and for continued vigorous community in volvement.  TRIBUTE TO PROCTOR CARTER  HON. IKE SKELTON  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 1, 1995  ",1995
70,,104,-0.172,381,3,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker today I wish to  pay  tribute  to  a great Missourian, Proctor  Carter, who  recently passed away. Born on  April 10, 1907, this former World War II Army  veteran, served the State of Missouri as  the  director of State division of welfare  for 27  years,  the longest tenure served by any wel fare director in the United States.  Educated  at  the University  of Missouri,  Carter received a bachelor's degree in journal ism, and a master's degree in art. He worked  for 1 year at United Press International in Dal las, TX. After that he was assistant to the ad ministrator for the Missouri Relief Commission,  and an assistant administrator of the State So cial Security Commission. In 1946 he became  the director of  the State division of welfare.  After his retirement, Carter was a consultant to  the Missouri Senate, informing on welfare leg islation and appropriations. Carter was also an  active member of  the Academy of Missouri  Squires, Veterans of Foreign Wars, American  Legion, and the American Public Welfare As sociation.  I urge my colleagues to join me in sending  sympathy to his two sons, Robert Joe Carter  and John Wallace Carter. A wonderful  friend  and community  leader, Proctor Carter will be  missed by all who knew him.  BLACK HISTORY MONTH  HON. BARBARA B. KENNELLY  OF CONNECTICUT  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 1, 1995  ",1995
71,,104,-0.346,381,3,Mrs. KENNELLY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to cel ebrate and honor the proud history of African Americans  during  national  Black  History  Month.  African-Americans  have made  invaluable  contributions  to  the economic,  cultural,  sci entific, and social  fabric of our society. By  celebrating February in this manner, our coun try can continue to learn about and draw upon  the strength  that  this history of struggle, en durance, and achievement lends to us all.  This year we will pay  tribute  to  the year  1895, and  its  importance  to  three prominent  African-American  leaders: W.E.B.  DuBois,  Frederick Douglass, and Booker T. Washing ton.  In 1895, W.E.B. DuBois, a distinguished  scholar, became the first African-American to  receive a Ph.D. In that same year, we lost the  Father of the Civil Rights Movement, as Fred erick Douglass passed away. And Booker T.  Washington,  noted  college  president  and  statesman, gave his famous Atlanta speech. It  was a significant period in the annals of Afri can-American history.  As  I reflect on  the  themes of accomplish ment and selfless work, I am quickly drawn to  3325  my district and a gentleman who embodied  the ideals of these great men, until his passing  last December at  the age of 96. The Rev.  Robert Moody was a pastor, activist, educator,  humanitarian, and friend to all who knew him.  For  over 50  years,  he  championed  the  causes of equal rights and education as pas tor of Shiloh Baptist Church. He mentored  countless young people and emphasized the  importance of education to young people. He  broke Hartford's color barrier and became its  first African-American member of the board of  education. He uplifted his congregation and  turned a once debt-ridden church into a thriv ing house of worship.  The Reverend Moody, like others we honor  this month, was a rare and wonderful  individ ual who,  through words and action, helped  make  a  difference  to  countless  people  throughout  the State of Connecticut and  the  Nation.  Mr. Speaker, there are countless men and  women who,  like  the Reverend Moody,  im prove  the  lives of many people on a daily  basis. They may not be as famous as W.E.B.  DuBois, or Frederick Douglass, or Booker T.  Washington, but they are heroes in the same  tradition. I honor the memory of the Reverend  Moody, and  the many others  like him. And  I  also salute  the  future  leaders who will chal lenge this Nation to reach  its great potential.  DOROTHY QUINN OF NASSAU HON ORED FOR OUTSTANDING SERV ICE TO GOP  HON. GERALD B.H.

72,,104,0.492,381,3,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker,  those of us  here  in Washington who were pleased with  the results of last November's elections tend  to  forget  that  the spadework  for  the Repub lican  tidal wave of victories was done, not  here  in Washington,  but  in  the  precincts,  towns, and villages across the country.  Countless volunteers  in our 22d Congres sional District did a lot of that spadework over  the years at the grassroots levels. I have per sonal  reasons  for  being  grateful,  because  these volunteers have  repeatedly helped  re turn me  to Congress with more votes  than  anyone else  in  the whole New York delega tion. They were equally instrumental last year  in the election of George Pataki as Governor.  I'd like to single out one of those outstanding  volunteers today.  Dorothy Quinn of Nassau has been doing  yeoman's work for the Republican Party since  the Eisenhower years. Her first involvement in  local politics was stuffing envelopes, but  this  experienced inspired her and several others to  form a Nassau Women's Republican Club.  In  1957 she was elected  the club's  first presi dent, an office she has held more than once.  Under her leadership the club grew in leaps  and bounds. That leadership was recognized  in  her being  chosen vice chairman of  the  Rensselaer County  Republican Committee,  and  in her serving on  the New York State  Committee.  Also  under  her  leadership,  the Nassau  Women's Republican Club was an active play er in State and national party affairs, including  ",1995
73,Senate,104,0.52,485,3,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President,  I am  introducing legislation to provide for a  45-day  layover of Federal regulations  to permit Congress to review and, po tentially,  reject  regulations  before  they become final.  The Regulatory Oversight Act will  improve the opportunity for Congress  to ensure Federal agencies are properly  carrying out congressional intent. All  too  often  agencies  issue  regulations  which go beyond the sense of reason.  This act provides a 45-day period fol lowing publication of a  final rule be fore  that rule may become effective.  This 45-day period will provide Con gress with an opportunity  to  review  the rule and enact, if it so chooses, a  joint  resolntion of disapproval on a  fast-track basis.  Significant final rules, which the act  defines  as  final  rules  that  increase  compliance costs on State, local, and  tribal governments and the private sec tor of at least $100 million in any year  may not take effect until at least 45  days after the rule is published. This is  the  same  threshold  in  the unfunded  mandates bill. Under current law, most  rules already are delayed by 30 days  pending  the  filing of an appeal. The  delay of 45 days is provided in this act  to avoid economic uncertainties and  harm from  these very large and bur densome rules during the congressional  review period.  Final regulations addressing threats  to imminent health or safety, or other  emergencies,  criminal  law  enforce ment, or matters of national security,  could be exempted by Executive order  from the postponement of the effective  date provided in the bill. However, a  joint resolution of disapproval would  still be eligible for fast-track consider ation.  Although a  joint resolution may be  introduced by any Member of Congress,  the fast-track process for floor consid eration of the joint resolution of dis approval  is only available under  two  conditions: First,  if  the  authorizing  committee reports out the resolution;  or second, if the majority leader of ei ther House of Congress discharges the  committee. The  joint  resolution,  if  passed by both Houses, would be sub ject to a Presidential veto and, in turn,  a possible veto override.  In reality, perhaps only a few regula tions will be rejected by this process.  But by providing a mechanism to hold  Federal agencies accountable before it  is  too late,  the Regulatory Oversight  Act makes an important contribution  to the critical regulatory reform effort.  At  this  time  I would  like  to ask  unanimous  consent  that  a  detailed  summary and  the  text of  the Regu latory Oversight Act to be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  s. 348  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  ",1995
74,House,104,0.559,498,3,Mr. LINDER.," Mr. Speaker, just over  14 years ago, Ronald Reagan was sworn  in as President on the West Front of  this building.  His remarks that day were brief, but  exceptionally stirring and profound. I  recall one paragraph that is as timely  now as on that inauguration day. The  words speak to the motives and goals  of the Contract With America and are  superior to my own.  He said:  You can see heroes every day going in and  out of factory gates. Others, a handful  in  number, produce enough food to feed all of us  and then the world beyond. You meet heroes  across a counter-and they are on both sides  of  that counter. There  are  entrepreneurs  with faith in themselves and faith in an idea  who create new jobs, new wealth and oppor tunity. They are  individuals and  families  whose  taxes  support  the Government and  whose voluntary gifts support church, char ity, culture, art, and education. Their patri otism is quiet but deep. Their values sustain  our national life.  Mr. Speaker, Ronald Reagan will be  84 on Monday, and on  that day  this  House is going to give him a birthday  gift,  something he has wanted  for a  long time: the line-item veto.  THE SECRET BEHIND THE  REPUBLICAN STRATEGY  (Mr. WISE asked and was given per mission  to  address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1995
75,House,104,-0.32,498,3,Mr. WISE.," Mr. speaker, one of those  embarassing genies popped out of the  bottle  last night when NBC-TV  re vealed  the secret behind  the Repub lican  leadership  strategies when  the  playbook was opened  to public scru tiny, and the strategy described might  be a little scary to Americans looking  for true change.  Apparently, according to the Repub lican  leadership strategy, it is all  in  the.wording. You. do not like what you  are doing, call it something else. Amer icans believe, according  to  this play book,  that  the GOP  is mean  and  uncaring. That will not do, so how do  you handle  it? Do not talk honestly  about the programs you are going to  cut that actually serve people, instead  talk about slashing bureaucrats.  If your aim is to cut the capital gains  tax  for  the wealthy,  do  not  say  wealthy, talk about helping the middle  class.  And as the playbook says, the media  is watching what comes first.  The cynicism suggested in the revela tion of  this  confidential memo will  leave a  sour  taste  in  the mouths of  most Americans and  it should.  It  is  time for the GOP to stop sugar coating  their actions with rhetoric and bumper  stickers and honestly explain  to  the  American people what their aims are.

76,House,104,-0.577,498,3,Mr. OLVER.," Mr. Speaker, soon we  will debate the Personal Responsibility  Act in the Republican contract. But.let  us be honest. It sounds more like the  female punishment act. It spells out  exact responsibilities and punishments  for women on AFDC. But it lets fathers  off the hook without even a mention.  Many women and their children are on  welfare only because the fathers do not  support their children.  In my State in  the last 6 months,  4,000 mothers escaped welfare because  Massachusetts makes fathers support  their children. We need to make child  support enforcement part of welfare re form. Both mothers and fathers must  be responsible for the support of chil dren.

77,House,104,-0.38,498,3,Mr. WYNN.," Mr. Speaker, good morn ing,  I  rise  today  to object  to people  playing God in the marketplace.  It is amazing to me that some of the  economists who claim to be such free  traders and such believers in the free  marketplace would  intervene  in our  economy a  record seven  times in the  past year. They have consistently in creased interest rates to the detriment  of the American consumer.  Now, while  I understand that some  restraint and  some  interest rate  in creases are in fact necessary, it seems  to me the Fed ought to at least wait  and see the effect of this last interest  rate increase.  I  can  tell you about  the effect of  their current rate  increase: Variable  ",1995
78,House,104,-0.44,511,3,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr.  KAN JORSKI].  ",1995
79,House,104,-0.303,511,3,Mr. KANJORSKI.,"  I  thank  the gen tleman  from California  [Mr. BEILEN SON] for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I listened with great  pleasure  to  the gentleman from New  York  [Mr.  SOLOMON]  and his  expla nation of the legislation we are about  to pass here that may be such an as sistance  to balancing  the  budget.  I  wish it were just so simple, and I wish  that there had not been a weakness on  the part of not only the Congress but  the President for these last 14, 15 years  to reconcile where America should be.  But the worst thing about this debate  is we are dealing with the balance of  power  that  the  Founding  Fathers  warned about when they structured the  Constitution of the United States. And  before we change that balance of power  it seems to me even though we may not  win,  I suspect  there are 230 votes at  least in this House that will pass this  bill, but before we do that I would hope  this debate brings out the proposition  of what it will do to America and the  American constitutional form of gov ernment  and  the  intentions  of  the  Founding Fathers as they say down in  Philadelphia,  in my home State, and  a  democratic  citizenry  could make  the  proper  judgments  through  their representative officials  to  spending money,  the  taxpayers  money.  Article I of the American Constitu tion does not say that the President of  the United States shall establish such  expenditures  as he  deems  necessary  and shall carry out those expenditures  without any further action. As a mat ter of fact, Article I says the power to  expend money, the taxpayers money of  the American people,  shall  reside  in  the  House  of Representatives,  the  house that represents the people.  The President represents the Nation  as a whole. We as individuals represent  our  individual  constituents. And we  come together as a body by majority  consent  to  expend  the  taxpayers  money. Yes,  it is a give and it is a  take, it is a moderation. Sometimes it  is abused, but let us look at the histor ical significance of that abuse.  In the last 20 years Presidents of the  United States have sent rescissions to  Congress of no more than $70 billion.  That is about $31h billion a year out of  a $1,500 billion budget. Hardly signifievolv~d how  cant. But  the Congress  responded by  cutting $20 billion more, or $4.5 billion  a year on average, a  full 25 percent  more per year than any President re quested.  Does that speak well for the Congress  or for  the President? Quite frankly,  I  do not think it speaks well or poorly  about either. Because when you are  talking about $3 or $4 billion in a $1,500  billion budget it is hardly a  traceable  item, and it is a very fine distinction  as to whether or not the peoples' will  in one  region, area or State of  the  country have some ability to get relief  through the Congress  that the Presi dent does not necessarily see in the na tional interest or toward his political  agenda.  We are putting through a change in  the balance of power here so that we  take the appropriation process out of  the House of Representatives and, to a  large extent, we  transport it down to  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and we put it  on the desk of the President. Now if I  had all  the faith and courage in  the  world to believe we would always have  a responsible President, a stable Presi dent and a President that had no polit ical agenda or  ideological agenda,  I  would say if we wanted to change the  constitution that way, there are ways  of doing it. But not necessarily being  as optimistic as most Members of the  House who will approve this bill are, I  can  foresee  the day  that what  the  President decides  is a priority of ex penditures  for  the American  people  may not be consistent with their Rep resentatives' actions or intent.  1200  Let us look at some examples:  Say California has an earthquake;  say New York City has a major fire or  destruction. What is the sympathy in  the Congress of the United States to al locate amounts of money for California  or New York and, if we do it, may have  to expend above and beyond  the bal ance of the budget? But a President  who looks at those two States and sees  no political  ramifications  if he dis avows that expenditure, could just as  easily strike that expenditure from the  budget, and we would have no recourse  unless  it were brought back  to  this  House and passed by a majority of the  House. And then we say, ""Well, that's  not unreasonable,"" and I agree.  Mr. Chairman, that would not be bad,  but the gentleman from New York [Mr.  SOLOMON]  indicated that was the rem edy, that the majority of the House of  Representatives  could  overrule  the  President at will. That is not true, Mr.  dhairman, because  the President has  the opportunity to veto that measure,  and to override  that veto it requires  two-thirds of the House of Representa tives and two-thirds of the Senate, a  majority that is overwhelming and sel dom had, and, quite frankly, if we had  that ability  today, we would not be  0  ",1995
80,House,104,0.192,524,3,Mr. BLUTE.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, now  is  the  time  to  give the President of the United States  the line-item veto authority. This issue  has been kicking around up here on  Capitol Hill for decades, and has been  discussed and chewed over, committees  have heard  testimony,  and  still we  have not done what needs to be done  and give the President this needed tool.  We  already have an example of it  working in our system of government.  It has been field-tested in the 43 States  that now have a  line-item veto  for  their Governors. We have heard testi mony in the committees from liberals  and  conservatives,  from Republicans  and Democrats, that the line-item veto  works as a tool to keep the budget in  lin~. There can be no doubt about that,  and it is time that the President had a  similar tool.  Beyond that, Mr. Chairman, I think  it needs to be pointed out that in the  last Presidential campaign, both  the  Republican candidate, the Democratic  candidate,  and  the  independent can didate all supported giving the Presi dent a line-item veto authority. It was  as close to a consensus issue as there  was in that campaign. The American  people support it by the polls. I believe  it is time we did what the American  people want and give the President this  very important tool.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman  from Wisconsin  [Mr.  NEUMANN], one of the original sponsors  of the line-item veto bill.  ",1995
81,House,104,0.667,524,3,Mr. NEUMANN.," Mr. Chairman, I be lieve this particular bill is important  for a whole variety of reasons. First  off, I will tell you when I campaigned  last fall, I was concerned as to whether  or not we would be able  to actually  keep the promises in the contract. This  is important, because it is another one  of those steps to keep the promises we  made last fall during the campaigns.  More  important than that, our Na tion right now today is $3.8 trillion in  debt. If every man, woman, and child in  the whole country were  to  take out  their checkbook and just pay off their  share of the national debt, they would  need to pay $18,500. For my family of 5,  the Federal Government has borrowed  $92,500. Just think about this. Over the  last 15 years, this Government has bor rowed $92,500 on behalf of my family of  five. To just pay the interest on the na tional debt, my family must write out  checks or pay taxes, if you like, of over  $6,000 a year. The people in my district  back  in southeastern Wisconsin have  average incomes of $32,000 a year, and  yet they must write out checks just to  pay the interest on the national debt of  over $6,000 a year.  I strongly support this line-item veto  and was one of the original sponsors,  because I think it is one of two pieces  of legislation that will stop this situa tion.  In Wisconsin,  Governor  Tommy  Thompson has  successfully used  the  line-item veto to hold down spending,  to  balance  budgets without  raising  taxes on  the Wisconsin people, and I  believe we should be using those Wis consin ideas here in Washington, DC.  The other reason I strongly support  the line-item veto is because it is a bi partisan effort and it is very encourag ing to me to come out here, being out side  the world of politics, and be  in volved in a bill that has bipartisan sup port, where both sides of the aisle are  working together to get it through. It  is very, very important if we are going  to reduce the Federal spending that we  get this piece of legislation through.  I do not think this is the end-all. I  think  there  are many, many more  steps  that are necessary  to actually  balance the Federal budget. But this is  certainly a very important first step as  we move  forward on completing  the  items  in  the contract  that we have  pledged to the people last fall.  ",1995

83,House,104,-0.432,550,3,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this  amendment  in  the strongest possible  terms.  I do not know how many are going to  listen, I do not know how many heard  before about  the  line-item veto. But  how can you say you are for the line  item veto to turn over the authority,  the explicit, direct authority and obli gation that we have in swearing to up hold and defend the Constitution, de fend our prerogatives and obligations  as a legislative body, a line-item veto,  you say, and then when the President  comes back with all of those line items  taken out which you have just voted to  give to him, say, ""But what if we don't  like it? What if there are some items  we don't want?""  So this is a fewer i terns bill you are  about to pass if you have this in, not a  line  item. Fewer items. You want  to  pass a legislative line-item veto bill.  One of the Members from the other  side, who I believe is chairing it for the  Republican Party, says, ""What if the  President does  something  egregious?  Then it comes back to us, and we get  to pick 50 Members to go against ev erybody else and get the rest of us to  go along With me on this.""  If you think deals .have been cut in  the Committee on Appropriations,  I  now see the Committee on Appropria tions as the enemy of us all.  Please, I have been in a  legislative  body too long. I understand how poli tics works. I am proud to be a part of  that tradition. I am not going to quiver  and be some craven cur down  there,  saying, ""Well, if the President sends us  back something that we volunteered on  this floor to give him, then if we find  some items, we can get 49 other people  to stand up with us, we will  take it  back.""  How can you have the gall to stand  up and parade yourselves in front of  the American people,  talking about,  ""We do not have the discipline to do  anything for ourselves, we are going to  have the President do it for us; how ever, if there are some items that are  taken out that we want and we can get  49 of our buddies to go along with us,  then we are going to see if we can't get  the other 218 that we need to go along,  and we will be able to get ours""?  I warned that the small States were  going to be at risk here. You know that  the big States and the big-power, spe cial interests you talk about, private  interests-I do not care whether you  are talking about the space station, I  do not care whether you are  talking  about a particular item, a dam or a  river, whatever it is you want to deal  with the public works-this is going to  open the whole thing back up again.  The hypocrisy of this whole line item  veto is made manifest by this amend ment.  I am waiting to see whether this is  voted through or not, because if it is,  let the record state here clearly that  this means we have a  legislative line  item veto bill in which the deal-mak ing and  the  logrolling will be  some thing like you have never witnessed in  the 200-plus years of this Republic.  This is going to be the granddaddy,  the mother of all pork-barrel bills,  when this comes out if you folks pass  this, and it is going to be on the record.  And in honor of this final decline and  fall of the Constitution of the United  States and  the House of Representa tives in particular, Mr. Chairman, I ask  unanimous consent to be able to enter  into the RECORD the disquisition made  in the Senate in 1993 by the Honorable  ROBERT BYRD on the line-item veto.

It was suggested that an obtrusive,  Socialist  government  or  President  might arise and abuse  the  line-item  veto.  It is our contention that every lead ership over the last 40 years has tried  to prevent the line-item veto, and now  they want to sunset it.  Second, it will affect future genera tions. A balanced budget amendment,  unfunded mandates, and line-item veto  will keep this Congress from spending  our children's and children's children's  future away.  The other side has had 40 years  to  pass this, and in the next 40 years they  may have, or the next thousand years,  they may take the majority again. We  want to establish a  line-item veto in  which a President is answerable to the  American  people  for  that  line-item  veto on every item that he forces.  If he abuses it, he himself will be an swerable at election time.  ",1995

Anyone who has been  listening  to  this debate can attest to the fact that  many of our colleagues really do not  know what this bill does. Members con tinue  talking about all of  the Gov ernors who have this authority, when  in fact H.R. 2 is very different than the  authority the Governors have.  Many continue  to believe  this  is a  true line-item veto bill when in fact it  is not. By the proponents' own admis sion,  this bill contains,  instead,  the  most  powerful  rescission  . authority  imaginable.

",1995
88,,104,-0.569,589,3,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker, we and seven  other members of  the Progressive Caucus  today are introducing one of the 11 bills of the  Progressive Caucus Alternative-The Progres sive  Promise-to  the Republican Contract  With America. Our  legislation will create at  least 1 million new jobs for unemployed Amer icans in each of the next 2 years by rebuilding  our Nation's highways, bridges, mass transit,  and other physical  infrastructure and by  in vesting in  job training and expanded services  for the most needy in our society.  This major jobs bill goes to the heart of the  sweeping  legislative  package  that  the  33  members of the Progressive Caucus unveiled  2 weeks ago as the only comprehensive legis lative alternative brought forth in the Congress  so far that charts a positive alternative course  of policy action  to  the Republican Contract  With America.  More specifically, our ambitious jobs bill will  provide $63.6 billion  in new  investments  to  stimulate  the national economy during  fiscal  years 1996 and 1997.  It  is  fully paid  for by  eliminating  tax  loopholes  that  reward U.S. based multinational corporations for investing  abroad and exporting U.S.  jobs and  through  targeted progressive tax increases that will fall  principally  upon  the  unearned  income  of  upper-income Americans.  Beginning  in  the 1940's and reaffirmed by  the Humphrey-Hawkins Act  in 1978, Federal  law has deemed 4 percent unemployment as  the hallmark of a strong and stable economy.  But now we are confronted with a Republican  welfare reform plan that abandons our national  commitment to training and providing jobs for  millions of unemployed Americans who des perately want to work and attain some small  measure of economic security for themselves  and their families.  The members of  the Progressive Caucus  believe  that  it  is  cruel,  short-sighted,  and  counterproductive to enact welfare reform leg islation without providing  jobs  for millions of  unemployed Americans who are ready, willing,  and eager  to be a part of  the mainstream  American economy.  Furthermore, we believe  that  fundamental  fairness dictates that upper-incorne Americans  who have received the biggest tax cuts during  the last 15 years, as well as highly-profitable  multinational corporations  that have enriched  themselves by  investing huge  sums of  in creasingly scarce capital to manufacture over seas and to take advantage of cheap, unpro tected foreign  labor, pay their share to retool  and rebuild our Nation to compete more eff ec tively in the 21st century.  Full employment is what America  is about.  It is our promise to ensure that every Amer ican has a job with an adequate income that  enables individuals and families to join in the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  American dream. No one  that  is willing and  able to work should be denied that opportunity  or should have to work 40, 50, or 60 hours a  week and still live in poverty.  This is not a new concept. It was the center piece of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's  ""Eco nomic Bill of Rights,"" proposed in 1944 as part  of his last State of the Union Message. In it he  called for jobs for everyone willing and able to  work. The Universal Declaration of Human  Rights and the International Covenant on Eco nomic, Social and Cultural Rights  recognize  work as a basic human right.  One in every 10 American families now puts  food on  the  table only with  the aid of  food  stamps. Tens of millions more survive on bare  subsistence, from paycheck to paycheck. Mil lions have fallen into unemployment or under employment.  In more and more abandoned neighbor hoods in America, a lack of jobs, income, edu cation, and hope has created an extraordinary  climate of savagery and violence surpassing  that of many communities in third world coun tries.  In 1978 with the passage of the Humphrey Hawkins  Full  Employment  and  Balanced  Growth Act, the U.S. Congress made a prom ise to Americans. Congress made a contract  with America  for  full employment, where  the  national unemployment rate was not to exceed  4 percent.  Before we move on  the Republicans' Con tract With America and balance the budget on  the backs of poor, hard-working Americans,  we have an obligation to carry-out a 50-year old promise for full employment. Five decades  ago, our national  leaders recognized what  is  still true today: that there are numerous eco nomic and social costs to the Nation without  full employment. Those costs were stated  in  the Humphrey-Hawkins  legislation. Without  full-employment we are:  Depriving our nation of  the  full supply of  goods and services, the full utilization of labor  and  capital  resources,  and  the  related  in creases  in  economic well-being  that would  occur under conditions of genuine full employ ment;  Lacking sufficient output of goods and serv ices to meet pressing national priorities;  Depriving workers of  job security,  income  skill development, and productivity necessary  to maintain and advance their standards of liv ing;  Exposing many  families  to social, psycho logical, and physiological costs,  including dis ruption of family life,  loss of individual dignity  and self-respect, and the aggravation of phys ical and psychological  illnesses, alcoholism  and drug abuse, crime and social conflicts;  Undermining Federal, State and  local gov ernment budgets by deficits due to shortfalls in  tax  revenues and  increases  in expenditures  for unemployment compensation, public as sistance, and other recession-related services  in  the areas of criminal  justice, alcoholism,  drug abuse, and physical and mental health.  Depriving businesses, especially small busi nesses, of the production, sales, capital flow,  and productivity necessary  to maintain ade quate profits, undertake new investment, cre ate jobs, compete internationally, and contrib ute to meeting society's economic needs.  These days, more people at work  is bad  news  for  the economic pundits and  financial  3533  speculators. Declining unemployment should  be good news. Too many of  those who do  have work are employed in low-wage or dead end jobs. Statistics reveal that in the first half  of last year, for instance, 27 percent of all new  jobs were in the temporary-help industry, and  a further 26 percent were part-time. Less than  half of the new jobs were private sector, non temporary  jobs. Manpower,  Inc.,  the  leading  provider of temporary workers, is now the larg est private employer in America.  If we  look at wages we again see the de cline  in well-paying, permanent  jobs.  In  the  Reagan-Bush eighties, the hourly pay of four fifths of the American workforce declined. The  typical worker was paid 4.9 percent less than  at the start of the decade. No wonder workers  in the United States slipped from 1st to 13th  in  terms of  the wages and benefits  they  re ceive.  Today,  almost  a  third  of  the Nation's  workforce-31 percent-is employed at pov erty level pay. The current minimum wage, at  $4.25 an hour, buys 26 percent  less  in pur chasing power than the minimum wage did in  1970.  Is  it any surprise  that a recently-pub lished  study  found  that  low-paid American  workers are the lowest paid workers in the in dustrialized world?  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  insists that creating more jobs, and  reducing  unemployment, is bad for the economy. He is  dead wrong.  What we need  is more jobs. We need  to  create millions of decent-paying jobs, not en courage massive corporate downsizing. We  need a bold and courageous Congress who  will  fight for the needs of the average Amer ican worker, not timid politicians whose vision  is circumscribed by the campaign contributions  of big money  interests.  It  is  time  to address  the  jobs crisis  that America, and American  workers, are facing.  The Progressive Caucus is leading the way  to a brighter future and  taking the first  large  step  forward, and  today we  invite others  to  join us  in  this effort. We encourage our col leagues to become cosponsors of this bedrock  bill in our Progressive Promise-The Job Cre ation and Invest in America Act of 1995.  We call upon all Americans who want  to  build a stronger and more fair America to join  in our commitment to create millions of jobs by  investing billions of dollars to rebuild and up grade America's physical infrastructure, clean up the environment, and improve the skills of  our workforce.  In keeping with the fiscal chal lenge confronting our Nation  in  these  times,  we do not add a penny to the deficit, but pay  for our investment program by cracking down  on corporate welfare. We close tax  loopholes  for offshore production while  rewarding U.S.  companies  that  invest, produce, and create  jobs  in  the United States. We  require  the  wealthiest U.S. corporations and citizens  to  pay their fair share of taxes.  Finally,  let us underscore that the jobs we  seek to create are good-paying jobs. They are  jobs rooted in upgrading our Nation's physical  infrastructure  and  improving  our  Nation's  human capital. They represent investments in  restoring real, long-term, sustainable economic  growth in America.  Retooling our national economy and basing  it upon  real economic growth and economic  ",1995

90,House,104,-0.346,628,3,Mrs. KENNELLY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to  introduce  a  resolution  ex pressing the sense of Congress that the  blind should continue  to be able  to  earn as much as senior citizens under  the Social Security earnings test. I will  offer an amendment in the Ways and  Means Committee when  it marks up  the Republican contract  to continue  the same earnings test for the blind as  seniors will have under the Senior Citizen's Equity Act. This action will en sure  that blind  individuals can con tinue  to be self sufficient, productive  members of society.    In  1977,  Congress  established  the  same earnings exemption standard for  the blind and retirees under the age of  70. In fact, this action was championed  by the present chairman of the Ways  and Means Committee, and provided  blind  individuals with  incentives  to  contribute as members of  the work  force.  Blindness is often associated with ad verse  social  and  economic  con sequences. It is often difficult for blind  individuals  to  find sustained employ ment or for that matter employment  at all. Action by Congress in 1977 pro vided a great deal of hope and incen tive  for  the blind population in  this  country.  The Republican Contract With Amer ica raises the earnings test for senior  citizens from $11,160 a year to $30,000 in  the year 2000. However, the bill specifi cally de-links blind workers from this  increase in the earnings test.  It is my hope that the link between  senior citizens and blind  individuals  can continue. Let's not remove the in centive  to work  that we were wise  enough to offer the blind in 1977. Many  in this country want to work and take  pride  in working and contributing to  society.  I have always been a supporter of the  blind. When I first came to Congress in  1982  I  successfully offered an amend ment as a member of the Public Works  and Transportation Committee  that  gave the blind priority to provide vend ing machines at rests areas and safe  areas on the National Interstate High way System. Since  that  time nearly  every State has passed similar State  laws. This action has provided lucra tive revenue opportunities for over 600  blind people  throughout  the country  and has been considered by many as a  major revenue source for the blind.  We in Congress have been successful  in the past 20 years in providing oppor tunities for the blind to succeed. Let us  not go back, let us move forward and  extend the increase in the earnings ex emption that we are providing to sen iors to the blind.  I urge my colleagues to support this  important resolution.  PRESERVING THE REPUTATION OF  THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  ",1995

106,Senate,104,-0.342,654,3,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President,  to morrow  is a  critical date  in United  States  trade  relations with  the Peo ple's Republic  of China  [PRC]. The  United States Trade Representative  has found that the PRC is seriously de ficient in its protection of intellectual  property rights. Talks have broken off,  and unless  the Chinese change  their  laws and improve their enforcement at  this eleventh hour,  the United States  will impose steep tariffs on a number of  products imported from the PRC, start ing tomorrow.  I am disappointed that the situation  has deteriorated  to  this point. More  than 1 year ago I invited the Chinese  Ambassador, United States executives  and other Members of the Washington  congressional delegation  to my office  to  discuss  this  issue.  I  spoke with  President Clinton and U.S. Trade Am bassador Michael Kantor as well. I en couraged all sides to get together and  work toward a solution to the problem.  As a proponent of free  trade, I am  hopeful talks will be resumed and the  Chinese Government will take serious  steps  to protect intellectual property  rights. Hard-working  people  in  the  State of Washington are  losing  too  much money to international pirates.  This must end, and our  relationship  with  this  important  trading partner  must resume as quickly as possible.  It is up to  the Clinton administra tion, and, more  importantly,  to  the  Chinese,  to show some  leadership. If  China wants to be a global economic  player, they have to play by the global  economic rules. And those rules don't  allow piracy.  Mr. President, as you know, I come  from a State which is, per capita, the  largest exporting State in the country.  Washington State is home to America's  single largest exporting company-the  Boeing Co. We send the literal fruits of  our labors---our apples and wheat-to  every corner of the globe.  And, we are the site of some of Amer ica's most  forward-looking,  cutting edge industries. We have big companies  like the Microsoft Corp and Nintendo  of America as well as small concerns  all along the I-5 corridor which special ize  in a dazzling array of high tech nology and biotech products.  These companies produce goods rich  in  intellectual property,  the corner stone of American innovation. Protect ing these inventions through intellec tual property rights is vital. Enforcing.  copyrights,  patents  and  trademarks  means  that when you build a better  mousetrap, you can reap the rewards of  innovation. That's why we need and  have strict laws in this country which  protect inventions and punish thievery.  I am pleased that intellectual prop erty has been included as a new dis cipline  in  the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade [GATT]. Accordingly,  it is  important  that all our  trading  partners uphold and enforce the strong est intellectual property laws possible,  especially those countries that wish to  join the GATT.  That is why the looming deadline is  so  disheartening.  I  sincerely  hope  China will address this situation, and  prove they deserve a place in the global  economic community.  WILLIAM J.

REMARKS AT DINNER HONORING WILLIAM J.  BAROODY, JR., OCTOBER 11, 1994  ",1995
108,Senate,104,0.271,667,3,Mr. GORTON.," Mr.  President,  the  Senate is not now at this moment de bating directly  the merits of House  Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budg et amendment. By reason of actions  taken by the distinguished Democratic  leader and the distinguished majority  leader, the issue before the Senate of  the United States at this moment is an  amendment proposed by the majority  leader  to a motion proposed by  the  Democratic  leader on  the duties  re spectively of the President and of the  Congress of the United States in reach ing a balanced budget. The  leader of  the Democratic Party proposes to add  to the Constitution a longer set of sec tions than the balanced budget amend ment itself, a detailed set of instructions,  the fundamental basis of which  is that the balanced budget amendment  will  not  even be  submitted  to  the  States until there is, in effect, a bind ing 7-year budget leading to a balance  in  the year 2002  and overriding  the  judgment of all Presidents and all the  new Congresses which will be elected  between the day on which we are en gaged in this debate and the year 2002.  The  obvious purpose  for  requiring  such a  totally unprecedented move is  to  obscure  the  debate  over general  principles; that is to say, is our present  fiscal system broken? Do we need  to  take drastic action to enforce a dis cipline on Congress and on the Presi dent to balance the budget? Or to the  contrary, is the status quo quite satis factory? It is to obscure that debate in  the details of a hypothetical attempt  to see 7 years in the future and say  today precisely how the budget will be  balanced 7 years from now. The hope,  of course, is that a large number of ele ments in any such proposal could be  presented as unacceptable to the Amer ican people, and,  therefore, undercut  the willingness of the States to balance  the budget.  In response to that attempt to hide,  to disguise  the  true  issue before  the  body,  the majority  leader has  in a  much  simpler substitute amendment  proposed  that  if this  constitutional  amendment  should  fail  of adoption,  should  the  judgment of this body be  that the status quo is just fine, that we  do not need any change, the majority  leader has proposed to direct the Presi dent of the United States this year to  submit a proposal to Congress stating  how he would balance the budget.  The majority  leader has made  this  proposal, of course, because so many of  the Members of this body on the liberal  side of the debate have given eloquent  lip service to the ideal of balancing the  budget but have said at the same time,  ""Not this way. Do not touch the Con stitution. Do not make any fundamen tal changes. Just go ahead and do it.""  But on this,  the fifth day of this de bate, not one of  those Members has  come up with a single detail outlining  how he or she would reach that goal  without the stimulus, without the dis cipline of a change in our Constitution.  Each of those Members has defended  eloquently  the  status quo. Each of  those Members has said that we do not  need a  fundamental change. Each of  those Members  have  spoken  about  tough votes, discipline, political cour age. But in each case, depending on  how long the Member has served, each  of those Members has voted consist ently for budgets which would never re sult in a balance in what we  take in  and in what we spend.  So the majority leader's proposal is  one of great simplicity and great logic.  If someho.w or another  there  is any  duty on the part of the proponents of  change of constitutional discipline in  this connection to say how they would  solve the problem, is there not an over whelmingly greater reason  to require  of those who say no change, keep the  status quo, to tell us how they would  reach this goal, a goal which quite ob viously has not been  reached  in  the  last year, in the last decade, in the last  several decades?  Personally, I believe that the major ity leader's amendment is designed far  more to outline the absurdity and the  lack of reason behind the Democratic  leader's amendment than it is  to be come a serious part of the fiscal dis cipline of this Nation. I do not believe  the President of the United States can  come up with a detailed item-by-item  proposal  to balance  the budget some  years after he will cease to be Presi dent of the United States.  I regret that all we hear is that the  budget  that he comes up with next  week will  include  figures  indicating  that the budget of the United States  will never be balanced pursuant to the  policies which he proposes. But I do not  think that this Congress, on the rec ommendation of the President, should  adopt unchangeable policies 7 years in  advance.  Well, if the President should not be  required to engage in such an activity  in the year 1995, how much less reason  is there not only for the proponents of  this amendment to follow such a dis cipline but to include that discipline in  the Constitution of the United States  of America?  Mr. President, can you imagine our  basic constitutional document  refer ring to sections in the Budget Act of  and  speaking  of  reconciliation  bills,  talking of details which are en shrined in our statutes, statutes which  can be changed by  this Congress at  will? Can any individual seriously state  that he or she would include two extra  pages of detailed verbiage in the Con stitution of the United States, all of  which will become anachronistic before  the constitutional amendment is ever  ratified by the various States?  No, as a matter of policy,  the pro posal of the Democratic leader is over whelmingly  flawed.  It  is, by greater  measure, his duty in defending the sta tus quo to tell us how he would reach  our common goal  than it is the pro ponents of this amendment. So his pro posal is flawed as a matter of policy. I  have also pointed out, Mr. President,  that his proposal is flawed as a matter  of aesthetics, a very important branch  of aesthetics-the way  in which we  treat our Constitution.  The  last speaker on  this floor,  the  distinguished Senator from Maryland,  has  talked at  length  and  in detail  about why we should not include the  general proposition about how to bal ance  the budget and a  set of super majori ty requirements in the Constitu tion. Yet, I warrant, he intends to vote  in favor of the motion made by  the  1974  ",1995

111,Senate,104,-0.419,732,3,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President, as my  colleagues  know, we  have  all been  elected to the Senate to make the dif ficult policy decisions  that confront  our Federal Government. Every day on  the Senate floor, we engage  in deci sionmaking that is the essence of the  legislative process.  Some decisions that come before the  Senate are rather commonplace, such  as how much to spend on scientific re search or whether we will build and  maintain new highways or ports. Other  decisions  are much more  profound,  such as who will become the next Su preme Court Justice, or whether or not  our Nation will go to war.  No decision a Senator makes it more  profound than our vote on an amend ment  to  the Constitution. Amending  the Constitution  is an extraordinary  legislative action  that has occurred  only a few  times in our Nation's his tory.  The first 10 amendments, which we  know as the Bill of Rights, were pro posed and ratified almost immediately  after  the Constitution  itself.  In  the  next 200  years, only 16 amendments  were proposed by Congress and ratified  by the States.  This experience tells us that the bal ance and compromise crafted during  the  Constitutional  Convention  has  served us very well. We are governed by  a remarkably res111ent document, and  it is a tribute to our Founding Fathers  that the Constitution has been amend ed so infrequently.  I  am  deeply  concerned  that  the  amendment we  are now  considering  wm upset the delicate balance of power  forged during the Constitutional Con vention of 1787. The balanced budget  amendment would transfer fundamen tal spending and taxing authority from  Congress to the executive branch. By  this  amendment, we would  unravel  mechanisms  that our Founding Fa thers delicately weaved into the fabric  of  the Constitution  to keep  the ex cesses of the executive,  judicial, and  legislative branches in check. I genu inely  fear  that  the balanced budget  amendment would give rise to an impe rial Presidency. And let us remember  that domination by  the Executive  is  what caused us to abandon our rela tionship with England and establish a  great democracy.  During hearings convened by House  and Senate committees, many profes sors of law and learned constitutional  scholars  expressed well-founded  con cerns  that,  if ratified,  the balanced  budget amendment would permit  the  President to  impose  taxes or fees  in  order  to enforce  the amendment.  It  would also implicitly or explicitly re peal  the  impoundment control meas ures contained in the 1974 Budget Act.  The notion that the Executive should  be allowed to impose taxes without the  concurrence of Congress  is a  radical  proposition.  It violates  the constitu tional principle  that Congress alone  should have the power to lay and col lect taxes.  Our Constitution  is  a  remarkable  document. As ratified by the States, its  fundamental elements are now familiar  to us all: A government divided into  three parts-each part  separate and  distinct-and each armed with tools to  defend  against  the  excesses  of  the  other.  Yes,  our  Constitution  has  been  amended over  the years. We have 10  amendments that set forth fundamen tal rights guaranteed to all. We have a  number of housekeeping amendments  which establish the electoral college,  provide for the election of Senators by  popular vote, and establish an orderly  process in the event of the death of the  President. We have amendments that  secure freedom and promote universal  suffrage, such as the 13th, ending slav ery; 14th, due process, equal protection;  15th, end discrimination; and the 19th  and 26th amendments, vote for women  and 18-year-olds.  But none of these amendments reor ders  the  fundamental  structure  of  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

112,Senate,104,0.356,771,3,Mrs. HUTCHISON.,"  I  think the Sen ator from Maine is making an impor tant point. When you are doing some thing that is as important as this, we  do need  to do  it right because  it is  going to be an amendment to our Con stitution that will last. Our Constitu tion has prevailed over the centuries  because we have been very careful not  to bind future generations. With  the  Constitution, less is more.  There is one thing that we have to  do, and that is make a bottom line. We  have  to  say,  like  every business  in  America,  like  every  household  in  America, like every State government  and every local government in Amer ica, there is an end. We must set our  parameters and then work within those  :parameters to set our priorities. That  is what every other entity in America  does.    As the Senator from Maine has said,  this is the time. It is a very short win dow that we have to make a difference  in the direction this country is going,  and we have the mandate.  For the first time, the House of Rep resentatives  has  passed  a  balanced  budget amendment, and if we miss this  opportunity, it may be that the window  will not return.  I wonder what all of these people who  are convinced we should not have an  amendment,  I wonder what  they are  going  to say to the American people  about how they will balance the budget  if they do not want it in the Constitu tion and they say, show me first. Show  me what you are going to do if we do  not have it. What is going to be dif ferent today than 34 out of the last 35  years? Isn't that really the question?  ",1995
113,Senate,104,0.091,771,3,Ms. SNOWE.," Will the Senator yield?  I  think that is exactly the question.  Would you not agree that those who  are opposed to a constitutional amend ment have a greater burden to prove  how they could enact a balanced budg et statutorily, because all previous at tempts have failed time and again?  There has been obfuscation, diver sion, delays, distraction, and,  in  the  final analysis, we have only seen our  debt grow. We have heard some discus sions how the deficit has come down in  recent years, but what we do not hear  is the fact  the deficit is going to go  back up for the remainder of this dec ade.  In fact,  since  the last time  the  Senate  passed  a  balanced  budget  amendment in 1982, the debt has grown  309 percent.  Even the President's own budget, in terestingly enough-we hear so much  talk about the President's tax package  in 1993, and I well recall that because I  served on  the House Budget Commit tee. We were challenged to bring up our  own specific line-item cuts. As Repub licans on  the committee, we did. We  did $435 billion worth of specific line item reductions in the budget.  Guess what? They were all rejected.  So we got a  tax increase, which hap pens to be the largest tax increase in  the history of the country. It was sup posed to reduce the deficit. To some ex tent it did, but, again, what happened  is the deficit continues to rise. In fact,  one of the reasons why it is rising is  that the revenues projected from that  tax increase are less than had been an ticipated and projected by the adminis tration. As a matter of fact,  the Con gressional Budget Office  has  recal culated  the deficit by $25 billion for  each of the next 5 years, and that is  based on an 11-year economic expan sion. That would be 3 years longer than  the longest postwar expansion.  And so we can understand what  is  going to happen; we are just going to  see more debt. There will be obfusca tion here about  the  right  to know,  what we ought to do, we should do im plementing legislation. But the bottom  line is, are we willing to balance the  Federal budget?  As  the Senator has mentioned,  the  only way that can be done is through a  constitutional amendment because we  have all taken an oath of office. That is  why the opponents of this amendment  do not want this amendment enacted,  to become law, because they know that  we will take our responsibilities seri ously and we will be obligated to bal ance that budget.

114,House,104,0.533,810,3,Mr. BAKER of California.," Mr. Speak er. if it is one thing the American peo ple have had their fill of. it is seeing  their hard-earned  tax dollars  squan dered  on  frivolous  special  interest  projects. Whether it is a $500 toilet seat  for the military or $100 million inter state to nowhere. the American people  have had it with paying for someone  else's pork.  Up until now America's real pork  producers, referring, of course, to Con gress,  has  buried  their  pet  pork  projects in important legislation. That  is why our line-item veto is such an  important part of the Contract With  America.  It gives  the President  the  power to search out and destroy waste ful spending before it starts.  With  the  line-item veto,  the buck  isn't all that stops at the President's  desk. The pork stops there too. Several  minutes ago the President delivered to  Congress his budget, which is out of  balance by over $210 billion, the 27th  year in a row.  It is time the President and Congress  worked  together  to  reduce  Federal  spending. When Mr. Clinton  ran  for  President, he said he wanted a  line item veto. Our Contract With America  gives him just that.  Happy birthday, Ronald Reagan.

I was  very  proud when President Clinton  came forward with a nominee for Sur geon General who has credentials that  are  better  than  almost  any  other  American in dealing with this very im portant issue of teen pregnancy. Dr.  Henry Foster, Jr.,  is a  very distin guished Ob-Gyn in Tennessee who has  worked in  the housing projects, who  has worked in his State tirelessly to  tackle teen pregnancy, and this coun try could make great strides with his  knowledge.  How sad I am that some people on  the other side want to treat this Presi dent as though he is road kill. They are  saying  they will not deal with  this  nominee because of his associations  with Planned Parenthood of America.  Now, I thought the right to free asso ciation  still  stood.  I  think  that  Planned Parenthood of America  is a  very honorable group to be associated  with. and I certainly hope they change  their mind.  SUPPORT FOR RAISING THE  MINIMUM WAGE  (Mr. WARD asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1995
116,House,104,-0.31,810,3,Mr. KLINK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  also to talk about the increase in the  minimum wage.  I was talking to a woman from my  district on Friday. She said, ""Congress man KLINK. I don't want to be forced to  go on welfare."" And then she listed off  the expenses that she would have to  pay when she goes to work, with child  care and with her rent and with food  and with transportation costs.  And she said, ""for $4.25. I can't afford  to go to work; I don't want to go on  welfare.""  In fact, that is the position so many  people find  themselves in. They want  the pride of going to work each day, of  having sweat on their brow at the end  of the day and talking about a job well  done. They want to get some cUscipline   back in their lives again. But at $4.25  an hour, they just cannot afford to do  that.  I think it is among Members of this  House and the other body also to say to  people that $4.25 an hour is not a  liv able wage and to  increase  the mini mum wage of this Nation.  LINE-ITEM VETO: AN IDEA WHOSE  TIME HAS FINALLY COME  (Mr. WELLER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1995
117,House,104,0.288,810,3,Mr. WELLER.," Mr. Speaker. today we  will vote to add one more disciplinary  tool to the budget and appropriations  process. the line-item veto. Along with  the balanced budget amendment, which  we passed 2 weeks ago,  the line-item  veto will help bring fiscal sanity  to  Congress' out-of-control  spend-a-thon  over the last 40 years.  Former President Ronald Reagan  used to say the line-item veto was not  a partisan issue but a good-government  issue. Unfortunately,  the Democrat",1995
118,House,104,0.198,823,3,Mr. QUINN.," Mr. Chairman, as a mem ber of the House Committee on Trans portation and  Infrastructure,  I,  too,  rise in strong opposition to the Orton  amendment.  The  amendment blurs  the Budget  Act's clear distinction between manda tory and discretionary  funding. Pro ponents of the measure today have said  we must be consistent, that we must  vote  for  the  line-item veto and not  have any exceptions. The exceptions  that we talk about this afternoon, how ever, make a clear distinction how that  money is raised.  This is a trust fund, a dedicated trust  fund where residents and constituents  that I  represent do not want  to see  their money and their tax dollars go to  Washington and be put in the rest of  the black hole where their money goes,  and never see a  return. A dedicated  trust fund  like  this gets a bang for  their buck. They know it is going to be  used for highway or aviation programs.  That is certain. They know it will not  be put in with all the rest of the money  where  those Washington  tricks  are  played.  I urge all my colleagues to vote no on  the Orton amendment.  The  CHAffiMAN.

119,House,104,-0.086,823,3,Mr. ORTON.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 10  seconds  to point out  that  these  user  fees,  as  they  are  being  called, just a couple of years ago in the  President's budget when  they  raised  gas  taxes, were  ranted  and  railed  against as gasoline  taxes against the  people. Now they are user fees.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman  from Wisconsin  OBEY],  the  ranking member of  Committee on Appropriations.  ",1995
120,House,104,0.453,823,3,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Chairman, I am prob ably one of the' most fiscally conserv ative Members of this body.  I am a  strong supporter of the legislation be fore us to provide the President with a  line-item  veto  authority.  However,  quite frankly, I do not think that this  particular amendment proposed by the  gentleman from Utah [Mr. ORTON] real ly deserves our support at this point.  The reason is, first of all, while his  intent may be good and sound good,  the policy, in fact,  is bad policy. We  could have  some  serious unintended  consequences by instituting this legis lation.  Most importantly, Mr. Chairman, the  rescission of highway and aviation con tract  authority will  not  save  any  money. By law, funds that are not ex pended from these trust funds remain  in the trust fund, and may not be used  for any other purpose, so we are not  saving any money with adoption of this  amendment.  Therefore, I oppose this amendment,.  and I urge my colleagues to also oppose  it when it come before the House.  0 1550  ",1995
121,House,104,-0.328,836,3,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  this  time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  Stenholm-Spratt amendment. I would  just urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.  It accomplishes the purpose for why  a line-item veto is needed, and that is  to shine light on an individual appro priation so that it cannot hide within a  massive appropriation bill.  I am a supporter of the line-item veto  legislation. I am going to vote for it.  But I think this gives us an alternative  in the event that the traditional two thirds override is declared to be unconstitutional, to have on the books a pro cedure that works and will accomplish  the exact same purpose.  The amount of the vote is not impor tant. It is important to segregate that  appropriation  to allow an  individual  consideration of it so that it cannot be  hidden in a large appropriation bill.  I  congratulate my  colleague  for  bringing  forward an alternative and  urge my  colleagues  to  support  the  amendment.  ",1995
122,House,104,-0.578,849,3,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  opposition to H.R. 2, the Line-Item Veto Act of  1995. While I am aware of the excitement in  the Congress to do anything perceived as pro moting deficit reduction,  I am also mindful of  my duty as a Member of Congress to act in  the best interest of the people I represent and  in the best interest of the U.S. Constitution I  have sworn to uphold. We cannot and should  not,  in an attempt to decrease the deficit or  put an end-to pork-barrel programs, shirk our  responsibility to act in the best interest of the  American people by disrespecting the found ing document of this Nation-the U.S. Con stitution. This shortsighted and rushed legisla tion will not only fail to put a dent in the deficit,  but will  endanger  the  delicate balance of  power so skillfully and wisely laid down in the  U.S. Constitution.  The bill before us today, the Line-Item Veto  Act of 1995, will not only attempt to curtail un wanted spending, but will also make it more  difficult to pass  into  law good  legislation  to  which  the President alone may object. Such  an abdication of congressional  responsibility  will certainly undermine many of our most im portant efforts to improve the quality of life for  all Americans.  Mr. Chairman,  the stated purpose of  the  Line-Item Veto Act  is to provide a statutory  item veto for both appropriations and targeted  tax benefits. The bill will permit the President  to rummage through legislation so that he can  eliminate whatever he wants to of all or part  of any appropriation item or any targeted tax  benefit. Under this bill, Presidential  line-item  vetoes would take effect unless both Houses  obtain a two-thirds vote to override the veto.  This legislation to  limit Congress' ability to  fulfill the will of the American people warps the  constitution to such an extent that the constitu tionality of the Line-Item Veto Act is obviously  in  question. While  I agree  that Congress  should continue to make significant strides to  reduce the budget deficit, this proposed meas ure goes well beyond the legitimate objective  of balancing the budget. In fact, this bill is spe cifically designed to inhibit the will of the peo ple by transferring congressional power to the  President that has been granted exclusively to  Congress by the U.S. Constitution.  Mr. Chairman, transferring the power of the  purse  to  the President  is clearly contrary to  the explicit language in the Constitution. The  Constitution clearly places with the Congress  the power to legislate appropriations bills. The  Line-Item Veto Act will  transfer a significant  portion of  this  constitutional power  to  the  President. The great constitutional significance  of the separation of powers cannot be ques tioned. In his famous Myers v. United States,  272 U.S. 52 (1926) dissent, Justice Louis D.  Brandeis said:  The doctrine of the separation of powers  was adopted by the Convention of1787, not to  promote  efficiency  but  to  preclude  the  excercise of arbitrary power. The purpose  was not to avoid friction, but, by means of  the inevitable friction  incident to the dis tribution of the governmental powers among  three departments, to save the people from  autocracy. (P. 293).  It is also apparent that the Line-Item Veto  Act is also redundant. Under current law, the  Constitution gives the President two opportuni ties to provide input into the Federal budget  process. The President's budget is his first op portunity to express his views regarding fund ing  for particular programs. Congress may  then either accept or  reject  the Presidenrs  recommendations.  The President may also veto any appropria tions bill if he does not agree with the funding  provisions contained  in  it. On several occa sions we have seen Presidents exercise this  option in order to prevent Federal funds from  being used  for various programs. Congress  did not override these vetoes and the Presi dent's will prevailed. Therefore, granting  the  President an additional means  through  the  line-item veto  to attack  legislation  is com pletely  unnecessary  and  duplicative.  The  President already has all of the veto power  that is constitutionally permissible.  Mr. Chairman,  I must also stress  that re ports of the deficit reducing impact of the line item veto have been greatly exaggerated. Of  the 43 States which have already enacted a  line-item veto,  there has been, overall, neg ligible progress toward State deficit reduction  as a result of this law. A study conducted by  the University of Wisconsin examining the def icit reducing power of  the  line-item veto re vealed that vetoes produce budget cuts that  ranged from .006 to 2.5 percent. Several other  studies also reveal  that, contrary to the rep resentations made in the slick sales packaging  of this bill, line-item vetoes are primarily used  as a tool of policymaking and partisan advan tage rather than fiscal restraint.  Such a compromise of authority could result  in the undermining of important legislation and  Government programs that a majority of Con gress has deemed necessary for this Nation.  Considering  the majority party's historic hos tility toward antipoverty programs,  it is not a  surprise  that  they  support  legislation  that  would grant  the President greater power  to  use the line-item veto to act as a tool of pol icymaking and political advantage.  I fear that  the election of a President hostile  to anti poverty  and  equal  opportunity  legislation  would  initiate an unwarranted and unprece dented line-item veto attack on aid to families  with dependent children, public housing, food  stamps, equal opportunity efforts, and other  programs for the disadvantaged.  Mr. Chairman,  this  legislation  is  unsur passed  in  its compromise of the balance of  powers  in our Nation. With very  little oppor tunity  for open hearing, and with  limited de bate, this measure has been placed before us.  A measure of this kind requires detailed analy sis of the impact it may have on the American  people, and the greatest pillar of the American  Republic: The separation of powers---but no  such review has, or will, take place. In the cur rent rush to force this bill through the House,  the will of the American people and the Con stitution  I have sworn to uphold will certainly  be compromised. I urge my colleagues to join  with me and vote against this bill.  ",1995
123,House,104,0.325,849,3,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of H.R. 2, the Line-Item Veto Act,  which I have cosponsored in this 104th Con gress and in the six previous Congresses.  Wrth the passage of this legislation, we fulfill  our commitment made in the Fiscal Respon sibility Act, the first legislative item in our Con tract With America. We completed the first half  of this act last month with the passage of the  balanced  budget  amendment.  Tonight we  send the Senate legislation giving current and  future Presidents the  line-item veto authority  already available to 43 Governors.  The American people have made clear their  desire to eliminate wasteful Federal spending  and this powerful  tool gives the President a  way to eliminate programs he deems wasteful  without having to veto an entire appropriations  bill or other major  legislation  that may also  contain many important and timely programs.  Under current law, wasteful or questionable  projects or programs often find their way into  law because  the President cannot afford  to  veto the important overall legislation in which  they are included. Today's line-item veto legis lation will change that procedure by allowing  the President  to single out specific projects  and force Congress to vote on each of them  individually. This makes both Congress and  the President more accountable to the Amer ican taxpayers for every dollar in the Federal  budget, and injects greater honesty and open ness into the budgetary process, another im portant goal of the Contract With America.  More than any other provision of our Con tract With America, our support for this bill in dicates Republicans' deep commitment to cut  the budget deficit, balance the Federal budget,  and restore fiscal sanity to the Federal Gov ernment.  In  the  past,  Democrat-controlled  Con gresses not only refused to give this authority  to Republican Presidents,  they also failed to  give it to Presidents of their own party. The  Republican Contract With America puts  the  welfare of  the country above partisan dif ferences, and will not only give future Presi dents of any party a greater ability to keep the  size and scope of  the Federal Government  under control, but  this  legislation, when en acted, will give President Clinton a  line-item  veto authority the day he signs it into law.  By granting Presidents greater power  to  control spending, Congress also places upon  them a responsibility to use this tool  waste as demanded by  the American  tax payers. The  line-item veto creates a bias in  the Federal Government in favor of saving tax  dollars, not spending  them.  I urge my col leagues to join me in voting for this important  governmental reform to take another step to ward getting our Nation's fiscal house in order.  ",1995
124,House,104,0.096,849,3,Mr. HALL of Texas.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  today  in support of legislation  that will save  taxpayers billions of dollars by eliminating  wasteful and unnecessary spending, namely,  H.R. 2, the Line Item Veto Act of 1995. For  too many years Congress has been spending  the t~payers' money as if there were no to morrow. Mr. Chairman, yesterday's tomorrow  has become today's reality. We can no longer  pretend that the problem will go away.

125,Senate,104,-0.313,888,3,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the Chair and I thank the distin guished Senator from Vermont for his  statement. I also thank the manager of  the bill for yielding the floor at this  time.  Mr. President, I  intend to take the  next hour or so, maybe a bit longer, to  try to lay out the case for at least let ting the people know what might be  entailed in a balanced budget amend ment.  But let me try to put this balanced  budget amendment in a broader con text. We will shortly get into a lot of  numbers, because if you are going to  deal with the balanced budget amend ment, you have to get into numbers.  However, before we get into those num bers,  let me  try  to establish what I  think is the proper context for the bal anced budget debate.  During the 1992 campaign, the Clin ton campaign had a  theme song by  Fleetwood Mac,  called  ""Don't Stop  Thinking About Tomorrow."" This song  represented a kind of theme for  the  campaign-change, hope,  ""don't stop  thinking about tomorrow"";  tomorrow  is coming, think about it, it is impor tant.  Yet,  if you actually thought about  that song and you thought about what  has been happening in the country, it  is clear that we have not been thinking  about tomorrow and we have not been  thinking about  tomorrow  for a  long  time.  Every speaker needs a text, or theme,  for his or her statements. I would like  to  take as  the  text for my remarks  today one of Aesop's fables. It is an old  ",1995
126,Senate,104,-0.309,901,3,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, today we  continue one of the most important de bates in the history of the Senate. The  debate involves whether to change the  basic, fundamental, organic law of this  Nation forever, and for the first time  to write fiscal policy into the Constitu tion of the United States-for the first  time, amended only 27 times in its his tory. The Constitution of the United  States is one of the most brilliant, up lifting, and  inspired documents ever  written by the hand of mere mortals. It  has served as a model for other na tions, nations  that are struggling  to  emulate the American genius and en sure a government that allows maxi mum freedom for its people, and yet  also fairly imposes the strictures of the  rule of law.  Such a document, with its carefully  weighted checks and balances, its beau tiful guarantees of freedom and liberty,  its eloquent preamble of 52 words, and  its visionary  flexibility has  inspired  and guided this great Nation of ours for  generations.  Now  the decision to preserve it for  our future generations z:ests with this  body-100 men and women  sworn  to  support and defend this marvelous Con stitution against all enemies, foreign  and domestic. And  the decision rests  with us. The buck stops here. I have  taken that oath 13 times in the last 48  years-to support and defend the Con stitution against all enemies, foreign  and domestic. I have administered the  oath of office on a good many occasions  to several of my colleagues, and I have  considered it an honor and a privilege  to do so.  This body has a solemn responsibility  to  debate  the  proposed  amendment  carefully,  fully,  thoroughly and with  diligence. Nothing  on  the  Senate's  agenda  is as  important as  this pro posal. It is the most important decision  that will be made in this Senate this  year. And  if, which God avert,  this  amendment is adopted, it will prove to  have been the most important amend ment,  the most important change  to  the Constitution since the Constitution  became effective 206 years ago, and it  will be the first time out of 27  times  that an amendment has been adopted  to damage this inimitable document.  Nothing on the Senate's agenda, as I  say, is as important as is this proposal.  So I say that no politically crafted, so called Contract With America-you  have heard about  that,  the Contract  With America, the so-called Contract  With America. Let me show you my  contract with America. Here it is, the  Constitution of the United States. It  cost me 15 cents. There it is--15 cents.  Any Senators who wish to get similar  copies may do so from the Government  Printing Office. It only coBts a dollar  even at today's prices.  So  this  so-called  Contract With  America, which I did not sign on to,  and which  just sprouted up  like  the  prophet's gourd overnight, during the  last election, should not drive this de bate or crowd out the thorough consid eration of this proposed constitutional  amendment.  We have a duty to air all sides before  the public, lest there be any misunderstanding about what is being proposed.  If we are to adopt this most serious of  alterations to our Constitution, let us  not do so without telling the American  people exactly what  the change will  mean to them. Let us not do so without  telling the American people exactly, to  the very best of our ability, what the  change will be to them, the American  people.  The debate may be at times tedious.  It deals with concepts and truths which  are not usually on  the public radar  screen. But it is our responsibility to  focus  the public,  if we can, on  this  issue which is so fundamental, so fun damental to the future of our Nation.  And so it is my hope that the Senate  and its Members will concentrate their  fractured attention  spans, clear  the  decks, and listen to and participate in .  this extraordinary debate. Now, this. is  no ordinary bill. It is no mere amend ment to a statute. This is the supreme  law of the  land about which we are  talking. We are talking about amend ing the supreme law of the land, the  Constitution of the United States, the  supreme law of the land, the guarantor  of our freedoms and the freedoms of  generations of Americans which we are  considering here on this Senate floor.  We are considering an amendment to  write  into  the Constitution  for  the  very first time language dealing with  fiscal policy. That is a subject which  the  framers of  the Constitution,  in  their wisd.om. left for the decisions of  the elected representatives of the peo ple in this body and in the other body.  I hope that we will be guided by at  least a limited wisdom of the Framers.  There is a kind of pretense that one  can  read between  the  lines  in  this  amendment, namely  that  the states men of  today are wiser  than  those  Framers of the Constitution who acted  208 years ago to submit to the States  for  their ratification the great docu ment. I hope that we will reread the  solemn oath that we all took when we  were sworn  in.  I hope  that Members  will listen to their consciences and re sist the political winds that have al ready blown through the other body.  Now is the Senate's time to shine. It  can  fulfill  the  task before us, with  faithfulness to its purpose, by an ex haustive review of the impact of this  proposal. Nothing we do during our col lective service in the Senate will ever  be more  important  than  this  task  which is before . us today, the task of  examining,  scrutinizing,  dissecting,  and hopefully rejecting this constitu tional amendment.  The people hopefully will remember  one truth as they watch and as we en gage  in  this historic debate;  that is,  that there is no disagreement over the  goal of getting to a balanced budget by  reducing the Federal deficit. This de bate, however, is about tampering with  the United States Constitution in such  a way as to mandate a zero deficit each  ",1995

Jim was with the department of  heal th for 16 years, serving as its direc tor of community affairs for 13 years.  And what a job he did. There was no  question, no deadline, no request that I  or my staff made  that Jim Carney  could not handle quickly, courteously,  and to the point. He was always well  informed about the activities and mis sion of the department, and the need  for  communication and coordination  with other branches of government. He  was a public servant in the very finest  sense of the word, and we will sorely  miss his help, his good humor, and his  presence at the department of health.

129,Senate,104,-0.145,927,3,Mr. NUNN.," Madam President, in May  of last year the Senate Permanent Sub committee on  Investigations held  a  hearing on the growing threat of orga nized crime in Eastern Europe and the  countries of the former Soviet Union.  This hearing featured an historic joint  appearance by Louis Freeh, the Direc tor of the FBI, Hans-Ludwig Zachert,  the  President  of  Germany's  Bundeskriminalamt, and General Mi khail Yegorov, the head of Russia's Or ganized Crime Control Department.  In his prepared statement submitted  to the subcommittee, General Yegorov  made  reference  to an Austrian com pany by the name of N ordex, implying  that  its president was an  individual  known as Umar Vokov, who  is sus pected by Russian authorities of under ground criminal activity. Recently, the  subcommittee has  received  a  letter  from  the real president of N ordex, a  Mr. G. Loutchansky, disputing General  Yegorov's statement and denying any  relationship between Nordex and Umar  Vokov. Mr. Lou tchansky also provided  the subcommittee with a  letter from  the Russian Ministry of Internal Af fairs to Nordex's attorney in which the  Ministry accepted Nordex's assurances  concerning Vokov and expressed regret  to Nordex for any inaccuracies in Gen eral Yegorov's statement.

This bill  mirrors a House bill  introduced  last  year  by  Representatives  PATRICIA  SCHROEDER, EDWARD MARKEY, and Mar jorie Margolies-Mezvinsky as compan ion legislation to my original bill. S.  2012,  the Protection From Coercive  Employment Agreements Act of 1994.  This bill addresses .a rapidly growing  practice in employment relations--the  practice of requiring employees to sub mit claims of discrimination or harass ment to arbitration as a term or condi tion of employment or advancement.  and prohibiting the employee from re solving their claim in a court of law.  This bill amends seven specific civil  rights statutes to make clear that the  powers and procedures provided under  those laws are the exclusive ones that  apply when a claim arises. The legisla tion would  invalidate existing agree ments between employers and employ ees that require the employment dis crimination claims to be submitted to  mandatory arbitration.  The statutes this would amend are  title vn of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of  1973,  the Americans With Disabilities  Act, section 1977 of the Revised Stat utes,  the Equal Pay Act,  the Family  and Medical Leave Act, and the Fed eral  Arbitration  Act  [FAA].  The  amendment  to  the FAA extends  the  protections of the bill to claims of un lawful discrimination that arise under  State or local law, and other Federal  laws that prohibit job discrimination.  Mr. President,  I want  to reiterate  that this legislation, as in the case of  S. 2012, is in no way intended to bar the  use of voluntary arbitration, concilia tion, mediation  or  other  informal  quasi-judicial methods of dispute resolution. In fact, I strongly support the  use of voluntary alternative dispute  resolution methods as a way of reduc ing the caseloads of civil and criminal  courts where appropriate.  This bill closes a widening loophole  in the enforcement of civil rights laws  in our Nation. An entire  industry Wall Stree~and a growing number of  companies and firms in many other in dustries have been able to circumvent  formal legal challenges to their unlaw ful employment practices in cour~a  right intended to be protected by the  statutes this bill amends. Employers  can  tell current and prospective em ployees, ""if you want to work for us,  you'll have to check your rights as an  American citizen at the door.""  Mr. President, this practice shQuld be  stopped now. It is simply unfair to re quire an employee  to waive,  in ad vance. his or her statutory right  to  seek remedy in a court of law, in ex change  for  employment  or  a  pro motion. This bill will restore integrity  in the relations between employees and  employers.  I ask unanimous consent  that  the  text of the legislation be printed in the  RECORD at the conclusion of my re marks.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 366  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

But  those cuts are not enough to satisfy  the American people, or get  the  job  done.  He may have sprinkled in a few tax  cuts. but they are far too late for the  middle class.  Mr. Speaker. the President's budget  may not be dead on arrival. but it is on  a respirator.  Republicans will take up many of the  President's cuts. while adding billions  more. And we will look carefully at his  other proposals. But clearly. the Presi dent has not gotten the message of the  last election.  We need a fundamental change in the  Federal Government, not just tinker ing around the edges.  With his budget.  the President has  offered only a modified status quo. For  many of us that simply  is not good  enough.

134,House,104,-0.658,979,3,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this is an exceedingly  important debate, one that I feel very  privileged to be  the ranking member  on the Democratic side to advance, be cause we are now talking about a part  of the so-called Con tract With America  that now inflicts affirmative harm to  the Constitution. This so-called Exclu sionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 at tempts to keep its promise made in the  Contract With America by eradicating  our Constitution's higher  covenant  with the American people that it has  maintained for over 200 years.  D 1500  Let us review the exclusionary rule.  Started in 1914 by court decision that  made no exceptions but applies only to  the Federal jurlsdiction, it rolled along  without event until 1961, when Mapp  versus Ohio then created another ex ception that included States as well as  Federal in the application of the exclu sionary rule. Then in the 1970's came  two very, very  important additional  modifications: the plain-view doctrine,  which allowed that evidence or activity  going on in plain view of the officers  was a reason that one would not have  to go to the magistrate to get a war rant;  then  came  the  exigent-cir cumstances doctrine, which rationally  concluded that evidence that was ei ther in danger of being destroyed or  eliminated or that put the officers at  great bodily risk were also exceptions  to the exclusionary rule that had been  created.  Notice that all of these modifications  were positive and supportable for those  of us, like me, who view this constitu tional protection to be absolutely im portant. And then in 1981 came Leon  versus the United States that created  yet another reception, in which it dic tated through the Supreme Court ma jority, incidentally, a Republican Su preme Court,  that if good faith was  used by the officer in seeking a war rant and that for reasons unknown to  him at that time the warrant was in valid or defective, that the exclusion ary rule would not be obtained and the  evidence would  be  admissible  into  court anyway.  And so today we meet here with our  new majority, which are here to tell us  that we are now going to codify the  Leon case and make it merely a con tinuing part of the exclusions to the  exclusionary rule that I have just re cited.  Well, my colleagues,  this  is not a  codification of Leon versus the United  States. I want to repeat that one more  time. This bill before us, H.R. 666,  is  not a codification of Leon versus Unit ed States. For anyone who looks at the  case will find that in Leon the officers  sought and were given a warrant. They  went to a magistrate and got a war rant. It turned out later that it was not  a good one, and Leon said that even so,  if the officer in good faith went to get  a warrant and got one that was subse quently invalid for any reason, then he  would be held, the evidence would be  admissible and he would be held  to  have been operating in good faith.  But the measure before us does not  do  that. The measure before us now  permits the officer  to declare on his  own that he believes that he is operat ing in good faith, having not ever gone  to a magistrate.  My friends in the Committee on the  Judiciary are now suggesting that this  is a codification of Leon. Well, I sug gest  that anyone  in or out of  law  school examining  the Leon case will  quickly come  to  the conclusion that  this is not the case at all, and I think  it makes a very important argument.  What we are doing is going far, far  beyond Leon and are moving now to  dispense with the exclusionary rule in  its entirety.  What we are saying now is that law  officers, Federal or local, that operate  on their perception that they are oper ating in good faith will now be let off  beyond the purview of the exclusionary  rule. I think that this is the most dan gerous damage and harm that we could  work to a rule that has been a part of  our Constitution for 200 years. I sug gest to my colleagues that the amend ment that I will offer is the only codi fication of Leon.  What we will do  is codify Leon by  saying where a warrant turns out to be  invalid or defective, given by a mag istrate to a police officer who operates  on the basis that he had a perfectly  legal document, that he will be excused  and his evidence will be allowed to be  .offered. Nothing more. And  it is on  that basis that I want everyone to real ize that this is far more than codifica tion. It is a complete wiping out of the  exclusionary rule as we have known it  throughout American history.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",1995

The exclusionary rule  is not wiped  out. It is changed from the way it is  presently administered. But if the evi dence  is offered and an unreasonable  search and seizure has been made that  was not in good faith, I am sure the ex clusionary rule in all its glory will be  enforced. This does no violence to the  fourth amendment.  The exclusionary rule is judge-made.  It was not made by this Congress. It is  a rule the judges thought up to deter  the policeman from making unreason able searches and seizures. And their  idea of deterring that was just not to  admit the evidence.  ",1995

137,House,104,0.426,992,3,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to accomplish  two purpases: First to congratulate the  gentleman from Michigan for bringing  the amendment to the floor, and then  to announce  that I will oppase  that  amendment.  Why do  I congratulate him? It ap pears that the gentleman from Michi gan is for the first time since I have  been in the Congress espausing a  re turn at least to sanity in the warrant  search and seizure realm of the law en forcement and agrees through the prop osition of his amendment that a good  faith exception shall exist in the war rant arrest. That is a great departure  from all  that we have heard  for 12  years  in  this Chamber,  particularly  from the colleagues of the gentleman  from Michigan. But I congratulate him  on doing that. Because we have come a  long way, baby, if indeed you come and  plead with the House to pass an amend ment that would provide a good faith  exception to a warrant arrest.  0 1650  I am exorbitantly pleased at the gen tleman's gesture, but at the same time,  I want to tell the gentleman the second  part and he may not want me to yield.  I  oppase  the amendment because  it  goes against the purpose of the main  bill, namely, to extend that good faith  exception, that trust that we want to  reside  in the  law enforcement officer  when  he  acts  in  good  faith  in  warrantless situations. We know that  in several jurisdictions the warrantless  good faith exception has already been  installed in the intermediary Federal  courts, and so, if we adopt the amend ment of the gentleman, we would be, in  effect,  taking a step backwards from  the upward march of the good faith ex ception in the warrantless situations,  which has already been blessed by some  of the intermediary Federal courts.  Mr. Chairman, nothing infuriates the  public more  than  the spectacle of a  criminal standing before the judge, fac ing his prosecutors and learning right  there  in open  court  that his  case,  where he was caught red-handed in a  burglary, red-handed in an assault, red handed in some heinous crime, to find  that the judge dismisses his case right  there in open court for the sake of a  technicality  that we have seen over  and over and over again. That infuri ates the American public in itself, and  then doubles the fury when we see that  criminal walking out of court, in effect  literally and figuratively laughing at  the judge, laughing at the prosecutor,  laughing at the witne$Ses who testified  against him, laughing at the system of  justice, and perhaps encouraging him  to commit  the same kind of offense  later, knowing, sophisticated criminal  that he might be, that he can escape  justice on a technicality.  What we are about here today is to  put some fear of God in that criminal,  and remove the technical release from  the prison of the hardened criminal and  to allow our law enforcement commu nity in whom we have faith to bring  about a sense of safety in the streets in  a good faith exception to the exclusion ary rule. That is not too much to ask.  Let us defeat the gentleman's amend ment.  ",1995

Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman from Virginia for  yielding.  What the gentleman from Pennsylva nia has proved here today is he cannot  tell us why he would change the exist ing  law, which  I  am  codifying  by  amendment in the Leon case. He does  not have an example, because we have  already given dozens of exceptions to  the exclusionary rule and there is not  one he can even make up now on the  floor or ever that would justify what  they are trying to do to the exclusion ary rule, and I  thank my friend  for  yielding to me.

140,,104,-0.328,1044,3,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing, along with my Ways and Means Com mittee colleague, Representative CLAY SHAW,  legislation to repeal a provision of the 1993  tax bill that has reduced secondary market li quidity  for municipal bonds and compli~ted  the Tax Code unnecessarily. The existing law  will likely make it more difficult for States and  localities to invest in our Nation's crumbling in frastructure.  The provision in question changed the way  certain municipal bonds are treated under the  Internal Revenue Code and caused some of  these bonds to be less attractive to investors.  As a result of this provision, State and local is suers attempting to address America's chron ically underfunded public  investment needs  may be forced to offer higher yields on their  securities, which would drive up their borrow ing costs.  Of critical importance to the success of the  American system of public finance  is  the  li quidity of the secondary market for municipal  bonds.  Investors are willing  to accept  lower  rates of return on State and local government  securities because of the tax exemption, but  also because they know they can readily sell  their bonds, if necessary, before maturity. It is  this indispensable characteristic of the munici pal bond market  that was handicapped  in  1993 by the Budget Act.  In certain situations, holders of municipal  bonds seek to sell their securities at what is  known as a market discount. Market discount  is the difference between the purchase price  of a bond and its stated redemption price at  maturity.  In general, market discount occurs  when a bond is purchased on the secondary  market at a price below par or below the ad justed issue price. Market discount is typically  caused by a rise in market interest rates or a  decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.  Before the enactment of the 1993 budget  reconciliation bill, accreted market discount on  a municipal bond was taxed as capital gain at  the time the bond was sold, redeemed, or oth erwise disposed of. A strong public policy ar gument can be made that, consistent with the  tax exemption on municipal bond  interest,  market discount on State and  local govern ment securities should be exempt  from  tax ation altogether.  However,  the  legislation  Congressman  SHAW and I have introduced today seeks only  to  restore  the  traditional capital gains  treat ment of market discount bonds. We believe  that increases in the value of market discount  bonds should be treated as capital gains, con sistent with  the  standard  treatment of  in creases in the value of most investments.  Under the new law, however, accreted mar ket discount  is  taxed as ordinary  income.  Since they are now subject to higher ordinary  income tax rates, market discount bonds have  become more difficult to sell on the secondary  market than other municipal bonds.  February 7, 1995  Furthermore, any security issued by a State  or  locality could become a market discount  bond at some point during its life, so second ary market liquidity for all municipal securities  has decreased. With the repeated rises in in terest  rates over  the past year,  the 1993  change has had dramatic consequences  for  the secondary market in these bonds.  The change  to ordinary  income  tax  treat ment for market discount bonds also reduces  their  liquidity because  investors cannot use  capital gains on market discount bonds to off set capital losses. Investors in secondary mar ket municipal securities now demand higher  rates of return to compensate them for higher  tax rates on discount bonds and for increased  risk that the securities will be more difficult to  sell.  The bottom line on the higher tax rates for  market discount is that State and local govern ments could ultimately face higher costs in is suing securities to pay for much needed public  infrastructure investment. Early anecdotal evi dence suggests that yields on market discount  bonds are as much as 25 basis points higher  than  they would have been under  the old  rules. These effects have been exacerbated  over the past year as interest rates have risen  and bond prices have fallen.  Moreover, the new market discount rule has  resulted  in a  reporting nightmare  for bond  dealers, mutual  funds, bank trust funds, and  others who are required to sort out and docu ment income to taxpayers. Some tax-exempt  mutual funds have simply stopped buying mar ket discount bonds altogether because of this  complexity, further reducing the liquidity of and  demand  for  these securities and driving up  their yields.  The new market discount rules could result  in higher capital costs for State and local mu nicipal bond issuers, raise extremely complex  financial considerations  that  repel  investors,  and provide little or no economic advantage to  the  Federal Government. As Federal  and  State budgets get tighter and tighter, the im portance of the tax-exempt market increases.  For those reasons,  I propose  that Congress  restore the law to its pre-1993 status.  The current proposal to cut the capital gains  tax presents us with an opportunity to address  this important issue. Consistent with that effort  to encourage investment, we should  reverse  the destructive proposal enacted in 1993, and  remove the penalty on investors and issuers it  imposed.  I encourage my colleagues  to join  me as cosponsors of this legislation.  TRIBUTE TO JAMES A. WILLIAMS  HON. ROBFRT A. BORSKI  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday.

142,Senate,104,-0.276,1083,3,Mr. REID.,"  In 1935, Social Security  passed. It passed, Madam President, be cause the American people wanted it to  pass. It was really at that time, per haps, an experiment. We did not know  if it really worked, but it did work.  I believe we have heard a lot about  the Contract With America.  I  think  that most all the items that my friends  are  talking about with  the Contract  With America are good and will help  the country.  But let us be realistic. The real, valid  first contract with America was Social  Security. That program has been in ex istence for 60 years. That is the real  contract. And it is a contract that has  worked and we should do everything we  can  to protect  the Social Security  trust funds.  We should do that, Madam President,  not only for the Harriet Raids of the  world, but also for those children that  are now in their beginning years, be cause we need to provide security for  them in their old age, also.  President Roosevelt and Members of  Congress recognized in 1935 that by fi nancing  the program by earmarked  payroll taxes, we would ensure that a  future President and Congress could  not morally or politically  repeal or  mutilate the character of the program.  Interestingly,  Madam  President,  President Roosevelt's fears were real ized  in  the early part of the 1980's,  when  there were attempts made  to  make sweeping cuts in Social Security.  Those cuts were repulsed by Congress.  But Congress came back right away,  came back quickly and solved the prob lems that they were having with Social  Security.  It was truly a bipartisan commis sion-Claude Pepper, the man who was  One of the previous speakers was quite cor rect to point out that before there was this  contractMeaning the Contract With America  that we hear so much about.  there was enacted a solemn contract with  the American people, and we call that Social  Security.  Mr. Wamp indicated:  We can achieve a balance without touching  Social Security. Our party and our leader ship are on record opposing cuts in Social  Security, and so am I.  Mr. CHAMBLISS, from the eighth dis trict of Georgia, said:  Mr. Speaker, let us send a message of as surance to seniors of this great Nation.  He, of course, is referring to Social  Security not being touched.  Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania said:  At a time when some are talking about a  new covenant, we should signal our intent to  protect Social Security for those who par ticipate.  Mr. YOUNG of Florida-and I did not  have the pleasure of serving with any  of the Members I have mentioned until  now. I served with Mr. YOUNG of Flor ida. He said, on January 25 of this year:  It reaffirms what I have long said and sup ported, that in reducing the Federal budget  deficit we should look to cutting spending in  those areas which are driving our Nation  deeper into debt. That certainly is not the  Social Security trust fund, which actually  runs an annual surplus-last year $61 b1llion.  I could go on with other statements  about how Members of the other body  talked  about  the  balanced  budget  amendment. They do not want Social  Security to be affected by the balanced  budget amendment. They are right. It  should not be.  What my amendment does, Mr. Presi dent, is put into writing what we have  now only as an oral promise. This dis agreement that is the subject matter of  this debate seems  to center on how  best to protect those trust funds. I be lieve that if I were trying this case to  a jury of my peers, the jury would re turn a verdict in favor of this amend ment  in a matter of minutes. This  would not be one where the jury was  hung up or one where they deliberated  a long period of time. I would suggest  that the debate clearly favors, and will  favor, the amendment that the Senator  from Nevada has offered, along with 14  of his colleagues.  Why, Mr. President, do we need to ex press exemption? Very  simple. Any thing less would be insufficient. If we  want to take this off budget and ex empt it from efforts  to balance  the  budget, it must be done in a binding  fashion.  I suggest that burying it in  implementing legislation, as was sug gested last week in another debate, is  like passing a sense-of-the-Senate reso lution;  it has no binding  effect.  It  makes us feel good but, essentially, it  is a nonbinding resolution. This lan guage will specifically exclude Social  Security.  ",1995

Far too often, the court system al lows vital information that is discov ered in litigation, and which directly  bears on public health and safety, to be  covered up: to be shielded from moth ers, fathers, and children whose  lives  are potentially at stake, and from the  public officials we have appointed to  protect our health and safety.  This happens because of the use of so called protective orde~really gag or ders  iBBued  by courts-that are de signed to keep information discovered  in the course of litigation secret and  undisclosed.  Mr. President, these secrecy arrange ments are far from benign. Last year,  the manufacturers of silicon breast im plants agreed to a record $4 billion set tlement of product  liability claims.  Most Americans do not know  that  studies indicating the hazards of breast  implants were uncovered as early as  1984 in litigation.

155,Senate,104,0.631,1239,3,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, before  contemplating today's bad news about  the Federal debt,  let's do  that little  pop quiz again: How many million dol lars are in $1 trillion? When you arrive  at an answer, bear in mind that it was  Congress that ran up a debt now ex ceeding $4.8 trillion.  To be exact, as of the close of busi ness yesterday, Wednesday, February 8,  the  total Federal debt-down  to  the  penny-stood  at  $4,805,605,149,692.51meaning that every man, woman, and  child  in America now owes $18,242.16  computed on a per capita basis.  Mr. President, again  to answer  the  pop quiz question, How many million  in a  trillion? there are a million mil lion in a  trillion; and you can thank  the U.S. Congress for the existing Fed eral debt exceeding $4.8 trillion.  CONCLUSION OF MORNING  BUSINESS  ",1995
156,Senate,104,-0.267,1239,3,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, what is  the status of the Senate? Are we on the  Reid amendment at this point?  ",1995
157,Senate,104,-0.293,1278,3,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr.  President,  I  thank my distinguished colleague.  It  should be noted  that  the  law  in  the  Constitution is being cited not only by  the distinguished Senator, but by a  former Chief Justice of the Supreme  Court of the State of Alabama, Senator  HEFLIN. He has studied  the  law and  legal  precedence-particularly  con stitutional  provisions.  I  compliment  him for speaking out on this particular  occasion.  It is not my  intent  to belabor the  point, but I certainly want to empha size that there is no alternative other  than  including  the REID amendment.  Why do I say that? Section 13301 of the  Budget Enforcement Act,  says,  thou  shalt not use Social Security  funds  with  respect  to  receipts, outlays, or  concerning the deficit.  That law passed this particular body  on a  vote of 98-2,  in 1990,  and was  signed  into  law by President George  Walker Herbert Bush on November 5,  1990. It is the law, and it has been reit erated again and again. On Monday of  this week, Mr. President, it was cited  by  the distinguished majority whip- the distinguished Senator  from Mis sissippi. When  asked  about  specific  cuts, he said:  Nobody-Republican, Democrat,  conserv ative,  liberal, moderate-is even  thinking  about using Social Security to balance the  budget, to pass the joint resolution for the  balanced budget amendment to the Constitu tion.  They are not thinking about it, they  are doing it. You actually repeal sec tion 13301 of the Budget Enforcement  Act that says: Thou shalt not use Sotrust  funds  cial Security  purposes.  Why is that, Mr. President? It clearly  states in section 7 of the resolution:  for deficit  Total receipts shall include all receipts of  the United States Government, except those  derived from borrowing.  The Social Security receipts in  the  Social Security trust fund is included  in deficit calculations under this defi nition. Some on  the other side have  said, ""Do not worry, we will legislate  later.""  But  I  recall  that none other  than  President George Washington,  in his  Farewell Address, said:  If in the opinion of the people the distribu tion or modification of the Constitutional  powers be in any particular wrong, let it be  corrected by  an  amendment  in  the way  which  the Constitution designates. But let  there be no change by usurpation; for though  this is one instance of good, it is the cus tomary weapon by which free governments  are destroyed.  [Mr. HATCH]  The Father of  this Country knew  that you could not change  the Con stitution by statute.  I have been in favor of balancing the  budget. I helped the distinguished Sen ator  from Utah  in 1982  when the balanced budget amendment  received the two-thirds required, the 67  votes.  We tried again with my distinguished  senior colleague, Senator THURMOND,  in 1986 but we did not get two-thirds re quired.  We  tried last year under the distin guished leadership of the Senator from  Illinois,  Senator  SIMON,  but  again  failed.  We have been in the vineyards work ing on  this particular problem, but  part and parcel of the problem is an other contract with America-the con tract we made with the senior citizens  of America back in 1935.  We  felt  so keenly about honoring  that contract, that we raised taxes in  1983, under the Greenspan commission,  to keep the program fiscally sound and  to maintain  that  solemn  trust. To  maintain that contract with our senior  citizens-not for defense, not for wel fare, not for foreign aid, not for other  Government programs-but for the So cial Security trust fund.  If you had said at that time that we  were raising taxes for welfare, foreign  aid, defense or other spending, I would  have  voted  no  and  other Senators  would have voted no. But instead, we  said, ""This is a trust fund and we must  continue to keep that trust.""  Like  the Senator  from Mississippi  has said, no one is thinking about vio lating that trust, but yet we are con stitutionally dissolving it by including  revenues  from  the  Social  Security  trust in the definition of total receipts.  Legislative  fixes will not work. As  George Washington  said, you cannot  amend the Constitution except as the  Constitution itself designates.  I am a reasonable man-as Rex Har rison said in ""My Fair Lady,"" an ordinary man-just trying to get along on  the floor of the Senate, certainly sup porting a balanced budget, but feeling  compelled to take issue here having es tablished a record in protecting Social  Security.  In the Budget Cammi ttee in 1990,  I  proposed the Social Security Preserva tion Act. It stipulated that Social Se curity trust funds should not be used in  calculating the deficit. It was reported  out 20  to 1, and on  the Senate floor  passed by a vote of 98 to 2. And still, I  see  administrations, Republican  and  Democrat; I see Congresses, Republican  and Democrat, violating the law.  Unfortunately,  it does not surprise  me. Former Senator Harry Byrd shep herded his own  statute  through  the  Congress which said, in essence, ""Thou  budget shall be balanced."" It was the  law, and yet we never adhered to it. I  do not know how we get away with this  thievery. But I know that something is  amiss when honest public servants say  that no one is considering using Social  Security to balance the budget when,  on the face of the legislation, it would  require  it. At  that point,  I have  to  speak out.  As a result, I have written a letter to  all  the Senators to put to rest ideas  about changing it by legislation later  on. You cannot amend the Constitution  by legislation. You have to get a joint  resolution, have three readings in the  Senate, and have an affirmation of 37,  or two-thirds, of the sovereign States  of America. So even if I wanted to pro tect Social Security by statute, I could  not do what they say can be done.  I will read the letter. This is to every  one of my colleagues in the Senate.  In 1983, the Congress made the Social Secu rity fund fiscally sound by programmed tax  increases. Naturally,  the Congress would  never have supported these tax increases if  the monies were to be used for foreign aid,  defense, welfare or the deficit costs of gov ernment. But violating the truth-in-budget ing principle, the Administrations and Con gresses continued to use the Social Security  trust fund to obscure the size of the deficit.  Annoyed with  this violation,  the Budget  Committee voted nearly unanimously in 1990  and the United States Senate with a vote of  98-2 joined the House in the now formal stat utory  law of the United States  in section  13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act, forbid ding by law the use of the Social Security  fund for the deficit. The violation continues.  Now comes the balanced budget amendment  to  the Constitution requiring  that, ""Total  receipts  shall  include  all  receipts of  the  United States Government except those de rived from borrowing."" Left alone, this pro vision would repeal Section 13301 and con stitutionally endorse the violation. The REID  amendment presently under  consideration  corrects  this unintended repeal by stating  that the Social Security trust fund, ""* * *  should not be counted as receipts or outlays  for the purpose of this article.""  John Mitchell,  the former Attorney Gen eral was known for the axiom, ""Watch what  we do, not what we say."" It should be made  crystal clear that we mean what we say. If  you want to continue to use the trust fund  and breach the trust, vote against the Reid  ",1995

159,House,104,0.581,1330,3,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding to me.  I just want to emphasize the point he  is making about the 5-minute rule and  the way in which the kinds of rules are  being  admitted here  do,  in  fact,  I  think, enhance debate of the House of  Representatives.  In the past,  the problem with  the  limitations that were put on many of  these rules was  they basically stifled  debate. What you had was limitations  on  the offering of amendments, and  then  time  limitations which assured  that what happened on the House floor  was  that Members would  offer  the  amendment and  then, because of the  time allocations, each Member would  get allocated 1 minute or 2 minutes to  get up and speak. As a result, the de bate always went past each other. A  Member would stand up and talk about  cats. The next Member would stand up  and  talk about dogs. The next guy  would stand up and  talk about ele phants. No one could understand what  we were doing as a result of that kind  of debate.  Under  the 5-minute  rule, Members  are permitted to yield to each other.  They can get their time extended. The  fact is you get real debate on the House  floor.  I think what we have seen hapP.ening  out here on the floor in the last couple  of weeks has, in fact, been impressive.  People  have  actually  engaged  each  other in real debate. That is what the  floor of the House of Representatives  should be all about, and it seems to me  that the rules that we are bringing for ward  that allow debate under  the 5minute rule preserve that kind of tra dition in the House of Representatives.  I want to congratulate the gentleman  and his colleagues  for  the kinds of  things  that they are doing  to assure  that we have real debate on real issues  in the House of Representatives.  ",1995

Republicans have only been in  charge for 1 month, and the approval  rating for Congress has already dou bled.  The reason is obvious. Under Repub lican leadership we are working hard to  keep our promises to bring big change  to America.  Nowhere is that more apparent than  in the crime package we are now de bat ing.  We  are  making  tremendous  progress in ensuring that the criminal  justice system will be more concerned  with the rights of victims and society  than the rights of criminals.  And who will benefit most from our  rough crime package? The middle and  lower  income classes, who  live with  violent crime every day. They know  what we need to do: catch, convict, and  confine violent criminals.  That is what our crime package is all  about. And  that is why we will con tinue working hard to see that it is en acted.  INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION  TO PROVIDE A LIVABLE WAGE  (Mr.  THOMPSON  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.  ",1995
177,House,104,-0.515,1421,3,Mr. THOMPSON.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  stand in support of livable wage for all  Americans by the year 2000. Congress men CL YB URN and HILLIARD and I have  introduced a bill, H.R. 768, that moves  the debate from a minimum wage to a  livable wage. Many Americans who  work in retail establishments such as  McDonald's already earn more than $5  per hour. The current minimum wage  of $4.25 per hour amounts to approxi mately $9,000 a year. No individual or  family can  live at a decent  level on  this  income. Contrary  to popular be lief,  two-thirds  of minimum  wage  workers are adults and not teenagers.  The minimum wage has not been  raised since April 1, 1991, nearly 4 years  ago. For  the  richest country  in  the  world, this is a national disgrace. All of  us know  that  the cost of goods and  services have risen over this time pe riod. By supporting a liveable wage, we  send a clear signal to the Nation of our  support for the working poor.  Let us vote for a  livable wage and  index  future  increases  so  that  all  American  families can keep up with  the rising cost of living. My constitu ents  in Mississippi deserve  it. Your  constituents deserve  it. We must de mand it.

In the first paper I described the de velopment of fiscal policy in postwar  America, following the huge swings of  the Great Depression and the Second  World War.  I described an economic  profession growing  in understanding  and reach. I made the point that I saw  this happen. In 1961, I joined the Ken nedy administration. I became Assist ant Secretary of Labor for policy plan ning and research. Unemployment that  year reached 6.7 percent,  the second  highest it had been since annual rates  were first recorded in 1948. There was a  sense of emergency. But also a  con fidence that we knew what to do. The  Federal Government was  running  a  surplus. The result was fiscal drag. We  would contrive to spend more and tax  less, so as to stimulate the economy  toward full employment.  We did and it worked. By 1966, unem ployment dropped to 3.8 percent and by  1969, it reached 3.5 percent. A level, in cidentally, never reached since.  Those were heady days. In 1965, in an  article in ""The Public Interest"" enti tled, ""The Professionalization of Re~  form,"" I noted that the Council of Eco nomic Advisers  forecast  for GNP  for  1964 was off by only $400 million in a  total of $623 billion, while the unem ployment forecast was on the nose; Re calling events that followed World War  II, I noted that in 1964 the unemploy ment rate  in West Germany was 0.4  percent, and not much higher in the  rest of Western Europe. Indeed, unprec edented low levels for peacetime.  There had been some social learning.  In the first year of the Nixon adminis tration, contractionary fiscal policies  were put in place designed to cool off  an overheated economy following  the  buildup for the Vietnam war. Then in  1972 expansionary policies put in place  by  then-Director of OMB George P.  Shultz stimulated the economy follow ing  the  197~71 recession-the  first  since  that  which Kennedy  inherited  from Eisenhower.  In truth, the record is extraordinary.  The great issue of the 19th centurythe economic swings accompanied by  vast unemployment-the  issue which  gave  rise  to  the  radical  totalitarian  movements  that were  to  prove  the  agony of the 20th century-that issue  has been resolved. A chart prepared by  the Joint Economic Committee illus trates this with great clarity. Between  1890 and 1945, real growth in the econ omy dropped by 5 percent on three oc casions, dropped by 10 percent on two  occasions, and on two other occasions  dropped almost 15 percent. Since 1945,  there have been four tiny declines, and  only one serious one, that of the reces sion of 1982, say 2 to 3 percent. Hardly  worth noting in the pre-war economy.  We had ""fine tuned,"" as the phrase  went. The contractionary policies of  1969 were,  in retrospect, a  little  too  large; while the expansionary policy of  1972 came a  little  too  late. But  the  theories seemed sound and the timing  likely to improve.  Both theory and practice centered on  the problem of underconsumption and  the avoidance of what was seen as the  problem  of  persistent  cyclical  sur pluses in the Federal budget.  'Then came  the Reagan Revolution.  Earlier doctrines were  succeeded by  supply side economics. To say again, I  saw  this happen. Huge  deficits  ap peared which were not cyclical, and  which were of no possible use. To the  contrary, just yesterday at the Finance  Committee, Matthew P. Pink, presi dent of the Investment Company Insti tute testified:  Government statistics show that personal  saving as a percent of disposable personal in come has tumbled over the last decade-from  a high of 8.0 percent in 1984, to a  low of 4.0  percent in 1993.  If government deficits are  . factored in, the situation appears even more  bleak: since the 1960s, ""net national saving""  has dropped from more than 8 percent to less  than 2 percent today.  In 1984, the Council of Economic Ad visers,  then headed by Martin Feld stein, the eminent Harvard economist,  now head of the National Bureau of  Economic Research, reported the grim  news that a structural as against cycli cal deficit had appeared and was not  going away:  REDUCING THE BUDGET DEFICIT  Despite  the dramatic  reduction  in  the  share of national income taken by govern ment domestic spending and the fundamen tal improvement in the character of our tax  system, the Nation still faces the serious po tential problem of a  long string of huge  budget deficits. Vigorous economic growth  can eliminate the cyclical component of the  deficit. But without legislative action,  the  structural component is likely to grow just  as fast as the cyclical one shrinks. The Ad ministration's economic projections  imply  that the budget deficit will remain roughly  $200 billion a year-or about 5 percent of  GNP-for the rest of the decade unless there  is legislative action to reduce spending or  raise revenue. Deficits of that size would rep resent  a  serious potential  threat  to  the  health of the American economy in the sec ond half of this decade and in the more dis tant future.  DEFICIT PROJECTION  The cyclical component of the budget defi cit is the party of the deficit that occurs be cause the unemployment rate .exceeds the in flation  threshold  level of unemployment,  i.e.,  the minimum  level of unemployment  that can be sustained without raising  the  rate of inflation. This excess unemployment  raises the deficit by depressing tax revenues  and by increasing outlays on unemployment  benefits and other cyclically sensitive pro grams.  The remaining part of the budget deficit,  known as the structural component, is the  amount of  the deficit  that would  remain  even if the unemployment rate were at the  inflation  threshold  level. The Administra tion estimates that the inflation threshold  level of unemployment is now 6.5 percent and  will decline in the coming years as the rel ative number of inexperienced workers de clines and as the Administration's employ ment policies are enacted and take effect.  Table I-2 presents the cyclical and struc tural components of the budget deficit for  1980 through 1989. The 1983 deficit of $195 bil lion was divided about evenly between the  cyclical and structural components. Because  of  the  lower  level of unemployment pro jected for 1984, a much larger share of the  current year's deficit is structural. The pro jected deficit of $187 billion includes a cycli cal component of $49 billion and a structural  component of $138 billion. By 1989, the entire  projected budget deficit is structural.

This  idea was already part of  the  public discourse. The new economics  was hard to understand. It seemed to  contradict common sense. To cite the  work of Thomas Kuhn, many or most  Americans  lived within an economic  paradigm  in which  countercyclical  spending made  no  sense whatever.  Would it not be agreed that Herbert  Hoover had the most practical and gov ernmental experience in national and  international economics of any Amer ican President? And yet, he did not  grasp  the new economics. Mind,  the  new economics had not yet evolved,  but the point is that much of President  Hoover's instinctive  response  to  the  Depression of the 1930's only worsened  that Depression. President Roosevelt  had more of an excuse, in that he knew  nothing of economics, or as near as  makes no matter. But his  instincts  were almost exactly those of his prede cessor, even denouncing in 1932 the few  countercyclical measures that Hoover  has instituted.  ",1995
188,Senate,104,0.548,1538,3,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, today, along  with Senator THuRMOND and other Sen ate Armed Services Committee mem bers,  I  am  introducing  the Ballistic  Missile Defense Revitalization Act of  1995,  for the purpose of requiring the  Secretary of Defense to develop for de ployment,  at  the  earliest  practical  date, national  and  theater ballistic  missile defense systems. The compan ion legislation, section 201 of H.R. 7,  has passed the House National Security  Committee and will soon be voted on  by the full House.  I am submitting this legislation in an  effort  to get  the Pentagon's current  ballistic missile defense program back  on  track.  Currently,  and  in  the  forseeable  future,  the United States  continues to be woefully unprepared to  cope with the threat of ballistic missile  attack. This must end; and the bill I  have  introduced  today will help end  our vulnerability.  Twelve years ago during his State of  the Union Address,  former President  Ronald Reagan posed a  simple chal lenge  to America's scientific commu nity: Find a way to make ballistic mis siles impotent and obsolete. Because,  he asked, ""ls it not better to save lives  than  to  avenge  them?"" With  those  words, President Reagan chartered one  of the most important and controver sial defense programs of  the modern  age-the strategic defense initiative.  Through the years the SDI program  was pushed and pulled  in many dif ferent directions by both the Congress  and administration. No push, however,  equalled the shove the Clinton admin istration gave  the program  in 1993.  With the elimination of key ballistic  missile defense programs,  the United  States  is now almost exclusively  fo cused on  theater ballistic missile de fenses which, hopefully, will be able to  defend our  troops deployed overseas.  But, this limited protection comes at  the expense of the development and de ployment of national missile defenses.   Focusing only on  theater defenses  and the threat that is here and now,  the administration completely ignores  analysis from our Nation's best intel ligence experts about the potential fu ture threat to the continental United  States.  Intelligence experts have repeatedly  warned that terrorism is on the rise,  that the quest for nuclear weapons in  the Third World has not subsided, and  that Russian nuclear materials have  shown up on  the black market. But,  the administration has failed to heed  those warnings.  Even the headlines lay bare the fu ture vulnerability faced by the Amer: ican people.  The Washington Times recently car ried the headline ""Yeltsin Can't Cur tail Arms Spread.""  A Clinton administration official re cently  stated,  ""The  out-of-control  weapons of mass destruction industries  in Russia are the No. 1 national secu rity issue facing the United States.""  China has sold to Saudi Arabia the  CSS-2, a medium-range missile capable  of reaching any place in Europe.  Iran  is  desperately  shopping  the  blackmarket for the technology to de velop  nuclear  weapons,  and Russia  wan ts to sell to Iran.  The threat is real. As former Direc tor of the CIA, Bob Gates, said, ""His tory is not over. It was merely frozen  and is now thawing with a vengeance.""  The CIA claims that 25 nations could  acquire chemical, biological, and  nu clear weapons by the end of the decade.  That's 20 more  than we have  today.  And, potentially, 20 nations that are  led by despots who see it as their duty  to annihilate the United States. One of  those  leaders  could be Abul Abbas,  head  of  the  Palestinian Liberation  Front, who promised revenge on  the  United States for attacking Iraq. He  said, ""Revenge takes 40 years. If not  my son then the son of my son will kill  you. Someday we will have missiles  that can reach New York.""  In day-to-day  terms,  the prolifera tion of weapons of mass destruction  among the Third World and the lack of  defenses against  those weapons could  radically alter the manner in which the  United States carries out its foreign  policy. Would we have deployed :5,000  troops in Hai ti if General Cedras had a  weapon of mass destruction and a mis sile that could reach Florida? Probably  not. Would America  stand  up  for  human  rights  and  democracy  in  a  starving nation if warlords had stolen  nuclear weapons  from Russia? Prob ably not. Would the Persian Gulf war  have been fought  if Hussein had suc ceeded in his quest, and acquired a de liverable  nuclear weapon?  Probably  not.  The world will be dramatically dif ferent in the 21st century. We cannot  predict the future. We don't know who  will do it or when it will happen. But,  it will happen. Some day,  someone,  somewhere will launch a ballistic mis sile at the United States.  When  the  warning  comes, most  Americans will believe that we will be  able  to defend ourselves. We  can't.  When  the codes  to  launch a nuclear  ballistic missile are entered and  the  keys are turned, there is no way to pre vent the missile from reaching its tar get.  We cannot  intercept it. We cannot  interfere with its guidance system. We  cannot make it self-destruct. There is  nothing we can do to stop even one sin gle missile from reaching the United  States of America. Nothing.  The Clinton  administration won't  change  the situation either.  In  fact,  it's getting worse. The Clinton admin istration and congressional opponents  have destroyed any future strategic ca pability  to defend  the United States  and are on their way to destroying po tential theater defenses as well.  This is being done by their decision  to clarify  the ABM Treaty  to define  our next theater defense missile as an  illegal missile. The ABM Treaty, re call, was  signed  in  1972  by Leonid  Brezhnev  and  Richard  Nixon.  It  shouldn't have been endorsed in 1972,  and it shouldn't be reendorsed in 1995,  23 years later. It most certainly should  not be redefined.  The threat has changed. Technology  has  improved. And  the Soviet Union  doesn't even exist. But,  the Clinton  team insists on deliberately drawing a  distinction between strategic and thea ter ballistic missiles, something that  was left undefined in 1972.  What  the  administration's  nego tiators have accomplished is not only  to negotiate away strategic systems which came as no surprise-but, also to  negotiate away the only advanced the ater systems in research and develop ment in the United States. The Clinton  administration has done this by arbi trarily placing speed limits on inter ceptors. If an interceptor breaks 3km/  sec, it is defined as a strategic ABM in terceptor and would not be deployable  as a  theater missile under  the new  terms of the ABM Treaty. Key theater  defense systems, including THAAD and  Navy Upper Tier, have capabilities be yond 3km/sec. and, thus, could not be  further developed as designed.  Over the last 2 years, the opponents  have won significant budget cuts  in  ballistic missile defenses and have suc ceeded in canceling all space-based op tions. This is especially disturbing be cause space-based sensors and intercep tors are critical to the success of any  global strategic defense system. They  provide worldwide,  instantaneous de tection of and protection against mis siles  launched from anywhere  in  the  world, and are both cheaper and more  effective than their ground-based counterparts.    During Operation Desert Shield,  it  took the United States 6 months and  400 airlifts to put in place the Patriot  interceptors that were used  to shoot  down some of the Iraqi Scuds. With  space-based  interceptors,  coverage  would be instantaneous. Yet, all sys tems  capable of accomplishing  that  mission have been zeroed. Zeroed, be cause using space for military purposes  is politically unpopular.  This narrowmindedness and  refusal  to view space ""for what it is-the high  frontier,  boundless  in opportunity",1995
189,Senate,104,-0.326,28,9,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  assuming that this is free time, I ask  unanimous consent  that  the Senator  from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, be  allowed to speak for 10 minutes.  ",1995
190,Senate,104,-0.266,28,9,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," I thank the Chair  and I thank the Senato!' from West Vir ginia.  Mr. President, I have listened care fully over the past weeks of this de bate-pro and con-on product  liabil ity. I am not an attorney, so I have  tried hard to work through what is fair  and what is not. While I would like to  have an opportunity to vote for cloture  on a more narrowly crafted bill, I can not vote  for  this bill with  the Dole  amendment included. To do so,  I be lieve, would extend the impact of the  bill  far beyond  the  limited  field of  product  liability, and  impose major  limitations  to  redress of grievances  across  the board in all civil actions,  without the opportunity of Committee  hearings in  the Senate and consider ation of how  the bill would  impact  other specific areas of the law.  Anyone who has  read  ""The Rain maker,"" the newest best seller, can see  what  impact  the Dole  amendment  would have, for example, in insurance  cases.  Insurance companies would be  able  to do exactly what was done  in  that book, act in bad faith. And I sim ply cannot support this.  I believe that Senators GoRTON and  ROCKEFELLER  have worked  hard  to  craft a bill with  reasonable  reforms  that could pass this body. I was par ticularly pleased with the compromise  reached with the Snowe amendment to  limit punitive damages  to  two  times  compensatory, which  is now part of  this bill. This  replaces  the original  fixed cap of $250,000, or three times eco nomic damages, whichever is greater. I  believe  this would be  a  fair model  wllich  takes  into consideration both  women and children whose  earnings  may be limited or nonexistent.  I  find myself in strong support of  other major provisions of this bill, as  well. Specifically, I support the imposi tion of a 2-year statute of limitations  from the time the injury and its cause  are discovered for a plain tiff to bring a  lawsuit.  This  provision  is  actually  more permissive  than  that  in many  States, and California. This provision  is actually victim and plaintiff friend ly.  Two, the imposition of a 20-year stat ute of repose, an outer time limit on  litigation involving workplace durable  and capital goods. This is a fair stand ard of repose.  The  bill would  eliminate  product  seller's  liability-including  that  against wholesalers, distributors, and  retailers-for a manufacturer's errors.  Sellers would remain liable in cases of  their own negligence. For example, if a  seller  removed  the manufacturer's  label from a toy that said it is not ap propriate for children under 6 years of  age, and a child was subsequently in jured, the seller would be liable.  The bill would preserve a plaintiff's  power to sue one defendant, theoreti cally  the  deep pocket,  for  the  full  amount  of  economic  damages,  but  eliminate such joint and several liabil ity for noneconomic damages, such as  pain and suffering.  It would allow either party to offer  to participate  in alternative dispute  resolution-something  that  I  very  much thought and hoped would be part  of this bill, and which I believe is an  important  part,  especially  for  the  plaintiffs who have small claims.  The bill would bar  recovery of a  plaintiff who is more than 50 percent  responsible for causing their accident  due to intoxication from alcohol or any  drug. This puts a fair measure of the  degree of culpability on a plaintiff in  an action.  It would reduce  the amount of the  judgment against the defendant if the  product user is found to have misused  or altered the product. I believe this is  a  just and  fair provision.  It would  eliminate liability of raw material sup pliers for medical devices, such as the  supplier  of  teflon/dacron,  products  often used to coat a medical device.  Finally, the bill would deny an em ployer at fault in causing a workplace  injury the right of reimbursement for  workers compensation benefits from an  employee who wins in a suit against a  manufacturer.  The tort liability system has been a  particular source of concern to many,  and that includes everyone: consumers,  professional service providers, manu facturers, and public agencies, all of  whom, in recent years, have faced in creasing liability insurance costs. Over  the last 40 years, general liability in surance costs have  increased at over  four times the rate of growth of the na tional economy. American manufactur ers and products sellers generally pay  product liability insurance rates that  are 20 to 50 times higher than those of  their foreign competitors. In a global  marketplace, that becomes a real bar rier to competition.  Many believe that the tort liability  system of delivering compensation  is  seriously flawed, requiring high trans action costs  to deliver compensation  that some see as inadequate and others  as too generous, but which most agree  is uncertain and unpredictable.  Putting aside  the size of the  judg ment for a moment,  the  transaction  costs associated with the current prod uct liability system-including plain tiff's attorney's fees, defense legal fees,  court proceedings and other public ex penditures, the time of the litigants- are  enormous.  The Rand  Institute  found that overall transaction costs of  the tort system actually exceed com pensation to plaintiffs.  Critics of product liability reform, on  the other hand, argue  that however  well or poorly the system performs its  compensation function, it must be pre served and indeed strengthened because  of its importance as a means of deter ring unlawful, careless, negligent con duct in the manufacturing of a prod uct.  I believe the basic bill provides a fair  and  reasonable balance. Many of its  provisions are either consistent with or  based on California law.  The two key features of the bill that  have raised the most concern are the  ",1995

196,Senate,104,0.135,236,9,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, the  1995 annual reports of the trustees on  the status of the  two Medicare  trust  funds,  released on April 3, 1995,  raise  serious concerns about future financial  viability of the Medicare Program.  The trustees conclude that the Fed eral hospital  insurance  trust  fund called Medicare part A:  First, has taken in less in Medicare  payroll taxes than it has paid out in  Medicare benefits every year since 1992;  Second, starts having to liquidate as sets next year, 1996; and  Third, will run out of money by the  year 2002.  The status of the supplemental medi cal insurance trust fund-called Medi care part B-is not much better. The  trustees ""note with great concern the  past and projected rapid growth in the  cost of the program.""  Four Cabinet members of this admin istration are trustees of the Medicare  trust  funds-the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, the  Secretary of Health and Human Serv ices, and the Commissioner of the So cial Security Administration. These  Cabinet members all signed  the 1995  trustee report, agreeing with the con clusions that the Medicare trust fund  is in serious financial trouble.  But  this administration  refuses  to  become engaged in proposing any solu tions. Repeatedly,  the President and  his Cabinet members have said  they  are waiting for the Republicans' budget  resolution before they offer any sugges tions to save Medicare.  In my memory, this is the first time  an administration has so completely  refused to be a part of the budget proc ess. The administration claims to have  done its part because it submitted its  1996 budget to the Congress. However.  the President's 1996 budget leaves Med icare  virtually  untouched. Medicare  proposals in that budget do not even do  enough  to delay Medicare  insolvency  for 1 year.  The financial problems of the Medi care Program are real. They exist re gardless of whether or not there is a  budget resolution, or the content of a  budget resolution. We  simply cannot  avoid addressing  this  issue, and  the  sooner the better.  Today, I am introducing a bill requir ing the trustees of the Medicare trust  funds  to report back  to Congress by  June 30, 1995, with their recommenda tions for the specific program legisla tion to deal with Medicare's financial  condition  that they call  for  in  their  1995 annual  reports on  the Medicare  trust funds. This is an urgent respon sibility of this administration and they  must come forward with initiatives so  that we can preserve the Medicare Pro gram, not only for future generations,  but for our current senior population.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be  printed  in  the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD as  follows:  s. 785  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. TRUSTEES' CONCLUSIONS REGARD ING FINANCIAL STATUS OF MEDI  CARE TRUST FUNDS.  (A) HI TRUST FUND.-The 1995 annual re port of the Board of Trustees of the Federal  Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, submitted on  April 3, 1995, contains the following conclu sions respecting the financial status of such  Trust Fund:  (1) Under  the Trustees' intermediate as sumptions,  the present  financing schedule  for the hospital insurance program is suffi cient to ensure the payment of benefits only  over the next 7 years.  (2) Under present law, hospital insurance  program costs are expected to far exceed rev enues over  the 75-year  long-range  period  under any reasonable set of assumptions.  (3) As a result, the hospital insurance pro gram is severely out of financial balance and  the Trustees believe that the Congress must  take timely action to establish long-term fi nancial stability for the program.  (b) SM! TRUST FUND.-The 1995 annual re port of the Board of Trustees of the Federal  Supplementary Medical  Insurance  Trust  Fund, submitted on April 3, 1995, contains  the following conclusions respecting the fi nancial status of such Trust Fund:  (1) Although  the supplementary medical  insurance program is currently actuarially  sound, the Trustees note with great concern  the past and projected rapid growth in the  cost of the program.  (2) In spite of the evidence of somewhat  slower growth rates in the recent past, over all,  the past growth rates have been rapid,  and the future growth rates are projected to  increase above those of the recent past.  (3) Growth rates have been so rapid that  outlays of the program have increased 53 per cent in aggregate and 40 percent per enrollee  in the last 5 years.  ( 4) For the same time period, the program  grew 19 percent faster than the economy de spite recent efforts to control the costs of  the program.  SEC. 2. RECOMMENDATIONS ON RESOLVING PRO.  JECTED FINANCIAL  IMBALANCE  IN  MEDICARE TRUST FUNDS.  (a) REPORT.-Not later than June 30, 1995,  the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital  Insurance Trust Fund  and  the Board of  Trustees of the Federal Supplementary Med ical Insurance Trust Fund shall submit to  the Congress recommendations for specific  program legislation designed solely(1) to control medicare hospital insurance  program costs and to address the projected  financial imbalance in the Federal Hospital  Insurance Trust Fund  in both  the  short range and long-range; and  to more effectively control medicare  supplementary medical insurance costs.  (b) USE OF  INTERMEDIATE ASSUMPTIONS. The Boards of Trustees shall use the inter mediate assumptions described  in  the 1995  annual reports of such Boards in making rec ommendations under subsection (a).

So far  this  year, the rules they have recommended  have been 70 percent closed. This is in  spite of  their promises  to open  the  process in the House.  However,  since  the  rule before us  today is an open rule, I must commend  the Republican majority.  As my colleague described, this rule  provides for the consideration of a rel atively noncontroversial Coast Guard  authorization.  It authorizes $3.7 billion for the Coast  Guard-exactly the amount requested  by the administration and only slight ly more than last year's authorization.  The  37 ,000 members  of  the Coast  Guard provide this Nation with invalu able maritime service  for everything  from search and rescue to drug inter diction and this $3. 7 billion will sup port their good work.  I would like  to commend Chairman  SHUSTER and ranking member MINETA  for putting together a truly bipartisan  bill which should pass the House with  Ii ttle opposition.  I urge my colleagues to support this  rare open rule.  Mr. Speak er, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1995
198,House,104,-0.444,288,9,Mr. STUDDS.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words, and I rise in strong support of  the Traficant amendment.  Mr. Chairman,  I  fail  to understand  why  the Republicans  feel  absolutely  compelled  to support  the administra tion's every  initiative. Now,  I under stand, I will remind Members,  this is  not some evil Republican budget cut ting proposal. This is a proposal by the  Democratic  Administration  to  cut  some $2 or $3 million, in the case of  these  small  stations,  out  of Coast  Guard. While I appreciate the intense  loyalty of  the new majority around  here, I think you should feel free to op pose  the  administration when  you  think they are wrong. I certainly do.  This is one of those cases.  I am aware that downsizing, God help  us all, is in. It is in, in corporations. it  is  in,  in government. Democrats are  busy reinventing government, and you  folks are busy eliminating government.  But everybody  is downsizing  in one  way or another. If there  is anything  that is not too big today, it is the U.S.  Coast Guard. I defy any Member of this  Congress  to  suggest  that  the Coast  Guard has too many resources. I know  that the gentleman may speak for him self, but I do not think anybody really  believes that.  Year after year, decade after decade  we have piled more responsibilities on  the Coast Guard, not less: law enforce ment, marine  environmental  protec tion, boating safety, drug law enforce ment and, of course,  the most impor tant mission of all, search and rescue.  They are one of most grossly under funded and understaffed agencies in the  Government.  To stand up here and suggest that we  need to downsize them I think is a bit  much.  We are going to have more debates  this year, I suspect, of a calculus kind  of how much is a human life worth. I  do not choose to participate in that de bate, because I do not think it can be  done. I do not think any of us is able to  put a dollar value on a human life. We  are talking about $2 or $3 or, if you say  $5 or $6, no more than $6 million. God  knows how many human lives we are  talking about. But if it were only one,  is a human  life worth $3 million?  I  guess it depends whose life it is. If it is  yours or your spouse's or your child's,  I doubt you would hesitate very long in  answering the question.  We all have parochial concerns here.  In my district,  the original  idea of  Coast Guard was to close two stations  and make one of them seasonal, sum mer only.  The first thing they ought to do  is  make Provincetown on the tip of Cape  Cod summer only. I am pleased to re port that we  talked them out of that  inane idea. I have lost five fishing ves sels with all hands since I have been in  this office out of that port, every one  of them in the winter. Talk about clos ing such a station in the winter. You  can fill in your own adjective.  Now they want to close the station in  Scituate just south of Boston and the  station in Menemsha on Martha's Vine yard. If we look at the criteria, they  are looking at response times. They are  saying, well, we need x numbers to re spond. Would you believe they use the  same response time in Florida as they  do  in Massachusetts  and Maine?  I  doubt  there  is any Member of  this  House who, if told you have to spend 10  minutes  in  the water  in  January,  would choose Cape Cod  rather  than  southern Florida. The odds,  to put it  mildly, are very, very different.  But the calculus, as we understand  it, used by the Coast Guard to say how  many minutes  response  time  there  needs  to be were uniform across  the  Nation. That is crazy. That does not  make any sense.  In New England, furthermore, as you  may have heard we have a fishing cri sis. We are about to put into effect dra matic,  new,  stringent  reductions  in  fishing efforts. This is going to mean  dramatically  increased  law  enforce ment  responsibilities  for  the Coast  Guard. Sadly, it is probably going to  mean greater search and  rescue de mands  because  people  are going  to  stretch a little bit further and go out  in weather they probably should not go  out  in,  fish  longer  than  they should  with smaller crews  than  they should  have to try to eke a living out of what  they  are  still  allowed  to  do. That  means more search and rescue respon sibilities for the Coast Guard.  Let me finally say, if I may, having  conceded that this is not an evil Re publican  budget  cutting  amendment  and sadly conceding that it is coming  from my own administration,  I hear  that there is going to be released to the  public a Republican budget this week  sometime. I do not know, and I am cer tainly not privy to the consultations  going on, but I would not be surprised  if we were to see an order of magnitude  cut across the board in the Department  of Transportation far exceeding what  we are talking about here.  This heat, this emotion that is being  engendered  in  this debate  is about a  cut  in  the Coast Guard budget of a  fraction of 1 percent. What would hap pen if the new Republican budget,  in  the spirit of downsizing of our times,  asked for a 10-or a 20-or 30-percent cut  in all functions of the Department of  Transportation? I do not know whether  that is going  to happen, but I would  not be surprised if that happens in all  so-called discretionary programs. And  if it does, the debate we have just had  on this floor will be as nothing com pared to the human lives that will be  at stake if we are presented with that.  So let us take this opportunity, Re publicans and Democrats together,  to  rally against one of the few instances  where this Democratic administration  has been wrong.  I urge  the support of  ment.  this amend Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  support  of  the  amendment offered by  the gentleman  from  Ohio. I have grave reservations with regard to  the Coast Guard's small boat unit streamlining  initiative. In particular, I am concerned with the  impact of this proposal on the maritime safety  in New England. The Coast Guard has pro posed closing three stations in Massachusetts,  including  two  in my district-Station Scituate  and Station Menemsha on Martha's Vineyard.  I fully understand the Coast Guard's need to  periodically reallocate its personnel and equip ment  resources and, generally,  to do more  with  less. However,  there are several  issues  which, in my view, require the Coast Guard to  maintain a high  level of search-and-rescue  [SAR] capacity in the region. For the past sev eral months, I have been working closely with  area fishermen, lobstermen, and municipal of ficials to study  the merits of the streamlining  plan. We have compiled what  I believe are  compelling reasons why these stations should  remain open. However, while we are most fa miliar with the circumstances in the Northeast,  these issues raise fundamental questions with  the national impact of the Coast Guard's plan.  In  my  view,  the  Coast  Guard's  rec ommendations have not adequately taken into  account  the severe weather conditions, par ticularly water temperature, prevalent in the re gion. The difference between  life and death  can be a matter of minutes in the freezing wa ters off Northeast shores. Yet in recommend ing stations for closure the Coast Guard ap plied  the same response  time  to Massachu setts as it did to Florida.  Additionally,  there  are  serious  questions  about  closing  Stations  Scituate  and  Menemsha in  the larger context of personnel  and asset  relocations  throughout New Eng land. When  taken  together  they appear  to  spread SAR  resources  too  thinly. The Coast  Guard plans  to move  three HU-25A Aireye  jets from Air Station Cape Cod to Texas and  transfer the cutter Point Jackson from Woods  Hole to Florida. Under the streamlining initia tive, the Coast Guard has also recommended  the closure of several other stations in Massa chusetts, Maine, and Rhode  Island.  I have  seen little evidence that the Coast Guard fully  considered the broader ramifications of these  recommendations.  In  fact, a  recent event has demonstrated  that the Coast Guard's SAR assets in the re gion may already be overextended. This past  ",1995
199,House,104,0.443,301,9,Mr. HASTERT.," Mr. Speaker, as we  wrestle with a way to save Medicare, I  rise  today  to urge my colleagues  to  help me  save  college wrestling and  other sports that have fallen victim to  an intrusive Federal bureaucracy.  In my home State of Illinois, four of  the major State-funded  universities  have either dropped or threatened to  drop wrestling as a varsity sport.  These  schools have been  forced  to  consider these cuts because of a mis interpretation of title IX. The Office of  Civil Rights in the Department of Edu cation has demanded that schools drop  men sports, such as wrestling, soccer,  and swimming, in order to achieve nu merical proportionality with women  sports.  This is another example of what hap pens when good  intentions turn into  unintended consequences.  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of title IX  is not to limit opportunity. The pur pose is to create even greater oppor tunity for all of our young athletes.  As a former wrestling coach, I urge  my  colleagues  to  consider  common sense changes to title IX. Let us not  allow Federal bureaucrats to pin down  the hopes and dreams of millions of  America's athletes.

Hon. NEWT GINGRICH,  Speaker of the House,  U.S. House of Representatives,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR.

200,House,104,-0.513,301,9,Mrs. MINK of Hawaii.," Mr. Speaker,  today I want to remember a native son  of Hawaii, Peter Avillanoza, who  re cently went to Oklahoma City to begin  a new mission, as director of equal op portuni ty for the Department of Hous ing and Urban Development. He moved  to Oklahoma City only a  few months  ago. He was 56 years old when he died  in the senseless bombing of the Okla homa City Federal Building.  Peter A villanoza cared passionately  about the people he served. He was a  pioneer. Peter was assigned by HUD to  work in Honolulu to help people com ply with fair housing laws. He had been  working in HUD's Orange County, CA  office. He didn't come in with a big reg ulatory stick and  levy penalties.  In stead, he prevented violations from oc curring in the first place. For 2 years,  he reached out into the community to  encourage consumers and industry to  buy into the concept of equal housing  opportunity for all. He made sure ev eryone-residents,  landlords,  realtors,  financiers  and public officials-knew  their rights and their responsibilities,  before  the  law  was  implemented.  Today, as just one measure of his suc cess, real estate industry in Hawaii re quires all  its professionals  to be  in structed about fair housing law before  granting them certificates to practice.  Peter A villanoza was born and edu cated in Hawaii. After graduating from  Kaimuki High School  in 1956, Peter  Avillanoza joined the Army, got mar ried and, after finishing his tour, used  the GI bill to get master's degrees in  business and criminology. While going  to school, he worked as a Honolulu po lice officer and in the fire department.  Peter A villanoza loved music, played  several  instruments  and  composed  songs, Hawaiian music being one of his  favorites. Friends and family recall the  day he began  singing gospel music.  That happened just last August, when,  at an outdoor religious revival, Peter  walked up to the stage and made his  peace with God.  Peter A villanoza  leaves  behind  a  great  legacy: his wife Darlene Dohi Avillanoza,  10  children,  14  grand children, and 10 brothers and sisters.  He raised his children with descipline,  fairness, and love. And he stayed con nected to them. No matter where he  was, he called his children every week,  thereby becoming the keeper of family  news.  After the bombing, relatives rushed  to Oklahoma City, struggling to find  out any details  they could. After 10  days of heartbreaking uncertainty, res cuers  found  his  body  on Saturday,  April 29.  Yesterday in Honolulu, hundreds of  friends, family and colleagues gathered  to lay him to rest. Their memories of  Peter Avillanoza, his love and his dedi cation will give them the strength to  endure his loss.  And on behalf of the people of Ha waii,  I wish to acknowledge  the pre cious life of Peter A villanoza and note  the deep personal loss suffered by his  family.  There will be no consolation for this  family. The sadness they feel must be  felt by all Americans. Only then, can  we  take the necessary steps to make  sure that his life was not taken in vain.  Hate and violence must be expunged  from our culture, and replaced with the  love and compassion exemplified in the  life of Peter A villanoza.  REPATRIATION OF CUBAN  REFUGEES TO CASTRO'S CUBA  ",1995
201,House,104,-0.362,301,9,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to express condemnation of the  secret meetings that were held between  the Department of State and the Cas tro dictatorship, and specifically be tween Under Secretary of State for Po litical Affairs, Peter Tarnoff and Com munist Cuban official Ricardo Alarcon,  which resulted  today, a dark day  in  American history, in 18 Cuban refugees  forcibly being repatriated to the Castro  dictatorship.  Mr. Speaker, I want the Committee  on International Relations, of which I  am a member, to hold hearings and re ceive a full accounting of who specifi cally authorized such a process, and all  details relevant to that process. During  March I was assured by senior adminis tration officials that no other options  prior to those that had been publicly  debated and discussed had been pre sented to the administration. And we  had the head of the Cuban desk appear  in my district talking to people from  within the community, and yet, despite  all of those statements made in public  and private,  this  type of clandestine  action occurred, and it belies private  and public assurances made to me and  others and therefore betrays trust.  I would like to know what was the  specific role of the State Department  in this latest process which was con cluded in the joint statement of May 2  with the Castro dictatorship. What was  the specific role of the National Secu rity Council, and what individuals from  the National Security Council were in volved? I would also  like  to know if  there are any other actual, understood,  or implied agreements with the Castro  dictatorship that have been made or  are in the process of being made.  No doubt our Government should be  keenly aware of the physical and psy chiatric abuse and attacks and other  ",1995
202,,104,-0.491,379,9,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize  the  achievements  of Dr.  Edgar  Wayburn and to congratulate him on receiving  the 1995 Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humani tarianism.  In  his  illustrious career, Ed has  achieved distinction as a physician, environ mentalist, and humanitarian. He  is a worthy  recipient of this award and  I join his  friends  and colleagues in congratulating him.  Many people have described Ed as  the  present day incarnation of John Muir. This is  not only an  accurate description, but one  which complements  the  legacy of Mr. Muir  himself. During his 50 years of service with  the Sierra Club, Ed was responsible for over  103 million acres of public lands in the United  States being designated as protected areas.  These lands included portions of the Redwood  National Park,  the Golden Gate/Point Reyes  region, and vast tracts  in Alaska. Their pro tected status  is a tribute to Ed's tireless en ergy and his lifetime commitment to the pres ervation of our Nation's wild lands.  On behalf of the millions of Americans who  seek respite in these natural sanctuaries, I sa lute you Ed and wish you and Peggy the best  in the years to come.

He went with a group called Medical  Group Missions, a nondenominational associa tion designed to provide assistance to needy  people worldwide.  The  trip was put  together by nurse Diana  Bennett, with whom Dr. Wilson had served on  the staff of Mt. Diablo Hospital.  As related by Dorothy Bowen in an article in  ""The Contra Costa Sun,"" Dr. Wilson  in 1993  journeyed  to Zimbabwe,  treating AIDS pa tients, living in cement block houses and work ing with serious ill patients.  This year he traveled to South America.  In  describing his trip to Ecuador, Dr. Wilson said:  We represent Jesus and His teaching and  also our country * * *. The greatest gift was  from them to us.

204,,104,-0.385,379,9,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for  me to rise before you today to pay tribute to  the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post No. 4087.  VFW Post No. 4087 celebrated  its 50th anni versary on April 29, 1995 at their beautiful fa cility that is located in my district in Davison,  Ml.  VFW Post No. 4087 boasts one of the larg est memberships  in  the State of Michigan,  with over 1300 members. The officers and  members of VFW Post No. 4087 are known  throughout the community  for their charitable  work on behalf of children. VFW Post No.  4087 is a major supporter of the VFW National  Home, which has provided care to the children  and grandchildren of America's veterans since  1925. VFW Post No. 4087 has also been an  active supporter of Little League Baseball  in  our community, helping to provide equipment  and uniforms so that young people will have  the opportunity  to play baseball. VFW Post  No. 4087 has also been an energetic sup porter of the Boy Scouts of America, playing  host to a local Boy Scout troop.  VFW Post No. 4087 has played a key role  in providing much needed medical equipment  to residents of the community. The generosity  of the members of Post No. 4087 have as sured wheelchairs and hospital beds for those  who might have otherwise gone without these  essential  items. Members of VFW Post No.  4087 frequently contribute their time, and trav el many miles,  to  the nearest Veterans Hos pital. The visits have helped  to cheer and  comfort these veterans who are sick and  in firm. Many times through the years the Color  Guards and the Firing Squad of Post No. 4087  have participated in events honoring our coun try. Their reputation precedes them. This has  resulted in many invitations to attend parades  and various  functions  in other communities,  adding a touch of class and dignity to what ever event they might attend.  Mr. Speaker, VFW Post No. 4087 has pro vided a dignified home to the bronze plaques  that honor those  in our area who served  in  World War  II. The plagues were  formerly  housed  in  the  Industrial Mutual Association  Auditorium but needed new home when  that  auditorium was discontinued. I am particularly  pleased to read on these plaques the name of  my brother, Kenneth Kildee, who served our  country in both World War II and the Korean  War.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is with great pride  that  I  stand before you  today, asking you and my  fellow Members of Congress to honor the Vet erans of Foreign Wars Post No. 4087. For 50  years they have stood firmly to their commit ment to  this Nation. Their dedication  to pro tecting and promoting the enhancement of the  ",1995
205,,104,0.419,392,9,Mr. PACKARD.," Mr. Speaker, one thing has  remained  constant  throughout our Nation's  history: The unquestioned  loyalty, dedication,  and bravery of our military personnel. As we  mark the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day, we  must never  forget  the price  that our  troops  paid. The sacrifice made by our fighting men  and women should never be forgotten.  Driven  by a sense  of duty,  our  troops  stormed the beaches of Inchon and lwo Jima,  staved off encirclements at Bastogne  and  Chosan, went  head-to-head with  superior  numbers at Guadalcanal and Midway, and  came away victorious. From the battle at Con cord Bridge  to  the  final actions  in Somalia,  American troops have proven to the world that  they are the best in the world.  In my home State of California, Governor  Pete Wilson, the county of San Diego, and the  cities of San Marcos and Escondido have al ready proclaimed 1995 as the Year of the Vet eran. These proclamations call on all  to  re member those that were so quick to answer  the call in America's time of need.  Mr. Speaker,  I urge my colleagues to join  me  in honoring all of  the brave men and  women who have put on the uniform to defend  their country by proclaiming 1995 the Year of  the Veteran.

206,,104,0.254,392,9,Mr. FLANAGAN.," Mr. Speaker, in recognition  of the 1 OOth anniversary of the founding of All  Saints Cathedral Parish of the Polish National  Catholic Church of Chicago,  IL, we  in Con gress salute  its pastor,  the Right Reverend  Robert M. Nemkovich, the clergy and parish ioner on this special occasion.  One hundred years ago, through the leader ship of Bishop Anthony Kozlowski and a large  group of Polish immigrants, All Saints Cathe dral Parish was organized. The cathedral par ish  has  been  a  force  for  good  in  the  Chicagoland area,  the State of  Illinois and  throughout our great country for 1 O decades.  The Polish-American parishioners and  their  ancestors have made significant contributions  to the cultural, economic, educational and civic  growth of out Nation.  The ancestors of the cathedral's parishion ers fled Poland for want of a better life here  in America. They brought with them their cher ished national customs,  their love of closely knit family life, and their love for their adopted  country, the United States of America.  May 21, 1995, is hereby especially noted as  All Saints Cathedral Parish Centennial Day.  The Centennial Mass of Praise and Thanks giving, celebrated this day, will commence a  year-long  celebration. We  in Congress ac knowledge  the accomplishments of  the past  and extend best wishes for the future as you  strive to serve the spiritual needs of so many  individuals. We urge all to join with the mem bers of All Saints Cathedral in the observance  of this memorable and happy occasion.

Illinois is known for all of these things, which  makes all of us justifiably proud to call Illinois  home. But what we are best known for is our  people.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to one of  Illinois' finest, a woman who has carried  the  banner for our State here in the Nation's cap ital for over 50 years, Helen Lewis.  Helen, a graduate of Western Academy  in  her hometown of Macomb, came to Washing ton in 1942 to work for the Federal Bureau of  Investigation. As he tells it, ""there was a war  on,"" and with three brothers in military service,  she came here to help.  In  1945, Helen began attending dances  sponsored by  the  Illinois State Society.  In  1947, Helen recognized that your membership  card got you into the dances free, and she de cided to join. Well, the spark fanned the flame,  and Helen has been warming  the hearts of  Washington-based  Illinoisans  for more  than  half a century.  In the 1958-59 season of the society, Helen  became an officer, and proceeded  to hold  every position the board had to fill,  including  two terms as president. This lead to her being  elected president of the Conference of State  Societies in the 1973-7 4 season.  The signature event for the society has al ways been the inaugural ball. Helen's first in augural  party was  for  the  inauguration of  President Nixon, and she has been a driving  force in every event since then. Of course, it's  not difficult to find people willing to help with  the glamorous events. It's a little bit tougher to  find people willing to commit of their time and  energy to keep the mailing  lists, select loca tions for events and keep the membership in formed. For the Illinois State Society, we have  always turned to Helen Lewis, who has orga nized the meetings, kept us faithful to our by laws and made sure that everything was done  with class and made everyone feel welcome.  Many people live here for many years with out giving up what Helen has.  In fact, Helen  says she's gone ""home, to my real home, Illi nois,"" back to Macomb, where she is settling  in, making new friends and renewing old ac quaintances. She is genuinely missed.  When the history of Illinois in our capital city  is written, the names Lincoln, Stevenson, Dirk sen and Michel will surely be included. But no  chronicle will be complete without recognizing  the contributions of Helen Lewis, who helped  make any  prairie State  transplant  feel  at  home. Helen, for all you've done for the thou sands of people who have been a part of the  society, we are eternally thankful. Good  luck  and God bless.  TRIBUTE TO HELEN LEWIS  HON. THOMAS W.

209,,104,0.271,405,9,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, unlike  the situation at the time at which the  Senator from North Dakota presented  this amendment a week or so ago, we  now have a  bill  in  the Chamber  in  which there is no cap on punitive dam ages. I say that not in triumph but in  regret. I believe that one of the great  vices at which legislation of this sort  properly should be aimed is at creating  some kind of relationship between the  actual  damages  caused  by  a  tort,  caused by a wrong, and the damages  that can be recovered as a result. But  with  the  latest  set of amendments  here, we have permitted a judge on. cer tain findings of egregious conduct to go  beyond what juries are permitted suc cessfully to impose in the way of puni tive damages.  The entire matter, Mr. President, is  at one level an argument on philosophy  but at another  level  it  is a  debate  about  the Constitution of the United  States. The Supreme Court in several  recent cases, while not setting a spe cific ceiling or cap on punitive dam ages itself, has spoken of serious con stitutional questions caused by unlim ited punitive damages, or by punitive  damages that are not related in any ra tional fashion to actual damages found  by a jury or determined by a court.  In other words, the Supreme Court of  the United States has invited the Con gress to do exactly what I had hoped  we would do more successfully than we  have accomplished in this bill.  But just to go over it again, we have  said that the maximum punitive dam ages that can effectively be awarded by  a jury are in an amount twice the total  of all economic damages and all non economic damages that go for pain and  suffering. And since those damages, in  very  serious  cases  of  people  being  maimed for life, can well go into eight  figures, and sometimes do, we have a  very large potential remaining for pu nitive damages. But in addition to that  provision,  in  the  so-called  Snowe  amendment  is a $250,000  figure when  twice the total of economic and non economic damages would be less than  $250,000,  together with the right of a  judge to go beyond even the Snowe for mula where  the  judge feels  that for mula to be too limited not to permit  proper punitive damages  for particu larly egregious conduct.  So the Senator from North Dakota,  in a number of respects, has already  succeeded. There is no number. There  is no specific formula which limits pu nitive damages.  As  I have said  frequently,  I  think  there should be. Working with the laws  of my own State and a handful of other  States where punitive damages are not  allowed at all, where the cap is zero in  most cases, we find no difference in the  safety or carefulness of business enter prises in those States. No case has been  proven  for  the  efficacy  of punitive  damages as a deterrent, in any event.  My own view is that the original limi tation in this bill was an appropriate  one, but that original  limitation has  twice been liberalized in the course of  this debate. And I express the fervent  hope that in concerning ourselves with  the proposition that we should not per mit absolutely unlimited discretion on  the part of juries, we should not have  no maximum sentence in civil cases for  wrongs, that we will make the partial  and halting move toward some kind of  rationalization which is now contained  in this bill.  Mr. President, we are in a peculiar  situation here this morning in that we  have a potential of  this amendment  and one other to be dealt with and we  do not have specific limitations on the  amount of time that can be utilized for  them. So I hope that, when either the  Senator from West Virginia or the Sen ator from North Dakota next speaks,  we can get an indication as to when  they will  finish  to  allow  the other  amendment to  take place. There will  be votes on any other amendments  which come up, but we will be asking  unanimous consent  that  those votes  take place after closing arguments and  before the vote on final passage. So the  sooner we know how  long  these  two  amendments will be debated, the ear lier we will be able to predict to our  Senators who are not here when they  will have to come back to the floor to  vote.  Mr. ROCKEFELLER  Chair.  ",1995
210,,104,-0.326,405,9,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  a couple of points. I agree with what  the Senator from the State of Washing ton said in argument to  this amend ment.  Just for  the edification of my col leagues-this fact has not been brought  out, I do not believe, in the debate-we  have removed caps, but people do not  realize,  I  think, often that there are  caps  on  some  rather  extraordinary  crimes in the Federal statutes. I will  give some examples.  Many Federal criminal fines, even for  particularly egregious crimes, do not  exceed $250,000. And that was our origi nal proposal, economic damages times  three or $250,000, whichever is greater.  Listen  to  this. If you  tamper with  consumer products and  it results  in  death, the Federal statute limitation is  $100,000 for punitive damages. If you re taliate against a witness, it is $250,000.  If you  assault  the President,  it  is  $10,000. If you rob a bank with the use  of a deadly weapon, the punitive dam age limit cap is $10,000. Sexual exploi tation of children  for an  individual,  $100,000;  in terms of an organization however that would work out-$200,000.  For treason-for treason-$10,000.  Now I say that in no way to defend  caps, because  the Senator from West  Virginia has fought for the removal of  addressed  the  caps and we have, I believe, been able  to do that.  I would,  in closing,  remind my es teemed friend and colleague from the  State of North Dakota, who is as prin cipled a person as I have ever met, that  the Senator from the State of Washing ton and I have so bloodied ourselves in  making sure we come back with effec tive removal of caps that we have said,  and that we have been unable to obtain  unanimous consent in this body to, in  effect, make  the cap  total and com plete because of a matter of 60 seconds  in  filing  the amendment,  that  if we  bring back the amendment with any thing but the cap removed, that we will  vote against  the motion  for cloture  should there be a filibuster on the con ference report.  So I really do believe that we are op erating not only in good faith but in  good substance on removal of the cap.  I hope, therefore, that what I consider  a  redundant amendment by  the Sen ator from North Dakota would be de feated.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.  ",1995
211,Senate,104,0.084,457,9,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, could I  ask a question to make a point?  When  it passed  unanimously  last  year,  that was when  the other party  was in charge, had the majority. So not  only did all of the Democrats vote for  it in a bill that was drafted by a major ity of the Democrats in the committee  and approved on  the floor, but every  Republican likewise voted for it.  So two different parties have worked  on  this  legislation  over  2  separate  years and come to exactly the same re sult. Having passed unanimously last  year, I certainly hope we can get on  with the same language, get the same  approval  this year of  the same  lan guage.  ",1995
212,Senate,104,0.623,457,9,Mr. SMITH.," I thank Senator CHAFEE  for making that point. He  is correct.  This  is not a partisan  issue. It is a  carefully crafted compromise to try to  accommodate some genuine concerns  out there among many individuals.  Again,  in  the Senate, controlled by  the Democratic Party last session, it  was passed unanimously. The Repub licans are now under control, and we  are offering  the same language again  on interstate transfer. There is not any  reason why we should have a huge fight  here, unless people, for whatever rea son, are trying to capitalize on some thing or take unfair advantage.  We felt it was fair and we continue to  feel  that now. Senator CHAFEE and I  are in agreement on that, and I know  there will be Senators from both the  importing and exporting States  that  will try to weaken or strengthen, de pending on  their position,  the  inter state portions of this bill. The bill is in  two sections-both interstate as well  as flow control. There are two sections  to the bill.  My response is, we struck this com promise last year, all parties agreed,  and  there have  been  no  significant  changes. What would be the fight?  Let me move to the issue of flow con trol, because we have heard statements  from a variety of individuals before our  committee,  very  prominent  individ uals. Senator BILL COHEN, Governor  Christine Whitman of New Jersey and  others, Congressman CHRIS  SMITH  of  New  Jersey, who  asked Members  to  move quickly  to address  the  issue of  flow control. And we did. We moved  very quickly at the behest of those in dividuals.  Frankly, ever since we moved quick ly at their behest, we have been getting  beat about the head and shoulders by  some who asked Members to move at  their behest. A number of witnesses ex pressed a strong concern that without  prompt congressional action to provide  for continued authority  in  this area,  many communities would be in danger  of having their bond ratings lowered.  That is true.  For those of my colleagues who may  not have heard me speak to this issue  on the subject of flow control, let me  be clear. This bill is in my subcommit tee, the Superfund Committee, which I  chair. It is in my jurisdiction.  I tried to craft a compromise, which  I think we did successfully, to get the  bill to the floor and help those people  who did have a problem. I oppose flow  control. I  think it is wrong. I do not  support walking away from the inter state commerce clause of the Constitu tion. I believe that we ought to stand  firm on that.  There is a situation that has devel oped, as Senator CHAFEE has already  outlined, where  individuals-munici palities-have let bonds, and there are  people who stand to lose on this. So we  tried  to craft a  compromise.  In that  compromise,  we  basically  grand fathered,  with  reasonable  grandfathering provisions,  those com munities.  I do not believe that flow control is  necessary to deal with the problem of  solid waste. We do not-I think the pri vate sector can do it just fine. I do not  believe  the  free market  is  broken.  There is no evidence that the free mar ket is broken in this area.  There are many people who are in volved in the transport of this mate rial, and I refuse to believe that recy cling cannot be accomplished without  flow control. I simply do not believe it.  I do not think there is any evidence to  say  that. But some States and some  communities got themselves in a bind,  and we are trying to help them out of  that bind.  Instead, we are being attacked for  trying to help them, in many ways by  those who wanted it and now have dra matically changed or moved their posi tion. That is the reason why nothing  has happened, because everybody wants  their position.  This  is a  compromise. That is  the  point. I am sympathetic to the commu nities that feel they need congressional  assistance on  this matter. There are  some. If we are starting from ground  zero and there were no bonds let, no  ",1995

214,House,104,0.493,509,9,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," Mr.  Speaker, I feel compelled to respond to  the allegations that this budget cuts  Medicare and cuts Medicaid; that just  is not true. Just look at the budget,  and look at the figures in the budget.  Today every Medicare  recipient,  the  average across the country, gets $4,700.  At the end of this budget process that  will have risen to $6,300. That is not a  cut.  What we are going to do is to pre serve the Medicare system. It is now  doomed  unless  one  does  something  about it going bankrupt by 2002. We are  not cutting Medicare. It will increase  from $4,700 to $6,300 per every recipient;  that is not a cut.  Let me say it again: When you go  from $4,700 to $6,300, that's not a cut.  Please be productive. Please join us  in this process to perfecting a budget  that is going to save our country for  our children. Do not continue with  these misstatements of fact.

What they do not tell us is that Medi care and Medicaid reform is actually  health care  rationing. House Repub licans want to cut Medicare and want  to cut Medicaid to pay for tax cu ts for  the wealthy, for wealthy special inter ests and to pay for star wars. Repub licans want to force  the elderly into  HMO's and to health maintenance or ganizations which will only lead to ra tioning of heal th care and will lead to  taking away of physician choice. Re publicans want to do that all because  some people in this House want to cut  taxes on millionaires, cut taxes on mil lionaires forcing Medicare and Medic aid patients into rationing and taking  away  their  physician  choice. Mr.  Speaker,  it  simply  does  not make  sense.  WASHINGTON PHILANTHROPY  (Ms. PRYCE asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend her re marks.)  ",1995
216,House,104,-0.473,509,9,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, the level  of Medicare and Medicaid cuts would  gut health care for the elderly and the  poor leading to rationing of health care  to those people to whom we promised  health  security:  $400  billion  over 7  years; that is a breathtaking amount.  That will mean cuts in Medicaid for  the frail, elderly, and nursing homes,  leaving them to languish there without  care, if they are lucky enough to get  into a nursing home at all. Commu nity, at-home-nursing services will be  cut, denying them that assistance as  well. Hundreds of hospitals and clinics  will be  forced  to close because  they  will not be able to afford care to the  newly under-insured as well as all the  uninsured of which there are 42 million  in this country, a problem the Repub licans even refuse to acknowledge ex ists. Doctors will  turn Medicare pa tients away as their payment levels to  them start resembling those for Medic aid, and greater costs will be borne for  the elderly who live on fixed incomes,  many of whom will be pushed below the  poverty line.  Mr. Speaker, this budget is cruel, it's  cynical, and it's mean.  ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT  DESTROYING SANTA ROSA ISLAND  (Mrs.  SEASTRAND asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",1995
217,House,104,0.536,509,9,Mrs. SEASTRAND.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I bring to light another example  of the overreaching arm of the Federal  Government. Santa Rosa  Island  off  Santa Barbara, CA, happens to be one  of the homes for the snowy plover bird.  The National Park Service has decided  that the snowy plover is so endangered  by cattle ranching on the island that a  3-mile-long  fence  and  road must be  built  to protect  the bird. The  local  ranching company must build the fence  within 7 days or the Government will  do it for them and give them the bill.  Scientific  data  proves  that  cattle  ranching on Santa Rosa Island does not  endanger the bird. In fact a strong case  can be made  that 93 years of cattle  ranching has actually led to a greater  proliferation of the bird.  D 1115  Unfortunately,  the Department  of  Fish and Wildlife refused to review this  data.  Mr. Speaker, the Endangered Species  Act was supposed to protect species in  danger of becoming extinct. It was not  meant to be a vehicle to destroy the  well cared for environment of Santa  Rosa Island.  ",1995

223,House,104,0.162,574,9,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman,  I  certainly  rise  in  strong  support  of  the  substitute  amendment. I might just say in com ment to that last interchange, I would  suggest that we are not here today to  pass a know-nothing piece of legisla tion. We should be here today passing  legislation based on the 20 years of ex perience, more than 20 years of experi ence, that we have had, so that we can  look at  the successes of the past 20  years and correct  the errors of  the  past.  I believe  that  is exactly what  the  Saxton-Boehlert-Roemer  substitute  does. It takes the best of both worlds.  It does 11\9t say we are going to take  two steps' backwards  instead of  two  steps forward. That is exactly why I  am supporting it today. We must strive  to maintain those aspects of the law  that have  proved  clearly  successful  over the past 20 years and apply what  we have  learned  in 20 years  to  the  present situation. That is exactly the  merit of this particular legislation.  With or without  the dispute about  what  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences does or does not do, I  think  the best of the National Academy of  Sciences wisdom is incorporated in this  amendment and used to supplement it.  I also want  to point out from  the  point of view of the State of New Jer sey, but I  think New Jersey's experi ence and concerns are equal in many  other States, i want to point out that  this is a very serious issue in the State  of New Jersey, particularly the State  which  is  the most densely populated  State in the Nation and  is clearly a  coastal State. I  think the committee  bill proposes a much narrower defini tion  of wetlands,  and  consequently  large tracts of valuable wetlands will  lose  their protection  in  the State of  New Jersey.  As has already been documented by  my colleague, the gentleman from New  Jersey [Mr. SAXTON], µpwards  of 80 per cent of existing wetlands in New Jersey  would face a changed status, and this  would have a very serious detrimental  effect on  the quality of life and  the  drinking water quality for all of our  citizens. The gentleman has laid that  out for us.  It seems appropriate to me that we  should take the advice of the experi ence of the last 20 years and apply it.  Second, as the gentleman from New  Jersey [Mr. SAXTON] also carefully doc umented in his opening statements, the  committee  bill's  language  regarding  nonpoint source pollution represents a  dramatic change in existing policy that  a coastal State like New Jersey simply  cannot afford to endure.  These changes would bring signifi cant negative economic  impacts not  only to New Jersey, but those negative  impacts would  apply  to  all  coastal  States.  I suggest  that my colleagues  pay close attention to the problems of  the Coastal Zone Management Act that  Mr. SAXTON has already pointed out.  Third, the committee bill section on  dredging is of some great concern to  those of us in New Jersey, as I know it  is to Representatives of other adjoining  States. Although I know that some of  our New Jersey people have been work ing on adjustments in the committee  print, or the mark, on that subject, it  is my understanding they are grossly  inadequate  to  the standards  that we  want to see maintained in New Jersey.  In conclusion, I simply want to again  endorse  strongly  this  substitute  amendment that we have before us.  Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  support of  the  Saxton-Boehlert-Roemer  substitute  amend ment  to H.R. 961,  the Clean Water Acts  Amendments of 1995.  Given  that  it  is now more  than 20 years  after the original Clean Water Act was written,  we must modify and improve this pivotal envi ronmental  law based on our experience and  the documented successes of the period.  Mr. Chairman, this must not be a one step  forward/two steps back exercise.  In updating the Clean Water Act,  the Con gress should strive to fix shortcomings of the  existing  program, without  jeopardizing  the  progress that the United States has made in  cleaning-up our water supply, at  the same  time we strive  to maintain  those aspects of  this  law  that have clearly been successful.  And that is what the Saxton-Boehlert-Roemer  amendment does.  After reviewing the Public Works and Infra structure Committee's version of H.R. 961,  and consulting with the State of New Jersey's  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  [DEP],  I cannot supports  its passage,  in  its  present form.  In several areas, this legislation poses a se rious threat to the State of New Jersey and its  own efforts to carefully manage our water sup ply and environment.  First, the committee bill is proposing a new,  much narrower definition of ""wetlands"". Con sequently,  large  tracts of valuable wetlands  will lose their protection, and could be vulner able to development. According to some esti mates, upwards of 80 percent of the existing  wetlands in New Jersey would face a change  in status under the committee's new language.  And this in New Jersey the most densely pop ulated State in  the Nation which means that  this would have a negative detrimental effect  on the drinking water quality of our citizens.  ",1995
224,House,104,0.415,587,9,Mr. ROBERTS.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the substitute.  Mr. Chairman,  this  is a  ""while I""  speech. While I share the concern and  admire the leadership of Messrs. BOEH LERT  and  SHAYS  and  formerly Mr.  SAXTON,  I must rise  in opposition  to  this amendment.  Let the record show that I am for a  clean Chesapeake Bay. Let the record  show I hope the gentleman from New  Jersey is able to swim as long as he  wants  in  the Susquehanna, or what ever. But I must say that agriculture  has a stake in this. I think there has  been debate here, and as chairman of  the House Committee on Agriculture, I  feel compelled to inform Members that  most of those interested in agriculture  are very  concerned about  this  sub stitute.  Now, you are going to say ""Who is  that,"" and I am going to tell you. The  Agricultural Retailers, American Asso ciation of Nurserymen, American Crop  Protection  Association,  American  Farm Bureau, American Feed Industry,  American Sheep  Industry, American  Soybean Association, CF  Industries,  Inc., Agriculture Association, Farm land Industries, the dairymen, and Na tional Association  of State Depart ments of Agriculture. They are  ex tremely important as you work on the  environment. You have got  to work  with  the state departments of agri culture as well as  the state depart ments of environmental protection.  We  have  the wheat  growers,  the  cattlemen,  the corn growers,  the cot ton council. I can go on and on and on.  But basically all of agriculture says  while they understand the concern and  the apprehension of those who have of fered this substitute, that we need this  bill. We need the other bill.  Now, why? Let me also add, if you  are from rural and small town Amer ica,  the National Federation of Inde pendent Business, one of the many out fi ts here that rates Members of Con gress. Some Members of Congress that  are about, wake up in the offices, wake  up here. The NFIB rating, two times,  one on the substitute and one on final  passage. They are opposed to the sub stitute; they are for the final passage.  Why would the NFIB and agriculture  indicate  their opposition  to  the sub stitute? Well, the substitute allows the  1987 Core Delineation Manual  to be  used for making wetlands determina tions. That  is  the manual  that has  caused all the problems. That has been  the problem.  This bill sets out a better determina tion,  a much better definition. This  1987 manual would let the regulators  decide wetland hydrology by looking at  ",1995

Guthrie  Squadron, a charter member of the Arnold Air  Society, located on the campus of South Da kota State University  in Brookings, SD. The  Guthrie Squadron was established  in 1951 ,  and named in honor of Capt. Bernie V. Guth rie, an Air Force pilot who was shot down over  Hamm, Germany during World War II.  Since its establishment, the Bernie V. Guth rie Squadron has had an outstanding record of  accomplishment and community service. The  squadron  instituted an annual veterans vigil,  which began as a  local project  in  the  late  1980's and was expanded  into a permanent  nationwide project  in 1991.  In addition,  the  Guthrie Squadron sold POW/MIA bracelets at  South Dakota State University to increase stu dent awareness of POW/MIA issues, and insti tuted a POW/MIA name tracing project which  included all area squadrons.  The Guthrie Squadron has also served the  community and the State by organizing blood  drives, participating in the Big Brother/Big Sis ter Program, and working with handicapped  children and adults. It has received numerous  honors, including the Outstanding Squadron of  1992,  the Outstanding State Service Award,  and the Jaycees Community Service Award.  I ask my colleagues to join me today in rec ognizing  the achievements of  the Bernie V.  Guthrie Squadron,  and  to  encourage  the  squadron to continue its long and proud tradi tion of service in South Dakota.  HONORING THE CROATIAN  FRATERNAL UNION  HON. PETER J.

234,House,104,0.392,769,9,Mr. BILBRAY.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment. I would have to say, as  someone who has spent 18 years fight ing to clean up  the pollution in San  Diego County, it concerns me when my  colloogue from California speaks of the  pollution problems in San Diego, when  in fact we can recognize that one of the  major problems we have had is that the  regulation has taken precedence over  the science and the need to protect the  public health.  This bill as presented by the chair man reflects  the scientific data  that  shows that not only does having chemi cally enhanced primary not hurt the  environment, but it also shows that the  studies that have been done by many,  many scientific groups,  in fact every  major scientific study in the San Diego  region has shown that if we go to sec ondary, as my colleague from Califor nia would suggest, that the secondary  mandate would create more environ mental damage than not going to sec ondary.  This is a big reason why a gentleman  from Scripps Institute, a Dr. Revell,  came to me and personally asked me to  intervene. My  colleagues may  not  think  that I have any credentials in  the environmental  field, but I would  point out that Dr. Revell is one of the  most noted oceanographers  that has  ever  lived  in  this century. He  just  passed away. He was saying strongly  that  the  secondary mandate on  the  city of San Diego was going  to be a  travesty, a  travesty  to  the people of  San Diego but, more important, a dam age to the environment of our oceans  and our land.

236,House,104,-0.512,795,9,Mr. BECERRA.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I also rise in strong  support of this en bloc amendment of fered by my esteemed colleague from  Michigan. It is true that at times we  try to do our utmost to protect our so cieties and our communities from pol lution, from hazards, from the environ ment when we create  those hazards.  But oftentimes we do not succeed.  It is unfortunate  that current  law  has not done the job of protecting cer tain communities, mostly low-income  communities, minority  communities,  when it comes to things like environ mental hazards. Let me give some very  concrete examples.  I represent a portion of the city of  Los Angeles. I happen to represent, in  portions of my district, some of the  wealthiest individuals in Los Angeles,  and at the same time in another por tion of my district I represent individ uals of very low income.  On one end of my district I have no  freeways crossing through the district.  I have no problems with waste dumps.  I have no problems with projects for in cineration plants or for pipelines for  oil  to be passed through. But on  the  other side of my district, I do. I have a  district that has within its 5-mile ra dius around seven prison facilities that  have been housed there over the last 10  years as a result of a supposed need by  the county  to have a place  to house  prisoners. We have a toxic waste dump  that is on the EPA site for cleanup, and  it must be taken care of because it is  emitting  pollutants  and  hazardous  emissions. I had, at one point nearby, a  proposal to build a toxic waste inciner ation plant in the district or close to  the district. It has not gone through,  but clearly present law was not enough  to protect this. Current legislation is  not enough to protect, and we need the  en bloc amendments by  the gentle woman from Michigan to make sure we  do so, because there is a danger, it is  clearly the case, the facts show it, that  disproportionately minority  commu nities,  low-income communities share  the exposure, the highest exposure and  the burden of that exposure of those  environmental hazards.  We should and we must do what we  can to ensure that there is equal treat ment of all communities when it comes  to hazardous wastes to make sure that  they are all protected, but oftentimes  we do not go far enough. This gives us  an opportunity to ensure that the past  wrongs can be righted and that we will  never make  those mistakes again, so  that every community, whether  they  are very empowered, very enfranchised,  or not, have  the opportunity  to say  that they will benefit from the protec tions of our environment that we are  trying to do here today.

241,House,104,0.528,834,9,Mr. BARTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I support the  clean water bill, H.R. 961. Among  its many  good provisions, which have already been de scribed and extolled, is a commonsense solu tion  to an  issue  that has unnecessarily bur dened cities  in my district, as well as many  others, regarding separate ""Sanitary Systems  Overflows"" [SSO's].  H.R. 961  instructs  the EPA  to develop a  reasonable, flexible, consistent, and economi cally  feasible  approach  for  controlling  dis charges from SSO's. It also instructs them to  stop, review, and modify enforcement actions  for projects required under the old policy.  While overinterpreting the Clean Water Act,  the EPA has  required cities with SSO sys tems, like Dallas and Fort Worth in my district,  to eliminate all overflows. The overflows  in  question do not present a public health or  water quality concern. Yet,  to date,  the EPA  has forced cities in Texas alone to begin hun dreds of millions of dollars of work to eliminate  all overflows. This bill will correct this situation.  We have come a long way since  I asked  EPA officials  to meet  in my office with  rep resentatives of Dallas and Forth Worth on this  issue, when few others were raising this con cern.  I thank the chairman of the Transportation  and  Infrastructure Committee for his help on  this issue and would like to work with him to  make some  technical and  refining changes  that are currently being discussed.  I strongly  support  the solution  included  in  this bill and  look forward to it becoming law.  ",1995
242,House,104,0.4,834,9,Mr. BONILLA.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  strongly urge all my fellow Members to  vote  for H.R.  961, Clean Water Act  Amendments. This is much needed leg islation. The Clean Water Act includes  an unfunded Federal mandate which  places a  terrible  toll on our State,  county, and local governments and the  taxpayers who pay their bills.  In my hometown of San Antonio, TX,  the Federal stormwater regulation-a  provision of the Clean Water Act-has  forced the municipal water districts to  raise  taxes on property owners. This  egregious  assessment  is  listed  on  monthly water  bills  as  the  FED  STMWTR FEE, so constituents know  this levy is a direct result of Federal  mandates. Let me  tell you,  they are  upset.  ",1995

RABBI AND REBBETZEN RYBAK  HONORED  HON. WIWAM J. MARTINI  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 1995  ",1995
244,,104,0.19,847,9,Mr. MARTINI.," Mr. Speaker,  on Sunday  night, May  14,  1995, Rabbi Dr. Solomon  Rybak and Rebbetzen Dr. Shoshana Rybak  will observe the completion of 1 O years affili ation with the congregation and service to the  Passaic and Clifton communities at Congrega12729  tion Adas Israel in Passaic, New Jersey. I con gratulate them and wish them all the best as  they celebrate this truly special occasion.  Rabbi and Rebbetzen Rybak have been  recognized as exceptional personalities in the  Passaic-Clifton area as well as  in  the  larger  metropolitan  New  York-New  Jersey  edu cational community. Both have attained signifi cant achievements  in  furthering Jewish edu cation and values. Upon completing his stud ies at Yeshiva University and  receiving  rab binical  ordination  from  the  late,  renowned  torah  giant Rabbi Dr.  Joseph Soleveitchik,  Rabbi Rybak served as Rabbi Soleveitchik's  research assistant in  the Rogosin  Institute of  Ethics. Rabbi Rybak was appointed by Dr.  Samuel Belkin, President of Yeshiva Univer sity, to the position of Rosh Yeshiva at the Ye shiva University High School and held that po sition  for 27 years. Rabbi Rybak earned his  Ph.D.  in Semitic languages from the Bernard  Revel Graduate School of Yeshiva University  and has lectured and published on educational  and Halachic topics.  In addition to his duties  as spiritual  leader of Congregation Adas  Is rael, Rabbi Rybak  is a Professor of Jewish  Studies at Touro college, serves as the editor  of CHAVRUSA, the professional publication of  the Yeshiva University Rabbinical Alumni and  is a member of the executive board of  the  Rabbinical Council of America.  Equally  accomplished, Rebbetzen Rybak  has balanced the dual role of a Rebbetzin and  a professional in her daily routine. Rebbetzen  Rybak was educated in both Israel and in New  York and holds a Jewish Teacher's Diploma  from Beth Jacob Seminary and a Doctorate in  school and clinical psychology from Pace Uni versity. Rebbetzin Rybak has been involved in  many of  the congregation's programs, con centrating on the youth Yorn Tov celebrations  and the congregation's Simchat Torah, Purim,  and Yorn Haatzmaut festivals. As a therapist  and  licensed  psychologist, Dr. Rybak  has  been  involved with several groups of excep tional children  including the handicapped, the  developmentally disabled and the gifted. She  is currently the clinical coordinator at the He brew Academy for Special Children [HASCJ in  Brooklyn and  is a member of several profes sional organizations  including  the American  Psychological Association, the National Asso ciation of School Psychologists, and the Coun cil for Exceptional Children.  Upon their arrival in Passaic in 1984, Rabbi  and Rebbetzen Rybak  found  a diversified  community  representing  the  full spectrum of  modern Jewish society.  In a quiet and unas suming manner Rabbi and Rebbetzen Rybak  began actively participating in the ongoing re vitalization of  the Passaic-Clifton community.  The contributions of Rabbi and Rebbetzen  Rybak over the past 10 years have been  in strumental in continuing to make Passaic and  Clifton  attractive  to  young  Jewish  couples  looking for a vibrant area in which to establish  their home. Their dedication  to  community  service and education serves as a role model  and inspiration to all. I salute these two fine in dividuals, and can only say that I am proud to  call  them members of  the Eighth Congres sional District of New Jersey.  ",1995
245,House,104,0.242,860,9,Mr. BATEMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I take  it the gentleman agrees with me and  shares my concern that if you just im plemented the raw data from the new  formula, 29 States would lose, some of  them as much as 9 percent of their  funding.  ",1995
246,House,104,0.379,860,9,Mr. PETRI.," That is absolutely right.  What this would do,  too,  is, frankly,  based on needs and not looking at what  States  have  done  tends  to  reward  States  that have been  ineffective  in  using funds they got under the last pro gram  rather  than States  that have  done a good job.  It seems to me that is a  little bit  funny,  plus  removing  the  nonpoint  source approaches here and the needs  assessment survey does not reflect the  broadening of the State and Federal  pollution fighting effort. The needs are  based on wastewater needs, not on  total needs in each State.  ",1995
247,House,104,0.254,860,9,Mr. FLANAGAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words, and I rise in strong support of  the Lipinski amendment and in opposi tion to the Bateman substitute.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman  from Virginia for his very thoughtful  substitute. And he is my friend and I  reluctantly oppose his substitute here.  I would  say  that under  its current  form, title VI of the Clean Water Act  amendment authorizes an annual allo cation of $2.5 billion over the next 5  years for State water pollution con trolling  revolving  funds  or  SRF's.  These SRF's provide critical assistance  to States for  the operation loan pro grams, for the construction and main tenance of municipal wastewater treat ment plants. These loans represent the  frontline for localities in their struggle  to improve our drinking water quality.  However, as it is written now, title  VI  unfairly  distributes  these  funds  under a bizarre and outdated formula  that is based on estimated needs and  population statistics from  the 1970's.  Instead,  the Lipinski  allocation  re flects real needs and uses real current  census data, the result being a better  return for each dollar spent.  The Bateman  substitute,  on  the  other hand, attempts  to address  in equity through a level of caps and also  trying to move in this same direction.  But  to offer or foster  the argument  that we have a past inequity that is 20  years old, that is based on data that is  that old, that will only move  toward  correcting it rather than correcting it  now seems to be perpetuating the same  wrong of the past just to a  lesser de gree.  I  think in pure fairness, we should  adopt the Lipinski amendment and re ject  the Bateman substitute, painful  though it may be for those States who  have, under the current calculation, re ceived more than they should have for  many years and will continue  to re ceive more under this substitute.  If  the Lipinski amendment  is not  adopted,  then States  like California,  New York, and my home State of Illi nois will  lose millions. The Lipinski  amendment is a question of fairness.  With the adoption of this amendment,  States like Illinois will  receive  their  equitable share of SRF assistance as  opposed  to something closer to  their  equitable share.  So I urge my colleagues to support  the Lipinski amendment and to defeat  the Bateman substitute.  ",1995
248,House,104,-0.176,860,9,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in  opposition  to  the Bateman  sub stitute  amendment,  and  I move  to  strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my very  good friend, and I mean this sincerely,  my very good  friend,  the gentleman  from Virginia [Mr. BATEMAN], putting  forth this amendment. He and I came  to Congress together. We were friends  then.  In the last few years, we worked very  closely together on the Merchant Ma rine Subcommittee. In fact, I doubt se riously there has ever been a majority  or minority that worked any closer to gether. So  I  am happy  that he has  brought forth this amendment. I know  that he frames it as a compromise, but  in all honesty I do not see it as a com promise. It is a minute step  in  the  right direction but only a minute step  in the right direction.  Let us  remember  that my amend ment simply restores what was in the  bill last year, what was in the bill at  the beginning of this year, and what  was not removed from the bill until the  subcommittee markup.  At the full committee markup, I at tempted to return to the original for mula in the bill based upon 1990 popu lation and needs. We lost. We lost on a  vote of 30 to 30. Unfortunately the 31st  vote in our favor wandered in the door  a few minutes after the gavel fell. The  next day we attempted to revive it for  another vote, but we failed. It was ta bled.  Mr. Chairman, I have heard people  talk about here today that it was de feated in committee. There have been  letters sent out saying it was defeated  in committee, my amendment.  It  is  true, but I  thought I would put it in  the proper perspective.  Once again I would like to reiterate,  there are winners and there are losers.  I oppose and I ask you to oppose the  Bateman substitute, and I ask you to  support the Lipinski amendment, par ticularly the following States: Arizona,  California, Connecticut, Florida, Geor gia,  Illinois,  Indiana, Kansas, Ken tucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New  Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Or egon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas,  Virginia, Washington, and West Vir ginia.  If you do not defeat  the Bateman  amendment and support  the Lipinski  amendment,  those  States will  lose  close to $800 million.  ",1995

Par ticularly my colleague, the gentleman  from Georgia [Mr. NORWOOD], who is a  fell ow member of  the Economic and  Educational Opportunities Committee,  has launched a relentless series of at tacks on OSHA.  Today, I would like to make a special  appeal to Congressman NORWOOD  that  we lower our voices and make a sincere  effort to humanize our discussion. In stead of focusing on the overwhelming  but abstract  statistics  such  as  the  56,000 hard-working Americans who die  each year from job related causes, from  now on let us emphasize instead the in dividual workers with names and faces.  There are workers in Mr. NORWOOD's  district  like William McDaniel, who  without adequate  restraining protec tion fell 80 feet off a television tower to  his death  in Pendergrass, GA. Like  Paul Powell, who was crushed in  the  unguarded drive shaft of a machine at  an Augusta, GA, plant. Like Earnest  Gosnell of Homer, GA, who was operat ing a  timber log skidder that had no  safety belts when  the machine over turned and crushed him.  these  fine  Americans were all  residents of Mr.  NORWOOD's district in Georgia.

KANJORIGI  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 12, 1995  ",1995
253,,104,-0.303,977,9,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to pay tribute to the Rotary Club of Danville,  PA which  is celebrating the 75th anniversary  of its founding. I am pleased to have been in vited  to participate  in  the anniversary dinner  on May 13 and  to have  this opportunity  to  bring the history of the club to the attention of  my colleagues.  Founded in 1905, by Paul Harris in Chicago,  the Rotary has been an institution in America  ever since. The first Rotary meeting consisted  of Paul Harris and  three other businessmen.  Out of that meeting came the idea to  form a  men's club  representing  local business and  the professions. Weekly meetings were held,  12859  in turn, at each member's place of business.  This is how the organization came to be called  Rotary.  The purpose as defined by its founder was  to undertake civic  functions of value  to  the  community. Mr. Harris was successful  in his  endeavor. Now known as Rotary International,  the  organization  has  grown  to more  than  25,000 clubs,  in 172 countries, with member ship well over a million and a quarter. In 1988,  Rotary opened its membership to women.  Fifteen years after Paul Harris founded Ro tary, the Danville Rotary Club was organized  and given its charter, No. 651. This club has  served  the community with dedication ever  since. The club boasts  three District Gov ernors from  its ranks from 1938 to 1993. The  club  joined with Bloomsburg and Berwick to  found the Columbia-Montour Boy Scout Coun cil  in 1924. Boy Scout Camp Lavigne was  named  in honor of Jack Lavigne, a charter  member of the Danville Rotary.  Over the years,  the club has sponsored a  children's clinic,  the student exchange pro gram, Cub Pack 36, Crop Walk, Danville Com munity Center, Thomas Beaver Library, Edith  Buckley Brown A.L.S. Foundation at Geisinger  Medical Center,  to name  just a  few of  the  club's beneficiaries. ""Service Above Self"", the  motto of Rotary International, is the tradition of  the Danville Club.

WOOISEY  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 12, 1995  ",1995
254,,104,-0.556,977,9,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor two brave and very dedicated women,  Nancy Hudson and Nancy Knoble, who are  deserving of special congressional recognition  for their efforts to call international attention to  the battle against breast cancer. They are very  positive  role models  for other women  faced  with this same situation.  The two Nancy's recently participated  in a  successful climbing expedition of the 23,085foot Mount Aconcagua  in Argentina  in which  16 breast cancer survivors  took part. They  should be commended for their participation in  this novel effort, organized by Breast Cancer  Fund of San Francisco, to raise money for re search and  treatment of breast cancer. The  two were  recently  recognized by  the White  House for their efforts during the Clinton ad ministration's Medicare Mammography Aware ness Campaign. I know that their enthusiastic  response  to  fighting  this disease  in such an  active manner helps to motivate others to re double  their efforts against  this deadly dis ease, as well as  the example  they set and  hope they give to other cancer survivors.

I believe  the Chair has the amend ment.  What we have attempted to do here  by this amendment, as reported by the  committee, S. 395 would immediately  authorize ANS exports carried in U.S. flagged vessels.  When the administration testified in  support of  lifting  the Alaska North  Slope crude oil export ban, they indi cated the bill should be amended, one,  to provide appropriate environmental  review; and second, to allow the Sec retary of Commerce to recommend ac tion against anticompetitive behavior  by exporters, and to establish a licens ing system.

Mr. Chairman,  the gentleman  from  Michigan [Mr. DINGELL] and I serve as  the House Members on  the Migratory  Bird Commission and as such we work  on ways to preserve in a voluntary way  the wetlands  of  this National  and  North America that are important to  waterfowl.  Over  the past several decades  that  this program has existed, we have in  99-059  0--97 Vol. 141 (Pt. 9) 38  fact preserved 7 million acres of wet lands  through  the North American  Wetlands Conservation Fund and 4 mil lion acres through the Migratory Bird  Commission  funding. All of that has  been done voluntarily.  This amendment allows us  to con tinue to recognize those lands that are  important for the development and the  growth of waterfowl in this country. It  is a good bipartisan amendment. I ap plaud my colleague for offering it. I ap plaud my  coJleague,  the  gentleman  from Michigan [Mr. DINGELL], for join ing in support of this amendment.

281,House,104,0.416,1211,9,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to the motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, what we have heard on  this motion  to  recommit  is  simply  nothing more than the same old delay ing  tactics. This motion  if  it were  adopted would gut the bill. What we  have heard here now is nothing more  than  the same old scare  tactics.  In  fact,  I was  somewhat astonished  to  hear our friend in the well refer to the  Milwaukee  tragedy as an example of  something  that presumably  the  bu reaucrats  could  have  prevented  or  could prevent in the future if we were  somehow to adopt the big-government  bill that they would prefer.  As we all know, the tragedy in Mil waukee occurred because of wildlife in  the stream, because of deer polluting  the water, and so I can see apparently  if we follow through my good friend's  suggestion  to  its  logical  conclusion  that we will have bureaucrats  from  EPA out there in Wisconsin with lassos  lassoing the deer to keep them out of  the stream. It obviously simply does  not wash. This whole  idea that they  somehow  through more  government  and more command control from  the  top on down can somehow correct these  problems does not wash.  Indeed, we  have before  us an historic  environ mental  bill,  a  sound  environmental  bill, a balanced environmental bill.  I would point out to my friends that  as we have worked  through over 30  hours of debate on this historic legisla tion, we have defended the committee  position with overwhelming votes. We  have  reformed  the wetlands and we  have defeated  the weakening amend ments by 50, 60, 70, 80 votes. We have  reformed  stormwater. We  have  de feated the weakening amendments by  60, 70,  80 votes. We have provided a  workable  nonpoint  source  program.  And, yes, we have provided flexibility  to the States and to the localities. We  have created a situation where a city  like San Diego will not have to spend  $3 billion needlessly which is what the  EPA was attempting to force the city  of San Diego  to do even  though  the  California EPA and an eminent group  of scientists said that it was unneces sary for San Diego.  Mr. Speaker, these are the kinds of  reforms and improvements which have  been made in this historic legislation.  Yes, we have also provided substantial  funding. Not as much as many of us  would like to see, but substantial fund ing so we can continue with this very  successful program.  As we move along to conference, we  certainly continue  to have an open  mind.  If there are other suggestions  and as we sit down with Members of  the other body  for  further  improve ments to this legislation, we certainly  will be able to address those issues and  we will do our very best to do so.  I know some Members have concerns  about the formula. You have my com mitment to work in conference to fix  the formula.  Mr. Speaker,  I would urge my col leagues,  they  can  proudly  and  proenvironmentally vote ""yes"" on final  passage, vote ""no"" on this motion to  recommit. Vote ""yes"" on final passage  to pass this historic clean water legis lation.  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  WALKER). The question is on the mo tion to recommit.  The  question was  taken;  and  the  Speaker pro  tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.  ",1995
282,,104,0.471,1289,9,Mr. WELDON of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, today  I am  introducing, with my good friend FRANK  the Low-Income School Choice Dem onstration Act of 1995.  Mr. Speaker,  in some parts of  this great  country,  the state of education continues  to  decay-despite throwing more money at the  problem. The liberal solution  is more money,  more bureaucracy, more regulation, and great er Federal intrusion into our schools.  I, and my colleagues joining me on this bill,  feel differently. We should  focus on parental  choices, deregulation of classrooms,  the ac quisition of essential skills and knowledge; and  good, objective tests that tell us how our chil dren are doing.  Education  is subject to a great many de bates and ideas. One of those ideas is allow ing parents to choose the school their children  attend. Some may say we shouldn't allow the  parents to decide what school might best pre pare their child for the world outside. But, I be lieve it is essential that we allow our parents  to determine what is best for their children.  In an article from  the Washington Post this  past weekend, a high school student was very  surprised to find out she had scored perfectly  on her SAT test. This was despite knowing  she had  incorrectly answered at  least  two  questions. How could this happen? Well, cur rently the College Board, the organization that  administers the SAT, is recentering the scores  to bring the average back up to 500 points. It  is a sad commentary on the state of our Na tion's educational system when we have  to  lower the standards of education in order for  our students to score well on their college en trance tests. This must stop. We must better  educate our children.  Breaking down old, outdated barriers and  confronting the new paradigm of change and  innovation has been the hallmark of this Con gress. The  first 100 days of  this Congress  brought a tremendous amount of chang~. The  primary thrust of all the ideas that have been  circulating is to reduce the role of Government  and empower the American people  to make  their  own  decision  about  their  lives. The  Weldon-Riggs  Low-Income  School  Choice  13171  Demonstration Act of 1995  is an  innovative  and creative way of changing the status quo  in the debate about education reform and edu cation choice for all Americans.  This demonstration project is a tiny step, but  a step nonetheless, toward change and a bet ter educational  future  for .our most valuable  asset, our children.  A good education is a key ingredient in end ing the cycle of poverty that entraps so many  of our Nation's children. This bill will  liberate  the parents of low-income children to choose  a school that meets the educational needs of  their children.  Improved education is essential for our Na tion's economic vitality. Our increasingly com petitive global economy demands a well-edu cated work force, and this bill will serve as a  catalyst for improved education.  In 1986, almost 94 percent of high school  seniors were unable to solve multistep mathe matical problems or use basic algebra. In fact,  a 1994 survey by  the Carnegie Foundation  found that few college professors feel U.S. un dergraduates are prepared  for higher edu cation: only 20 percent of professors believe  undergraduates have adequate written and  oral communications skills and only 15 percent  feel undergraduates are sufficiently skilled  in  math and qualitative reasoning.  As  for literacy, most young Americans are  functioning at  rudimentary  levels: enough  to  get through the day perhaps, but not enough  to sustain a strong democracy, a competitive  economy, and a vibrant culture. According to  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, functional il literacy costs U.S. businesses $300 billion  in  lost productivity annually.  Our children need the opportunity to pursue  a good education.  If  this educational oppor tunity  is outside  their  school  district,  they  should have the chance to take advantage of  it and find their American dream through qual ity education.  Last November,  the American people sent  me and many others to Congress to change  the way the Government works. School choice  is one step toward changing  the attitudes of  the Federal Government regarding education.  Under the Weldon-Riggs education bill, the  Secretary of Education would review applica tions from school districts around  the Nation  and select 10 to 20 school districts to partici pate  in  the  school  choice  demonstration  project. Children who are eligible for the Fed eral School Lunch Program could participate,  and their parents would receive certificates to  use at any public, private, or charter school in  the area.  Two $5 million grants would be available to  the most needy districts. They would be tar geted to those communities with highest num ber of  low-income children. The  remaining  grants would be in varying amounts up to $3  million.  Parents could use the money to send their  children to public, including charter schools, or  private,  including sectarian, schools of  their  choice. The money could be used to pay rea sonable transportation costs and would be lim ited to the average per child expenditure in the  local public school.  The Weldon-Riggs  school  choice  dem onstration bill would cover 3 years, with an ini tial cost of just $30 million. Each participating  ",1995
283,Senate,104,0.551,1302,9,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, Presi dent Clinton announced today that he  is going to veto the rescission package.  President Clinton is going to veto our  effort to reduce Government spending  by $16 billion. President Clinton, who  continues  to  talk about deficits,  is  going  to veto a bill  that cuts more  spending than any rescission bill in the  history of this country.  Why is he going  to do  that? He  is  going to do it because he is committed  politically  to  the  special  interest  groups who stand to lose from our put ting  the Federal Government  on  a  budget like everybody else. I think Bill  Clinton should start representing  the  public interest and not the special in terests  that support  the Democratic  Party.  I think it is outrageous, when we are  running a $175 billion deficit, when the  deficit is heading toward $350 billion,  and the President, to defend things the  way  they are  in Washington, DC,  is  going to veto a bill that cuts 16 billion  dollars' worth of Government spending.  The President should sign the rescis sion bill. He should join our effort to  put the Federal Government on a budg et like everybody else. Ultimately, we  have to make a decision. Are we going  to change the Government in order to  bring back  the American dream, put  the Federal Government on a budget,  let families keep more of what  they  earn, or are we going to continue to  support business as usual in Washing ton, DC?  When Bill Clinton vetoes a $16 billion  cut in Government spending to protect  a few pet programs, he is putting the  political  interests of his administra:ion and his party in front of the inter ests of the people of America. I do not  think the American people are going to  like it; I think they are going to react  negatively  to  it;  and  I  think  they  should.  President Clinton can stop us on the  rescission bill. He can get Democrats  to vote and sustain his veto. I think it  is important that we pass the bill, that  we challenge him, and that we try to  override this outrageous veto. But for  next year, beginning in October, we are  going to be writing the appropriations  bills, and so the President is not going  to have the ability to veto bills unless  he wants to shut down Federal depart ments.  I think we are fast coming to the mo ment of truth. Are we serious about  dealing with Government  spending?  Are we serious about putting the Gov ernment on a budget  like everybody  else? Or are we committed to the same  old special interest groups that have  dominated American Government  for  40 years?  By vetoing an effort to reduce Gov ernment spending to protect special in terest programs, President Clinton  is  saying he is willing to protect business  as usual in Washington. I think this is  something  that we have  to fight be cause I think we are down to the basic  principle on which the American peo ple cast their votes in 1994, and I think  they expect us to stand up, speak out,  and fight for putting the Federal Gov ernment on a budget  like everybody  else.

286,House,104,-0.516,1406,9,Mr. SABO.," Mr. Chairman, I yield my self such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, members of the com mittee, first let me congratulate, as I  did in committee, my colleague from  Ohio. We are both participants and ob servers of this process. I congratulate  him for getting the Republicans on the  Committee on the Budget together. I  assume when the 2 days of debate are  over, he will have the votes and he will  pass his resolution, which has required  an exceptional amount or work by him self and the other majority members of  the committee.  I  have very  fundamental  disagree ments with  that  resolution,  but  I  watch your discipline and your hard  work with admiration. So I congratu late you for putting a product together  that  is before  this House  today and  really  presents  the  opportunity  for  some very fundamental debate.  However, let me make one observa tion as an observer before I say some  words  as  a  critic. The  question  is  whether your plan will achieve its stat ed goal. Let me simply say that we are  not quarreling over a few numbers here  and there, and we might find some that  we might dispute. But I, frankly, think  for you to succeed requires a signifi cant amount of luck.  I  think  if  this were a  unicameral  body of the Congress and this were the  final product, it simply would not suc ceed. There are some things you have  put into place and have put into law al ready. Your beginning assumption has  been a big tax cut, which adds roughly  $90 billion  to  the deficit in the year  2002.  You assume as a separate vote that  you are going  to make huge cuts in  Medicare  in a separate vote removed  from the balance of the budget to come  in September.  My friends,  if that bill were before  this House with those kinds of cu ts in  Medicare, with  the numbers  in your  resolution, I would predict that such a  bill would not pass this House.  The numbers are sort of interesting.  The tax cut is $90 billion in the year  2002. The projected Medicare cuts are  $86 billion. If that did not succeed, a  whole series of other numbers that you  use would come unraveled.  Mr. Chairman, that is merely an ob servation about the plan that is before  us today. It would require significant  luck to succeed. But that is not my  fundamental objection.  Mr. Chairman, we have had two very  fundamental things occur over the last  15-20 years in this country. For the last  20  years, we have had a  revolution  where  income  flows  in  this country.  The very rich have gotten much richer,  and  the rest of the American public,  who work hard, working families are  struggling to get ahead, many with de clining income.  We have also had, since 1981, an esca lating Federal deficit. Two years ago  we passed the President's program to  make a significant dent in that deficit.  Part of that program was asking the  most affluent to pay a little more, and  our Republican  friends  all  said no.  They all said if we passed that pro gram, we would throw the country into  a recession. The opposite happened. We  have had unprecedented growth over  the  last  2 years. Unemployment  is  down. The economy  is growing. The  deficit went down.  But more is left to do, and we come  to that now in this year 1995. Again, we  have  to  reduce  that deficit, but we  face, again, a country where  income  continues  to  flow  in  increasing  amounts to a very few and the bulk of  the American people are  left strug gling.  We now have the Republican proposal  on how to deal with the deficit. Who is  asked to sacrifice? It is clear that peo ple who depend on Medicare and Medic aid will be asked to sacrifice. And then  in a series of incredible, numerous de cisions, struggling Americans, who are  working hard, working Americans, find  their chances to move ahead, they will  find  those doors sometimes slammed  shut; other cases,  sort of gradually  closed in a series of cut, after cut, after  cut, whether it is students trying to go  on to college, people seeking to get new  training for jobs and retraining, wheth er it is a parent trying  to put their  child in a Head Start Program, cuts on  them frozen.  The TRIO Program for kids,  to get  them  to go  through high school and  into  college,  abolished. Low  income  seniors who have problems with fuel  ",1995
287,House,104,0.697,1419,9,Mr. SANFORD.," Mr. Chairman, I was  going  to discuss  the short-term out look for  the U.S. economy. Unfortu nately, time will not permit much de tail, but I would also like to address  Laura D'Andrea Tyson's recent state ment that budget cuts pose significant  downside risks to our economy.  I think this shows an antiquated no tion that the more Government spends,  the better off our economy. This does  not seem consistent with what we have  seen over the last 30 years. It also does  not recognize what Government  fun damentally  does: Government  redis tributes wealth, it does not create it.  There are three real  threats in the  near term to our economy. First would  be the possibility that Congress does  not act seriously on the budget deficit  that is facing us; second,  that Japan  resolves the run-up of its currency to  our detriment; and third, that a trade  war  ensues  between  America  and  Japan. Let us explore all three for just  a few moments.  First, our Nation's budget deficit is  the biggest threat to our economy. I  think that for several reasons. First, if  we were to look on relative terms, the  ratio of public debt to gross domestic  product that our Nation is facing right  now is the highest that our Nation has  ever  faced.  Second,  a  child born  in  America  today will  end  up  paying  $187,000  in  interest  costs  over  the  course of their lifetime, simply as their  share of past Federal spending.  Third, it is simple math. The stand ard of living is directly driven by pro ductivity, which  is driven by  invest ment, which is driven by savings. The  larger  the Government  share of  the  economy, the smaller the personal sav ings will be, and  there will be  less  money for investment.  The second near-term  threat would  be the international value of our cur rency. I think there are two grave dan gers on this front. One is that almost  anything that Japan does in the near  term  to correct  its over-valued cur rency will hurt our economy.  At 75 yen to the dollar, Japan's gross  domestic product [GDP] equals Ameri ca's GDP. That clearly does not make  sense.  It is unsustainable,  and will  change. The only question is when.  Second,  the  risk of  losing  reserve  currency status. If the Asian central  banks were  to use gold as a  reserve  asset instead of the dollar, or simply to  decrease their dollar holdings, I think  it would  have  very  damaging  con sequences for the American economy.  Finally, I think the third risk facing  us is the possibility of a trade war with  Japan. I think we ultimately would be  the ones most affected by this, because  any escalation of global tariffs would  especially hurt  the  largest  trader  in  the world, which is the United States.  Specifically,  I  do  not  think  that  Japan is the problem. The problem fac ing our economy is a  tax system that  rewards consumption over savings and  investment.  ",1995

One of the tragedies we. have faced in  this  country  is  that we  have  even  masked the true size of the debt and  deficit. We have used the Social Secu rity cash flow surplus for that purpose.

291,House,104,0.231,1458,9,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Chairman,  this Mem ber would  like to express his support for the  House Budget Committee-approved  budget  proposal. Congress must act now to adopt a  plan to balance our Federal budget.  If a bal anced budget is not adopted, and current pol icy is maintained, our Nation's children will be  left with a country that is fiscally bankrupt. A  balanced budget will ensure that the next gen eration will inherit a future that is full of oppor tunity.  This Member shares the goals of the budget  committee  to eliminate  the budget deficit by  the year 2002. The budget proposal offers a  road map to achieve this goal by providing il lustrative savings recommendations to the Ap propriations Committee and  the various au thorizing committees, demonstrating  that  the  budget can be balanced. While this Member  notes that these recommendations included in  the budget proposal are nonbinding, the over all spending allocations are in fact real funding  levels which must be adhered to by the Appro priations Committee.  This  budget  proposal  offers  a  common  sense approach that allows spending to con tinue  to grow, yet at a slower rate.  In  fact,  Federal spending grows about 3 percent an nually under this budget proposal, rising from  $1.588 trillion in fiscal year 1996 to $1.817 tril lion in fiscal year 2002.  In addition, this Member would like to com mend  the House Budget Committee  for recin  of  State  student  incentive  education  vocational  ommending the termination of many wasteful  Federal  programs.  However,  this Member  would like to state his concern regarding sev eral of the programs suggested for termination  or reduction. These suggestions should be re considered during  the deliberations  that will  take place between now and the start of the  new fiscal year. This Member's concerns with  the  recommendation  of  the House Budget  Committee are as follows:  Sharp  reductions  in agricultural commodity  support programs;  Sharp reductions in export promotion, credit  and  insurance programs. During  the GA TT  subsidy phase-down period,  this amounts  to  something close  to a unilateral disarmament  for our export base;  Elimination of such programs as  the com munity development block grant, HOME, and  the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Program;  The elimination of several rural health pro grams;  Deep  reductions  programs;  Termination  grants;  Sale of the Western Area Power Administra tion;  Elimination of section 2 and section 3(b) im pact aid programs;  Complete phase-out of Corporation for Pub lic Broadcasting;  Total phasing out of the entire Amtrak oper ating budget.  In linking these concerns I would emphasis  that alternative  reductions  in other programs  and agencies would be  supported by  this  Member to meet the budget  targets. Having  listed these objectives or concerns to the illus trative or suggested House Budget Committee  recommendations,  this Member is pleased to  note that the rule contains clarifying language  regarding  reductions  in agriculture programs.  Included  is a commitment to  reexamine agri cultural policy in 1999 and 2000 if there are  certain negative consequences as a result of  these reductions.  Mr. Chairman, the House Budget Committee  proposal departs from the failed status quo: It  offers bold  leadership for a balanced budget  by the year 2002. This proposal is an  impor tant step in the effort to secure a bright and  prosperous future for our Nation's children.  ",1995
292,House,104,-0.491,1458,9,Mr. SERRANO.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  strong opposition to House Concurrent Reso lution 67,  the Republican  leadership budget  resolution for fiscal year 1996.  I believe  the Members of  this House are  unanimous in agreeing that we must bring the  Federal deficit under control. While there are  differences over whether the budget must be  in absolute balance or whether deficits, and  surpluses, have a role in stabilizing the econ omy, getting  the deficit down  is a universal  goal. We must reduce the amount of debt we  leave to our children.  But  there are  legitimate questions about  how fast to go, how steep a glideslope is fair  or wise. The Rules Committee's requirement  that  all  amendments  produce  a  balanced  budget by fiscal year 2002 limits the proposals  this House may consider to  those  that slam  the brakes on Federal spending.

293,Senate,104,-0.095,15,14,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I want  to commend and congratulate an out standing employee of the Department  of Agriculture in Alabama, Beulah G.  Varnell. She has been working in var ious  capacities  for  the Department  there for over 50 consecutive years.  Prior to  joining the Department of  Agriculture's Consolidated Farm Serv ice  Agency  [CFSA],  Mrs.  Varnell  worked at the Red Stone Arsenal  in  Huntsville, AL,  for a short period of  time. In 1945, she began work as Assist ant Clerk of Conservation Materials  and  the next year became Principal  Conservation Material Clerk. She pro gressed  steadily  over  the  next  few  years to Senior Clerk in 1949.  Beulah Varnell has demonstrated ex ceptional ability to assuming and car ryin6 out many programs, with pri mary  responsibilities  for administra tive, price support, conservation, wool  and mohair, and feed grain. She be came Chief Program Assistant in 1966  and is known across the State for her  knowledge of CFSA programs and her  extraordinary ability  to get  the  job  done and done well. This is reflected by  her willingness  to help out with all  other programs in the county office.  She has worked  for  four different  CEO's during her 50 years with  the  agency. She has always donated annual  leave to the leave transfer recipients  and maintains  hours  of annual  leave at the end of each year as indi cated by all available records. She cur rently has accumulated 4,103 hours of  sick leave, and has never been off work  for any extended period of time. Th~re  is a familiar anecdote that Beulah once  had a wreck while on her way to work  and  asked  that  her  typewriter  be  brought to her home so that she could  continue  her  duties  uninterrupted.  That is dedication.  Beulah married Royce Varnell, who  is retired from  the Tennessee Valley  Authority, in 1950. She is very close to  her family, including her brother, 3 sis ters,  nieces,  and  nephews.  The  Varnell's  have  two  farms  in  Rogersville, AL, one planted with soy beans,  the other maintaining several  head of cattle. Beulah has lived on a  farm in Rogersville all her life and has  been  associated with all  aspects  of  farming  through personal experiences  and her job with CFSA.  She  is  an  active member of  the  Rogersville Church of Christ where she  teaches a class. Beulah and Royce have  a garden every year and also maintain  240  a  numerous  assortment  of  flowers  around their home. In her spare time,  she enjoys crocheting and quilting. She  also  enjoys  spending  time  at  the  camphouse on the Tennessee River, vis iting with friends and family.  In short, Beulah Varnell enjoys life  to  its fullest,  and  is happiest when  helping others. She is a great asset to  CFSA and  the Department of Agri culture, having always  remained  to tally dedicated to the needs of county  producers. I congratulate her and sa lute her as one of the best examples of  public service our Nation has to offer.  IS CONGRESS ffiRESPONSIBLE?  LOOK AT THE ARITHMETIC  ",1995
294,House,104,0.418,93,14,Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky.," Mr. Speak er, we have heard a lot of hot air from  the liberal Democrats about Medicare.  But when  they  talk about Medicare  what they really mean is medi-scare.  They don't really want to save Medi care from bankruptcy. All they want to  do is scare people in to voting for their  party. For Democrats it is perfectly ac ceptable to let Medicare go bankrupt- just as long as they have a political  issue it doesn't matter what the truth  is.  And the truth is that Medicare will  be broke in 7 years if we don't take se rious action  right now. Republicans  have not walked away from this issue.  Unfortunately for the American peo ple, liberal Democrats have used Medi care  for  their  twisted  scare  tactics.  You see, liberals can not win elections  with the force of their superior ideas.  The only strategy that works for lib erals is fear and disinformation.  Bu,t the American people are smarter  than liberals would believe. They will  not buy the scare tactics and they will  not allow Medicare to go bankrupt. Mr.  Speaker,  later  this month Medicare  will  turn 30 years old. The Medicare  Trustees Board  reports  that  unless  something  is done quickly, Medicare  will not survive another 7 years. Re publicans have responded to this warn ing. We are committed  to protecting  and preserving Medicare so that it can  observe many more anniversaries.  It would be wrong to just ignore the  warnings of those in charge of Medi care. But,  that  is exactly what  the  Democrats are doing. They ignore the  advice of leaders in their own party.  Three of Bill Clinton's cabinet sec retaries are on the Medicare Trustees  Board, and yet the liberal Democrats  here in the House act as if they do not  exist. By  their silence,  liberal Demo crats are admitting they would rather  see Medicare go bankrupt.  The difference here, Mr. Speaker, is  that Republicans want  to save Medi care, Democrats do not want to do any thing.  FDA's charge that the tobacco family  is out to addict children is ludicrous on  its face.  Mr. Speaker, as tobacco farmers go  to market, I want to assure them that  the radical left wing of the other party  will not get away with  its selective  persecution of their historic and legal  American industry. To the farmers in  eastern North Carolina keep up  the  good work, help is on the way.

295,House,104,0.449,93,14,Mr. TIAHRT.," Mr. Speaker, last year  Republicans stood before the American  people and made a promise that if we  took the majority, we would conduct  an audit of the operations of the House  of Representatives. Today the findings  of this audit are presented.  The audit had to be conducted. For  years the American people were inun dated by countless stories of misuse  and abuse of congressional privilege.  The light of truth and accountability  had to be shown on the institution that  is responsible for spending the Amer ican tax dollars.  I would just point out that this would  never have happened had  the other  party  remained  in  the majority.  It  would never have occurred to the other  party to put themselves on the same  level of accountability that they hold  every other financial  institution and  every business in America under.

296,House,104,0.391,106,14,Mr. LIGHTFOOT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  am pleased to present H.R. 2020, a bill  making appropriations for the Depart ment of Treasury, the Executive Office  of the President, General Services Ad ministration, and various independent  agencies for fiscal year 1996. The bill  being considered  today was given  a  very appropriate number, H.R. 2020.  1145  We call it a bill with vision, starting  with a strong vision for a future free of  debt and deficits. This bill cuts $403  million in real spending from 1995 en acted levels, and that is 3 percent less  than last year.  Mr. Chairman, a couple of points I  would like to make about the spending  portion of the bill that I think may be  of interest to some Members.  There are claims that this bill is over  1995 by $401 million in budget author ity. That number has been shown  in  various charts and reflects a compari son of H.R. 2020 to 1995 assuming enact ment of  the  rescission supplemental.  The reason this number looks so high  is quite simple. H.R. 1944 includes a re scission of $580 million  from GSA's  Federal Building Fund. As the number  for 1995 comes down,  the number for  1996 simply looks bigger.  The fact is, the bill is actually a cut  in outlays, and that is a  real cut in  spending by about $403 million. There  seems to be a lack of understanding or  misunderstanding about the difference  between budget authority and outlays  among some of our colleagues, particu larly some of our newer Members. The  fact is, outlays are the money that is  spent. It is quite simple. If you can cut  outlays, you cut actual spending. We  are  cutting  $403 million  in  actual  spending;  these are dollars  that will  not be spent. That is the number that  counts in deficit reduction, not budget  authority, because budget authority is  simply authority to spend the money.  Until you spend it, it does not really  count for anything.  As a result, I would like to remind  my colleagues the bill is within its sec tion 602(b) allocation  in both budget  authority and outlays and there are no  Budget Act points of order against con sideration of the bill.  Mr. Chairman, I will insert a table in  the RECORD  that compares the bill by  account  to  the amounts appropriated  in 1995 and the amounts requested !>y  the President.  I would urge my col leagues to look at this chart because, if  they review it, I  think  they will see  that each proposed spending level by  program is below the 1995 level in every  single  instance,  except  for  crimes,  parts of IRS, and law enforcement ac tivities.  I also would like to  thank my col league,  the gentleman from Maryland  [Mr. HOYER], and members of our sub committee, for their work in helping us  put this package together. I think it is  important to note  that about 90 per cent of our budget was off limits. We  could not touch it because it supports  salaries and fixed expenses. We had to  make our contributions to deficit re duction using only 10 percent of our al location. The 602(b) number that we re ceived was a tough one, and we had to  make some tough decisions in the proc ess. I think that will be reflected in the  bill if people will take time to study  and go through it.  Again I would like to thank the gen tleman from Maryland [Mr. HOYER] as  well as the other subcommittee Mem bers for their cooperation, and also the  great work our staff has done in work ing through this very difficult bill.  As reported, H.R. 2020 also has a vi sion of change for programs that are  under our  jurisdiction. One  that  re quires agencies and activities to tight en  their belts,  to  think better and  smarter,  and  to use  their  resources  more wisely. That vision includes the  Executive Office of the President.  Mr. Chairman, this is not a partisan  measure, despite some attempts being  made to label it so. We have had a lot  of years of runaway spending  in this  body, and, as a  result, everyone has  shared in the weal th over  the years.  Unfortunately, that has brought us to  the point we are at today, where every one  is going  to have  to share  in the  pain of cutting back. That includes the  Executive Office of  the President as  well.  The facts speak for  themselves. We  held 42 hearings over a three month pe riod,  including a week's interruption.  We heard from 174 witnesses, including  members  of  the administration,  the  private sector, and Members of Con gress. Everyone was given an oppor tunity to justify their requests for re sources in the upcoming fiscal year.  I would also say that,  today, Mem bers have had more than adequate time  to take a look at what is in our pack age. After subcommittee markup,  it  laid out  there  for almost a week.  I  shared it with Mr. HOYER and our col leagues on  the minority side several  days before we went to subcommittee  markup. The  full committee markup  has been available now for over a week.  And if people are running in here at the  last minute,  I would say maybe we  should take a look at some of the staff  work that is not being done by Mem bers on both sides who are calling at  the  last minute  saying  ""We  didn't  know this."" There is no excuse. It-has  been out there a  long time and there  has been enough  time  for people  to  take a look at it.  preparing  this  package,  we  scrubbed  the numbers, we  looked at  what was being requested, we looked at  In  agency accomplishments,  their goals,  and their plans for the future because  that is an important part of the proc ess. We separated out programs  that  were merely  those  that were wanted  from programs that were truly needed.  After doing  that, we  sat down  and  wrote the bill.  First and  foremost, H.R.  2020 out right  terminates  agencies  and  pro grams that have outlived their useful ness, that produce work that can be ac complished by others parts of the gov ernment or private sector, or simply  have a place in a  leaner and stronger  government.  In many cases we found duplication.  Where we  found duplication,  one of  those duplicates departed. We success fully terminated four agencies as a re sult of that process, for first year sav ings of $7.7 million and 5-year savings  of $40.8 million. Those four agencies are  gone, nada, zero. They are zeroed out.  They don't exist anymore. There  is  nothing partisan about it. Not even the  termination of  the Council  of Eco nomic Advisers.  Mr. Chairman,  to my critics who  claim  that we are being partisan,  I  would simply say, think again. As we  prepared the bill, I did not sit down and  ponder what would be a strong partisan  statement. I do not view myself as a  partisan individual. I spent my time a  bit more  constructively, and  simply  produced and pondered on what could  be  and should be good Government.  Then we sat down and made the mark.  I will challenge my critics who say  this bill goes too far as we debate H.R.  2020 here today on the floor. Ironically,  H.R.  2020  is also being criticized by  those who believe it does not go  far  enough.  That is right. On  the first hand we  are being criticized for going too far,  and on the second hand, the measure is  being  criticized  for  not  going  far  enough. We have a lot of people angry,  so that probably tells us we probably  have a pretty good bill. If we have ev eryone upset on all sides, it may be be cause we are  in  the mode of making  cuts.  But to our critics who say we have  not gone far enough,  I would simply  say to them, stop and think. We need  to be smart about the process.  This  is a  first step in a multiyear  process, the bill we will consider today.  We  have  taken  programs, we  have  merged their activities, and started a  serious downsizing. Rome was not built  in a day, nor did it burn down in a day.  I think it took 3 or 4, if I recall history  correctly, and the Federal Government  c~nnot stol) in its tracks overnight.  It is a big train, and it has been mov ing for a lot of years, and it cannot be  stopped  simply by  throwing a  brick  wall up in front of it. If we are going to  avoid a crash, what we have to do  is  apply the brakes in a very slow, a very  deliberate, and a very positive manner,  ",1995

299,House,104,-0.306,145,14,Mr. LUTHER.," Mr. Chairman,  I support  the  amendment  to prevent  the use of  funds  for  timber  roads and  timber sale preparation  in  roadless areas. I support it because it makes  sound economic sense and will save tax payer  over $18 million.  Given the fact that our national debt is ap proaching $5  trillion,  I believe  the Federal  Government should not bear the responsibility  for  timber  companies  to  construct  logging  roads in areas currently without roads. While  there may be a case for a logging program,  this is an example of where the return to the  taxpayer does not justify the cost.  The U.S. Forest Service has already con structed 360,000 miles of logging roads, or 8  times the total number of miles  in our inter state highway system. Even with this existing  infrastructure, the Forest Service loses money  on many timber sales, in part, because of the  cost of constructing new roads. And the most,  expensive  roads  to construct are  those  in  roadless areas.  By  prohibiting  the  construction  of  these  roads, we can  increase  the  return on  tax payers' investment in the U.S. Forest Service  timber program. This  is an example of  the  type of common sense  that voters  in Min nesota and across the country are looking for  in  their elected  leaders.  It  is  fiscally  respon sible.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this com mon sense amendment.  ",1995
300,House,104,0.217,145,14,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  in sup port of  the Kennedy-Boehlert-Vento amend ment  to stop the construction of new Forest  Service roads in roadless areas.  There  is a good  reason why  these areas  have remained roadless in the past. It is costly  and environmentally unsound  to harvest tim ber  from  these areas. Most of  the  roadless  areas are extremely remote, mountainous, and  generally not well-suited to timber harvesting.  The cost of harvesting and  removing  timber  from these areas is tremendous, and because  of the difficulty of constructing good roads on  steep slopes,  timber sales  in  roadless areas  almost always lose money.  Last year, the Wilderness Society re ports that 109 of the 120 National For ests lost money. This is $337 million of  the  taxpayers money which could be  used for more productive programs.  Logging and  road building  in  these areas  carries enormous environmental costs as well.  Roads contribute  to soil erosion and  sedi mentation of rivers  that harm  fish and other  aquatic organisms.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Forest  Service  has  claimed  that  it  is moving  toward ""ecosystem  management."" If this is true-and we certainly  take  them at  their word-it should not be  building roads on remote and untouched tracts  of forest lands.  Mr. Chairman, why would we  knowingly  build roads and harvest timber in areas where  it is uneconomical and environmentally dam aging  to do so? The  forests belong  to  the  American people, and I believe that they want  to put an end to below-cost timber sales. The  first sales to be eliminated ought to be those  that have the greatest financial and environ mental costs-timber  in previously  roadless  areas.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to sup port the Kennedy amendment and protect our  wilderness areas and the taxpayers dollars.  ",1995

The amendment  is also de signed to reduce funds to the Forest Service  for timber sales in roadless areas.  If enacted, this amendment would shrink the  amount of timber acreage suitable for harvest ing by roughly one-third. One-third. The Ken nedy amendment would have the effect of tak ing more than 60 million acres and essentially  designating them as ""wilderness"" areas.

Today in this Congress, we reaffirm  one of  those examples with  the an nouncement of the privately conducted  audit of this institution, the first ever,  the  first  in  its history finally being  completed.

Because  you see, Price Waterhouse,  the  inde pendent accounting firm with whom we  contracted to do  the audit, said that  the records were so poorly kept that  they could not even make an accurate  assessment of the problem.

I do so because I regard it as a  first step in a more effective strategy  to enable the Bosnian people to exer cise the right of self-defense to bring  this horrible war and its atrocities to  an end and to do so in a way that will,  in the  long term, reinforce  the cohe sion of the alliance.  Those who argue against this legisla tion fear that it risks a crisis within  the alliance.

But it  seems that the administration moves  from crisis to crisis in Bosnia without  a clear definition of what our policy is  or ought to be. We have alternated be tween  indifference and almost panic,  operating without purpose ancl often  seemingly without principle.  Over 2 years ago, as  the policy of  ""safe  havens"" was  being  defined,  I  came to this floor expressing a concern  and a question.  ""A police action,""  I  said,  ""protecting  safe  havens,  will  probably stop some short-term suffer ing, but it will answer few  long-term  questions. After we purchase a  ternporary peace for fleeing refugees, what  is our eventual goal?"" I asked. ""On this  question,"" I  then said, ""this adminis tration is silent.""  Now it is 2 years later and that even tual goal is still unclear, and that si lence has become a source of consider able embarrassment. For, 2 years later,  little has changed. The  situation  is  worse.  We have maintained, during that pe riod of time, a one-sided arms embargo  against Bosnia which has only served  to reinforce the advantages enjoyed by  the Serb aggressors.  We have placed critical command de cisions  in  the hands of international  bureaucrats who have not brought any  military experience, political  insight,  or even moral courage  to  their posi tion.  We have made a  series of  threats  against Serbian forces that proved hol low, empty, undermining our credibil ity with both friends and  foes alike  around the world.  And  we  have  repeatedly  misled  Bosnian  leaders,  first  opposing  and  then  supporting  various  initiatives,  leaving the Bosnian Vice President to  conclude ""We are going to die of these  initiatives.""  Mistake has  followed  failure  in an  unending downward spiral as each safe  area became progressively unsafe.  ""I don't remember a time,"" says one  expert, ""when there was so much scorn  for American foreign policy."" Former  British Secretary David Owen  com ments, ""To the day I go to my grave, I  will not understand the policy.""  The result has been an American re treat into a purely reactive mode. Our  only role, it seems, is to respond to Eu ropean proposals and  initiatives. The  only clear objectives of this adminis tration seem to be to appease our allies  and avoid political blame.  Now the administration is reduced to  floating  another  French  proposal,  which repeats every error of the past.  It calls on us to place more troops into  indefensible positions. It demands that  we risk American  lives  to prove our  loyalty to a  failed NATO policy. And  once again,  it has no diplomatic or  military end game.  It continues an  aimless and endless commitment.  The President of France says the use  of American helicopters and airmen is  necessary  ""to  place  the Americans  squarely in front of their responsibil ities."" The effect would be to place our  troops squarely in front of bullets as a  symbolic commitment  to  a  strategy  which no one expects to succeed. It is  hard to imagine a policy more destruc tive  to American  interests or more  likely to lead to pointless loss of life.  The central problem here  is pretty  clear.' The ""safe haven"" approach has  not worked. But even more than that,  it could not have worked, even with  less United Nations interference, even  with more military commitment, be cause the safe havens were chosen far a  ",1995

308,House,104,0.453,301,14,Mr. BURR.," Mr. Chairman,  like  the  gentleman from Maryland [Mr. HOYER],  I would like to consolidate FDA, but I  would like to do it in a different way;  through reducing  the number of em ployees  in an agency  that  is a mis guided agency. It has grown well be yond its established limits under  the  Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  It is unconscionable that we would con sider funding $64 million toward a new  building  to  encourage  continued  growth of an agency that brags about  the fact that it is ""getting new regula tions out faster than ever before.""  Under  Commissioner Kessler,  the  FDA has all but abandoned  its core  mission,  the timely approval of drugs  and medical devices. Earlier this year  they admitted to a congressional sub committee  that they are still sitting  on food additive petitions filed as early  as March of 1971,  for .reasons nobody  knows. The law requires that these pe titions must be reviewed in 180 days or  less.  The  FDA  is  requesting  additional  user fees and funding dollars. At  the  same time, their average drug approval  time is an outrageous 14.8 years. Many  medical devices take more than twice  as long to approve in the United States  then in the United Kingdom-hardly a  country known for unsafe product ap provals.  The FDA's funding has increased by  237 percent since 1970. Their employ ment levels have increased by 106 per cent. Meanwhile,  in  the past 5 years  the review of 510(k) device applications  takes 156 percent longer yet the num ber of applications they have received  has only increased by 12 'percent.  So how  is Dr. Kessler spending the  taxpayer's money? He is seizing orange  juice clearly labeled as made from con centrate, just because its brand name  included the word ""fresh."" He has also  sent his inspectors to lead police on a  raid against sellers of vitamins and  health food supplements. He has con ducted a campaign against letting doc tors and researchers know how drugs  might be used for treatments not spe cifically mentioned on the label.  At a time when we are addressing the  need  for  comprehensive  reform  and  overhaul of the FDA, it seems incon sistent and irresponsible to even con sider appropriating  funds  for  a  new  FDA building. This is an agency that  needs to be reigned in-not build up.  Let's wait to see what the new and im proved FDA  looks like after we pass  comprehensive  reform  legislation be fore we spend $64 million on a new FDA  building.  I urge strong support of the Duncan  amendment, Mr. Chairman, don't en courage the FDA to live any larger.  ",1995
309,House,104,0.513,301,14,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr. Chairman, let me  say that on November 8, the American  people  said pretty clearly  that  they  want this new Congress to reduce the  size,  scope,  and cost of Government  here in Washington, DC.  At a  time when we are going to do  that, we have been doing it all year and  we are going to keep doing it, why do  we want  to  invest more money  in  building  facilities  that are,  frankly,  never going to be used?  We are not going  to need some of  these buildings here in town. As we go  through this downsizing over the next  couple of years, we will have ample  room for the FDA, what is left of it, to  be consolidated in some other empty  buildings. We should not be investing  money in buildings we are never going  to use.  ",1995
310,House,104,0.782,301,14,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise to  support  this amendment.  I  think the  FDA is an example of a Government  agency  totally out of control, with  lack of responsiveness to the oversight  functions of Congress. We do not get  appropriate answers. We do not get an swers to the questions we ask when we  inquire of them, and I am part of a fac tion, a group of new freshmen who plan  to see a completely different FDA in  the next 2 or 3 years.  It is ridiculous to spend money on a  building  that we are never going  to  allow the FDA to occupy, and I stand  to oppose this. I think it is important  that we look at what the FDA is going  to look like after this time.  ",1995

313,,104,-0.583,379,14,Mr. WELLSTONE.," Mr.  President,  first of all, before my colleague leaves,  we come here to speak on the floor and  we have other engagements. Let me  just say to him that I think we are to tally in agreement on  the need for a  full discussion and debate. Hopefully, it  will be one that is done with a consid erable amount of substance and grace  and dignity on welfare. I do  think it  would be a mistake to fold this into a  reconciliation  bill  because  I  think  whenever you are considering such a  major departure from public policy and this is amajor departure of public  policy-it is a mistake to fold it into  the reconciliation bill where you really  do not have the opportunity for the debate and discussion.    I  say  to my  friend  from Missouri  that, if he is going to speak in morning  business, I would really pref er to  let  him have the time, so I will just take  2 minutes rather than  taking up  the  rest of the  time for now.  I do  think  there are a couple of things that con cern me about what is called welfare  reform.  First of all, I want to make sure it is  not reformatory as opposed to reform.  It seems to me real welfare reform enables a family-and in the main we are  talking about women and children-to  make  the  transition from welfare  to  workfare. Now, we have been talking  about that for a  long time. Actually,  Franklin  Delano  Roosevelt  talked  about that in 1935 when what we now  know as the AFDC Program was intro duced as a part of the Social Security  Act.  The problem is when we  talk about  moving to workfare as opposed to wel fare, 'it is very difficult  to have any  welfare reform unless, in fact, there is  affordable family child care. I mean, it  is very difficult today for a single par ent. Almost all of these single parents  are women. In some ways I wish more  were men. And I wish there were less  single parents, period, No. 1; and, No.  2-and I think the Chair and I agree on  this-men  took more  responsibility.  But if we are going to say to a single  parent, ""You need to work,"" there are  a couple of critical ingredients to make  sure this is real welfare reform and not  reformatory.  One  is  for  especially  smaller children, that there is afford able child care. That is not done on the  cheap.  I know that in Minnesota, one of the  problems that we have run into-and I  think we are doing a really good job on  welfare reform-is we have long wait ing lists. As a result of that, many of  the mothers that you talk to cannot  make the  transition to work because  they simply cannot afford or find-not  custodial-but  developmental  child  care for their children.  A welfare family is not 1 mother and  10  children. We  are usually  talking  about one mother and two children.  I will be done because I do not want  to take  the time away from my col league from Missouri and we will have  plenty of time for debate on this.  The second point is the one we talk  about all the time, which is we have to  somehow figure out where health care  reform fits  into  this, because all  too  often what happens is a single parent  goes back  to  school,  a mother goes  back to school, a community college,  maybe then finishes up at the Univer sity of Minnesota, then tries to get a  job. The Washington Post had a very,  very good portrait about  this. What  happens is, you are no longer receiving  Medicaid, you are paying child care,  and if you look at the wages that are  out there for jobs, you are behind. So  we have  to make sure  that,  in fact,  families are able to make this transi tion without punishing families. So I  think the heal th care reform piece is  critically important.  Finally, I  think this is a challenge  for all of us. I think it goes well beyond  welfare reform policy. We  really need  to look at the fundamental question of  standard of living in this country and  the squeeze on  the vast middle class  and what has been going on for the last  15 years, plus-I am not pointing the  finger  in any party direction-and  I  think the overwhelming challenge is to  have an economy that produces good  jobs that people can count on. I think  that has to be part of welfare reform as  well, so a mother has a job that pays a  wage, has benefits on which she can  support her children. I  think we need  to look at these much more carefully.  I could say more. I will not. My col league is anxious to speak. I yield the  floor.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  SANTORUM).

314,,104,0.536,379,14,Mr. ASHCROFT.," Mr. President, it is  true  that there  is a broad consensus  that people understand what we have  attempted to do with our welfare sys tem has been a failure. If you want to  see what  our  current Washington based, one-size-fits-all welfare program  has done,  to see how the perverse in centives of  the welfare  system have  failed, I guess you could go just a cou ple blocks from here. There you can see  a generation raised by welfare and fed  through  food  stamps,  but  literally  starved of nurture and hope. You will  meet young teens in their third preg nancy. You will meet children who not  only do not have a father, but they do  not know any other child with a father.  These are tragedies of the current sys tem, and these are the realities against  which reform must properly be judged.  There has been a great deal of report ing recently on divisions in our discus sion on welfare. I would like to make  something as clear as I possibly can.  While it may have taken us some time  to reconcile our differences in terms of  the strategy  that we have, we have  never forgotten the horror of our cur rent system, we have never disagreed  on our  fundamental  values,  and we  have never wavered from our central  commitment, and  that is  to end  the  system of welfare we have now,  to  strengthen States and communities, to  restore hope and opportunity  to  the  millions of Americans for whom such  words now are tragically words with ou t definition or words without mean ing.  I might add that it is important for  us to understand that as well meaning  as we might be in Washington in seek ing to find a single solution to all of  the problems that relate to the needs  of people that would move them from  dependence  to  independence, it would  be inappropriate for us to try and find  a solution because there are lots of so lutions that are going to be necessary,  and no one garment will fit all children  and no one vehicle will carry all loads  and no  single  system  imposed  from  Washington on this great Nation will  be productive  in moving people from  the web of dependency  to  the oppor tunity of independence.

I want to show you  the cuts that the Republicans are im plementing, and this chart shows  the  beginning of that effort.  We might call it a Sav-0-Meter. The  legislative branch we have cut by $150  million; foreign aid by $1.5 billion; the  energy and water budget by $1.6 billion;  the Interior budget by $1.6 billion.  We  are  just starting. We  are only  partway  through  the  appropriations  process, and we have already cut $5 bil lion out of the Federal budget com pared to last year. We expect to go up  to about $21 billion.  What does this mean to Mr. and Mrs.  Taxpayer of America? Roughly at this  point about $50 per family in cuts al ready. We  expect  to get up  in  the  neighborhood of $210 to $250 in cuts for  the average American  family. Those  are real cuts. Those are cuts the people  will notice. They are not the imaginary  cuts the other side talks about.

320,House,104,0.19,496,14,Mr. MARTINI.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to express my concern over the  Supreme Court's  recent  decision  in  Hubbard versus United States. In that  decision  the high court overturned a  Federal statute that has been used to  prosecute Members  of Congress  and  others who  intentionally and know ingly release false or deceptive inf or mation  to Congress. The current law  no longer is applicable to such situa tions.  As  a  former Federal prosecutor,  I  know that section 1001 of 18 U.S. Code  is a critical provision of  law, which  protects the Federal Government from  potential waste, fraud, and abuse.  That's why  in response  to  the Su preme Court's decision,  I have intro duced the Government Accountability  Act (H.R. 1678) which will extend the  false  statement statute  to all  three  branches of the Federal Government.  If Congress fails to act, unscrupulous  public officials, contractors, and private citizens will be able to engage in  acts of fraud and misconduct against  the Federal Government without fear  of punishment.  Mr. Speaker, we are here to serve the  American people not ourselves.  In closing, I urge my colleagues  to  cosponsor H.R. 1678 which brings ac countability back to the Federal Gov ernment.

321,House,104,-0.506,496,14,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Speak er, I have a modern day Robin Hood  story to tell. Except this one, unlike  the original story, does not have a  noble ending. You see, the Robin Hood  of Capitol Hill has it backward: He is  stealing from the poor to give to the  rich.  Of course, Republicans do not want  to admit this. But how else can we de scribe the Republican plan to cut Medi care  to pay  for  tax breaks  for  the  wealthy?  Consider this: The median income of  senior citizens in 1993 was about $15,000  for males and $8,500 for females. About  3.8 million seniors lived below the pov erty level in that year.  It is this group of citizen&-27 million  of them-that will have about $1,060  per year  in Medicare benefits  taken  from each of them in order to give 1.1  million of America's richest people a  $20,000 tax break.  Now if the Republicans want to have  a substantive debate about how to im prove Medicare and rein in its costs to  ensure  future  solvency,  then  let us  have  that talk. But the Republicans'  current effort is not about that. It is  about finding ways to pay for tax cuts  for the wealthy under the guise of sav ing Medicare.  Mr. Speaker, Republicans are not so  stealthy that their Robin Hood-in-re verse crusade will go unnoticed by sen iors.

322,House,104,-0.233,509,14,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise here to support  the Bereuter proposal. I  think it is a  sound, constructive proposal. I want to  commend  the  gentleman  from Ne braska [Mr. BEREUTER] and every Mem ber, Democrat and Republican, who co operated in putting together this sound  piece of public policy.  I love the stem winding, desk thump ing  speeches  that some of our col leagues give, but when you ask your self what is the solution, the solution  really  is  the Bereuter proposal. We  have a terrible condition in China, but  let me let you in on a secret. It has  been that way for 6,000 years.  When I  first went to China shortly  before we began any kind of relation ship with them at all over a 40-year pe riod, they were just finishing the cul tural revolution, in which millions of  Chinese had been displaced and rooted  out of their families and their homes  and  transported around  the country  and hundreds of thousands of Chinese  had been slaughtered. Fortunately, no  Americans lost their lives in there be cause we did not have an American na tional in the whole country of China at  that time.  China  has  never  experienced  the  types of freedoms that yve in the West ern world have developed  so  tortur ously over so many thousands of years.  They have never had religious freedom  or freedom of speech. They have never  had the freedom of assembly or any of  the  freedoms we cherish. They need  them,  they want them, and they will  eventually get them, but we have  to  lead the way, and we should never go  to the same disastrous type of program  that we carried out for about 40 years  in which we  threw ourselves out of  China  and  isolated  ourselves  from  China.  Our trade situation with China is not  good, but it is better than the terrible  situation that we had in the past. It is  going to improve. I love all this discus sion about slave labor, and I hope some  of the people are listening to this. I do  not know of any State in the United  States that does not have slave labor.  All of us in our States produce goods  that are  sold  in commerce  that we  Americans consume that were made by  slave labor in our own prisons. It has  been against the law so long as I can  remember to import any of those kinds  of goods in the United States.  So we have tried to keep them out. I  am sorry some of 'them slip in, but it is  against  the  law and anybody that is  convicted of importing those kinds of  goods is going to be penalized. We are  doing our best to penalize Americans  for knowingly doing that kind of thing.  But I doubt that there is a Member of  Congress here that has not slept on a  bed or sat at a desk or used a  filing  cabinet that was not made by prison  labor in the United States.  Mr. Speaker,  I am sorry  that my  time is up, but support the Bereuter  amendment. It is a good, constructive  proposal.  ",1995
323,House,104,0.673,509,14,Mr. SALMON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 2058. I  believe it is a big bold step in the right  direction. I am really pleased that the  gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. BEREU TER] has taken this initiative.  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to talk  a  little bit about my  experience.  I  served a mission for my church in Tai wan from 1977 to 1979. Most of the peo ple  that I became  friends with over  there were people that lived in main land China and escaped the oppression  of China under Mao Tse-tung. At that  time  they watched  their  families,  many of them being killed, murdered  before their very eyes. Many of them  watched their parents be severely pun ished,  sometimes beaten,  sometimes  even killed, for praying in public.  As China engaged the Western world,  I was heartened, I was encouraged, by  her ~esire to become more open politi cally, economically, and socially. But  as with many Americans, much of that  optimism  was  extinguished  by  Tiananmen Square, and part of me died  that day. Since  that day China has  steadily marched  backward,  stifling  freedom,  flouting human  rights,  and  demonstrating disregard.  I  do  support  doing  business with  China. I think it is a step in the right  direction, but we need to make sure  they understand we will be watching  and  the people that do business over  there need to not be accepting, but step  forward and do the right thing.  .

324,House,104,-0.404,509,14,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like  to congratulate both  the gentleman  from Nebraska [Mr. BEREUTER] and the  gentleman from  Indiana  [Mr. HAMIL TON], the two cosponsors of this legisla tion, and certainly to  the gentleman  from Virginia [Mr. WOLF], and the gen tlewoman from California [Ms. PELOSI],  who actually worked very closely with  both cosponsors  to put together this  legislation in a way I believe that all of  us will be able to support; second, what  I believe is important, to send a signal  to  the Chinese  that  is unified  that  truly  represents  the  true  feelings of  this Nation. So I would like to thank  them for making this debate very com fortable for all of us in this House of  435 Members.  I would have to say, and I believe I  will just reiterate what the gentleman  from Nebraska  [Mr. BEREUTER]  has  said, that the United States-China re lationship will probably be  the most  important relationship that the United  States will have for the next 20 years.  That is whether China is viewed by this  country as our enemy, or whether this  country views China as an ally, or per haps something in between.  China has 22 percent of  the world  population,  1.2  billion people. Their  economic growth rate is over 10 per cent per year, and probably will grow  much greater than that. Lloyd Bent sen, before he left as Secretary of the  Treasury,  said  that  for  the next 15  years China will be building an equiva lent to 18 Santa Monica freeways per  day, and that means the Japanese, the  Europeans, and all other countries are  moving into China now, trying to influ ence China's behavior.  I have to say one of the experts that  spoke on the rule perhaps has a little  amnesia. President Clinton is basically  fallowing  the policies  of  the Ford,  Reagan, Bush, Carter, Nixon years in  terms of our relations with  the Chi nese. That is because they all under stood the permanence and importance  of our relations with that country.  Now, there is no question that what  the Chinese have been doing over the  past decade, now coming to light,  is  something that we all in this country  abhor,  and  certainly we  understand  that there were certain universal prin ciples  that all major great nations  must comply with. But the way to real ly do it is not to isolate the Chinese,  but to engage the Chinese.  That is what basically the Bereuter  resolution does.  It  tells  the Chinese  that there are certain behaviors that  we do not accept, but at the same time  it attempts to normalize our relations  with the Chinese. That is why this res olution, this bill,  is so important for  us, because ultimately it is the heirs of  all of us in this room, the heirs of all  of us in this country, that will benefit  in  terms of peace and understanding  among nations and people of these na tions, if in fact we can find some way  with  the United States, China,  and  other countries,  to begin the normal ization process with this Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this  bill.  ",1995
325,House,104,0.374,522,14,Mr. WHITE.,"  I  thank the gentleman  for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, my district overlooks  both  sides of  the  shipping  lanes of  Puget Sound. It is one of the biggest  trading districts in the United States.  China is our biggest  trading partner.  Every year there are billions of dollars  coming  into my district because of  trade with China.  But, Mr. Speaker, that is not a good  enough reason for me to vote for most fa vored-nation  status  for China. We  should not sell the Chinese people into  slavery  just  to bring  trading profits  into our district.  Mr. Speaker, the reason to vote for  this bill is because it is the only way to  bring the Chinese people out of slavery.  We have seen plenty of examples of  that in recent history. In Eastern Eu rope, in Tiananmen Square, it is only  after expanded contacts with the West  that we see the people themselves ris ing up and demanding human rights  from their own governments.  Mr. Speaker, it is the fax machine,  not the trade sanction, that freed East ern Europe, and it is the fax machine,  not the trade sanction, that will free  China.  I ask my colleagues, do not vote for  this bill because it is going to bring  trading profits  to  the United States.  Vote for this bill because it is the best  way, really the only way, to bring free dom, human rights, and prosperity to  the Chinese people.  HASTINGS  of  Florida.

Also, I want to complement my  colleague on the Committee on Appro priations,  the  gentleman  from New  York  [Mr. WALSH]. Coming from  the  State of Washington, I see some of my  colleagues from Washington State on  the floor. We had a very serious E. coli  breakout  in our State 3 years ago.  Three young children died, hundreds  were sick, and so I was definitely very  concerned in the appropriations com mittee when  there was an effort  to  delay the implementation of the new  regulations, which our ranking mem ber,  the gentleman from Illinois [Mr.  DURBIN], so carefully described, some one who has had great experience  in  this area.  But I think this is a model of how we  should work these problems out, and I  commend  the  gentleman  from New  York for engaging Secretary Glickman  and  the chairman of the authorizing  committee and the Democratic Mem bers, and they were able to work out a  reasonable compromise on  this  issue.  We will not delay the new regulations  from going into place.  What the gentleman from New York  wanted, properly, and I wanted to com mend the chairman, too, the gentleman  from New Mexico [Mr. SKEEN], for fa cilitating this, was that all the parties  should be heard. He talked about a ne gotiated rulemaking, which I happen to  believe  this was  too complicated an  issue  for  that, but we got  the same  achievement by giving all the parties  the ability to participate.  D 1500  The most important thing is we are  protecting  the American  consumers.  Seven thousand people a year die from  salmonella or E.  coli and hundreds  more, hundreds of thousands more are  sick  and  ill.  So  this  is  a  serious  consumer issue, and some of us on the  Committee  on Appropriations  have  been very concerned  that  there has  been a pattern of,  in essence, gutting  health, safety and environmental legis lation in the name of helping the pri vate  sector. That  is not  right. The  American people do not want unsafe  meat. They do not want unsafe drink ing water.  So I commend the gentleman from  New York for working this problem out  and getting a satisfactory result that  is in the interest of the country and in  the interest of consumers and certainly  in the interest of the people of Wash ington State, because we went through  a terrible crisis just a year or so ago.  So I commend the gentleman and I  support his motion to strike.  ",1995
327,House,104,0.505,561,14,Mr. SMITH of Michigan.," Mr. Chair man, as one of the few dairy farmers  that still is milking cows on my farm,  I would like to put out a statement in  the  RECORD  in  opposition  to  this  amendment.  The hormone bST occurs naturally  in  all  milk. The FDA determined that bST will nei ther adversely affect the health of cows, nor  the  individuals who consume  the milk pro duced from  the these cows. This determina tion was based on over 2,000 studies. Exten sive testing has been going on for the past 1 O  . years. Supplemental hormones,  for example,  estrogens treating women during menopause,  have been used  in humans for  the past 20  years.  The issue now  is whether the Government  discourage biotechnologies which have been  proven safe. I believe that producers, not Gov ernment bureaucracies, ought to make deci sions involving the economics of their respec tive operations.  ",1995
328,House,104,0.208,561,14,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the amendment.  mstory is a marvelous teacher. This  argument that the future, the future of  the family farm will be affected by this  vote, I  think,  is somewhat in doubt.  Several hundred years ago, there was a  group of individuals in England, I be lieve, referred to as the Luddites who  opposed the imposition, ""imposition,""  of mechanization tractors on farmers.  They went around hitting the tractors  with hammers.  In the early 1970's, I, as a Peace Corps  volunteer, went to Asia to work as an  agriculture extension agent. India was  a net importer of grains and there was  a marvelous American scientist named  Norman Borlaug who developed.the tri ple gene variety of wheat,  it was a  dwarf  variety  of  wheat  that  outproduced  the  domestic  varieties,  the native varieties by twofold without  the  [Mr.  fertilizer, merely by just changing the  seed. By adding fertilizer, you could in crease yields by fourfold. The net re sult is India now exports wheat and  rice.  Yes, we are losing family farms. New  York in the 1980's lost 10 percent of its  farms per year. That was 10 years be fore bST was licensed to be used in the  United States.  It is more of a function of high prop erty taxes that is driving small family  farms out of business. Too much Gov ernment is the answer there.  Mr. Chairman, we all have concerns  about bST. The gentleman from Wis consin  GUNDERSON]  explained  quite  clearly,  as did  the gentleman  from Wisconsin [Mr. ROTH]. We had 10  years of testing in the laboratory be fore it was even brought to the farm  for field tests.  And once it was brought to the farm  for field  tests,  the results were posi tive. There was some increase in masti tis because  the animals were milked  more.  ",1995

331,House,104,-0.204,587,14,Mr. GORDON.," Mr. Chairman, let me  first recognize the sincerity of the pro ponents of this amendment, but let me  also say very clearly I rise in opposi tion to this amendment, and I want to  clarify what  this amendment  is not  about.  This amendment is not about smok ing, whether juvenile or adult smoking.  It has nothing  to do with smoking.  This amendment  is not about deficit  reduction. It has nothing to do with  deficit reduction.  Every small family farmer pays an  assessment on every pound of tobacco  that they grow. This amounts to over  $30 million a year  that goes  to  the  Treasury, so it has nothing 'to do  in  any way with deficit reduction.  What it does have something to do  with  is whether or not small,  rural  counties and communities in the South  can exist. Tobacco  is  the only crop  they can grow in these communities,  unlike  in Illinois and other commu nities where they have farms with hun dreds of acres, long rows where you get  on that tractor, and you drive a half  mile and your  turn around and you  drive back.  You cannot do  that  in  these  little  communities. These are hilly country,  rocky country. About  the only  thing  they can grow is tobacco, and that is  why the average tobacco patch is only  3.3 acres. It takes a family. It is squat  labor. It is the whole family that gets  out and works together to get this crop  in and then get it in the barn.  Without the tobacco, it means that  there are no grocery stores, because  there is no one to buy groceries. There  is no filling stations, because there is  nobody to buy gas. There is no phar macies, because there is no one to go to  the drugstore.  So make no mistake about it. This  amendment is not about deficit reduc tion. This amendment  is not about  smoking.  It is about allowing small  communities in the South to continue  to be able to exist and allowing farmers  to raise their family and see that they  are able to improve their life, just like  everyone here wants to see their fami ly's life improved.  ",1995
332,House,104,0.361,587,14,Mr. EWING.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank  the  gentleman  for  allowing me  to  speak out on this.  I wish that my colleague from Illi nois would have introduced a bill, if he  really wanted to get smoking, to make  it illegal. I am a reformed smoker, and  I understand that. I do not encourage  it.  But what you are doing here, you are  not affecting the program at all. You  are just twiddling with it around the  edge. You are doing things to a pro gram  that  provides  income  to  the  American Treasury, that provides ex port and helps us with our balance of  trade.  My colleagues, go to Kentucky, go to  Georgia, go to North Carolina and see  how  these people  live and see  if the  Durbin amendment is not affecting the  lives of small people. It is.  If you want to make tobacco illegal,  do it. Try and do it up front. But do not  twick around the edge. That is not fair  to  the people you are messing with,  and it certainly is not fair to this Con gress.  ",1995
333,House,104,-0.155,587,14,Mr. BAESLER.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  think we have had a lot of discussion  about what this amendment is not.  Being a  tobacco farmer, this year in  June we are all in Kentucky putting  out tobacco and working with it. What  this amendment tells me as a tobacco  farmer and all of the other farmers in  Kentucky and North Carolina, if I have  a disease in my crop this. summer, if I  have  something going wrong  in my  field, I cannot go ask the county exten sion agent what the problem is.  It also tells me later on when that  disease, blue mole or black shag, takes  all of my crop, that I am not entitled  to Federal crop insurance to help pay  for  that disaster.  If  the Ohio River  floods, on one side we might be in Illi nois, those farmers can acquire Federal  crop insurance to take care of them. A  tobacco farmer from Kentucky cannot.  This  is not about health. This  is  about fairness. We are going to tell one  group of farmers in the United States  who pay their taxes, tobacco generates  $12 billion a year to the United States,  State and local governments. We are  going to tell one group of farmers, you  are not deserving to go  to the exten sion service  to get help. Every other  farmer in the United States is, but you  cannot.  We are going to tell that same group  of farmers,  if the Durbin amendment  passes, you cannot have Federal crop  insurance to protect your investment.  ",1995

We know we are falling be hind  in readiness. The military con struction projects that will be canceled  by the proposed amendments will help  address these quality-of-life and readi ness problems.  We have just gone through three dif ficult rounds of the base closure proc ess. The bases and the facilities that  have survived are the keepers. We need  to make investments to maintain the  infrastructure that literally serves as  the foundation of our armed services.  Therefore, Mr. President,  I urge my  colleagues to vote to table the Binga man amendment.  ",1995
336,Senate,104,0.1,678,14,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I reintroduce  legislation  to help  the Department of Housing and Urban Develop ment deal with the fraudlllent practice  of equity skimming.  As  the  chairman  of  the Govern mental Affairs Subcommittee on Over sight, I have investigated a disturbing  number of instances of fraud.  Over  the past 2 years,  I have been  looking at the Department of Housing  and Urban Development's [HUD] sub sidy and mortgage insurance programs.  This investigation has focused on an  outrageous practice know  as equity  skimming.  Equity skimming is the term used to  describe a particular type of housing  fraud. It occurs when an owner of a  HUD-insured project takes money in tended to be used to pay the mortgage  and provide maintenance and upkeep of  the project and diverts it for his or her  own use. This diversion of funds often  causes  the owner  to default on their  mortgage, forcing HUD-which guaran teed the loans-to pay the private lend er the balance of the mortgage. At this  point, HUD assumes the mortgage and  the owner is required to make mort gage payments  to HUD. Regrettably,  however, the owner often continues to  divert  funds  for personal use  rather  than meet mortgage  and other  ex penses. As a result, these projects often  fall into disrepair, forcing the tenants  to endure intolerable living conditions.  The  term  ""equity  skimming""  is  somewhat of a misnomer in that the  actual equity that the owner invests in  the project  is  relatively small com pared to the amount skimmed by the  owner.  The HUD IG estimates that equity  skimming has cost taxpayers approxi mately $6 billion to date. HUD has ap proximately 20,000 total projects in its  insured mortgage  portfolio,  totaling  over $40 billion. HUD holds another $10  billion in mortgages already in default.  An additional $10 billion worth of HUD insured mortgages are estimated to be  at risk of default and in fiscal year 1993  alone HUD paid $965 million in multi family  housing mortgage  insurance  claims to private lenders. HUD's IG be lieves that a significant amount of the  defaults are a  result of equity skim ming.  The tragedy of this fraud goes beyond  the waste of taxpayer dollars. As a re sult of equity skimming,, tenants have  been forced  to live in horrible condi tions because needed repairs go unat tended to. At the same time, the own ers of these projects live the high life  while HUD is stuck with the cost of in suring the mortgage and rehabilitating  the deteriorated project.  Let me give a couple of examples of  how this shoddy practice has worked.  In upstate New York, partners in a  nursing home claimed to be broke and  failed to make payments on a $5.1 mil lion HUD-insured mortgage. While they  were defaulting on the mortgage and  sticking  the  taxpayers with  the bill,  ",1995

339,,104,0.739,782,14,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, over the last sev eral years, we in the House have devoted a  great deal of attention to the issue of crime in  the United States, and have passed several  anticrime bills. While we  have not always  agreed on the proper methods to reduce crime  in America, Members of this body have unani mously condemned acts of violence.  To me, therefore, it is inconceivable that this  Congress has not moved  to outlaw certain  acts of violence that have been protected by  the Supreme Court since 1973. That year, the  Court ruled  in  its Enmons decision that union  officials were exempt from prosecution for acts  of violence,  if they were used  to gain  legiti mate union objectives. The Enmons decision  severely  restricted  the  scope of  the  1946  Hobbs Anti-Extortion Act. The Hobbs Act was  enacted primarily to quell violence and extor tion by union members and officials as  they  enforced compulsory union membership. By  exempting union officials from the Hobbs Act,  the High Court effectively sanctioned  these  acts of violence.  The results of this decision have been dev astating. Since 1973, union violence resulted  in 181 murders, 440 assaults, and more than  6,000 acts of vandalism. In fact, from 1975 to  1993, there were more than 7,800 acts of doc umented union violence. I believe that this vio lence must stop.  On June 8, 1995,  I introduced H.R. 1796,  the Freedom From Union Violence Act. H.R.  1796 would  restore  the original  intent of the  Hobbs Act to allow Federal 'authorities to pros ecute union officials accused of violence or  extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act. The au thor of the Hobbs Act, Representative Samuel  Hobbs,  stated,  ""that crime  is  crime  whether or not  the perpetrator has a union  card.""  I agree with Mr. Hobbs, and  I believe  that,  regardless of one's views on  labor  is sues,  the House can agree  that violence  is  wrong and ought to be condemned. Lady Jus tice, after all,  is blindfolded-she should not  be peeking to ask for union credentials.  I urge my colleagues to support this impor tant legislation.  * * *,  ",1995

342,House,104,-0.552,886,14,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the gentleman  for  yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  rule. I am pleased to see that the com mittee has granted Chairman YOUNG's  request for an open rule which protects  the  rights  of all Members  to  offer  amendments.  I  applaud  Chairman  YOUNG for continuing the tradition of  our committee by seeking open rules.  We do not agree, however, on  the  merits of this legislation. During the  consideration of H.R. 70, I will be offer ing an amendment to restrict exports  of Alaska oil to the amounts which are  in excess of current consumption on  the west coast. The bill as reported by  the resources committee restricts the  President's authority  to protect U.S.  interests by forcing him to choose be tween  exporting  100  percent  of  the  Alaska oil or no oil at all. The bill spe cifically precludes the President from  finding that it is in the national inter est  to establish any volume  limita tions.  Additionally, Mr. Speaker,  I would  note that, upon passage of H.R. 70, the  rule provides for a motion to bring up  the Senate-passed bill, strike the text  and insert the House language. While I  have no objection to this procedure, I  would caution my colleagues that they  are buying into much more than they  expect in this legislation at a substan tial cost to the taxpayers.  The other body has included several  matters which will come up  in con ference which would not be germane  under House rules to the subject Alas ka oil exports. I am particularly con cerned about title 3 of the Senate bill  which requires the Secretary of the In terior to grant a holiday on collecting  royal ties from oil companies which op erate in the Gulf of Mexico. This relief  is granted whether or not it is needed.  For drilling in waters deeper than 800  meters, for example, title 3 would re quire no less than 82.5 million barrels  of royalty-free oil for each lease.  The stated purpose of title 3 is to en courage oil development in deep waters  of the gulf. Yet the oil companies are  already encouraged without any help  from  the Government. The  last  two  gulf lease sales have brought in record  bonus bids. The gulf is now one of the  hottest areas in the world for new ex ploration.  In my view, mandatory royalty relief  would be nothing other  than a  tax payer-subsidized holiday windfall  for  the oil operators in the gulf. This is  new corporate welfare at its worst. If  title 3 had been in effect just 3 months  ago,  the royalty holiday would have  cost the Treasury at least $2.3 billion  from the last lease sale alone.  So, Mr. Speaker, there is much more  to H.R. 70  that will be considered in  conference  than  just Alaska oil  ex ports-and there are good reasons that  House Members are unaware of  the  deep water royalty relief issue because:  ",1995

347,Senate,104,0.262,990,14,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President,  I am  happy at long last to join my distin guished colleague from Connecticut on  this issue. For roughly 21/z years I have  been in strong opposition to the efforts  by  the distinguished majority  leader,  Senator DOLE, and his coauthor of this  measure,  the  distinguished  Senator  from Connecticut, recalling that dur ing the gulf war operation when I was  the principal sponsor of the resolution  adopted  by  the Senate, my  distin guished  colleague  from Connecticut  was my principal cosponsor on that. So  once again we have joined.  I wish to make very clear, Mr. Presi dent, I  join for the very clear reason  that the majority leader and the Sen ator  from Connecticut changed  in a  very material way  the approach they  had initiated some 21/z years ago.  I  think it is well worth the time of  the Senate  to  focus on exactly what  those changes were that led this Sen ator-and I now believe a majority of  the Senate-to join in this. As a matter  of fact, I am hopeful that close  to 70  Senators will eventually join on this. I  know my colleague from Connecticut  and  I and many others have  talked  among ourselves. These are the condi tions  that have materially  changed  this approach, in such a manner that it  now gains the support of the majority  of the Senate and indeed many of us.  These are the conditions under which  the United States will  terminate the  embargo.  I  read  from  the measure  which is at the desk:  4.  Termination.  Section  The  President  shall  terminate the United States embargo  of  the  Government  of  :Cosnia  and  Herzegovina as provided in subsection (b) fol lowing:  1. Receipt by the U.S. Government of a re quest from  the Government of Bosnia and  Herzegovina for  termination of the United  States arms embargo and submission by the  Government of Bosnia and Herzegovin~. in  exercise of its sovereign rights as a nation,  of a request to the United Nations Security  Council  for  the departure of UNPROFOR  from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is a very dramatic change. The  initiative  is on  the Government,  the  recognized Government of Bosnia and  Herzegovina,  to  first  petition  the  United States and/or  to petition  the  United Nations  for  the departure of  UNPROFOR.  The  second condition under which  our President is authorized to act:  A decision by the United Nations Security  Council or decisions by countries contribut ing  forces  to  UNPROFOR  to withdraw  UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is very clear. It is an exercise of  sovereign rights.  Now, the Senate received today a let ter from  the President of the United  States addressed  to  the  leadership.  I  have now had an opportunity to review  that letter, and I regret to say that it  is written as though the author had not  read what is before the Senate today.  This letter now appears in the RECORD  in its entirety, and I say to those who  wish to take the time to examine it- and I hope all Senators will-it is a  communication from  the President of  the United States to the leadership of  the Senate in which he acknowledged  that there are no simple or risk-free  answers in Bosnia. But he goes on to  recite a procedure that has been aban doned by the proponents of this meas ure before the Senate and, it seems to  me, does not  recognize  in  sufficient  clarity exactly what has been put forth  to the Senate.  So I will address that in greater de tail later, but I should now like to pose  a question or so  to my distinguished  colleague.  The criticism leveled at the  initia tive proposed by  the majority  leader  and the Senator from Connecticut cen ters  around  the  term  ""Americani zation"" and that if the Senate were to  adopt this it would constitute an invi tation, an  invitation  to  the Govern ment of Bosnia to take the initiative.  My recollection is, having met with a  series of Government officials, includ ing the Prime Minister of Bosnia, they  have  come  and  specifically  asked,  asked of  individual Members of  the  Senate that this be done in the exact  fashion as is laid out in the measure  before the Senate today. Am I not cor rect in this?  ",1995
348,Senate,104,-0.205,990,14,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, the  Senator  from Virginia  is  absolutely  correct, in many ways. First, that the  Bosnians have consistently asked that  the arms embargo be  lifted. Second,  they have been confronted with  this  question:  If you have  to  choose be tween lifting the embargo and the U .N.  forces remaining in Bosnia, which will  you choose? And they have said clearly  lifting the embargo.  The language of this proposal before  the Senate  today  is in tended to give  some ear finally  to  the victims and  give them the opportunity to request,  and in that sense to formally require  that they request, the United Nations  leave if that is their judgment as a pre condition for the lifting of the embar go. And there are those who have said,  well, they want the United Nations to  leave, but they really do not.  This  says  that  the  condition  on  which the embargo will be lifted is if  the Government of Bosnia says offi cially, formally that they request the  United Nations to leave. Then the em bargo will be lifted.  ",1995
349,House,104,-0.324,1055,14,Mr. DEUTSCH.," Mr. Speaker, as you  have heard, today is the 30th anniver sary of the Medicare Program. I think  this is a day to focus on what the Re publicans in this Congress are propos ing to do to that program.  The Republican budget-passed plan  has $270 billion in cuts. They have said,  and  they have said recently on  this  floor, and  they continue  to say  that  those are necessary to save the plan, to  save the plan from itself. Well, the re ality is in the last 30 years of the Medi care Program it has never had more  than a 10-year actuarial  life. In fact,  there have been times over the last 30year period where it has only had a 2year actuarial life.  The $270 billion number has nothing  to do with 10-year actuarial life. It has  to do with the budget that they have  proposed and some of the outrageous  corporate welfare  systems  that still  exist.  Now, what can be done? What is that  $270 billion to lead to? The $270 billion  will lead to a  fundamental change in  the Medicare system for beneficiaries.  When you go through the numbers, the  inevitable result of $270 billion in cuts  is that you will have a Medicare sys tem not very similar  to  the system  that exists  today. We would have a  Medicare system  that would  force  a  large percentage. of the 37 million peo ple  in  this country on Medicare  into  substandard HMOs.  Right  now,  Medicare  reimburses  HMOs at about 95 percent of the pre vailing fee-for-service in an area. Only  about  10  percent of Medicare  bene ficiaries choose  to  join  those HMOs.  The Republican  proposal will  drive  down that reimbursement cost in the  neighborhood of 70 percent.  I do not  doubt there are private for-profit HMOs  that will be able to provide service at  that cost, but at what quality? That is  the question.  MEDICARE-MEDICAID  ",1995
350,House,104,-0.499,1055,14,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, I want to be fair to the Re publicans. We  should not  just  talk  about the pain they are going to be in flicting by making all the people pay  more for Medicare because that is only  one part of it. They also plan in their  budget  to  reduce  the cost of  living  every elderly person gets, no matter  how low on the income scale.  Their budget balances  in  the year  2002, only because in part they cut the  cost-of-living increase for Social Secu rity. They think older people have been  overcompensated for inflation.  But  finally,  for  those older people  who live in assisted housing and public  housing who have Section 8  certifi cates, they have a third gift. They are  going to raise their rent. So older peo ple are going to find  that, if the bill  passes that is pending before us,  that  instead of 30 percent, they will pay 32  percent of their income. Their income  will not go up as fast. Maybe that is  the consolation when the Republicans  cut the cost of living, but they will pay  more for Medicare. They will get less  ",1995
351,House,104,-0.429,1094,14,Ms. BROWN of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, here  we  go  again,  another Republican  attack  against the working people. That's why  I rise  in  support of  the Coleman amendment  to  maintain workers' bargaining rights under sec tion 13(c). Current language in the bill threat ens  the collective bargaining  rights of more  than 200,000 transit workers across the coun try.  Many Members on both sides of the aisle  support sensible reforms of this program, but  do not support repeal. They recognize that ef forts to address the legitimate concerns by in dustry and by Members are ongoing.  The Transportation and  Infrastructure Com mittee, of which I am a member, has jurisdic tion over section 13(c). Our committee  is re viewing the 13(c) program as well as the De partment of Labor's recently  released  reform  proposals.  DOL's proposed  regulations would signifi cantly reform the mechanism used for the ad ministration of 13(c), thereby directly address ing  the principal concern of the  industry:  the  timely  release of Federal  transit grants.  In  short,  the DOL regulations would ensure the  certification of all  transit grants in 60 days or  less while  preserving  collective  bargaining  rights and  longstanding protective provisions  agreed upon by labor and management.  .  Efforts by the authorizing committee as well  as  the Labor Department  to  reform section  13(c) are far more sensible than using an ap propriations bill  to gut major labor legislation  that for much of its history has enjoyed biparti san support. This bipartisan support is best il lustrated by a recent letter sent to the Speaker  by 25 of our Republican colleagues opposing  repeal of section 13(c).  I urge my colleagues to support the Cole man  amendment and  give  the  authorizing  committee an opportunity to reform  the 13(c)  program.

355,House,104,-0.35,1302,14,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, this week  America celebrates  the 30th anniver sary of Medicare. Thirty years ago,  Medicare brought to our senior popu lation, for the first time, health secu rity they never enjoyed before. They  knew  that  whatever  their  cir cumstances, medical  care would  be  available if they suffered from sickness  or accident.  All that is threatened now. The ma jority party's budget does wage war on  Medicare.  It cuts  $270  billion  from  Medicare to finance tax breaks for the  privileged few. Seniors will lose their  choice of physician unless they can af ford  to pay more. Everybody  in  this  place can, because they earn $130,000 a  year. Their budget will provide seniors  cut-rate, substandard medical care un less they can afford to pay more. Their  proposed cuts will deprive seniors of  the  security Medicare now provides,  unless they can afford to pay more.  To curb costs, why not rein in rising  insurance  company  premiums  costs,  along with hospital costs and prescrip tion  drug  costs? Why  pick  on  our  grandparents  first? Let  us  not  let  America backpedal into the 21st cen tury.

356,House,104,-0.378,1302,14,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker,  I believe  . that this is the first time I have spoken  on the floor  this year about a state ment of the Speaker, but I feel com pelled to do so today.  His comment yesterday  that he  is  not  convinced  that Vincent Foster  committed suicide was highly irrespon sible.  There is no evidence to support the  notion that the death of Vincent Fos ter was not a suicide. It is not a subject  to  inquiry  in the hearing now under  way in this Congress.  The Speaker has shot from  the hip  before, but when it comes to matters of  life and death, there is no good excuse.  No one, especially a Government offi cial and surely the Speaker, can be too  busy to think about the ramifications  of what he says before he talks.  I urge the Speaker to reflect further  and withdraw his comment. We need to  appeal  to  the better instincts of our  citizenry and not  to reinforce or en courage,  inadvertently or not,  those  who  try  to  spread paranoia or un founded conspiracy theories for what ever purpose, political or otherwise.

358,House,104,-0.018,1315,14,Mrs. MORELLA.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the gentlewoman  for yielding  time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  Norton amendment which would  re move  the ban on access  to abortion  services  for  incarcerated women, ex cept  in  cases  of  rape  or  life  endangerment.  There are currently 5,984 women in carcerated in Federal Bureau of Pris ons  facilities,  the majority-68 per cent-of whom are serving sentences  for drug offenses. Most of the women  are  young, were  frequently  unem ployed, and many were victims of phys ical or sexual abuse. According  to a  1987 survey, 6 percent of women in pris ons and 4 percent of those in jail were  pregnant when admitted. Limited pre natal care,  isolation from family and  friends, and the certain loss of custody  of the  infant upon birth present un usual  circumstances  that exacerbate  an already difficult  situation  if  the  pregnancy is unintended.  Because Federal prisoners are totally  dependent on health care services pro vided by  the Bureau of Prisons,  this  ban,  in effect, prevents  these women  from  exercising  their  constitutional  right  to abortion. Most women pris oners were poor when  they entered  prison, and they do not earn any mean ingful compensation from prison jobs.  This ban then closes off their only op portunity to receive such services, and  thereby denies them their rights under  the Constitution.  I urge my colleagues to support the  Norton amendment.

359,House,104,-0.413,1328,14,Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Chairman,  I move  to strike  the  last  word for the purposes of entering into  a  colloquy with  the  distinguished  chairman of the committee.  Mr. Chairman,  I appreciate  the op portuni ty to discuss with you the im portance of a program, the community based justice grant program, which was  contained  in  last year's crime  bill,  which has been a part of the local law  enforcement block grant.  This is a very, very impressive pro gram that was initiated by the district  attorney  in Middlesex County, MA,  Tom Riley.  Several years ago I went up to Low ell, MA, on a hot summer day. In the  morning I met with over 100 residents  of the city of Lowell, MA, who were  meeting with five young top police offi cers. This was a  tremendous program  where 100 residents of the city of Low ell, MA, got together with five young  police officers from the Lowell depart ment with a couple of young prosecu tors and identified some of the worst  violent criminals in the city of Lowell.  They went after these criminals in a  way that was unprecedented and, as a  result, we saw the crime rate in Low ell, MA, drop by 50 percent.  Last year, for the first time in scores  of years, we saw the crime rate drop to  its lowest point. There was not a single  murder committed in Lowell, MA, last  year.  We expanded the program into Som erville, MA, Malden, MA,  a  range of  other cities and towns throughout the  State. In each case the crime rate was  dropped in half or better as a result of  the people  taking  the  streets back,  working hand in glove with the local  police department and taking the time  to identify specific criminals that were  perpetrating  violent  crimes  against  others. If they think there are drugs  being dealt  in at a particular apart ment,  they  tell  the  local prosecutor,  tell  the police officers, and work  to gether to eliminate and eradicate those  individuals  that are  responsible  for  these crimes. It really is a tremendous  program.  ",1995

363,,104,-0.402,1393,14,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, 30 years  ago a contract with our senior citizens  was created when  the Medicare pro gram was enacted, and now the Repub lican Congress is proposing to end Med icare as we know  it and balance  the  budget,  I am afraid, on  the backs of  senior citizens.  Mr. Speaker,  the Republican Party  was against Medicare when it was en acted in 1965, and now that Republicans  have 'regained control of Congress, one  of the first things that they want to do  is take $270 billion out of the program  and for senior citizens to foot the bill  for a balanced budget. While I believe  in a balanced budget, I feel the Repub lican approach is incorrect, wrong and  draconian.  Medicare has had a  lot of success  since it was established. Poverty rates  for senior citizens have declined dra matically. Medicare has given seniors  universal  heal th  coverage  and  pro tected them from depleting their hard earned  resources. Without Medicare,  many seniors would be forced to choose  between health care, food, and shelter.  Mr. Speaker, I want to read an ex cerpt  from  testimony  submitted  to  Congress during  the Medicare debate  from a concerned citizen in 1963. It is  from the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD: ""My  mother is now 85 years old, and since  she has been hospitalized before,  the  insurance company cancelled out her  policy, and now I am paying the bill.  Her sole  income  is a  social security  check for $40 a month. I hope my chil dren will not have the same choice to  make to either pay the bills or put dad  on relief."" That is from the RECORD on  November 21, 1963.  Mr. Speaker, the problem is that the  Republicans  have  not discussed  the  specific details of how  they plan  to  change Medicare,  because  they  are  afraid to tell seniors what will happen  with this $270 billion in Medicare cuts.  One plan,  though,  that  the Repub licans are floating is a voucher plan,  which basically limits the health care  coverage of senior citizens. This vouch er plan would basically give  seniors  substandard health care unless  they  have a  lot of money and can afford  their own health coverage. Essentially,  a senior will be told that once he has  used up the voucher, that he will have  to pay for health care insurance out of  his own pocket, and I am afraid, Mr.  Speaker, the Republicans do not realize  that most seniors are on a fixed income  and simply will not be able to afford  the extra cost  that will be entailed  under this proposed voucher program.  There  are other Republican  plans  that have been discussed that will ei ther force senior citizens into HMO's or  the managed care systems that are like  HMO's, and essentially what that does  is  to  tell  the  seniors which doctors  they can and they cannot see.  I have talked to a lot of senior citi zens over  the  last few months about  some of these alternate plans that Re publicans have come up with, and most  of the senior citizens I  represent are  very happy with their doctors and do  not want to be told which doctors that  are going to serve them. They are very  afraid of the fact they will not be able  to choose their own doctor.  Nobody  really knows exactly what  the Republicans are going  to do, be cause they have not put specific pro posals forward.  But their proposed Medicare cuts are  so  large,  I  am convinced  it  is only  going  to hurt  senior citizens.  I  am  afraid the Republicans will end Medi care as we know it, without telling the  American public the true story of what  these $270 billion in cuts are ultimately  going to mean to them.""  Some estimates figure  that seniors  will  have  an  additional  $1,000  per  month of our-of-pocket costs to main tain  the  same heal th coverage  that  they are currently  receiving,  and  if  health  costs  rise  faster  than  the  growth  in Medicare  to  seniors,  then  seniors are either going  to get  less  services or pay more money. It is that  simple.  Mr. Speaker, finally, during the last  few nights,  I have heard Republicans  state  that  they are  really concerned  about saving Medicare and that is why  they are putting forth these cuts in the  program and the changes that we are  hearing about. But I would maintain  that if Republicans are truly concerned  about saving Medicare and reforming  it, then they should not be approaching  it in the backward way that they are  approaching it. Republicans are start ing with $270 billion in cuts, the largest  amount of cuts in  the history of the  Medicare program. Then,  after  they  make  these cuts,  they want  to gut  Medicare to achieve the cost savings.  The American public should not be  fooled by these Republican plans. Sen ior citizens should watch closely over  the next few months to see what the  Republicans do  to  the existing Medi care  program,  and  the Republicans  should not be allowed to break Medi care's contract with America's seniors.

I  think  it is  important  the House  note that it was the Republican Con gress that led the way to roll back the  unfair 1993  tax on senior citizens' So cial Security, and it is the same Repub lican-held Congress that has also called  for increases in income eligibility for  senior citizens who now are capped at  $11,380  a year. Under  the Republican  legislation, they will be able to make  up to $30,000 a year without deductions  from Social Security.  We will work in a bipartisan fashion  to make sure we preserve and protect  Social Security and Medicare. What we  will do with Medicare is to make sure,  through our preservation task force, to  come up with options to make sure we  eliminate the fraud, abuse, and waste  which exists in the system. That is the  core of the problem.  D 2310  I also rise  tonight, Mr. Speaker, to  pay  tribute  to a Norristown commu nity leader from my district, Frances  Joyner, someone who gave so much for  her community. She died at the age of  53, and this has certainly shortened the  life of someone who was a great Amer ican, a great community volunteer.  Mr. Speaker, she contributed much  in her time, much more so  than you  might  expect  for  someone  of  such  young years. She was an outstanding  employee at the Norristown State Hos pital, an active employee at the U.S.  Post Office. But more important than  her regular job was what she did in her  community.  She was active in her church, she was  active in civic organizations, and she  helped start many youth programs in  her community  in Pennsylvania. She  was a member of the board of directors  and  treasurer  of  the  Norristown  Jaycettes, and she was active with the  Montgomery County Junior Miss Pag eant. She was the founder of the Miss  Essence of Ebony Pageant.  She was on the board of directors of  the YMCA. She was director of the Fos ter Parents of the Children's Aid Soci ety.

365,,104,0.254,1406,14,Mr. GILLMOR.," Mr. Speaker,  the House of  Representatives historic vote on  the budget  resolution sets .the stage for congressional ac tion  to begin consideration of privatization of  PBS. Far from spelling doom  for Big Bird or  the ""MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour,"" the vote pre sents public broadcasting with vast opportuni ties  to establish  its  independence  from  the  Federal Government while preserving its tradi tional educational mission.  My good friend and colleague MIKE OXLEY a member of the Commerce Committee--re cently stated that it was time for public broad casting to  look beyond  its traditional reliance  on Federal support for opportunities and alli ances in the private sector. By doing so, pub lic broadcasting can insulate itself from politics  while securing a reliable and steady source of  funding.  What are our options? Public broadcasting's  value to viewers, and thus investors, is bound  up  in  its noncommercial emotional  identity.  One of the most intriguing private sector solu tions I have seen to date is the one suggested  by our former colleague, Jack Kemp.  In a re cent Wall Street Journal article, Mr. Kemp  called upon PBS  to  leverage  the duplicate  public broadcasting stations that exist in most  major markets.  According to Mr. Kemp, PBS has 345 sta tions with sometimes as many as 4 or 5 serv ing the same market. By contrast, each of the  4 major commercial  networks, ABC, NBC,  CBS, and Fox have fewer than 225 apiece. By  leveraging the commercial potential of its du plicate stations, Mr. Kemp suggests that public  broadcasting could preserve the noncommer cial, educational nature of the vast majority of  its stations while creating a viable and secure  source of private sector funding.  With some creative, market-oriented  think ing, public broadcasting could be part of a  new excitement, finding ways of satisfying the  legion of devoted fans and lessen the depend ence on the Federal dole. I call upon PBS and  its supporters to work with Congress in identi fying and developing the kinds of creative and  innovative solutions that the new telecommuni cations market can provide.  Mr. Speaker, I want to see public broadcast ing to do the things it does so well, especially  the educational mission. But reliance on Fed eral  funding will not keep  the system viable.  Public broadcasting needs new ideas and new  alliances. The market  is  the place  to  find  them.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  July 26, 1995  IN PRAISE OF POSTAL WORKERS  WHO HELP STAMP OUT HUNGER  THE SAN DIEGO COASTAL  CORRECTIONS ACT  HON. TONY P.

366,,104,-0.28,1406,14,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to take a moment today to praise the efforts  of a prominent group of American workers  who  rarely  receive  the  recognition  they de serve--both as representatives of the Federal  Government and as private citizens who con tribute to their local communities.  These are  the postal workers who  touch  each of our lives nearly every day. For many  poor and elderly citizens especially. postal  workers are  the only  representatives of  the  Federal Government that they see, and those  citizens depend on the postal workers for con tact with the world and many other needs.  But postal workers assist their communities  in  far more ways  than  just by delivering the  mail. They volunteer their time and efforts in  countless communities across  the Nation  to  help those less fortunate than themselves. On  May 13, 1995, the National Association of Let ter Carriers [AFL-CIO], with the strong support  of the U.S. Postal Service management, con ducted a food drive for needy families through out the Nation. On that day, U.S. Postal Serv ice letter carriers collected nonperishable food  and canned goods from  thousands of gener ous postal customers who  left  the  food by  their mail boxes. The collected food is distrib uted  to  hungry people  through  local  food  banks and emergency feeding centers.  The annual drive  is  timed  for  the second  Saturday in May, which is a time of year when  food pantries usually  run  low on donations.  This is the third year the drive has been con ducted nationwide.  Nationwide,  the  estimated  total  collected  was more  than 44.4 million pounds of  food.  This was  far greater than  last year's record  total of 32 million pounds. More  than 1, 130  NALC local branches signed up for the drive,  covering an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 com munities in all 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the  Virgin Islands.  As chairman of the Democratic Task Force  on Hunger and  the  former chairman of  the  House Select Committee on Hunger, I have a  strong interest in promoting efforts such as the  postal workers' campaign to help the hungry.  Furthermore, as the Representative from Day ton, OH, I want to call special attention to the  postal workers in the city of Dayton who col lected 167,000 pounds of food.  I am proud that I participated in the drive in  my district. On May 13, I walked with Dayton  Postmaster David Ashworth, letter carrier Wil liam Ernest, and Dan Grilliot, president of the  Dayton branch of the National Association of  Letter Carriers, as they collected food along a  postal carrier  route. We walked one of  the  routes in Centerville, OH, in my district.  I now offer praise to  the National Associa tion of Letter Carriers, the management of the  U.S. Postal Service, and above all, to the men  and women of the postal service who partici pated in this public spirited campaign to help  the less fortunate in our communities.

367,House,104,-0.383,5,21,Mr. REED.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to speak on behalf of my constituents  who have no voice but who have a very  large stake in the outcome of the de bate over  the GOP budget-the chil dren of Rhode Island.  The Republican budget will eliminate  Medicaid  coverage  for  almost  40,000  children  in Rhode  Island, many  of  whom  are  disabled. The Republican  budget will cut nutrition assistance for  almost 50,000 children in Rhode Island.  The Republican budget jeopardizes im munizations for children in Rhode Is land. The Republican budget will deny  14,000 children  in Rhode  Island child  care  assistance. Unfortunately, Mr.  Speaker, the list goes on and on.  I say to my Republican colleagues we must work toward a balanced budg et for our children, not balance  the  budget on  the backs of our children.  When it comes to public investment in  children's health and education, deny ing a dollar today actually costs more  in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote  against  this  short-sighted  and  mean  spirited  budget  reconciliation  bill.

368,House,104,-0.321,18,21,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, al though  I  support a balanced budget,  this Republican bill is too extreme. It  takes our country in the wrong direc tion.  I want to make it clear to the Amer ican people exactly what is wrong with  this bill.  The Republican  bill  cuts  student  loans and forces students and their par ents to bear the burden of paying even  more for a college education.  It makes excessive cuts to Medicare  by increasing the average senior's out of-pocket cost by nearly $400 per year  in order to give a  tax break for  the  wealthy.  It makes deep cuts in long term care  that will  raise  the cost  for nursing  homes and will  force  seniors out of  nursing homes, or bankrupt their fami lies who are  trying  to care for  their  parents and grandparents.  It eliminates the guarantee of Medic aid by threatening the health care of  over 36 million low-income children, el derly,  and  disabled American&-our  most vulnerable Americans.  It curbs the quality of nursing homes  for elderly Americans by repealing the  minimum Federal requirements.  And it cuts the earned  income  tax  credit which provides  a modest  tax  break for  the lowest-income families.  These EITC cuts are a  tax increase on  the lowest-income working families in  our country.  I am pleased  that  there will be a  strong democratic alternative that has  been praised by the Washington Post as  a  respectable, disciplined alternative  that  is easily  the best horse  in  the  race. It will balance the budget by 2002  without the extreme cuts in Medicare,  it gets rid of any  tax cut until  the  budget is balaned, it preserves the tax  credit for the working poor, and it does  not cut education.  Mr. Speaker, it is  time  to get our  House in order, yet it should be done  the smart way. The Republican bill  only  burdens  hard-working, middle  class Americans for the benefit of the  wealthy and it must be defeated.  ",1995
369,House,104,0.034,31,21,Mr. PARKER.," Mr. Chairman, for pur poses of clarification I would like to  engage the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.  KASICH] in a colloquy.  First let me thank the gentleman for  his willingness to work with those of  us who have been concerned about the  public auction of the facilities in the  Power Marketing Administration. It is  my belief that the study provision con tained in this legislation is superior to  an outright sale. In fact, this nonbiased  study will hopefully provide our com mittee with the needed facts to deter mine whether or not a  sale of  the  PMA's will be in the best interest of  the Government in the long run.  ",1995
370,House,104,-0.401,44,21,Ms. LOFGREN.," Mr. Chairman, on be half of the seniors, working  families  and especially children in my district,  I strongly oppose this bill.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  H.R. 2491, the Budget Reconciliation Act. This  bill ignores the priorities of the American peo ple by its cavalier attitude toward children and  working families. One key purpose of this bill  is to provide tax breaks for the wealthy; most  Americans will get nothing back or even pay  more under this so-called tax break plan.  My  district  is made  up  of  hard-working  American  families and  they have sent me a  loud and clear message: they want thoughtful  and measured cuts  in our Government, cou pled with strong safeguards for our elderly, our  families, and our children. This bill ignores that  message.  Mr. Chairman, almost 8,000 children  in my  district will  lose  their health coverage under  this bill, and thousands of working families will  suffer from the cuts in student loans and high er taxes. My district, Santa Clara County, will  lose $564.6 million in Medicaid funding over 7  years and health care officials warn that emer gency clinics,  local clinics, public hospitals,  nursing homes and private hospitals could be  forced  to close  their doors. These measures  aren't part of the message I receive from my  district.  This bill also cuts into some of the most im portant tax provisions that benefit my district.  I know  that many of my colleagues are dis mayed  that  the Earned  Income Tax Credit,  which provides a true incentive to people try ing to stay off welfare and into the work force,  would be a target of  this Congress. Scaling  this back really amounts to a tax increase for  low-wage-earning Americans.  I am equally disappointed that the Majority  has  seen  fit  to  eliminate  the  Low-Income  Housing Tax Credit.  In 1993, two-out-of-three  of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  cosponsored  legislation  in 1993 to make this  credit permanent. It made sense in 1993 and  it makes sense now. The city of San Jose has  called  this tax provision ""the single most im portant source of funding for the development  of affordable housing."" Since 1991, 17 44 af fordable units have been developed  in San  Jose, with a total tax credit of $100 million and  a total economic impact of a quarter of a bil lion dollars. Mr. Chairman, this credit, like the  Earned  Income Tax Credit, helps people  to ward self-sufficiency, spurs  local economies,  provides jobs for  local workers and provides  affordable  housing  for  struggling  families.  Under this same bill, 7,685 children in Califor nia will have to go without basic housing. We  need housing for these children and their fami lies. Why are we sacrificing effective credits in  favor of tax breaks for those who make hun dreds of thousands of dollars a year?  But this bill  is about more than  tax credits  and tax breaks, Mr. Chairman. It's really about  our children themselves. Kicked off Medicaid,  deprived of school  lunches, and  inadequately  protected  from  hunger,  homelessness  and  abuse by  the provisions of  this bill, children  are going to suffer. Did you know that over 50  percent of all Medicaid recipients are children?  These children are the real  losers in  this bill.  And  to  top  it all off,  this reconciliation bill  is  going  to  cap welfare  assistance, meaning  even  less money will be available  for  these  needy children.  My colleagues,  it  is clear  that  the current  majority  lacks  interest  in struggling  families.  When this budget takes effect, working Amer ica will be squeezed even more. What will this  mean? More working families unable to afford  health care, housing, education, child-care and  even  food; more problems with  unemploy ment, homelessness and more stress  in our  local communities. Do we want  this?  Is  this  what the American people really asked for in  November? I know that the people who elect ed me last November certainly did not.  ",1995
371,House,104,-0.382,57,21,Ms. ESHOO.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 15  seconds to the gentleman from Illinois  [Mr. RUSH].  ",1995
372,House,104,-0.478,57,21,Mr. RUSH.," Mr. Chairman,  I would  like to point out to the gentleman who  just  spoke  that under  this bill  the  State of Florida will lose $5.9 billion in  health care for the elderly and the dis abled. Most of  this  is coming  from  nursing home care which would have to  be paid  for by hard-working middle class families.  ",1995
373,House,104,0.302,57,21,Mr. LATHAM.," Mr. Chairman, I think  it is interesting when you talk about  agricultural  policy  and  not  having  hearings, we had 19 hearings concern ing the Freedom To Farm Act and get ting  ideas  from  farmers  themselves.  One gentleman who spoke earlier ad mitted during the committee hearing,  on  the Democrat  side,  that he had  never attended any of these hearings.  I think it is kind of interesting, I am  sure he must have been listening to bu reaucrats here in Washington, but the  thing they told,  the farmers  told us,  they want flexibility, they want a safe ty net, and they want relief from regu lations that are strangling agriculture  today.  One  important  thing  to  remember,  when we actually get  to a  balanced  budget,  it is going  to  lower  interest  costs by 1.2 to 2 percent, and when you  look at agriculture that is borrowing  $141 billion a year, over 7 years, that  more than makes up for any reduction  in farm spending, and under  the bill  that is in our Reconciliation Act, there  is more disposable net  farm  income  than even existing law would be.  ",1995
374,House,104,0.339,291,21,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman, I have had ex tensive discussions with  the chairman of  the  House Commerce Committee concerning  the  fact  that  teaching  hospitals  and  academic  medical centers have traditionally had higher  costs. This is due to the special mission that  right  these institutions have providing specialty pa tient care, conducting clinical  research, and  training new physicians to treat our poor.  After  these discussions,  I have been as sured that it should be the policy of the States,  when creating their new MediGrant programs,  to  take it  into account. Obviously,  it  is in the  best interest of this Nation's health care to en sure top quality doctors and research facilities,  along with continuing specialty care. This can  be done if the States recognize that additional  reimbursements will be required to these types  of facilities.  ",1995
375,House,104,-0.329,304,21,Mr. DOYLE.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  today  in  opposition to H.R. 2425, and to speak on be half of our communities, hospitals, and  the  health of  today's and  tomorrow's senior citi zens. If we are to bring about Medicare reform  which will prove to be truly beneficial, we must  first  reach a consensus  that  reforms must  achieve specified goals without creating new,  more difficult problems.  In  the Pittsburgh  area  alone,  there are  seven hospitals which would face almost cer tain shut-down as a result of these proposed  cuts. This situation is certainly exacerbated by  the elimination of disproportionate share pay ments to these hospitals. It is neither prudent  nor logical to make devastating cuts to Medi care  in such an arbitrary fashion. The sound  thinking,  hard-working  people  of  western  Pennsylvania and across this country will tell  you that putting the cart before the horse will  get Medicare nowhere fast.  It has been documented that both proposals  we. are considering today, H.R. 2425 and the  Democratic alternative, will result in the Medi care  trust  fund being put on sound  financial  footing  through  the year 2006. However,  the  Democratic alternative saves $90 billion, all of  which  is put back into the Medicare system,  while H.R. 2425 cuts $270 billion,  far more  than is necessary, simply to help pay for huge  tax cuts we cannot afford.  A recent national poll shows that 72 percent  of those polled oppose Medicare cuts being  made to pay for tax breaks. One has to ques tion how making major cuts to Medicare in a  quick  fix effort  to  fund  tax breaks could be  construed by anyone as fiscally conservative.  I urge my colleagues to oppose the ill-con ceived and reckless cuts called for in this bill  ",1995
376,House,104,-0.045,447,21,Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi.,"  As  usual, my friend,  the gentleman from  Ohio  [Mr. KASICH],  is  right. We do  take the best parts of their plan, and  we make it better.  As far as our Nation's veterans,  the  coalition budget makes $1.5 billion less  in spending  cuts  for  veterans'  pro grams. The leadership plan would ex tend the prescription drug co-payment  and raise it by $1. The Coalition plan  does not.  But, most importantly, the coalition  plan enacts the text of H.R. 580, a bill  that has over 220 cosponsors, and pro vides  much-needed  military  sub vention, allows our military retirees to  take  their Medicare payments  to a  military hospital. This is a plan that  has been endorsed by the Coalition of  Military and Veterans Associations,  the Retired Officers Association,  the  Fleet Reserve  Association,  the Air  Force Association,  the Army Associa tion, the Marine Corps League, the Ma rine Corps Officers Association,  the  Military Order of the Purple Heart, the  National  Association  of Uniformed  Services and 30 other veterans' groups  want to see this plan become law.  We have a chance to do that by pass ing the coalition budget.  ",1995
377,House,104,-0.465,460,21,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Thank you, very  much. The gentleman  from Colorado  [Mr. SKAGGS].  ",1995
378,House,104,-0.264,460,21,Mr. HEFNER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the gentlewoman for making this time  available. I do not usually participate  in special orders, but I read a press re lease that took on, in my view, a very  vicious  tone and made some accusa tions about a gentlewoman who has  been my friend for a long, long time.  Mr. Speaker, the only thing we have  in life is our integrity, and our word is  our bond, as people  take about. We  have some high rhetoric when we get  into debate about different issues. We  have just had Medicare and reconcili ation.  I have been here  for some 20  years, but we usually try to, in our ar guments, be basically honest and have  some truth to what we say.  But, Mr. Speaker,  I  do not  think  there is any argument, nobody has dis puted,  that  this was not a  forgery,  which in itself is bad enough that any one would forge a document. The only  reason that I can imagine that anyone  would put a document out is because  the  heading  ""Alliance  for  Justice""  maybe would call attention that this is  an organization and people would pick  it up and they would have some respect  and people would read it.  It would  seem  to me  if someone  wanted  to put  the  information out,  they would have used  their own sta tionery, or the subcommittee's station ery head. Not only was it a  forgery,  which is bad enough, but after contact ing  the  different organizations  that  were mentioned, they denied that they  got the numbers. They got no Federal  funds. And this, in itself, is false wit ness about an agency.  Then when  they get  caught with  their hand in the cookie jar, if they are  in the majority, they can have a mo tion to table and if they have got the  votes, they can walk lockstep and table  it. It does not mean that they are not  caught with their hand in the cookie  jar.  It seems to me if they had wanted to  do  the honorable  thing when  it was  called  to  their attention,  if the sub committee chairman had wanted to do  the honorable  thing, he would apolo gize if his staff had done it.  Mr. Speaker, if my staff had done it,  I would have been the first one on this  floor.  I  have  been  a  subcommittee  chairman for a  lot of years.  I would  have been the first one on this floor to  apologize to this House and to apolo gize to the people that were affected,  and the staff people that had done it  would  apologize  and  they  probably  would not have been on the staff any more.  This  is something  that  takes on a  very serious situation to me. Then I  read the press accounts here. The press  release says: Taking Ms. SLAUGHTER to  task for all she wants  to do and use  this as politically motivated and un founded.  It is not unfounded. Nobody denies  that it is a forgery. There is no doubt  about that. Let me just read and follow  up on what the gentleman from Cali fornia  [Mr.  FAZIO]  said.  I  have  a  quotation here on the same situation  that the gentleman was talking about.  This was  from  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania [Mr. WALKER]:  We have got to make certain that what we  do serves the best interest of the House, but  also accomplishes the purpose of making cer tain that we never have the future staff peo ple or future Members thinking that this is  the kind of thing they can get away with.  He goes on to say,  This is political dirty tricks with venom, be cause what they have done here is the dirty  tricks  have  resulted,  potentially,  in  the  change in the entire public documentation,  but in this case, in trying to change the peo ple's minds on legislation that is being pro posed in this House.""

380,Senate,104,-0.37,603,21,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, I rise  in strong support of the fiscal respon sibility amendment. Mr. President, we  should not cut taxes until we balance  the budget. This reconciliation legisla tion cuts taxes before the budget is bal anced. This is like eating dessert before  dinner.  I support a balanced Federal budget  and I have voted for significant deficit  reduction over the past 2 years. But re ducing  the deficit cannot be accom plished if we are simultaneously cut ting taxes for the wealthiest of Ameri cans.  This  is  fiscally  irresponsible. This  highlights the Republican's real priority in this reconciliation bill-cutting  taxes for the wealthiest Americans.  Balancing the budget must be based  on principles that uphold basic values.  Protecting our seniors, providing op portunities for our young people, and  protecting the ladders of opportunity  for working families are my guiding  principles. This reconciliation legisla tion violates those principles by gut ting Medicare and Medicaid, cutting  student loans and repealing the earned  income tax credit [EITC].  The fact is Mr. President, the Repub lican tax cut would add nearly $300 bil lion to the national debt by 2002. All  but the last few billion of the tax cut is  borrowed money,  under  the Repub licans own deficit reduction timetable.  This reconciliation bill is fiscally ir responsible-and don't think otherwise.  Requiring  the budget  to be balanced  before we cut taxes is the responsible,  fair  and  principled  action  to  take.  That's what this amendment ensures.  This amendment also ensures that fu ture tax cuts will be  targeted to low  and moderate-income working Amer ican families, not the wealthiest Amer icans. That  is why  I  support  this  amendment and urge my colleagues to  support it.  Mr. President, the tax cuts proposed  by the Republicans are fiscally disas trous. I urge my colleagues to vote for  fairness and common sense and vote for  this amendment.  ",1995

Mr. President,  simply put,  this provides health care  support to the most severely disabled  individuals  in our  society.  Senator  CHAFEE and I received a letter of sup port from the Consortium for Citizens  With Disabilities, 30 national organiza tions  that work  to  support  the dis abled.

Remember, this is a  lifelong condi tion which cannot be cured like substance  abuse or unemployment.

385,,104,0.043,837,21,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing legislation to support the activities of a  key bureau within  the Department of State the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. This is the  Bureau that is tasked among other things with  maintaining the security of the lives of Amer ican diplomatic personnel overseas.  We have been repeatedly reminded that the  world  is still a very dangerous place. My bill  will  help  strengthen  America's  defenses  against international terrorism targeted against  individuals or governments, and will  improve  our ability to battle this deadly and cowardly  scourge.  Recently, we have witnessed  several at tacks on American personnel and facilities; in cluding the tragic death of two innocent Amer ican personnel viciously gunned down while in  a United States diplomatic van on the streets  of Karachi, Pakistan. There was also the re cent grenade attack on the United States em bassy in Moscow. It is still an unsafe world for  American personnel and facilities abroad.  The Diplomatic Security Bureau is required  to provide a secure environment for the con duct of American diplomacy worldwide. Ameri cans are sent  to distant and sometimes un friendly locations around the world to carry out  our foreign policy goals.  It  is our duty to be  sure that the best security is provided to these  Americans and other nationals, who help carry  out and  implement our foreign policy abroad.  Unfortunately, there has long been precious  little enthusiasm  for many of  these difficult,  and often undiplomatic security type functions  and safety efforts within some parts of our  State Department.  I fear that in the competi tion for resources, security of all kinds is get ting short changed today.  The bill, I am  introducing today, will help to  provide greater leadership and professionalism  within the Diplomatic Security Bureau. This reEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  form  is important given the extent of respon sibilities assigned to this bureau.  In addition  to protection of personnel as signed to U.S. diplomatic missions abroad, the  Bureau provides physical protection  for De partment of State office and residential facili ties,  communications,  and  information  sys tems; prevents  the penetration of diplomatic  facilities by  foreign  intelligence efforts, and  certifies construction security procedures.  Diplomatic Security also conducts personnel  background  investigations  for security clear ances,  investigates visa and passport  fraud,  protects  resident  and  visiting  foreign  dig nitaries, and makes semiannual assessments  of the threat levels of overseas posts for ter rorism, crime, human  intelligence, and  tech nical attacks on facilities.  My bill sets out new professional statutory  qualifications  for  the Assistant Secretary of  State for Diplomatic Security. This individual is  in charge of the important day to day leader ship  in  the State Department protecting our  personnel and  facilities abroad, as well as a  key border security function, dealing with vital  travel and entry documents. The bill also  in sures  the Bureau's permanent existence  in  any possible downgrading scheme.  The Diplomatic Security Bureau,  besides  these many responsibilities I noted, also irwes tigates passport and visa fraud, which exists  on a massive scale today. This fraud seriously  threatens our  internal security by  facilitating  the often undetected and easy entry into our  Nation of international terrorists, drug traffick ers, and other unsavory criminal elements.  The growing problem with visa and passport  fraud  requires professional  law enforcement  leadership and experience to help bring about  successful  prosecute of  these  criminal  of fenses  in our Federal courts.  I was pleased  last year to take the lead in the crime bill that  raised  the  criminal  penalties  for  these of fenses, especially  if done to  facilitate  terror ism, or drug trafficking.  In addition, we must continue to adhere to  high standards  for construction and building  security at the Diplomatic Security Bureau. We  can not afford to have another Moscow Em bassy episode  that has cost  the country  in  terms of expenditures required to rebuild this  building and in terms of national security con cerns.  On June 29, 1995,  the  International Rela tions Committee held oversight hearings on  many of these security problems, including the  recent attacks on American personnel over seas  in both Karachi, Pakistan, and on our  Ambassador in Burundi.  We  identified  the problem of  the Ambas sador's driver  in Burundi, who because of  budget cuts and  resource  restraints, did not  receive the needed defensive driving training  as requested earlier out of concern for safety  by our Embassy in Bujumbura.  In both  instances in Pakistan and Burundi,  the embassy vehicle drivers froze when the at tacks came, and were not adequately trained  to possibly help avoid  injury  to our United  States personnel under transport. While such  training would not have guaranteed successful  avoidance,  its omission, surely did not help  matters.  It was plainly evident from  those oversight  proceedings that in the last few years the Dip30293  lomatic Security Bureau has  taken  far  too  deep, and disproportionate cuts as part of the  State Department's own management initiated  resource  reductions. The State Department  has started to cut into the very bone marrow  of its own vital safety and security operations.  The cuts  in staff,  resources, building and  construction security, and other personnel, se curity training, and/or contract related security  activities, such as crisis management training,  maybe today needlessly endangering the safe ty of our personnel,  facilities, and overall na tional security abroad.  This  is a cause of serious concern, which  cannot be ignored, especially today when we  are considering increased American presence  in places like Bosnia, and  in  light of the rise  of radical religiously motivated terrorism, often  directed at Americans and our  interests. Let  us hope we have not forgotten the lessons of  Beirut in the early 1980's when our Embassy  and other  facilities abroad  faced  the deadly  terrorist bombs and attacks.  Congress must help put an end to this un acceptable downward slide in diplomatic secu rity at  the U.S. State Department. We must  help restore it to the priority status it deserves.  After all, these are issues of vital national in terest. In addition, we do a disservice to those  Americans we send abroad to conduct our for eign policy, when we neglect their very secu rity, and personal safety.  Disproportionate cuts in our diplomatic secu rity efforts  in  the  last few years, have been  largely accepted without serious protest. The  current  incumbent  in  the post of Assistant  Secretary for Diplomatic Security has no real  formal background in law enforcement, the in telligence services, or the security field.  Professional quali.fications related to this im portant and high level position within the State  Department are not now required of any  in cumbent who holds, or will hold, that top secu rity position in the State Department. Therein  lies the potential danger to our national secu rity.  My bill, helps correct this situation. This As sistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security posi tion should be more than a ticket punch in the  foreign service on the way up the career lad der at our State Department.  It is vital, especially in the current climate of  reduced budgets and cutbacks  in  the State  Department,  that  the Assistant Secretary  for  Diplomatic Security have the relevant profes sional  law enforcement,  intelligence, and/or  security qualifications and experience for this  important job.  Professional qualifications that are essential,  in order that he or she can carry on the fight  for adequate resources and respect in a even  more informed, and serious manner, befitting  the threat to our national security, and do so,  without fear or favor.  The bill,  I introduce today, will require pro fessional  related qualifications hereafter  for  anyone appointed Assistant Secretary of Dip lomatic Security, and charged with that impor tant responsibility abroad in today's ever dan gerous and hostile world.  This reform embodied in my bill (H.R. 2541)  is in America's vital interest.  I ask that the full text of the bill be printed  hereafter:  ",1995
386,,104,-0.39,850,21,Mr. MEEHAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay tribute to an outstanding newsman in my  district. Bob Schufreider,  news director  for  WCCM-AM  in Lawrence, MA,  is  leaving  the  station after 81f2 years of dedicated service to  the  listeners of  the Merrimack Valley and  southern New Hampshire. His  talents will  sorely be missed.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Bob came  to  the station  from Chicago  in  1987. He worked his way up from a part-time  on-air personality,  to covering  fires, storms,  and city council meetings  full-time. He has  hosted numerous public affairs shows, sharing  important  information on  topics of  interest to  his  listeners.  In addition, he has broadcast  countless high school  football and basketball  games in communities throughout my district.  He will be remembered by his listeners for his  smooth play-by-play and uncanny command of  statistics and sports trivia.  His is a special craft, Mr. Speaker.  In this  era of media mergers and superstations, what  Bob, and others like him in small and medium size markets do, is vitally important to stitching  together the fabric of a diverse community. It  takes a sharp eye, and a good ear,  to stay  rooted and connected  to  the community one  serves. Bob has demonstrated those abilities  time and time again.  He does not depart greater Lawrence with  only the memories of persons interviewed and  stories filed. He leaves with his wife, Kathleen  McEvoy, a native of North Andover, MA, and  their daughter Hannah.  On behalf of the many listeners of WCCM AM, I wish Bob, Kathleen, and Hannah well in  their new endeavors, and look forward to their  return visits to his many  fans  in  the greater  Lawrence area.  TRIBUTE TO JULIA C. HESTER  HOUSE  HON. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 1995  Ms.  JACKSON-LEE. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to the outstanding commu nity service rendered by the Julia C. Hester  House in my hometown of Houston, TX.  Hester House, a multiservice agency, was  charted by the State of Texas as a nonprofit  corporation  in June 1943.  It was named  for  Julia C. Hester, a distinguished public servant,  who lived and worked in Houston's fifth ward  during the early decades of this century. Ms.  Hester, a  teacher by profession, welcomed  neighborhood children into her home and pro vided a safe location for organized social ac tivities for children of the Houston community.  She was also the State leader of a fraternal  organization known as Heroines of Jericho.  Unfortunately, Ms. Hester did not live to see  her deeds for young people of Houston gain  the wide  recognition  that  they deserved and  eventually received.  In 1943, when the Hous ton Community Chest, now the United Way,  supported the first community center in an Af rican American neighborhood,  the  fifth ward  was chosen,  in part, due to the contributions  of Ms. Hester.  Today, I am extremely pleased to state that  Hester House faithfully carries on the work of  its namesake. It has a board of directors com posed of 24 members and is affiliated with the  United Way of Texas Gulf Coast. On an an nual basis, Hester House serves over 1 0,000  participants, many of which have no other  place to turn for assistance.  October 26, 1995  I salute Hester House for fulfilling ""their mis sion, which is ""to provide social services that  enhance the quality of life for the residents of  the fifth ward and surrounding communities.""  In a period in which so many families are in  transition, I especially commend Hester House  for providing services that are extremely vital  to  families. Hester House offers child care  services, before and after school programs for  older children, and a 1 0 week summer day  camp.  One  outstanding  program,  the  Hester  House's kid's way enrichment program, pro vides guest speakers, educational  tours and  trips and self-esteem training.  Their successful program for teens provides  social and career development,  tutorial serv ices, athletics,  recreation, alcohol and drug  abuse prevention,  juvenile delinquency and  teenage pregnancy prevention programs dur ing those most influential and  impressionable  teenage years.  The agency's  reach has extended signifi cantly beyond  just offering services  for chil dren. For seniors, they offer health screening  activities, nutritional meals, community service  projects, exercise classes, and several other  activities.  Hester House also provides emergency food  and  clothing distribution,  student  internship  placement, volunteer opportunities and emer gency rental assistance.  I congratulate the board of directors, the ad visory board, and  the staff of Julia Hester  House  for  their outstanding  and  dedicated  service  to  the House community and wish  them continued success.  TRIBUTE TO JESUS ""CRUEY""  GARCIA  HON. BOB FILNER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 1995  ",1995
387,,104,-0.652,850,21,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker and colleagues, I  rise today to honor a community leader who  passed away this week-Jesus ""Chuey"" Gar cia.  Chuey's life was woven together by his ef forts to improve the lives of those around him,  especially  in  the San Diego community of  Barrio Logan.  The center of this activity was his Chuey's  Numero Uno Restaurant, which became a  focal point for friends and family and a site for  charitable  fundraisers and community meet ings. Chuey often offered his  restaurant  to  local community groups, and every Christmas  would prepare in his kitchen a holiday meal for  orphans in Tijuana.  Chuey Garcia  first  came  to  the United  States in 1927 from his home in Central Mex ico-and he never let circumstances stop him  from achieving his dreams. A true reflection of  the American dream, he worked as a  field  worker, cook, and chef's assistant. By 1950,  he was head chef, and after running a kitchen  for 3 years, he became and entrepreneur and  opened  the restaurant we all came  to know  and love.  He made a real difference  in  the  lives of  many in the Latino community, and served as  ",1995
388,House,104,0.39,1266,21,Mr. KIM.," Mr. Speaker, today I want  to  talk  about  the  so-called  EITC,  [earned income tax credit]. I hope that  my folks from California are listening  to me this morning.  I did not know anything about EITC  until I joined Congress. I was busy run ning my own business,  trying to sup port my family.  I did not know what  the EITC  is.  I know welfare.  I know  food stamps. I know a little bit about  Medicare and Medicaid, but EITC, what  does it do? That is what I would like to  talk about this morning.  Before  I do,  last week,  this House  passed  the 1996 budget reconciliation  bill. The bill was historic. It contains  the spending cuts necessary to balance  the budget by  the year 2002, 7 years.  During this process, we have been hear ing all kinds of misrepresentation, all  kinds of distortion, sometimes flatout  lies. Let me give some examples.  They say we are cutting Medicare,  when we are actually allowing Medi care spending to grow by $80 billion a  year.  They say we are cutting Medicaid,  when we are actually allowing Medic aid spending to grow by $30 billion a  year.  They  say we  are  cutting  school  lunches,  when  our  plan  increases  spending on school lunches by over $1  billion over the next 5 years.  What we are  trying  to do  is slow  down  the  growth  of  out-of-control  spending. We have been spending and  spending, and it has become out of con trol.  But the biggest distortion,  the big gest misrepresentation, is on the EITC.  Let me talk about it this morning for  a couple of minutes.  What is the EITC? It was passed back  in 1975. It is called earned income tax  credit.  What does it do? Well,  the Govern ment  tries  to help  those people who  work but do not earn enough money to  support their families, children. There fore, the Government helps them.  If you make less than $26,000 a year,  with kids,  then  the Government will  match up to 36 percent of a person's in come with a tax credit. In other words,  as I said earlier, if you work full time  but you cannot support your family,  then Government supports you.  ",1995

392,House,104,-0.409,1539,21,Mr. KENNEDY of Rhode Island.," Mr. Speak er,  it is with truly mixed emotions that I today  will vote  in support of this conference report.  There  is much  in  this  report  that  is good,  and for the most part of those measures which  prompted me to support the bill when  it was  on the House floor remain.  This bill continues our historic and important  commitment to advancing peace in the Middle  East.  Israel  is our strongest ally and  is  the  only democracy  in an unstable, volatile, and  important region.  The American people have been partners  with  Israel  in difficult days, and  today as  the  prospects  for peace appear more promising,  we must continue to be a steadfast ally.  This bill also makes  important refinements  in  the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act,  toughening standards that apply to actions by  the PLO.  As well,  this bill  includes several provisions  which continue our commitment to support the  people of Armenia.  I applaud the inclusion of  the earmark  for Armenia,  the cap on aid  to  Turkey, and the inclusion of the Humanitarian  Aid Corridor Relief Act.  These  are  good  provisions.  The United  States must be beside the people of Armenia  in their struggle against aggressors.  Unfortunately,  the conference  ignored  the  will of the House on section 907 of the Free dom Support Act. After two and a half hours  of debate, on June 29  the House voted  to  maintain a strong Freedom Support Act and  says  to Azerbaijan,  that we will not give you  aid until you end your unjust blockade of Ar menia.  This was right then. And it is right today.  What is wrong, in fact unconscionable, is to  have Conferees  turn  their back on  the ex pressed will of the House.  Democracy is based upon  the simple  idea  that votes matter, that when people freely ex press what  they  believe, and  the majority  speaks, that they will be heard. By ripping the  heart out of  the Freedom Support Act,  the  conference report cavalierly said that votes do  not stand for anything.  This back room deal  is beneath  this Con gress. As people  in struggling democracies  look to us to set an example,  it  is tragic that  we set such a poor example  in  the very bill  that defines how we relate to  the rest of the  world.  Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this bill. I support  much that is in  it, but deplore what has been  added and how that was done.  Those of us-and I remind you that it is the  majority of us-who believe in a strong Free dom Support Act, will take our fight to another  day.  We will not give up.  ",1995
393,House,104,0.373,1539,21,Mr. CALLAHAN.," Mr. Speaker, hav ing no further requests for time, I yield  back  the balance of my  time, and  I  move the previous question on the con ference report.  The previous question was ordered.  MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR. OBEY  ",1995
394,House,104,-0.459,1578,21,Mrs. CLAYTON.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week, Congress passed an historical  budget reconciliation plana plan that  our Republican colleagues call revolu tionary.  A revolution, however, involves more  than  change-a  revolution  involves  change for the better, forward motion,  progress. There  is great doubt in my  mind, and  the minds of many of my  constituents, that we are progressing.  While,  the deed has been done, and  the plan has passed, we are now in con ference with the Senate, and there is  still time to undo some of the damage  from that plan.  If the damage is not undone, we will  be left with no choice except to urge  the President to veto the bill.  This evening, I want to again high light the great harm that the Repub lican plan will do to rural America in  the area of health care-because past  pleas have been largely ignored.  Rural North Carolina, including my  congressional  district,  like most  of  rural America, will be especially hard  hit by these cuts.  Rural communities lack high paying  jobs, often lack the infrastructure nec essary for economic expansion and, on  to  average, have  incomes  far below  the  average American. Rural communities  will hurt more from the cuts.  The lack of basic resources and op portunities, such as employment, hous ing, education, and utility services, es pecially  water  and  sewer,  is  compounded by limited access to qual ity health  care  and  a  shortage  of  health  professionals,  especially  pri mary and family physicians.  The Republicans seem to want senior  citizens  to have health care  that  is  cheaper.  Democrats want  senior citizens  have health care that is better.  Cheaper and better are not the same.  You get what you pay for.  They want to cut corners. We want to  cut with conscience.  The Republicans want to put seniors  in groups and choose doctors for them,  because its cheaper.  Democrats want  seniors  to  choose  their own Health Plan or doctors, be cause it's better.  Under  the Republican  plan, many  seniors in rural North Carolina will be  forced  to  travel many more miles  to  find a hospital, because it's cheaper.  Democrats want to prevent rural hos pitals from closing because of cuts in  Medicare, because it's better.  Cheaper could cost less, it could also  cost more, but it could cost lives.  Why are  the Republicans pushing a  cheaper health care plan?  Because they are also pushing an ex pensive tax cut plan for wealthy Amer icans.  They have voted to cut the Medicare  Program by $270 billion so  that they  can pay for a  tax cut program of $245  billion.  If the Republicans dropped their ex pensive  tax cut plan for the wealthy,  they would not have  to push  their  cheaper health care plan for seniors.  Citizens of Rural America have  in comes  that are 33 percent-yes, one  third-lower than their urban counter parts.  The elderly who  live  in rural areas  are 60 percent more likely  to  live  in  poverty-60 percent.  Twenty-five  percent  of  rural  hos pitals already operate at a  loss, and  that  is because Medicare  alone  ac counts for almost 40 percent of the av erage hospital's net patient revenue.  It  is estimated  that  this plan will  cost North Carolinians a  loss of over  $3,000  for each Medicare  recipient  in  North Carolina between now and  the  year 2002, and a  loss of some $900  for  each recipient each year thereafter.  This cut in Medicare will reduce the  size of the program by 25 percent-rais ing  the cost of premiums and copay ments  to  each  of North Carolina's  999,000 Medicare beneficiaries.  And, when the Medicare cuts are combined  with the cuts in the Medicaid Program, Federal  health care dollars coming into North Carolina  will be reduced by more than $15 billion.  The Medicaid cuts affect North Carolinians  of all ages-the elderly, children, the disabled,  the poor.  There are some 985,000 Medicaid  recipi ents in our State. We would be forced to elimi nate coverage for almost half of those Medic aid recipients.  The Medicare cuts will be especially painful,  since more  than 8 out of 1 0 of all Medicare  benefits go to senior citizens with  incomes of  $25,000 or less.  Those who are pushing  this cheaper plan  fought the creation of Medicare  in 1965, and  now,  in 1995, have voted  to do what  they  failed to do in 1965-cut the comfort of retire ment from our senior citizens.  Medicare spending  in  the  rural areas of  North Carolina will be cut by $3.3 billion-a 20  percent cut in the year 2002 alone.  Worse, rural North Carolina will  lose some  of the limited number of hospitals we have.  Because  of poverty,  rural  hospitals  lose  money on Medicare, while urban hospitals  make a small profit.  The typical rural hospital, under the Repub lican's plan, will lose some $5 million in Medi care funding, over 7 years.  Rural hospitals already need 5,084 more  primary care physicians  to have  the  same  doctor to population ratio as the Nation as a  whole.    This harsh Republican plan will mean tough er times for families and especially for senior  citizens.  Mr. Speaker,  change.  But, they do not want change that takes us  back 30 years, when more  than one out of  every two senior citizens had no health care at  all.  They do not want change  that  forces our  seniors  to choose between heat and health,  that is no real choice. They want change that  takes America forward. They want change that  is better, not cheaper. The people want a real  revolution. The conferees should keep that in  mind.  If not, the President should veto the bill.  really do want  the people  THE BALANCED BUDGET DEBATE  ",1995
