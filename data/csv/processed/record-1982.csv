0,House,97,-0.218,5,3,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, today I  also have the envious delight of re minding  the House  that  today  is  March 2, Texas Independence Day, as  so eloquently described by our majori ty leader.  Knowing full well, Mr. Speaker, that  at least half the House wishes  they  were Texans, and the other half does  not know any better than not  to,  I  have endeavored to bring a little bit of  Texas to the House. If anyone here is  so unfortunate as  to never have sa vored Texas chili, then I suggest they  wait only long enough to hear the end  of my remarks before hastening to the  House Capitol dining room to get a  bowl of Texas red hot chili. This is  venison chili from the central Texas  area. Those of you who are familiar  with venison chili probably scented it  this morning when you woke up, be cause this is one of the best batches  we have ever whipped together; so you  chili veterans,  I know, will want  to  leave  immediately, go below and get  your batch of Wick Fowler's Texas  venison chili which I am serving for  the 14th time in a row.  Congratulations to all of you. May  the Lord help you!  D 1230  BILL ALEXANDER OF ARKANSAS  LISTENS ""TO THE FOLKS BACK  HOME""  <Mr. ALEXANDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1982
1,House,97,-0.41,5,3,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker, the  President has  repeatedly challenged  Members of Congress to listen ""to the  folks back home"" before making our  decisions about his budget proposals. I  am listening and I am reading their  letters, and this is what I am finding.  In a letter printed in the Arkansas  Gazette on February 15, written by a  constituent of mine  in Van Buren  County:  It's beginning to look more and more like  the people were sold a bill of goods in the  last election, which they may long regret.  In a letter to me from Marked Tree,  Ark.:  Mr. Reagan's words put up or shut up is a  challenge to the average American citizen to  speak up against Mr. Reagan's bullying tactics and determination to subject the work ing class American to the whims of himself  and his rich friends.  A year ago people in Arkansas were  angry but confident that Reaganomics  would revive the economy as President  Reagan promised. Today-with Arkan sas unemployment  standing at 12.1  percent-the highest rate in the histo ry of our State-our people are telling  me they are afraid of the record defi cits Mr. Reagan's economic policy has  produced and are only faintly hopeful  that Reaganomics will end the reces sion it has created.  The  letters  from which  I  have  quoted are not isolated cases. They are  indicative of  the conspicuous differ ence in the attitudes of my constitu ents that I am observing in 1982 com pared to the same period in 1981.  The people I am hearing from are  the youngsters  in elementary school  worried about their future education.  They are the farmers pleading for  help to save their livelihood from the  threat of the Reagan administration's  high interest rate, tight farm credit,  and low commodity price policies.  They are the schoolteacher and her  70-year-old storekeeper husband, who  still works a 10-hour day, and who to gether paid for  the first 4 years of  their son's college education and are  now seeing the family dream of his be coming  a  doctor  shattered  by  the  Reagan  administration's student  fi nancial assistance policies.  And, I am hearing from the business  people who are worrying about what  the Reagan administration's high in terest rate policies are doing to their  businesses  and  about  the  growing  threat of bankruptcy that is already  overtaking  businesses  across  the  Nation at an increasingly rapid rate.  Yesterday's announcement that the  leading economic indicators were down  for the ninth straight month in Janu ary adds to the current worries of our  people. These are the indicators that  normally signal, 2 months in advance,  significant turns in the Nation's econo my. The signal we are getting now  tells us that the end of the recession is  not yet in sight. And, administration  spokesmen  admitted yesterday  that  our national unemployment rate could  reach 10 percent,  the highest  in 40  years, before it begins to come down  again.  This news about the economic indi cators  strengthens my  belief,  the  belief of many of my constituents, and  of many of our colleagues that if this  administration continues to refuse to  take action to help bring about an end  to  the  recession,  the Congress will  have to work out a bipartisan solution  alone. Efforts are underway in that di rection and we must work to strength en them.  ",1982
2,House,97,-0.401,18,3,Mr. LOWRY of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, over a year ago, I introduced  a resolution which noted the alarming  increase in violence in El Salvador and  the need for a negotiated settlement  to the conflict in that country. It af firmed  the sense  that a democratic  government which  respected human  rights was necessary in order for sta bility to return to El Salvador. A year  later, I am sad to note that that vio lence has not stopped, that respect for  human rights has not increased, and  that all  the parties  to  the conflict  have not yet begun  talking  to each  other about the problems which are  causing the war in El Salvador to con tinue.  More people died from violence in El  Salvador  last  year  than  the  year  before. Systematic acts of kidnaping,  torture, and murder continue to haunt  the lives of ordinary citizens. Efforts  toward a political solution to the vio lence have been obstructed. Earlier  this year, I cosponsored House Con current Resolution  226  because  I  strongly believe that the role of the  U.S. Government should be one of  seeking a resolution of the crisis. The  United States should urge uncondi tional discussions among the major po litical factions in El Salvador. I believe  that passage of this resolution will be  important in moving toward a situa tion where talks can be productive-a  cease-fire and groundwork for a politi cal settlement. While the elections in  are only a month away and will not  solve the inherent problems of El Sal vador, I believe that if this Congress  passes House Concurrent Resolution  ",1982
3,House,97,0.319,31,3,Mr. CORCORAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York <Mr. GILMAN).  ",1982
4,House,97,0.043,31,3,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the motion to suspend the  rules and pass H.R. 5366, the Federal  Employees Flexible and Compressed  Work Schedules Act of 1982, and I  want  to commend  the gentlewoman  from New York,  the  subcommittee  chairman <Ms. F'ERRARo), and the gen tleman from Illinois <Mr. CORCORAN>,  the ranking minority member of the  subcommittee, for their leadership in  bringing this measure to the floor at  this time.  long-time supporter of the al ternative work  schedule program,  I  was pleased that all of my colleagues  on the Subcommittee on Human Re sources supported H.R. 5366, and that  the full Committee on Post Office and  Civil Service favorably reported that  measure by a voice vote.  H.R. 5366 would permanently au thorize the A WS program. This pro gram  is  currently authorized under  Public Law 95-930,  the Federal Em ployees  Flexible  and  Compressed  Work Schedules Act of 1978. However  the authority  for  the experimental  A WS program outlined in that act, ex pires at  the end of  this month on  March 29, 1982.  The A WS  program has  afforded  Federal employees the opportunity to  participate in a number of work sched ule designs other than the traditional  5-day, 40-hour work week. As a report  prepared by the Office of Personnel  Management indicated, the A WS pro gram has been especially successful.  Of the more than 320,000 employees  participating in that program, 90 per cent of nonsupervisory employees and  over 85 percent of supervisors were  satisfied with and wished  to  retain  their A WS schedules.  Moreover, OPM found that the AWS  program resulted in greater efficiency  of Government operations; reductions  in vehicle miles driven by  those on  compressed work schedules; increased  As a  public  accessibility  to Government  services at agencies open  longer be cause of flexible work schedules; and  substantial increase in morale because  of the employee's feeling that he had  greater control over his worklif e and  more  time  to  devote  to  personal,  family, cultural, and social activities.  Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues  to suspend  the rules and  pass H.R.  5366  so  that what has  proved  to be a productive program,  beneficial  to both  the Government  and to its employees, can continue un interrupted.  ",1982
5,House,97,-0.384,31,3,Ms. FERRARO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Maryland <Mr. HOYER), a member of  the subcommittee.  ",1982
6,House,97,-0.379,31,3,Mr. HOYER.,"  I  thank  the gentle woman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker,  I would first  like  to  commend  the  chairwoman  for  her  timely  and  determined  efforts  in  moving H.R. 5366 through committee  and onto the floor in order to secure a  permanent authorization of  the ad justed work schedule program before  it elapses on March 29.  The A WS program, sometimes  re f erred to as flexitime, has proven to be  a productive, efficient, and beneficial  personnel program for the American  public and  the Federal work  force.  Since the AWS program began, Feder al agencies have been more accessible  to the public-especially for those in dividuals on the west coast who found  Government  offices  in Washington  closed due to the time differences. Em ployees have found that A WS offers  them more control over their lives and  thus enables them to be more produc tive and free of interruptions while on  the job. In all, flexitime has proven to  be a successful tool for the efficient  use of personnel.  Mr. Speaker, as you well know, this  has been a very difficult year for Fed eral employees: Minimal salary hikes,  a reduction in health benefits and in creases  in annual premiums and de ductions,  large-scale  reductions  in  force, and continued threats of fur ther reductions in employee benefits  have left the civil service demoralized  and lowered productivity in all levels  of government. I would hate to see a  good program, a profitable program  like A WS curtailed because the time  ran out on it. So, Mr. Speaker, the bi partisan effort to enact a permanent  authorization for flexitime  is all the  more important and warrants our deci sive approval so that no interruption  in the adjusted work schedules occurs  on March 29.  It has been a pleasure for me to join  my colleagues on both sides of  the  aisle in facilitating timely enactment  of  this  legislation.  Flextime  has  proven successful in this Nation's larg est industries. It has been proven suc cessful  in  the Federal Government.  And, upon permanent authorization of  AWS, we can be sure that we have  taken another step toward accessible,  efficient government.  ",1982
7,House,97,-0.351,31,3,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Speaker, I add  my congratulations to the chairlady of  our subcommittee, who has  led our  subcommittee  so  ably,  not  only  through  these hearings, but for  the  year and 2 months that I have served  on it.  Many of us in America wonder how  we are going  to make our workers  more productive. There are two ways  to do it. One way is going to be unsuc cessful, and  that  is  to  threaten,  to  cajole, to hit workers over the head.  The other way, which is the Japanese  way, which has proven so successful, is  to tell our workers: We are in partner ship with you, and we are going  to  make life easier for you, and you will  be more productive for us.  That is what flexitime has proven.  At a time when we seem to be putting  all of the burdens that this country  has on the backs of workers in general,  and Federal workers in particular, we  can be thankful that there is at least  one program that moves us in a right  and positive direction, as opposed to  all  the negative proposals  that are  coming out of this administration.  ",1982
8,House,97,0.497,31,3,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to oppose this because of the proce dure under which it is being brought  before  the House. This  is a  serious  issue. It is one that ought to be dis cussed  in  its  totality. We ought  to  have an opportunity to at least discuss  amendments. Here we are, on the 2d  of March, having had our ninth vote  for the year earlier today on approv ing the Journal, but we do not have  time, somehow, to go by the regular  rules of this House. The Rules Com mittee  is  available  today,  this bill  could go before the Rules Committee  today and we could have  it on the  floor tomorrow. We could then have  the opportunity to discuss the ques tions  that  the  administration  has  raised with it.  To  listen  to  some  speakers,  you  would think that this concept was uni versally approved. While  I  agree  in  principle with  the  idea of flexitime,  anybody who has even persued  the  Washington Post article on what has  happened with flexitime over at the  Labor Department, or  spoken with  some of  the employees over at  the  Labor Department, knows  that it  is  not working there. There are excesses  and there are abuses that have taken  place within this program. We ought  to be able to address it. We ought not  to be afraid to take more than an hour  ",1982

10,House,97,-0.483,57,3,Mr. LEHMAN.," Mr. Speaker, no one  illustrates  the  hope  and  cause  of  Soviet Jewry more  than  Ida Nudel.  Known as the Guardian Angel of the  Prisoners of Conscience, Ida Nudel has  risked her own life as an activist and  leader of the Moscow Helsinki Moni toring Group before being sent into a  4-year Siberian exile in 1978.  Nearly a year has passed since the  House of Representatives paid special  tribute to Ida Nudel, and in April Ida  will spend yet another birthday, her  51st, in the isolation and captivity of  internal exile.  Ida's life was devoted  to helping  fell ow  refuseniks whose  daily  lives  became nightmares once they applied  for permission to emigrate from the  Soviet Union to Israel. She personified  the  guardian  of moral  and  inner  strength, courage, and determination  characteristic  of  the Soviet  Jewry  movement. Even  though  she  is  no  longer able  to deliver  the messages  that provided so much encouragement  to refuseniks cut off from the com forts of society, her sensitivity to the  psychological needs of people who,  due to their wish to live in Israel, are  forced  to suffer mental and physical  harassment, continues to be felt. Her  selfless activism became and remains a  symbol of strength. While she is shut  away and denied the caring in her own  time of need which she extended to  others, we must do what we can for  Ida Nudel.  I have recently joined with many of  my colleagues  in sending a  letter to  Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin  urging  that permission be given  to  allow  Ida  to be  reunited with her  family in Israel.  We in Congress must continue our  call for Ida's release. And we must in tensify our efforts to reopen the gates  to Jewish emigration from the Soviet  Union. As the 1981 Jewish emigration  figure of 9,447  reveals, last year had  the lowest rate of departure from the  U.S.S.R. since 1971.  I  call on my  colleagues  to work  toward reopening the emigration for  Soviet Jews and others who wish to be  reunited with family in other parts of  the world, and to protest the resurgence of anti-Semitic practices by the  Government of the Soviet Union.e  e ",1982
11,House,97,-0.044,57,3,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  pleased  to have  this opportunity  to  speak out on behalf of Ida Nudel, the  ""Guardian Angel"" of Soviet Jewish ac tivists. Ms. Nudel is one of my ""adopt ed"" Soviet Prisoners of Conscience,  and I have followed her case closely  over the years. As she is due to be re leased from internal exile very soon, it  is imperative that we let the Soviets  know we have not abandoned this her oine.  Ms. Nudel was arrested on June 2,  1978, for ""malicious hooliganism,"" the  traditional charge made against Soviet  Jewish activists who seek only to prac tice  their  religion  or  emigrate  to  Israel. She was arrested because she  had hung a  banner  saying,  ""KGB,  Give Me My Visa"" outside her apart ment window the previous day. But as  she said after she was sentenced later  that month, her real crime was that,  ""During these (past) 7 years I have  learned to walk proudly with my head  high as a human being and as a Jewish  woman.''  Ida Nudel first applied to emigrate  in May 1971, but emigration was con sistently denied for reasons of state se curity. This was a patent fabrication,  as Nudel has no knowledge of state se crets. During the time between her ap plication to emigrate and her arrest,  Nudel  lived  alone  in Moscow. Her  apartment was raided frequently, and  her personal effects often confiscated.  Despite continual KGB harassment,  Nudel continued her campaign to get  permission to emigrate.  She also continued her efforts on  behalf of Soviet Prisoners of Con science,  for which  she came  to be  known as the ""Guardian Angel."" She  wrote regularly to them and sent them  packages necessary for their survival.  Her  expressions  of  solidarity with  these Prisoners of Conscience are a  model to all of us working for the free dom of citizens  imprisoned because  they stood up for human dignity.  In November 1973, Nudel entered a  medical clinic for a heart condition.  Soviet authorities attempted during  her stay there to classify her as an al coholic. This would have meant her  being committed to a psychiatric hos pital, and exposed  to  the  insidious  Soviet practice of repressing dissidents  by  using  psychiatric  ""treatment.""  Thanks  to public opposition  to  this  prospect, she escaped this fate. Since  then she has suffered from a number  of serious  illnesses, but has resisted  treatment  for  fear  of what  could  happen to her in a hospital.  Ida Nudel is serving her sentence in  Krivosheino,  a  Siberian  village  of  6,000, most of them exiled criminals or  their  descendants. Her  first  home  there was a hostel inhabited by 60 vio lent men who frequently  threatened  her with physical harm. In 1979, she  was able to move to a one-room hut.  She must walk long distances to carry  provisions, a difficult task due to her  recurring heart and kidney problems.  I  recently heard from Elena Frid man, Ida Nudel's sister who emigrated  to  Israel  from  the Soviet Union  in  1972, and whom Ida Nudel will join if  she is permitted to emigrate. Ms. Frid man is very concerned about what will  happen to her sister if she is not per mitted to emigrate immediately upon  her release from  internal exile. She  wrote:  We cannot allow the Soviet authorities to  believe that Ida has been forgotten after 3 %  years of exile. They must be reminded that  they will be held accountable for whatever  further harm might befall her during this  upcoming hazy period. Every effort must  now be made to extract from her persecu tors an answer as to what they have in mind  now that they know they couldn't break her  by isolating her in Siberian exile. She has  suffered enough.  I  cannot even begin  to  imagine what sinister fate awaits her if and  when she is allowed to leave Siberia as a  Soviet ex-convict if she  is not allowed  to  leave the Soviet Union directly from Sibe ria.  Seventy-four of my colleagues and I  sent a letter on Friday to Soviet Am bassador Anatoly Dobrynin  asking  that Ida Nudel be allowed to join her  sister as soon as she is released. I hope  our effort will prompt action by the  Soviets, and certainly intend to follow  up on this effort with similar appeals  to the Soviets. I also have written to  the  State Department  about Ms.  Nudel, and understand that Secretary  of State Haig in fact mentioned the  urgency of Ms. Nudel's case at his  recent meetings with Soviet Foreign  Minister Gromyko. I am pleased the  State Department has taken this activ ist role on her behalf. Only continued  pressure on  the Soviets will  bring  about the freedom of Soviet Prisoners  of Conscience.  Ida Nudel's only crime was  to  live  proudly as a Jew. We must stand by  her until she is freed and permitted to  join her sister in Israel. Today's spe cial order should serve to warn the So viets that the United States will not  countenance  the oppression of good  citizens like Ida Nudel. If we are suc cessful, perhaps very soon Ida's dream,  ""that some day  I will walk up  the  steps of an El-Al aircraft, and my suf fering and my tears will remain in my  memory only,"" will come true. Thank  you, Mr. Speaker.e  ",1982

Ida Nude! has  been aptly called the ""Guardian Angel  of the Prisoners of Conscience"" in the  Soviet Union.

13,House,97,-0.303,70,3,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. Speaker, I am  today, along with Congressman BYRON  DORGAN,  introducing  a  bill which  would direct the Secretary of Agricul ture to exercise his deferral responsi bility  to FmHA borrowers who are  unable to make their loan payments.  These are FmHA borrowers who,  in  the view of FmHA have shown good  management practices but whose eco nomic  situation  is  due  to  circum stances beyond their control and who,  if  they made  such payment would  have their standard of living unduly  impaired. The bill also directs  that  FmHA exercise  its  responsibility  to  notify all borrowers of the existence of  various servicing  remedies,  including  deferral of  loan payments,  and  re quires  appeal  procedures. This  bill  adds a new provision that this deferral  responsibility  apply  to  family  size  farms.  We are  introducing this legislation  even though it may not be legally nec essary-there  are  pending  lawsuits  which make the very persuasive case  that both  the granting of deferrals  under certain circumstances and the  publicizing of servicing remedies are  already part of FmHA's duties. Ac cording to a pending lawsuit in Geor gia, FmHA is taking the position that  it does not have the responsibility to  grant deferrals even through it may  find that the farmer's inability to pay  is due  to circumstances beyond his  control and that if he did pay it would  unduly impair his standard of living.  FmHA is also  taking the position in  this case that it has no obligation to  inform borrowers about the servicing  remedies provided by the Agricultural  Credit Adjustment Act of 1978. By this  embarrassing position, FmHA is free  to consider, or not consider, a borrow er's deferral eligibility behind closed  doors. The borrower not only will not  be involved in any way, but he or she  will not even necessarily know  that  the deferral relief exists. That is not  what Congress intended by the 1978  law, and that is not what the Constitu tion intended under due process. Pro grams are not passed by Congress to  be put in a desk drawer.  We want, with the introduction of  this bill, to keep the momentum going  which was generated by the recent Ag riculture Subcommittee on Conserva tion, Credit, and Rural Development  hearings regarding FmHA credit poli cies, and to let FmHA know that Con gress expects them to do everything  possible to keep those farmers in oper ation who are good managers and who  are temporarily unable to make pay ments due to economic circumstances  beyond their control. If we do not act  now, if FmHA does not stop its subtle  and not-so-subtle pressuring of farm ers  into  liquidation-by acceleration  notices, by suggestions  that farmers  sell off land and equipment, by refus ing credit-we will not have a family  farm system any more. There has been  for years a  trend toward bigger and  bigger farms. In addition, the average  age of farmers is 59. If you combine  those facts with the current situation  of large numbers of farmers  leaving  agriculture-many of  them younger  farmers-not only we will not have a  family farm system anymore but we  will not even have a sufficient number  of qualified farmers. Farming is an ex tremely  complex profession and we  must plan for the future-we cannot  turn out farmers with a 6-month train ing course as though they were com puter operators.  I mentioned earlier in this statement  that the House Agriculture Subcom mittee on Conservation, Credit, and  Rural  Development  recently  held  hearings on FmHA credit policies and  programs. It was one of the more frus trating experiences of my congression al career to try to pull out of USDA  officials the true story of how many  farmers are being forced out of busi ness. Someone who had attended the  hearing wrote me and said he appreci ated the diligence with which the sub committee members tried to ""piece to gether"" what is happening to farmers  across the Nation. ""Piece together"" is  exactly what we are being forced to do  because  of  lack  of  cooperation  by  USDA, and frankly, an unwillingness  on the part of USDA to publicly ac knowledge the serious situation facing  farmers. Undersecretary of Agricul ture Frank Naylor, in response to writ ten questions by Chairman En JONES  again evaded the questions regarding  numbers of delinquencies, voluntary  and  involuntary  liquidations by pro viding only partial answers. You can  be certain that I will not, and other  Members of Congress who are inter ested in agriculture will not, stop in  our efforts to get the total picture of  what is happening to American farm ers.  H.R. 5666  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That sec tion 331A of  the Consolidated Farm and  Rural Development Act is amended by< 1) inserting the designation ""(a)"" before  the text thereof, striking out ""section"" and  inserting in lieu thereof ""subsection""; and  <2> adding at the end thereof a new sub section (b) as follows:  ""(b) During the period beginning with the  enactment of  this subsection and ending  September 30,  1983,  the Secretary  shall  permit, at the request of the borrower, the  deferral of principal and  interest on any  outstanding loan made, insured, or held by  the Secretary for farm ownership purposes  under subtitle A,  farm operating purposes  under subtitle B, disaster emergency pur poses under subtitle C, or economic emer gency purposes under the Emergency Agri cultural Credit Adjustment Act of 1978, and  shall  forgo  foreclosure of any such  loan  upon a showing by the borrower that he or  she has demonstrated good management  practices and  that due  to  circumstances  beyond the borrower's control, the borrower  is  temporarily unable to continue making  payment on  such principal  and  interest  then due without unduly  impairing  the  standard or living of the borrower. The Sec retary  shall  permit  interest  that would  accrue during  the deferral period on any  loan deferred under this subsection to bear  no  interest during of after such period.""

14,Senate,97,-0.383,109,3,Mr. TSONGAS.," Mr.  President,  I  fully support the efforts of my col league from Massachusetts to send the  administration and the Chilean Gov ernment  a  clear message  that  the  United States will not accept Chile's  continuing disregard for basic human  rights.  I,  too, am deeply concerned  that  the Reagan administration  in tends  to  reverse our policy  toward  Chile by developing a closer relation ship with  the Pinochet regime. The  nomination of James Theberge as U.S.  Ambassador to Chile is a clear symbol  of the administration's changing per ception of the Chilean regime and I  am compelled to vote against his nomi nation.  The military regime in Chile has a  long, well-documented record of delib erate and grievous human rights viola tions. The U.N. and numerous interna tionally  recognized  human  rights  groups such as Amnesty International  and Freedom House  have  reported  that  the human  rights situation  in  Chile continues to deteriorate. Among  the rising tide of arbitrary detentions  in Chile were the arrests of members  of the Chilean Human Rights Com mission last December.  In its human rights report  to  the  Congress, the State Department further listed a number of human rights  violations  in  Chile.  For  example,  during 1981, at least 68  incidents of  torture were reported to human rights  organizations and most were allegedly  perpetrated by members of  the Na tional Information Center <CND or ci vilian police.  Although  the  last  reported disap pearances occurred in 1977, about 635  cases from the period 1973-77 remain  unresolved. Amnesty International be lieves this figure is higher. Despite the  fact that the Chilean Supreme Court  appointed special judges in 1979 to in vestigate many of  these  disappear ances,  the State Department reports  that to date no one has been formally  indicted. In addition while the Chilean  Government has denied holding politi cal prisoners, there are more than 218  persons in the judicial process charged  with seditious activity.  Mr. President, the list of incidents  involving human rights violations  in  Chile could go on. It is obvious that  the oppressive nature of the Pinochet  regime necessitates that our Ambassa dor to Chile be constantly vigilant and  sensitive to the issue of human rights  in that beleaguered country. By his  testimony  during  his  confirmation  hearings, Mr. Theberge failed to con vince me that he would be such an  Ambassador. His responses to Senator  KENNEDY'S questions were clearly in adequate and demonstrated a marked  insensitivity  to  the  vital  issue  of  human rights. For instance, he stated  that ""there has been a significant im provement in the human rights situa tion in Chile since 1977."" This state ment, however, ignores the significant  continuing pattern of human rights  abuses in Chile today.  That  the  administration  would  nominate Mr. Theberge as Ambassa dor to Chile is a clear testimony of its  failure  to  show  sufficient  concern  about the human rights violations and  oppressive practices of the Pinochet  government.

23,Senate,97,0.433,148,3,Mr. HAYAKAWA.," Mr.  President,  the February 1982 issue of Consumer  Reports contains an article relating to  agricultural marketing orders. The ar ticle is off-base and best ignored. How ever, I have received a letter from the  National Council of Farmer Coopera tives in response to the article which  deserves  the  attention  of my  col leagues.  As with a recent piece shown on the  TV show ""60 Minutes,"" Consumer Re ports has attempted, by slanting the  facts,  speaking  in  generalities,  and  misrepresenting the nature and intent  of marketing orders to create a story.  In my mind, the story to be told is  one of successful industry self-regula tion and promotion. This activity has  brought  the American  consumer  a  plentiful supply of high quality and  low-cost produce. Maintaining a plenti ful  supply  of  agricultural  produce  while maintaining  agricultural  in comes at a level which provides for a  healthy farm sector is most difficult.  Government is called on continually to  stabilize the agricultural marketplace;  we have responded primarily through  legislation.  Our most  recent effort,  the 1981  farm bill, will cost the American tax payers $11  billion over  the next 4  years, only 2 percent of which will go  to my home State of California. When  placed alongside the programs of the  farm bill, fruit and vegetable market ing orders show themselves to bester ling examples of market-oriented self regulation with no cost to the Govern ment and tremendous benefit to the  consumer.  Understandably, the National Coun cil of Farmer Cooperatives has taken  offense at the media misrepresenta tions of marketing orders. I bring your  attention to their response. And final ly, I wish to commend the council for  taking the time to set Consumer Re ports straight.  The letter follows:  NATIONAL COUNCIL OF  FARMER COOPERATIVES,  Washington, D.C., February 22, 1982.  IRWIN LANDAU,  Editor, Consumer Reports,  Mount Vernon, N. Y.  DEAR MR. LANDAU: Your February 1982 ar ticle, ""What's a Marketing Order?"" correct ly noted that the Secretary of Agriculture,  who  is  legally charged with  representing  long-term consumers'  interests, must ap prove every action of marketing order com mittees. However, you failed  to follow up  and  explore  in depth  this most  critical  aspect of  these programs-namely,  their  role in assuring American consumers of a re liable, high-quality,  relatively  inexpensive  source of food over a long period of time.  Congress enacted  the Agricultural Mar keting Agreement Act of 1937 with just that  purpose in mind. Protecting farmers against  the wild, extreme price fluctuations which  are so unique to agriculture has been con sistently viewed by Congress as  the best  means of maintaining the small business, so called ""family farm"", operation which has  provided our nation with the world's most  generous,  dependable  and  least  costly  sources of food.  The urgent need for governmental steps  to help farmers achieve more orderly mar kets and more stable prices, in the U.S. as in  all the world's industrial nations, grows out  of the little understood nature of the food  production-marketing  system. Volume  of  output cannot be controlled by the farmer,  as in industrial factories, not only because  of highly variable weather but also because  in the American system hundreds of thou sands of production decisions are made by  independent farmers in a fashion which is  essentially uncoordinated if government as sumes no role.  But  the central problem which  results  from unpredictable food output arises from  the fact that, beyond a certain level, people  have little need, or ""demand"", for additional  food. As a result, even a modest ""oversup ply"" causes a sharp drop in price for the  farmers' product. In a  totally unrestricted  market, the farmer who grows 20 percent  more  than normal,  in a year when  total  supply is also 20 percent above the normal  market need, usually finds his gross return  decreased by as much as 20% <sometimes  more)-an  ironic negative  reward  for his  good performance and his contribution to  the national welfare.  Any comparison of farmers' incomes with  others who contribute as much effort, cap ital investment, managerial talent and high  risk, has long demonstrated that most farm ers are substantially under-compensated in  terms of monetary benefits.  In many  in stances, farmers' rewards come largely from  their sense of independence, dedication to  the land and the satisfaction of being a part  of nature's most elemental processes. Many  farmers have little margin of profit to with stand the instability which arises from a to tally ""free"" market environment. The chal lenge our government has faced for decades  is to develop balanced programs which will  give farmers some limited protection against  such disasters not of  their own making,  while striving to maintain the tremendous  productive benefits which result from our  market-oriented system of strong individual  incentives and independence.  The proper balance between unrestricted  freedom  for our  food producers and  the  type and amount of government  involve ment which  is necessary  to maintain our  system by protecting farmers from econom",1982

25,Senate,97,-0.322,174,3,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, Arkan sas honors one of  its finest citizens  today  as our State  celebrates Lily  Peter's Day. This remarkable woman farmer,  businesswoman,  author and  poet, patron of the arts, and a strong  supporter of the political process-is  being feted by a Helena, Ark., celebra tion which includes a banquet, recep tion,  and  symphony orchestra per formance.  A number of newspapers in the mid South  area  have  recognized  Lily  Peter's contributions to our State and  I  submit  those  tributes  for  the  RECORD.  to JOm  Mr. President,  I want  the  scores of people all across Arkansas  and the Nation who pay tribute to this  great American. This tribute is most  deserved and long overdue. We in Ar kansas are better for having had Lily  Peter in our midst.  The tributes follow:  [From the Helena World, Feb. 21, 19821  MISS LILY-GENEROUS, GRACIOUS, SMART  <By Dave Farnham, Editor>  <Phi-lan'-thro-pist 1. Someone with an in clination to increase the well-being of man kind, as by charitable aid or donations. 2. A  person who  loves mankind  in general. 3.  One whose actions are designated to pro mote human welfare.>  Her surroundings are  simple, practical,  and, she admits, a little cluttered.  There are books everywhere, on shelves  and spilling over and up the backs of living  room furniture.  There are pictures of family and friends,  and even a few of herself, on most of the  walls  and  lined up on  tables and desks  where she greets her many visitors.  The home would fit easily and without  fanfare  into  a middleclass neighborhood  and the trees and bushes and hedges that  almost hide  the home from passersby on  Connell's Point  road are  far  from mani cured.  It is apparent, in fact, that neither inside  or outside has there been any enthusiastic  effort  to  expose  to  the unknowing  the  wealth or the status of the persons inside.  The trappings of the rich, the need to dis play one's material acquisitions, are clearly  unnecessary. They would be an intrusion, a  shameful distraction.  And it all seems perfectly right, as though  it should be no other way, because any pre occupation with ""things"" would be a sad de traction from what Miss Lily Peter  truly  represent.  Take note of some of the facets of life  that are most important to Miss Lily:  the  continuous, unhampered, and relentless use  and reuse of her own mind; the desire to see  that as many of those with talent are able  to pursue their vocations without financial  concern; and bringing  the excitement of  fine literature, music and art to the notice  of people throughout Arkansas, but most es pecially  to her neighbors  in Monroe and  Phillips counties.  It is  the quickness, depth, and scope of  Miss Lily's mind that grab you almost im mediately.  She speaks at a fast pace, as though fear ful  somehow  that she will be unable  to  unveil all the thoughts and ideas that are  rushing about in her head. She leaps from  one subject to another, a line from a poem  <one of her many own published works or  that of another author> can be  triggered  into her awesome memory by the most in nocuous of discussions.  It is putting pen to paper, transforming  the vast storehouse of knowledge and un derstanding that she possesses into a wick edly clever or winsomely beautiful poem, at  which Miss Lily is most skilled.  She has written three books: ""The Green  Linen of Summer"", a series of short poems;  ""The Great Riding"", an epic poem dedicated  to Hernando DeSoto, the Spanish explorer,  stories about whom captured Miss Lily's at tention and her youthful, romantic heart at  the age of seven; and ""The Sea Dream of  the Mississippi"", a short history of the Jo liett-Marquette expedition she wrote in con junction with the 1973 re-enactment of that  southward  exploration  of  the  ""Great  River.""  THE GREEN LINEN OF SUMMER  ""I wrap my thoughts in the green linen of  summer  Against the terror of the dragon wind  And pray that the linen may not too soon  be thread bare.  Its texture thinned  For by and by I know will come November  With its wintry blast  And what is  there to keep body and soul  from freezing  If the linens do not last?""  Seven other manuscripts await publishing.  They are ""The Mad Queen"", a poetic trib ute to Miss Lily's fascination with mathe matics; ""News from Camelot"", ""Delta Coun try"", ""Earth Shadow"", ""Sunlight on an Old  Rail Fence"",  ""Panels of Antiphon"",  and  ""Johnny-Jump-Ups and Joe-Pye-Weed.""  But Miss Lily is as great a lover of music  as she is a respected author of both poetry  and prose. This great passion for music has  been intensfied, perhaps, because Miss Lily  was  denied  the  childhood  training  that  probably would have made her an accom plished musician. It is obvious that she feels  that was a personal loss.  ""As a performer of music i am zero,"" she  says. ""In the backwoods of Arkansas <where  she grew up) there were no music teachers.  If you have a great voice you can wait but  for  the piano or a string instrument you  must start very young. I only saw one piano  <an aunt's) until the time I was twelve.""

26,,97,-0.526,213,3,Mr. MITCHELL of Maryland.," Mr.  Speaker, I am very proud that I can  share a bit of faith in the continuation  of human kindness and concern for  others with my colleagues. The follow ing is  the story of Willie and Helen  McCray. This couple has reared, com pletely and partially, 22 children, in cluding 3 of their own. I believe that  the deeds of this outstanding family  lend credence and pride  to  the con cepts and continuation of family love,  giving,  sharing,  and caring. As our  economy and  insensitive policies dic tate that our families must lean more  and more on each other, stories such  as the following lend hope to the con tention that this institution will not  fail us.  A HUMAN INTEREST STORY  <Submitted by Willie and Helen McCray,  Sr.)  This  story  is based on  a  couple who  fought  the odds and proved  the experts  wrong in their complete and partial raising  of twenty-two children  including three of  their own. This story is presented by Willie  and Helen McCray, Sr. Any names men tioned in this story may be fictitious:  It all started in late December, 1957 when  I,  then a Baltimore City Policeman, was  walking a beat in west Baltimore. I noticed a  little girl gathering food from various trash  cans. I asked her why she was getting food  from the cans. She very shyly responded by  saying ""to help feed my brother and sis ters.""  The child was 12 or 13 years of age.  I  called  the  late  Policewoman Lt. Violet  Whyte and asked her if I could take the  little girl home with me. She stated that she  would have to investigate the matter which  was a procedure. That night when I went  home, I explained the matter to my wife,  Helen. We  immediately decided  that we  were going to start helping children.  In the middle of January, 1958, a repre sentative  from  the Department of Social  Services had a very long interview with us,  warning us about the problems we faced in  trying to raise other people's children. The  problems  included different personalities,  health, mental, and above all interference  from  the children's natural parents. But,  2907  she complimented us for having the idea of  wanting to help. She also pointed out that  there would be a very slight subsidy coming  in each month to assist with the expenses.  My wife stated that our love for children  would supersede any options that may con front us; the children would be like our own  <at that time we had two small boys 5 and 2  years of age).  In the middle of February, 1958, Helen  called me and said, ""Guess what? We have  two little girls, 10 and 13 years old!"" I was so  excited that I came home early. After meet ing the girls, I did what I didn't realize that  I would be doing for the next 18 years and  19 more children. First, I would question  the kids about what they liked most, then, I  would attempt  to find out as much as  I  could about  their past. We would all be  seated around the table with our own chil dren and Helen and I pointed out to them  that they were all our children. No one was  better or worst than the other; there would  be no foster parents, sisters or brothers in  this home, we will be parents, brothers and  sisters.  The first two kids were natural sisters and  at the time we got right down to business of  preparing  them  for  school. Again,  I  did  what I would be doing for the next 18 years.  In each case the clothing that came with  the kids were no good and Helen  threw  them out which meant that I would have to  give her money to buy new clothing.  We always shared our pride, therefore, we  would also up to this day, when our kids  walked out of our house,  they  became  models to most of the neighboring children.  Helen and I were married 10 years before  she was able to give birth to our first child,  a boy, who at one years of age became na tionally known as the first Carnation Milk  Baby Winner. The next was also a boy who  eventually became a very popular football  player. We were very hungry for a daugh ter. In September, 1958 we had a little girl,  <now an employee at the Gas and Electric  Company). When Alice was born,  the 10  year old girl became very  jealous because  she wanted to remain the baby girl. The 13  year old became so attached to the baby  that the public thought the baby was hers.  In June 1961, we received a  third child,  again 13 years of age and a sister of the  other two girls. Can you imagine, within a  period of three years, we now had two boys  and four girls?  The older girls were very smart in school  and church. Helen showed a perfect exam ple as a leader playing games, taking them  to different affairs, and even playing bobby  jacks with them. The girls soon organized a  singing trio in church and a dancing trio.  We were very careful in bringing them up  to  try and keep  them from going astray.  The neighbors  charged us  as being  too  strict, but we meant we were going to set an  example for these kids.  One year before the first two girls grad uated from high school, we met for the first  time their natural mother, who then wanted  the children to come back to her home after  their graduation, in order to help her. We  had a conference with  the girls and they  stated that they were finished eating from  trash cans and naturally  they wanted  to  continue staying at home with us.  There were a  lot of tremendous, serious  illnesses among the older girls, one in par ticular was almost the victim of having to  wear side bags the rest of her life and would  never bear children if Helen had not made a  dramatic stand against the doctor's wishes.  Today this girl has two wonderful boys. The  ",1982

Last month Consumer Reports of fered  its views on marketing orders,  and Mr. Robert N. Hampton,  vice  president for marketing and interna tional  trade,  National  Council  of  Farmer Cooperatives,  rebutted  those  comments in a letter to the editor of  the magazine.  The National Council of Farmer Co operatives has, in my view, presented  an often-overlooked argument on the  benefits provided  the  consumer by  marketing orders, and I should like to  take this opportunity to share those  views with my colleagues.  NATIONAL COUNCIL OF  FARMER COOPERATIVES,  Washington, D.C. February 22, 1982.  IRWIN LANDAU,  Editor,  Consumer  Reports,  Street, Mount Vernon, N. Y.  Washington  DEAR MR.

Many  different  pro grams have been developed, adjusted, some times discarded, for different commodities  and at different  times  and places. The  ""farm problem"", like other economic dilem mas, is always with us.  Marketing orders, which are a central ele ment of government's tools to bring a desir able measure of market stability in order to  assist dairy, fruit, vegetable and other spe cialty crop producers, have a long record of  serving the public as well as farmers' inter ests. Your statement that the public inter est is not represented in the design and ad ministration of marketing orders is not cor rect. The U.S. Department of Agriculture  has been clearly charged since the time of  President Lincoln with  representing  the  public as well as farmers' interests. Indeed,  many  farmers  in  recent  years have  ex pressed  increasing  concern  that USDA  sometimes has such strong concern for con sumer issues that it fails to give due weight  to farmers' needs.

28,,97,0.413,239,3,Mr. HILER.," Mr. Speaker, in recent  months,  the House Committee  on  Ways and Means has held ""field hear ings"" for the purpose of investigating  the effects of the budget reductions. I  attended the hearing that was held in  Indianapolis and it struck me that the  committee's education was not com plete; that is,  the committee did not  have the advantage of testimony from  those who have seen the waste and  abuse  that permeate our  country's  public welfare system.  As a means of correcting this short coming, I am pleased to submit for the  RECORD the text of a letter from Miss  Elizabeth Samkowski to the Honora ble DAN ROSTENKOWSKI. Miss Sam kowski  is  director  of  the Marion  County,  Ind., Department of Public  Welfare, which services the Indianapo lis metropolitan area. Her comments  are very revealing, and I am confident  that my colleagues on the Ways and  Means Committee and all House Mem bers will want to take careful note of  this insider's view of public welfare.  TEXT OF THE LETrER FROM MISS SAMKOWSKI  TO HONORABLE DAN ROSTENKOWSKI  I  recently attended  the Hearing of  the  House Ways and Means Committee in Indi anapolis. As director of the largest welfare  department  in  the state, with an annual  budget of $41 million, in addition to dispens ing over $45 million  in  food stamps  last  year, I feel qualified to make a few observa tions about our welfare programs. Even  more significant, after talking with dozens  of our caseworkers who are  in  the front  ranks, I discovered that most of them share  my views. There has been a  significant  change in the attitude of caseworkers re garding welfare  in  the  past  few  years.  Almost without exception, they are in favor  of the administration's attempt to cut back  entitlement programs, and their only criti cism is that we have not gone far enough.  The most recent changes in AFDC result ed  in about  twelve percent of our cases  being discontinued, with a dollar reduction  of less than seven percent. Those families  who were discontinued were ones in which  the recipients were employed, or there was a  substantial  income  from  other  sources  which had previously been disregarded  in  determining  eligibility. Many  employed  mothers who were receiving AFDC immedi ately quit their jobs or chose to work less  hours so they could continue to get welfare.  There is something inherently wrong with a  system which allows individuals to have a  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  choice between living off welfare or support ing themselves.  Our caseworkers are seeing AFDC moth ers who are not working simply because  they have children under six years of age.  They are living a comfortable life with not  only a monthly welfare check, but a pletho ra of additional benefits which are not avail able to the ordinary taxpaying citizen: free  Food Stamps, free comprehensive medical  services, including transportation, free child  care, government subsidized housing,  low  energy assistance, free school lunches, and  free legal services. Our employees are not so  fortunate. Many of them are finding it nec essary to work a second job just to meet in creasing expenses. Our caseworkers return  to work following maternal leave as quickly  as the doctor will release them; they cannot  afford  to stay home until  their children  reach  six.  I  have heard  them say  they  cannot afford to have more than one or two  children, yet they are working with AFDC  mothers who get a ""bonus"" for each addi tional child.  Most Americans are willing to help fami lies who are totaly unable  to provide for  themselves. However, welfare has become a  way of life for too many people who have no  initiative  to do anything except wait for  their monthly welfare check. This attitude  was dramatically exemplified in a recent in cident  involving one of our caseworkers.  During a home visit, a small child asked her  recipient mother who the caseworker was.  The mother replied, ""Oh, that lady is my  caseworker. When you grow up, you will  have one,  too.""  I  submit  this  is not  the  American way and is a sad commentary on  our society. Rather than encouraging fami lies to be independent, our system has re sulted in the welfare rolls increasing at an  alarming rate. Too many AFDC families are  far better off  financially  than  the  two parent working  family who  is supporting  themselves  and paying  taxes  to  support  those who prefer a different way of life.  I enthusiastically endorse the administra tion's proposal to return to the States the  administration and control of entitlement  programs. Who knows better than the local  citizenry who are the truly needy persons in  a community? States and local governments  can do a far better job of defining priorities  and targeting areas of needs than a pater nalistic government working  through  the  morass of rules and regulations established  by a bloated bureaucracy  that  is out of  touch with realities of a program. The re duction in administrative overhead would in  itself be significant.  Our present system of public welfare has  fostered illegitimacy, dependency, erosion of  family strengths, and perpetuated a class of  non-productive citizens who have no inter est or motivation for altering their way of  life. It is time for a change.e  REFORMING THE PRESENT U.S.  CRIMINAL CODE  HON. F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 2, 1982  e ",1982
29,,97,0.646,239,3,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.,"  Mr.  Speaker, today, I, along with the other  two Republican members of the Sub committee on Criminal Justice, intro duced legislation to reform the present  U.S. Criminal Code.  2933  This bill, with the exception of the  habeas corpus provisions, is presently  being considered by the Subcommittee  on Criminal Justice as an amendment  in the nature of a substitute.  This  legislation, while  similar  in  some  respects  to H.R.  1647, which  passed the House Judiciary Committee  last year, is different in 18 major re spects.  The differences are as follows:  EXPLANATION OF THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN H.R. 1647 AND H.R. 5679  I 1) DEATH PENALTY  The amendment contains a  chapter 38  which provides a constitutional mechanism  for  imposition of the death penalty. The  chapter is patterned to some extent upon S.  114 <DeConcini> which has been the subject  of extensive hearings in the Senate. It lists  four  capital offenses: murder,  espionage,  treason, and aircraft piracy in which death  results, all of which are capital offenses  under current  law. The chapter provides  that a sentencing hearing will be held upon  conviction for a capital offense which seeks  to determine the existence of aggravating or  mitigating  circumstances which warrant  more or less serious punishment.  12) EXTORTION (SEC. 2522!  The  amendment overrules  v.  Enmons decision to the extent that the ex tortionate conduct referred to in that case  constitutes a state or federal felony punish able by an imprisonment penalty of two or  more years. It is based upon legislation pro posed by Mr. Hall during  this Congress.  H.R. 1647 maintains Enmons.  I 3) GOVERNMENT APPEAL OF SENTENCE  In chapter 41, H.R. 1647 provides for de fendant-only  appeal  of  sentence.  The  amendment would provide the government  with a similar right if the trial judge's sen tence falls below that provided for in the  sentencing  guidelines.  The  government  would, however, have a shorter time to file  notice of appeal.  the U.S.  14lPAROLE  The amendment would phase out parole  five years from the effective date of the sen tencing guidelines  except  for  those who  were sentenced under the old system.  15) FACILITATION  The amendment contans a facilitation sec tion <Sec. 505> which punishes those who  provide substantial assistance for the com mission of specifically designated serious of fenses.  16) SOLICITATION  The amendment contains a  solicitation  section <Sec. 1103) which applies  to those  who encourage the commission of specifical ly designated serious offenses.

30,,97,-0.385,252,3,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing legislation to designate  certain public  lands of outstanding  natural and scenic value in Michigan  as part of the national wilderness pres ervation system. These lands, located  in the Manistee, Ottawa, and Hiawa tha National Forests, possess excep tional  natural  characteristics  and  great wilderness value which should  be preserved as an enduring resource  for the benefit and use of the people  of Michigan and the United States.  In a State of over 36 million acres of  land, less than three-tenths of 1 per cent would be designated wilderness  by the Michigan Wilderness Heritage  Act of 1982. In every instance bound aries were drawn to exclude private in holdings to the maximum extent pos sible. Six of the areas contain no pri vate  inholdings at all.  It should be  noted that there is currently no con gressionally mandated wilderness  in  the State.  The areas to be designated wilder ness by this legislation contain many  superb  national  treasures  including  lakeshores, wetlands, and some of the  only remaining stands or virgin white  pine in the State. They are Nordhouse  Dunes Wilderness on the Lake Michi gan shoreline; Sturgeon River Gorge  Wilderness;  Sylvania  Wilderness,  which is a popular area for canoeists;  Carp River Wilderness; Horseshoe Bay  Wilderness which stretches along sev eral miles of undeveloped Lake Huron  shoreline; Government Island Wilder ness; Round  Island Wilderness; Big  Island Lake Wilderness; Delirium Wil derness; and the McCormick Wilder ness. Among the many other fine f ea tures of these areas can be found bald  eagle,  rare and  insect-eating plants,  granite-rimmed lakes, wild rivers, and  a waterfall. Not only do  these areas  provide excellent recreational oppor tunities for  the naturalist and back packer, but they also serve as an im portant  resource  for  teachers  and  schoolchildren.  I want to stress that powerboat use  is permitted in areas designated as wil derness where it has occurred in the  past. The 1964 Wilderness Act also  permits hunting,  fishing,  and  trapEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ping. Fire control activities and insect  and disease control procedures are al lowable as well.  The RARE II recommendation proc ess has been completed  in Michigan  since 1979. It is  imperative  that the  continued uncertainty over the status  of these lands be resolved and those  national forest system lands which are  not designated wilderness made avail able for other appropriate use.  The  inclusion  of  these  areas  of  Michigan  in  the national wilderness  preservation system will do more than  simply preserve the wilderness charac ter of the land. It will protect water sheds and wildlife habitat and provide  a permanent resource for scientific re search and primitive recreation. I urge  my colleagues to support this legisla tion.

31,,97,-0.274,252,3,Mr. LONG of Maryland.," Mr. Speak er, I would like to share with you a  tribute to the late Malcolm Moos, a  friend and colleague, as it appeared in  the Baltimore Sun, February 12, 1982.  POLITICS AND THE PROFESSOR; A TRIBUTE TO  MALCOLM Moos  <By Stephen Hess)  WASHINGTON.-Malcolm Moos liked to tell  about a  time in the 1940 presidential cam paign when  he  and Hubert Humphrey,  young instructors at the University of Min nesota, agreed to a 30-minute debate on the  campus radio station. They flipped a coin to  see who would speak first. Mr. Humphrey  won and spoke for 27 minutes.  ""After that catastrophe at the hands of a  demolition expert,"" Mr. Moos would  then  add, ""I sought refuge in the calm waters of  academic life for the next 18 years.  But when I  first heard this story in the  early 1950s, Mr. Moos was combining his  duties as professor of political science at  Johns Hopkins with a  less spiritual life as  city chairman of the Republican Party in  Baltimore.  He  saw  nothing  incongruous  about  a  morning spent in research on what would be  a major history of  the Republican Party  and an afternoon of dealing with a charac ter called ""Bad Check Shorty"" in the fourth  ward.  This blending of theory and practice tells  much about the strengths and contributions  of Mac Moos, my friend and mentor. who  died last month at the age of 65.  Politics came naturally, perhaps genetical ly, to Mac. His father had managed 11 state  campaigns in Minnesota and was rewarded  with the postmastership of St. Paul.  I once asked Charley Moos why he never  ran for elective office. He answered:  ""Yes. I  thought about running for mayor:  I was pretty well known in that my name  had been on every post box in the city for  13 years. But whenever  got  the urge.  read  the telephone directory.

34,House,97,-0.494,408,3,Mr. YATES.," Mr. Speaker, the guar anteed student loan program is run ning out of money. It will all be gone  by April. It will have to be replaced be cause  it  is an entitlement program.  Last September,  the House Labor HHS Appropriations Subcommittee in dicated the funds it had made avail able were inadequate. The Reagan ad ministration has recently sent to the  Congress a budget  request  for $978  million.  Mr. Speaker, that amount of money  is another example of the usual warm,  sympathetic,  consideration  the  Reagan administration has shown for  the Nation's social programs. Making  $978 million available is like throwing  a  15-foot  rope  to students who are  drowning 20 feet away. It just is not  enough money to take care of student  loan needs for the balance of the year.  It is about $300 million short. Accord ingly, I am today filing an urgent sup plemental appropriation bill for $1,287  million, which is the amount needed  to maintain the GSL program at the  same operational  level presently au thorized by law.  The administration bases the differ ence  in amounts on terminating the  GSL program  for doctoral students.  The Reagan administration would end  all GSL loans to doctoral students-to  prospective physicians, to scientists, to  Ph. D's, to  lawyers,  to biologists,  to  specialists  in all  the scientific disci plines.  It would close the door to Govern ment assistance to doctoral students at  a time when they most need help-as  they  reach  the  final  stage of  their  career.  It is another example of depriving  students who need help most of the  opportunity to obtain such help. They  could not afford to go to private finan cial sources for  loans. Only the rich  and well-to-do could continue their ca reers toward their doctors degrees.  Such an unfortunate action would  deprive our Nation of the well-educat ed store of necessary personnel our  Nation will need for the future.  In addition to hurting the students,  Mr. Speaker, it would hurt the private  colleges and universities. Enrollments  would drop dramatically, leaving such  institutions in strained circumstances,  and placing undue  loads upon  the  public colleges and universities.  The Reagan administration's thesis  is  ill conceived, Mr. Speaker. I  trust  the Congress will keep the door of op portunity open to all Americans espe cially those who desperately need this  Government assistance.  DON  HAYWORTH'S  LONG  RECORD  OF  DEDICATED  PUBLIC SERVICE  <Mr. KILDEE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1982
35,House,97,-0.385,408,3,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  a sense of personal loss that I bring to  the attention of my colleagues  the  recent passing away of the Honorable  Don Hayworth, a former Member of  the House  of Representatives who  built  an  impressive  record  of  long  years of devoted public service. Mr.  Hayworth, who was 84, was a Member  of Congress in 1955 and 1956, and had  lived the last several years in Wash ington, D.C. He was an honored active  member of  the Former Members of  Congress, and a close personal friend  of mine of long years standing. I had  often benefited from his advice and  counsel since coming to Congress.  Mr Hayworth  represented  the old  Sixth District of Michigan when it in cluded Flint, which now is in the Sev enth District which I am honored to  represent. He was a dominant figure in  Flint area Democratic politics in the  1950's and early 1960's, when I  first  met him and had the opportunity to  work with him on his campaigns.  Mr. Hayworth was born in Toledo,  Iowa, and attended Grinnell College.  He received a master's degree in inter national relations from the University  of Chicago and a doctorate in speech  from the University of Wisconsin. He  headed  the  speech  department  at  Michigan State University from 1937  to 1942 after holding similar positions  at Penn College in Iowa and the Uni versity of Akron.  In  1942 Mr. Hayworth  came  to  Washington, D.C., to head the Victory  Speakers Bureau with  the wartime  Office of Civil Defense. He had earlier  created and headed a similar bureau  for the Michigan Office of Civil De fense. He then was liaison officer with  the States on fuel conservation with  the Department of the Interior. He re turned to Michigan State University in  1944 and again after his one term in  the Congress. In 1963 Mr. Hayworth  returned  to Washington, D.C., as a  consultant to the Department of Agri culture, and he was a member of the  1965-66 task force which set up medi care in the Social Security Administra tion. He retired from the Social Secu rity Administration in 1967, but he re mained active and retained his interest  in  domestic  and  foreign  issues.  In  recent years he traveled to mainland  China and to the Soviet Union, and he  was writing  a  book  on  philosophy  when he passed away.  REAGANOMICS  CLEARLY  A  FACTOR  IN CLOSING OF GEN ERAL TIRE'S AKRON PLANT  <Mr. SEIBERLING asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks, and to include extraneous  matter.)  ",1982
36,House,97,-0.496,408,3,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr.  Speaker,  early on Monday morning  I  got a  phone call from the president of the  General Tire & Rubber Co. giving me  the sad news that the company was  closing  its only  tire plant  in Akron  with a loss of 1,200 jobs.  Two years ago,  the company was  talking about building a new tire plant  in Akron. I suggest that Reaganomics  has something to do with this situa tion. Let me repeat:  Two years ago, General Tire was  planning  to  build  a  new  plant  in  Akron. This week  they  announced  they are closing  the one  they have  there.  That plant, with its 1,200 employees  and their families, is but another one  of the tragedies that President Rea gan's crazy,  upside  down,  so-called  supply-side economics,  including  last  year's egregiously wasteful and  irre sponsible  tax bill and high defense  spending, are inflicting upon our com munities  in Ohio,  as well  in other  States of this Nation.

37,House,97,-0.448,421,3,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker,  the  United States is still dangerously de pendent upon foreign sources for its  oil. Today we import some 5 million  barrels each day, about one-third of  our  total national consumption. To  compound the problem, our major free  market industrial partners, Japan and  the nations of Western Europe are  even more dependent on foreign oil  than we are. Any interruption in oil  imports would cause major economic  and national security problems. The  situation is made even more serious by  the fact that much of our imported oil  comes from highly volatile and unsta ble  areas;  for  example, we  depend  upon the Persian Gulf countries for  over 1 million barrels a day. In the  event of an interruption in oil imports  our position would be even more pre carious  because  of  our  agreement  under  the  International  Energy  Agency <IEA) to assist Japan and the  nations of Western Europe.  Simply put, it is  inconceivable that  this Nation, knowing what  it knows  about its vulnerability, should fail to  plan ahead to prepare as fully as possi ble to meet a potential crisis.  NEED FOR S. 1503  The Congress provided the President  with the authority he needed to pre pare contingency plans  for meeting  the kind of crisis  that could  result  from a restriction or cut off of foreign  oil supplies, but  that authority has  lapsed. In the opinion of  the Presi dent's own Justice Department there  are no other comprehensive authori ties in existence at this time that are  adequate to meet the challenge.  The Defense Production Act would  only protect the military.  The IEA would only protect interna tional allocation and could actually  result in increasing our domestic vul nerability.  The  strategic  petroleum  reserve  would, as of today, cover only 40 days  of imports.  S. 1503 provides the missing link of  authority that will enable us to forge a  strong chain of national preparedness.  Under S.  1503: The President  is  given  the authority  to protect  the  American economy and the consumer  by limiting skyrocketing market prices  and making sure such markets are  served,  the President's authority  is  limited to control of the price and allo cation of oil and could only be exer cised in the event of a severe disrup tion in the supply of petroleum in the  United States, and the President's au thority  is  subject  to  congressional  review and  is  limited in duration to  150 days.  KEY PROVISIONS OF S. 1503  There are a number of  important  provisions of this bill that deserve dis cussion at this time.  Consumer  petroleum  inventories:  The conferees adopted an amendment  to protect consumer petroleum inven tories. The provision was intended to  exempt from allocation  those stocks  owned by, and in the direct possession  of, an end user for his own use prior to  the  declaration  of  the  emergency.  Thus, the end user must own the pe troleum, must have it stored on site,  and must  plan  to  use  it  himself;  exempt stocks may not be resold. The  language would only protect stocks of  refined petroleum product and residu al fuel oil. It would not protect crude  oil nor would it protect stocks of any  product held  for processing  into  refined  petroleum products. Refinery,  separator,  processor  or  marketer  stocks are not protected unless solely  and explicitly held-prior to the decla ration of an emergency-for the fuel  operations of the holder, and not for  any purposes of throughput supplies.  Subsidiaries of refiners such as petro chemical subsidiaries are not protect ed, except to the extent determined by  the President.  In addition,  the President cannot  take account of exempted stocks  in  making allocations under  the act. If  the end user would otherwise be enti tled  to receive an allocation,  it may  not be reduced on account of his hold ing exempted stocks. Nor should the  amount of exempted stocks be treated  as a floor in determining allocations.  In short the President must ignore ex empted stocks entirely in the alloca tion process.  Crude oil sharing: A crude oil shar ing program is allowed. However, the  main purpose of such a program is to  protect consumers during an emergen cy. The President should use the pro gram to get needed products to con sumers  in the affected areas  in  the  most efficient manner possible, and at  the lowest possible cost. The program  should not be used to subsidize ineffi cient  refiners or  allocate  crude  to  those refiners who produce products  in plentiful supply during a shortage.  Presidential  authority: Under  the  President's price and  allocation  au thority, the President may control pe troleum which  is  imported, which  is  used at refineries, and which is held as  stocks by importers, producers, refin ers, or marketers. Thus, the President  may, under SPAA,  implement-on a  temporary basis, subject  to congres sional  review-programs  similar  to  those in the Emergency Petroleum Al location Act, sections 13, 14, 15, and  16, which deal with import authority,  refinery controls, and inventory con trol. The President should use  these  authorities as necessary.  Information collection: No new  in formation collection authority  is  re quested in SP AA because there is suf ficient  authority  in other  statutes.  However, the conference report directs  the  President  to  collect  necessary  emergency preparedness  information  under  his  existing  authority. The  Nation as a whole and the separate  States cannot adequately cope with,  let alone prepare for, an emergency if  we do not have sufficient information.  Thus SPAA directs the President to  continue  to collect substantially  the  same petroleum information collected  under the Emergency Petroleum Allo cation Act of 1973, as of September  1981. Though all of this information  must be collected, it need not be col lected through the same forms or in  the  same manner  as under EP AA.  Format changes or other consolidation  ",1982
38,House,97,0.355,434,3,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr.  Speaker,  the following material compiled by the  Heritage Foundation  is an excellent  concise  analysis  on  the  subject  of  Soviet use of chemical, biological, and  other forms of poisoned earth warfare  in Asia and Afghanistan. It paints a  truly horrifying picture.  That the Soviet Union would so cas ually and flagrantly violate the terms  of both the 1925 Geneva Protocol and  the 1972 Biological Weapons Conven tion presents a very persuasive argu ment for  the need  to proceed very  carefully with  any  future  United  States-Soviet trade and arms control  agreements.

It should not  surprise us that GEORGE'S retirement  from Congress will not end his public  service. As an FBI special agent, a  navy veteran, and assistant U.S. attor ney, a State legislator, and U.S. Con gressman, his entire life has been one  of dedicated service to his country and  his fell ow citizens. Within Congress,  GEORGE has provided valuable service  to the House leadership as the deputy  majority whip.  In his six-term congressional career,  GEORGE has worked hard to make Gov ernment more  responsive  to  the  people. He was a strong proponent of  regulatory  reform  well  before  it  became a popular issue. He has also  pushed hard to improve our Nation's  legal process and the administration of  justice.  Soon GEORGE will himself be admin istering justice as a judge on the Cali fornia Court of Appeals. We wish him  success in his next endeavor equal to  that which  he  has  realized  as  a  Member of this body .e  e ",1982
40,House,97,-0.509,447,3,Mr. BINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, this is  not a happy moment, because we are  marking the departure of one of the  finest Members of  this House,  the  Honorable GEORGE DANIELSON. He  is  ending a 12-year career in the Con gress to take up a new career on the  bench as a California  judge. I must  admit he is extremely well suited for  that position, but he has done such an  outstanding job in Washington I hate  to see him go. After 8 years  in the  State legislature and then more than a  decade wrestling with public policy  issues here, I suppose it is understand able when a change of venue seems in  order.  Although  some  of  his  greatest  achievements in the legislative process  have come from his work on the Judi ciary and Civil Service Committees, he  has not limited his efforts to these jurisdictions. GEORGE has led efforts to  reform our electoral system,  improve  the health care system, support educa tion progams, prevent discrimination,  reform  our  tax  system,  and many  more. He  does not  just wring  his  hands or make speeches about prob lems confronting his district and the  Nation,  he  does  something  about  them. Many of the positions he has  taken over the years have been politi cally difficult ones, such as his consist ent  leadership  in supporting foreign  aid.  I particularly enjoyed my associa tion with GEORGE DANIELSON while he  served as a member of the Foreign Af fairs Committee. He took a great inter est in the work of the committee and  was especially conscientious in attend ing the many meetings with foreign  dignitaries that are part of the work of  that committee.  GEORGE DANIELSON  is  a  delightful  companion and a wise and compassion ate human being.

As we  say goodbye  to Mr. DANIELSON,  and  thank him for his many years of serv ice to our Nation, it is most appropri ate  to  recognize his many contribu tions both here in the Congress and  before entering public life.  As a Member of the House of Repre sentatives, we  have  come  to  know  GEORGE as a dedicated and informed  member of the Judiciary Committee  and the Post Office and Civil Service  Committee. His in-depth knowledge of  the American  legal  system and his  consummate study of our national his tory has combined to make him an in valuable member  of  the  Judiciary  Committee. In taking these credentials  to the court of appeals, I am confident  he will continue  to make a positive  contribution to our system of jurispru dence.  We will all miss GEORGE, and I am  glad to have this opportunity to say  I wish him the best of luck and  good will.e  e ",1982
42,House,97,0.378,447,3,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I  join my colleagues in extending our  best wishes  to GEORGE  as he  com mences a new career. I must say I am a  little  envious:  Following  a  distin guished career in both the executive  and legislative branches, and in both  private and public service, he is going  to make it three for three with a stint  on  the bench. And at an age when  most people would be  sitting back  drawing social security checks. I hope  it is not a sign that he knows some thing we do not about the trust fund.  Seriously, we  are  going  to miss  GEORGE in the House. For years, I have  felt as though our careers were someso.  how  linked. First,  it was  the Navy,  during World War II. Then it was law  practice. Then we both came to Sacra mento about the same time-although  I beat GEORGE there by about 1 year.  He got back at me in 1970, by getting  elected to the House first. So I do not  know whether he was following me all  those years or I was following him but this latest turn of events cannot  be too bad a sign.  We have not always seen eye to eye  on every issue; in fact, we have often  been  on  opposite  sides. But  from  everything I have seen of him, I know  that GEORGE has always had the best  interest of the people of California at  heart. He may even have been right on  a couple of occasions.  It goes without saying that he will  be missed, both  in his committees,  where he has served with distinction,  and on the House floor, where he has  frequently presided. He will have a  new chance  to yield  the gavel soon.  But  I  hope he will  remember his  friends back in Washington, especially  when the days get cold and the tem pers hot. We wish him and Candy the  best-they both deserve it.e  e ",1982

I remember so well our visit together  to  the Fort Mitchell Cemetery site  during his tenure as chairman of the  VA Cemeteries Subcommittee.

66,,97,0.325,473,3,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speak er, on March 10, 1982, the city of St.  Petersburg will welcome a unique cul tural experience  into  its midst. The  Salvador Dali Museum &  Institute,  which  includes  the largest collection  of art works by a living artist, Surreal ist Salvador Dali, opens on that date  with a gala celebration.  The museum will feature, on a rotat ing basis, 93 oil paintings, 200 water colors  and drawings,  1,000  graphics  and sculptures, and a 2,500 volume re search library, as well as speakers and  films on Dali and Surrealism. Valued  at approximately $35 million, the col lection was donated to  the State of  Florida by Cleveland  industrialist A.  Reynolds Morse and his wife, Eleanor  R. Morse, after a Wall Street Journal  article about their collection without a  home was read by St. Petersburg at torney and newly appointed city coun cilman James W. Martin.  The city of St. Petersburg, an enthu siastic supporter of this latest edition  to  its cultural community, provided  and renovated a city-owned building  on  local waterfront  property  and  leased it for 30 years at $1 per year. A  $2 million grant from  the State of  Florida was used to develop the facili ty and an adjacent park.  A group of community leaders, dedi cated to establishing the Dali collec tion in St. Petersburg, have worked for  almost 2 years to realize their dream.  The museum  site  is  on Bayboro  Harbor,  adjacent  to  the  Bayboro  campus of  the University of South  Florida  and  future  plans  for  the  museum include the availability of re search, work study programs, and in ternships  to students and faculty of  the State university  system, which  represents nine universities and their  branch  campuses  throughout  the  State of Florida.  I applaud the efforts of everyone in volved in securing this important ac quisition and urge both visitors and  local  community members  alike  to  visit the Salvador Dali Museum &  In stitute at their earliest opportunity.e  U.S COAL EXPORTS: THE  BUYER'S VIEW  HON. NICK JOE RAHALL II  OF WEST VIRGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 3, 1982  e ",1982
67,,97,-0.306,473,3,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, a  sub stantial portion of this Nation's coal  exports goes to the European market  and  it  is  expected  that  the United  States will supply even more steam  coal to this market in the future. This  is beneficial to the Europeans in that  they gain a measure of energy security  through a stable source from an allied  nation, and, it benefits this Nation by  creating employment  in  the mining,  rail, and port industries in addition to  contributing  toward a  favorable bal ance of trade.  Recently, I met with representatives  of the Association Technique De L'Im portation Charbonniere <ATIC) which  buys coal for France. One of the major  concerns of ATIC, and of all European  buyers, is the ability of this Nation to  keep its ports competitive with those  of  other  coal  exporting  countries.  Deeper port channel drafts allow the  use of larger coal vessels which can  transport coal at less cost. Obviously,  this is a factor which coal buyers take  into consideration when determining  with whom  to  sign  long-term  con tracts.  Following  is a memorandum  from  ATIC on the issues raised during our  meeting. I believe the information con tained in it will be of use during our  deliberations on port improvement leg islation.  ASSOCIATION TECHNIQUE DE L'IM PORTATION  CHARBONNIERE  <A.T.I.C.l, DELEGATION IN NORTH  AMERICA,  New York, N. Y., February 24, 1982.  Memorandum on  issues  raised by Mr.  Albert Viala, Vice Chairman and Chief Ex ecutive Officer of Association Technique De  L'Importation  Charbonniere,  Paris  <A.T.l.C.)  in Washington on February 4,  1982, in relation to the competitiveness of  U.S. steam coals.  1-PAST AND FUTURE SITUATION  1.1  In the year 1980, and especially  in  1981, high vessel demurrage, up to $15.00  per ton of coal  loaded, for vessels sailing  from East coast ports was experienced. This  factor had a direct bearing on world prices  for steam coal. As a matter of fact, competi tors outside the USA have taken advantage  of this situation by increasing their sales  prices by demurrage we paid  in the U.S.  without any  real Justification  in any  in crease in their costs to deliver coal. This de murrage paid to the ship owners has not  produced any improvement in the financial  condition of the American coal producers,  with  the  possible  exception  of  exports  through ports where the waiting time was  less  than  that experienced on  the East  coast.  1.2 The strong world steam coal demand  witnessed during  the years  1980/1981  is  likely to stabilize in 1982, at a much lower  level. Taking into account the present world  economic situation we can assume that the  future prospects for improvement in exports  for the American coal producers cannot be  foreseen before the years 1985/1986.  The reasons for this forecast are:  Excess production capacity, the world ca pacity having been based on inflated con sumption prospects made in the years 77-79;  Worldwide weak economy;  Conservation;  The oil glut.  1.3 In the coming 4 to 5 years the Ameri can coal industry is going to face increased  competition but, in the meantime, it should  work  very  quickly on getting  ready  for  future better years.  2-ATIC'S POSITION  2.1 We are very much  in favor of pur chases from the USA for the following rea sons:  The political situation in the country and  the relatively stable labor situation;  No interference on the part of the govern ment on exports and on pricing;  The free pricing situation  in  the USA,  with competition between producers of all  sizes, as well as between traders and bro kers,  is a definite advantage  to us. Such  commercial  freedom  in  the  international  coal business cannot be found in all export ing countries by foreign consumers:  Great number of ports.  2.2 Measures likely to improve the com petitiveness of American coals to the export  markets.  Dredging of channels and ports to accom modate ships of minimum 150,000 TDW  drawing 55 feet;  Development of  terminals with  storage  and throughput capacity available for small  producers and not only private terminals be longing to and operated by large producers.  ATIC is very much in favor of the VSPA  project in Norfolk, the port of New York  terminal and of the type of terminals in ex istence and planned in New Orleans;  Opposition to total deregulation of export  rates by the railroads;  Close and permanent review of the conse quences of the Stagger's Act and its deregu lation on the survival of small mines:  Incentives to purchase French manufac tured products and equipment in order to  improve the balance of trade situation for  France (deficit: 1980 FF 24.5 billion/US $5.3  billions 1981 FF 22.9 billions/US $4.2 bil lions>.  About 8.5 million metric tons of coal are  to be purchased by ATIC in 1982 for a total  value of about 600 million dollars.  N.B. The above considerations regarding  ATIC's position on steam coals (part 2> and  their competitiveness are also valid for met allurgical coals.e  RESOLUTION SUPPORTS  LITHUANIAN LIBERTY  HON.HENRYJ.NOWAK  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 3, 1982  e ",1982

69,,97,0.342,486,3,Mr. DERWINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, on  February  9,  1982,  I  reminded  the  Members of the efforts of the Nation al Committee of American Airmen to  Aid General Mihailovich. This group  of U.S. air crew members is attempting  to correct  the  record  regarding  the  unfair  treatment of Draja Mihailo vich,  Yugoslav  anti-Axis  guerrilla  leader, by the Allies during and imme diately after World War II. I recently  received  a  letter  from Mr. David  Martin, author of ""Patriot or Traitor,  the Case  of General Mihailovich,""  which throws a new and rather sensa tional  light on  the Anglo-American  abandonment of General Mihailovich.  In his book, Martin charged that ele ments in SOE Cairo, the SOE was the  British equivalent of  the U.S. OSS,  sabotaged United States and British  supplies of Mihailovich; and slanted  and  suppressed  intelligence  for  the  purpose of inducing the Western Allies  to switch their support from Mihailo vich to Tito.  Mr. Martin's letter, gives the details  to substantiate his charges. His letter  is reprinted for the information of the  Members.  ARLINGTON, VA., January 21, 1982.  Hon. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI,  U.S. House of Representatives, Washington,  D.C.  DEAR CONGRESSKAN DERWINSKI: Because  of  the great  interest you have displayed  over the years in the case of General Draza  Mihailovich, I am writing to inform you of  some highly important information that has  emerged with  regard  to  the Mihailovich  case.  As you know, in my book ""Patriot or Trai tor, The Case of General Mihailovich,"" I re produced extensive documentation from the  reports and statements of the British and  American officers who served with Mihailo vich  to establish < 1 > that, many months  before the British Foreign Office made the  fateful decision to abandon Mihailovich in  December of 1943, there had heen persistent  sabotage of  the Mihailovich supply oper ation by elements  in  the British SOE  in  Cairo: and <2> that vitally important reports  sent out of Yugoslavia by the British and  American  liaison officers were never  for warded to London by SOE Cairo. I suggest ed that the person probably responsible in  both situations was a junior British officer  by the name of James Klugman, who rose  from the rank of lieutenant to that of major  by the end of 1943. Klugman, I pointed out,  was a known Communist who had before  the war headed up the European Commu nist youth movement and who after the war  became the editor of the British Communist  theoretical journal. I did not say that Klug man was  a Soviet agent, even  though  I  strongly suspected it, because at the time  ",1982
70,,97,-0.472,499,3,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker, social se curity  disability  insurance  termina tions have risen dramatically  in the  last year. As a result of the accelerated  process of continuing disability investi gations begun last March, the month ly  disability  termination  rate  has  almost doubled,  rising from approxi mately 6,300 per month in 1980 to over  12,000  per month  today. This  in creased number of terminated recipi ents and the process under which the  terminations were carried out have  caused considerable public outcry.  I  am sure nearly every House Member  has been contacted by constituents  upset over the harsh treatment termi nated disability  recipients  have  re ceived.  Yesterday, March 2,  I  introduced a  bill, H.R. 5684, which  is designed to  ease the human pain caused by disabil ity terminations. My bill does not seek  to  prevent  disability  reviews  from  taking place. By all knowledgeable ac counts, many disability cases are  in  need of review. What my bill does is  propose a series of four disability in surance program reforms to make the  termination process more fair and ease  the transition period back to the work  force for those recipients whose bene fits have been eliminated.  First, H.R. 5684 would prevent State  agencies or the SSA from making a  disability termination decision prior to  notification of  the  recipient. Under  current law, beneficiaries, through no  fault of their own, can receive notice  that their benefits should have been  terminated as of some past date, up to  several months before. Such decisions  often  leave  terminated beneficiaries  with little of no transition time and, in  many cases, no current income and a  debt to social security.  Second, H.R.  5684 would  extend  from 3 months to 5 months the transi tion benefit period for terminated re cipients. This 5-month period, which  corresponds to the 5-month period dis ability beneficiaries now wait  to  re ceive benefits after filing, would great ly ease  terminated recipients' transi tions back into the work force. After  several years without working and in  many cases a certain degree of residu al pain, it is not reasonable to expect  terminated  disability  recipients  to  settle into a steady job in less than 5  months.  Third, to balance the extended tran sition benefit period, H.R. 5684 would  institute an earnings test on transition  disability benefits. In other words, cri teria similar  to  those  in  retirement  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cases would be used to reduce transi tion disability benefits by $1 for every  $2 earned, when an individual's earned  income exceeds $360 per month. The  earnings  test would prevent persons  who have successfully  reentered  the  work force from continuing to receive  transition benefits.  Finally, H.R. 5684 would allow a dis ability recipient whose benefits have  been terminated, and who has filed a  timely  appeal,  to  receive  continued  payments until the appeal is conclud ed. Under this provision, however,  if  the appeal  is  lost, all benefits paid  after  the 5-month  transition period  would be considered overpayments and  be subject to recovery by the Social  Security Administration. This contin ued payments provision is necessary to  provide  a means of addressing  the  needs of the thousands of persons ap pealing State agency termination deci sions because they are unable to work.  At  the present  time,  those persons  filing appeals are often forced to wait  up  to  10 months without  support  before an administrative law judge can  hear  their  appeal.  This  proVIS10n  would  not  increase  costs  because,  under  the current system, a person  who wins an appeal  is  retroactively  awarded past benefits.  I believe  the  reforms proposed  in  H.R. 5684 will effectively address the  uncertainty currently faced by termi nated  disability  recipients, without  greatly increasing trust fund costs or  creating new administrative problems.  The only added cost to the disability  trust fund would be the difference be tween the cost of 2 additional months  of  benefits, which would  itself  be  offset by revenue saved through the  implementation of an earnings test on  all transition DI benefits.  I urge my colleagues in the House to  support  this  important  and much  needed legislation.  The text of H.R. 5684 follows:  H.R. 5864  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That <a>  section 221(a) of the Social Security Act is  amended by adding at the end thereof the  following new paragraph:  ""(3) Notwithstanding any other provision  of this section <or of section 216(i) or 223),  the day on which an individual's disability is  determined to have ceased shall in no case  be earlier than the first day of the month in  which such individual is initially notified of  such determination in writing (by the appli cable State agency or the Secretary. as the  case may be), and the month which is deter mined to be the termination month <as de fined  in section 223(a)(l)) with respect to  any individual shall in no case be earlier  than the month in which such individual is  so notified, except to the extent otherwise  provided by the Secretary in cases where  notification was unavoidably delayed be cause of the failure of the  individual  in volved to make a timely report of material  facts <relating to either medical condition or  gainful activity> which he had or should  have had in his possession."".  3193  (b) The first sentence of section 223<a>< 1 >  of such Act is amended by striking out ""and  ending with  the month"" and  inserting  in  lieu thereof ""and ending <subject to section  221<a)(3)) with the month"".

71,,97,-0.496,512,3,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr.  Speaker,  yesterday's Washington  Post  con tained another outstanding article by  Mary McGrory. It was inspired by the  incredible  phraseology  employed by  President Reagan's counselor, Edwin  Meese III, who, in discussing the ad ministration's plans to expand spend ing for so-called civil defense, referred  to it as the best way to avoid the con sequences of ""something that may not  be desirable."" As Ms. McGrory says  that is probably ""the ultimate in laid back description of nuclear war.""  Although the American Medical As sociation has formally declared  that  ""no medical response""  is possible  in  the event of nuclear attack, the ad ministration, nevertheless, is proceed ing to push an expensive but utterly  ludicrous  program  of  civil  defense,  which has as its heart a so-called crisis  relocation  plan  to  remove  citizens  from  their homes and return  them  after  a  nuclear  attack.  As  Ms.  McGrory points out, the basic flaw in  the plan is that it relies on an 8-day  warning which, according to the public  affairs director of the Civil Defense  Association, ""we will not receive.""  However,  there  is  even  a  greater  defect in the plan. Last year, using the  Freedom of Information Act, I got the  Arms  Control  and  Disarmament  Agency to disgorge a 1978 report on  little  known  effects  of  a  nuclear  attack.  In  that  report,  the  agency  brought out the fact that, in addition  to the blast and fallout from a full scale nuclear attack, such an attack  would destroy most of the ozone layer  in the Northern Hemisphere, making  it impossible for plants or animals to  survive unprotected on the surface of  the Earth. One conclusion was  that  any  realistic  civil  defense  program  would have to provide sufficient un derground food, water, and facilities to  enable  the population  to  live below  ground for several years.  The fact is that any meaningful civil  defense program in a world in which  tens of thousands of nuclear weapons  exist, as they do at present, would be  prohibitively costly, requiring trillions  of dollars, and would constitute a total  negation of what we  think as  the  American way of life.  Such a program clearly has not the  slightest  chance of being put  into  effect or even authorized. Yet any thing short of such a program is not  only  a  delusion but could  actually  bring a nuclear war closer by creating  the illusion of protection for the popu lation.  It is time we quit thinking in terms  of such dangerous nonsense and get on  with the job of nuclear disarmament.  The full text of Ms. McGrory's arti cle follows these remarks:  REAGAN AIDE OFFERS LAID-BACK DESCRIPTION  OF NUCLEAR WAR  Ronald Reagan's counselor, Edwin Meese  III, yesterday gave what may be the ulti mate in laid-back description of nuclear war.  He called it ""something that may not be de sirable.""  Meese was addressing the Civil Defense  Association  at  the Shoreham Americana  Hotel, bearing  the president's warm good  wishes and the happy news that Reagan in tends to double  its budget as part of his  strategic planning.  Meese conceded that it  is ""not an easy  task to defend and justify civil defense"" be cause ""it is the kind of thing people have a  psychological aversion to.""  Reagan's plans to add 17,000 nuclear war heads to an arsenal of 25,000 has run into  considerable flak. Aroused physicians and  scientists are raising the alarm about un speakable death and destruction. The Amer ican Medical Association has formally de clared that ""no medical response"" is possi ble in the event of nuclear attack. And Jon athan Schell's New Yorker series about the  end of the planet is working its way into the  national psyche.  But Meese said that civil defense ""is a de terrent for a possible attack on this nation""  and the Civil Defense Association workers  applauded vigorously.  ""Preparedness,"" he declared, ""is the best  way to avoid the consequences of something  that may not be desirable.""  The ""deterrent,"" as presently constituted,  seems unlikely to give the Soviets pause. At  its heart is the crisis relocation plan, an in tricate, upbeat scheme that envisions order ly removal of citizens from ""target areas"" to  ""host areas"" and their return, within a rela tively short period of  the bomb burst-a  return to ""a home area"" that sounds a step  away from normalcy.  A few lines from the literature put out by  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency, which is in charge of civil defense,  from a section called ""What Home May Be  Like"" give the flavor of this exceptionally  sunny scenario:  ""Fuel and food supplies will be rerouted to  your home area; however, this may take a  day or two. . . . It may be necessary to take  extra precautions with waste. Some  food  stocks will probably have to be carried back  in your car. Be sure it is fresh, particularly  raw meat.""  The whole thing conjures up a picture of  an area that has somehow escaped flattened  buildings, heaped corpses and the radiated,  blinded, or burned inhabitants generally as sociated with nuclear assault.  The real defect in the plan is that it relies  on an eight-day warning which, according to  William Murray, public affairs director of  the Civil Defense Association, ""we will not  receive.""  But Meese says that ""reinvigoration"" of  civil defense will  ""give people  the confi dence that their lives can be protected.""  ",1982

Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of  Senate Joint Resolution 142  calling  upon the President to issue a procla mation designating March 21, 1982, as  ""Afghanistan Day.""  We cannot ignore the Soviet military  occupation  of Afghanistan  and we  must keep  alive  the public  interest  since the Afghan situation is no longer  receiving  the media coverage  it de serves.  We must demonstrate over and over  again the nature and extent of Soviet  crimes in Afghanistan. As  the leader  of the free world, the United States is  expected to pursue a policy of firm ness against Soviet imperialism. This  is one case where we can be certain  that all countries of the free world will  respect  our  leadership,  especially  those people who share the Muslim re ligion which is being suppressed by So viets in Afghanistan.  It is only fitting that we  join with  the European Parliament, who on De cember 16, 1981, passed a similar reso lution  commemorating March  21,  1982, as ""Afghanistan Day.""  I urge my colleagues to  join me in  supporting Senate  Joint Resolution  142 calling for an international observ ance on March 21 as a day of global  support for the Afghan people.

75,House,97,0.379,551,3,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  support of the resolution. It is over 2  years since the Soviet Union brutally  invaded Afghanistan. For over 2 years  the courageous Afghan freedom fight ers have continued to resist the Rus sian occupation. Facing tanks, helicop ter gunships, and devastating chemical  warfare. The  freedom  fighters have  countered with little more than rifles  and bravery. Still  they enjoy over whelming popular support and control  most of the countryside. Against all  odds, there is some chance that they  will actually succeed in convincing the  Soviets one day that the price  they  have to pay to continue occupying Af ghanistan is just too high.  Mr.  Speaker, we  cannot  let  this  struggle  disappear  from  the  front  pages, or even the back pages, of the  world press. The Soviets must be made  to pay a heavy price in world condem nation  for  their  subjugation  of  a  neighboring  country. We must  also  make them pay for their brutal use of  chemical weapons that wipe out whole  villages  indiscriminately. This  is not  just  the Afghan  freedom  fighters'  struggle. It must be our struggle too,  and  the struggle of decent freedom loving people everywhere. It is our job  to keep the pressure on, to keep focus ing world attention on what is happen ing in that far off unhappy land. If we  allow  the world to forget about this  extension of Russian empire, the Sovi ets will be free  to step up their sup pression  and  increase  their use  of  deadly chemicals, and all faint hopes  for a free Afghanistan may be extin guished.  ""Afghanistan Day,"" March 21,  is a  worldwide effort to focus renewed at tention on the Soviet takeover of that  country,  which  has  already  been  almost forgotten on the pages of our  newspapers.

99,Senate,97,-0.328,655,3,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I am pro posing today legislation to remove a  loophole in the Regulatory Flexibility  Act that I do not believe the Congress  ever intended to leave open.  My bill would make clear that the  Regulatory Flexibility Act is intended  to apply  to all  rules published  for  public notice and comment that may  have a  substantial  impact on small  business or other small  institutions.  Under the current language of the act,  several Federal agencies have claimed  that their rules are exempt from the  analyses required under the Regula tory Flexibility Act. Certain exemp tions are certainly valid. The Congress  clearly did not intend that the Regula tory Flexibility Act apply to rules not  published  for  public  comment. But  where public comment is solicited, and  where these proposed rules could have  a significant impact on small business,  I believe it was intended that the Reg ulatory Flexibility Act be brought to  bear. Rules published for public com ment by the Department of Defense  and the Internal Revenue Service are  of particular importance to small busi ness, yet both have been reticent in  complying with the act.  I will attempt, in the remainder of  my statement, to demonstrate the im plications of and weaknesses in the ar guments for exemption put forward by  the DOD and the IRS. I believe in the  process,  the need  for  congressional  clarification by way of amending the  act and the need for close congression al oversight of  the act will become  clear.  The  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act,  passed by the 96th Congress, requires  that agencies, in developing rules that  would have a significant impact on a  substantial number of small businesses  undertake  a  regulatory  flexibility  analysis  to  determine  what  that  impact might  be  under  alternative  ways of implementing the rule. Agen cies are encouraged to adopt the least  onerous approach or  exclude  small  business  from  coverage  completely.  The findings and purposes section of  the act are straightforward and unam biguous in expressing the congression al rationale and objectives and I ask  unanimous consent that a copy of that  section be printed in the RECORD fol lowing my statement.  Mr. Frank Swain, Chief Counsel for  Advocacy at the Small Business Ad ministration,  succinctly  summarized  the Regulatory Flexibility Act's intent  in testimony last October 7, before a  House Small Business Subcommittee  when he stated:  The Regulatory Flexibility Act imposes a  requirement of regulatory analysis, and the  expectation is that Federal agencies' sensi tivity to the needs and problems of small en tities will increase, and different regulatory  decisions will result.  He went on to say:  The instrument of regulatory analysis is  basically a self-help mechanism for the Fed eral  regulator. Making  him  think  first  before acting, making the rulemaking proc ess itself more open to those who are most  directly  affected  by  that  process,  and  making  sure  that  regulations more  fre quently reflect rather than dictate economic  realities.""  Mr. Swain's predecessor  as Chief  Counsel  for Advocacy, Mr. Milton  Stewart, characterized the act as:  An effort by what is perhaps the largest  institution in the world to limit its own neg ative regulatory impact on ""small business"".  It is a conscious and laudable, if overdue,  effort at self-control, at forbearance in the  exercise of power.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of the ""Message From the Chief Coun sel,"" printed in the Small Business Ad ministration's Guide  to  the Regula tory Flexibility Act, from which this  latter quote was taken, be printed in  the RECORD following my statement.  The  loophole being used by some  agencies to avoid this selfhelp mecha nism, to avoid forbearance in the exer cise of power, lies largely in a techni cal misinterpretation of the act.  Specifically,  the act  requires  that  when an agency publishes a general  notice of proposed rulemaking ""pursu ant to section 553(b) of the <Adminis trative Procedure Act>. or any other  law,"" it must undertake a regulatory  flexibility analysis unless the agency  certifies in advance that the proposed  rule would  not  have  a  significant  impact on a  substantial number of  small businesses or other small enti ties.  My proposal would strike  the  lan guage ""pursuant to section 553(b) of  this title, or any other law,"" in the def inition of ""rule,"" and similar language  in two other sections of the act, so as  to make the act read:  Whenever an agency publishes general  notice of proposed rulemaking for any pro posed  rule,  the agency shall prepare and  make available for public comment  . . . a  regulatory flexibility analysis.  The change would not make  the  Regulatory Flexibility Act an  inde pendent authority or mandate for any  Federal  agency  to  publishing  for  public notice and comment any rule  which it would not otherwise publish.  It simply would require that when the  rulemaking process  is opened up  to  the public,  its  impact on  the  little  guys, as well as the big ones be as sessed. It would require that the rule  writers attempt to increase their sensi tivity  to  the needs and problems of  small entities. It would require that  rule writers  to  think  first  before  acting.  I do not think that is too much to  ask, but apparently  the officials of  some Federal  agencies  and depart ments do.  The most  notable  examples  that  have come to my attention are the De partment of Defense and the Internal  Revenue Service. Both of these agen cies have claimed a near blanket ex emption from the requirements of the  Regulatory Flexability Act  on  the  grounds that they are not ""required  by section 553(b) of the <Administra tive Procedure Act), or any other law""  to publish notice of proposed rulemak ing for public comment. I should point  out that both of these agencies regu larly publish notice for comment of  their own volition. I commend them  for  their action, and hope they will  continue this practice.  I ask unanimous consent that copies  of correspondence between the SBA's  chief counsel  for advocacy and  the  Office of General Counsel of the De partment of Defense concerning the  applicability of the Regulatory Flexi bility Act be inserted in the RECORD.  This correspondence makes  it clear  that  the DOD considers  itself com pletely exempt from  the Regulatory  Flexibility Act as a consequence of the  language addressed by my proposed  amendment.  The Internal Revenue Service made  its position clear when it published, on  October 8, 1981, its notice of proposed  rulemaking concerning pooling of in dustrial development bonds, a matter  of  tremendous  importance  to  small  business. The proposal stated:  Although this document is a notice of pro posed rulemaking which solicits public com",1982

101,,97,0.377,720,3,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, I am  happy to take part in this year's ""Call  to Conscience Vigil"" for Soviet Jews.  Life  in  the U.S.S.R.  for Jews has  become more and more unbearable.  Life is even worse for those Jews who  express a wish to leave the country.  They are systematically harrassed and  often lose their jobs and are forced to  hide from the authorities.  The number of Soviet  Jews who  have been denied the right to emigrate  to a free society is almost impossible  to count. It is my hope that our effort  will help many of the families and in dividuals  in  the Soviet Union who  have been denied this right.  As part of the effort to aid these  persecuted people, I'm sponsoring the  refusenik, Alexander Kushner. Alex ander has been  trying  to  join his  mother, brother, and grandparents in  Israel since 1976. As of December 1980,  he had been refused permission five  times to leave the Soviet Union. Alex ander cannot  find  suitable  employ ment despite being a skilled construc tion engineer. He was recently called  up  for  reserve military  duty  even  though he served in the Soviet Navy  from 1967 to 1970. Alexander's mother  is asking support for her son.  It is my hope that this vigil and the  letter I and my colleagues are sending  to the President can have some posi tive  effect on Soviet human  rights  policy. I commend the gentleman from  New York, Mr. LENT, for chairing this  year's Congressional  Call  to  Con science Vigil.e  THE LIFELONG LEARNING  INSTITUTE  HON. BENJAMIN A.

102,,97,0.043,720,3,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I  take  this opportunity  to  inform my col leagues of an innovative and successful  program which is run by the Rockland  Community College Senior Citizens  Club-the Lifelong Learning Institute.  While many senior citizens clubs meet  for social stimulation, this group aims  to stimulate mental activities.  The  Lifelong  Learning  Institute  began when Mr. Otto Hutt, chairman  to the advisory board of the Rockland  County Office on Aging, and director  of some 14 clubs in our congressional  district, went to the Rockland CommuEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  nity College requesting a room to use  for the formation of a senior club de voted only to eduction. The club took  root in the spring of 1980, with only a  handful of members, to discuss issues  and  concerns. The  group  received  great support from the college faculty,  and, realizing the potential offerings  of senior citizens, began to run mini courses. The courses are so successful  that they are now recognized by the  State of New York with financial sup port  to  the  college. The Rockland  Community Center Senior Citizens  Club has about 200 members, who do  not work for pay but for personal ful fillment. The club charges dues of $1  per year, in return for one free mini course each year. The Lifelong Learn ing Institute is currently offering four  minicourses,  in current events,  reli gions  of  the world,  understanding  aging, and  literature. To my knowl edge, this is the only such club in the  State of New York, and may very well  be  the  only  one  throughout  our  Nation.  The senior citizens club of the Rock land Community College has set an  important example by creating  the  Lifelong  Learning  Institute.  This  group of older Americans has  rein forced for us the realization that our  senior citizens have significant contri butions to offer. The club has given its  members an opportunity to feel proud,  to stand tall, and to off er theirknowl edge and skills to each other, and to  their communities.  It is my hope that the establishment  of this institution will begin a trend in  our Nation, to bring the senior citizens  of  the United States back  into  the  mainstream. Accordingly,  I urge my  colleagues to encourage similar insti tutions in their constituencies.e  TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN  GEORGE DANIELSON  HON.

However, we are  losing him to another very important  post-as a  judge of the court of ap peals in his home State. I am certain  he will  take  to  that  job  the same  thoughtfulness and responsibility he  exhibited in his work in Congress.  In his 12 years  in Congress, Con gressman DANIELSON has been a hard  worker and achieved a leadership role.  In his work on the Judiciary Commit tee, where I have been pleased to serve  with him, he has achieved an impres sive record. He is to be commended for  March 4, 1982  his work on regulatory reform, where  he was one of the early advocates of  doing something to overhaul the Fed eral Government's regulatory system.  He has worked in the areas of the ad ministration of justice and copyright  laws.  I want to congratulate Congressman  DANIELSON on his appointment to the  California Court of Appeals.

104,,97,-0.295,720,3,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker, I ap preciate this opportunity to join with  Representative LENT and my other dis tinguished colleagues  to express our  concern and dismay about the plight  of  Ida Nudel  as we  commemorate  March 2 as the World Day of Protest  on her behalf.  Ida Nudel was imprisoned for help ing other  Jewish prisoners of con science to emigrate to Israel from the  Soviet Union. Once again, through the  example of Ida Nudel, we can see the  persecution and suffering of the Jew  who wishes to uphold his religion or  emigrate to Israel, rights supposedly  granted its citizens by signatories of  the Helsinki accords.  Ida Nudel's refusal to accept official  Soviet policies against religious free dom and emigration is an example of  tremendous courage. For this, she has  earned  the  affectionate  title  of  ""Guardian Angel for Soviet Prisoners  of Conscience."" Also for this, she has  spent the last 4 years in Soviet jail in  Siberia.  I  join with my colleagues in calling  on the Soviet Union to allow an exit  visa for Ida Nudel when she is released  from prison on March 20 so that she  can be reunited with her family. I also  call on the Soviet Union to respect the  rights of its people. We must work to  remove the reasons for Ida Nudel's im prisonment  and  banishment, while  recognizing  that  the actions of  Ida  Nudel stand as a testimony to courage  and conviction.e  THE HELL WITH THE LAW OF  THE SEA  HON.

Douglas Cornell was  noted for his journalistic integrity and  skill in covering the White House. I  offer my personal sympathy  to his  family  including  his  devoted wife  Helen Thomas. The following is an ar ticle which  appeared  in  Sunday's  Washington Post concerning Mr. Cor nell:  DOUGLAS B. CORNELL, 75  Douglas B. Cornell, former White House  reporter for the Associated Press and hus  band of UPI reporter Helen Thomas, died  Saturday at the age of 75.  Mr. Cornell, who covered presidents from  Franklin D. Roosevelt  to Richard Nixon  during his 36 years with AP, had been in  failing health in recent years. He died in De troit where he was being cared for by the  parents of Thomas. He was hospitalized  with pneumonia six weeks ago.  A native of St. Louis, Mo., Mr. Cornell  spent his childhood  in Falls City, Neb.,  where as a high school student he landed  his first newspaper  job at the Falls City  Daily News. Mr. Cornell graduated from the  University of Missouri School of Journalism  in 1928. He worked at the Moberly <Mo.)  Monitor-Index, the Des Moines <Iowa> Reg ister, the United States Daily and the Gen eral Press Association before joining the AP  in 1933.  As White House correspondent  for  the  wire service, he worked in direct competi tion with his future wife, Helen Thomas. At  his retirement party at the White House in  1971, then first lady Pat Nixon announced  Mr. Cornell's engagement to Thomas. They  were married soon afterward.  Mr. Cornell, who was a member of the  Sigma Delta Chi Hall of Fame, also leaves a  son from his first marriage, Douglas Cornell  Jr. His first wife, Jenny died in 1966.e  IRA-INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT  3427  are different lengths of time for certif icates. There  is  also  the  issue  of  whether funds are compounded daily,  monthly, or annually.  But as  I  read  the report,  I noted  with particular interest a chart that  was prepared by the Christian Science  Monitor. The Monitor raises the ques tion of what today's $100,000 will be  worth in the future. They compared  the annual rate of  inflation from 6  percent up through 14 percent. Then  they reviewed the money erosion over  a  25-year  period.  For  instance,  $100,000 with an 8-percent rate of in flation would be worth only $14,602 in  25 years.  Let us take an annual rate of infla tion of 12 percent, which would be an ticipated with  the  big  government  spending we now have. Then let us  assume that 6 percent of this goes for  taxes. Now if you receive 12 percent  interest on your $100,000 and 6 per cent of it is paid for taxes, this means  that with  inflation, even with earn ings, your money would only be worth  $23,000 in 25 years. Our country has  too much  inflation  and  too much  taxes. It all goes back to one basic sub ject-America has more government  than we need and more  taxes  than  America can afford to pay.

Mr. Speaker,  this  treaty  is  funda mentally flawed. It does not represent  the best interests or the national in terests of the United States of Amer ica.  This  treaty  as  drafted would  create an entity much stronger than  the United Nations.  It would  create  an  international  seabed  authority which would  not  only make laws but would control two thirds of the Earth's surface. Quite  simply, we would be giving up  the  right  to  explore  two-thirds of  the  Earth's surf ace without firing a shot.  In this international seabed author ity, in the Assembly, each country has  one vote. Our country has no veto. We  have received no guarantee of a seat  on any important committee in this  particular  international  seabed  au thority. The orientation is toward the  Third World and the Communist bloc.  Under this treaty we would not have  unfettered access  to deep ocean bed  minerals. There would be a mandatory  technology transfer provision in this  particular treaty. There would be pro duction ceilings. There would be anti monopoly provisions. To top it all off,  the United States would end up fund ing 25 percent of the cost of the inter national seabed authority.  The Law of the Sea Treaty should  be lost at sea. This is not in the best  interest of this country and our efforts  as a country should be placed toward  the Reciprocating States Agreement  which  is currently a  law and some thing that will be ratified by our coun try, as I understand it, this week.

It is  with  deep  gratitude  and  heartfelt  thanks that we seek to honor those  who so honored us with their heroic  and selfless sacrifices, ultimately that  of their freedom.  The Veterans' Administration has  estimated  that since World War II,  140,000  soldiers have been captured  and held as prisoners of war. Over  9,000 men have been listed as missing  in action and never recovered. These  men suffered  in ways  that we may  only hope  to understand. They en dured loss of their freedom and loved  ones, lack of proper medical attention,  torture, and in many cases a horrible  death.  For  those  now  free,  their  memories will always be held captive  to those dark years of their lives.  How can we ever hope to repay the  sacrifices of those men who stood as  living  embodiments  of  the words  honor and courage? We must start by  remembering. We must start by letting  these men know that we will honor  their  incredible  sacrifices. We must  start by expressing that which we so  deeply feel. And we must proclaim this  day as a day  to  remember  the un speakable torment and pain that both  prisoners and their families suffered  for  their country. We are proud of  these men.

110,,97,0.176,837,3,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Speaker,  the  land developers who plan and build  the  subdivisions  surrounding  our  urban centers have a pervasive and en during effect on our daily lives. Those  who create communities out of coun tryside have the substantial task of de termining the nature of the human  environment  in  that area for many  years to come. Unfortunately, not all  developers have  respected  the  rela tionship between the natural environ ment and the one created for man,  and  the consequences have been an  abundance of poorly planned, sprawl ing subdivisions  that will plague us  long after the developer has left.  One man who has made the creation  of proper human environments his  first priority  is  J. Alvin Hawbaker,  who will be honored for his achieve ments this month by his fellow resi dents of State College, Pa. This recog nition is thoroughly earned and long  deserved. Mr. Hawbaker  began  his  career over 50 years ago as a carpen ter's apprentice,  learning the home building business firsthand, and work ing his way up to owning his own con struction company. He came to State  College during World War II, and 5  years later founded his present compa ny, J. Alvin Hawbaker, Inc., which has  now engaged  in all aspects of  real  estate subdivision in central Pennsyl vania for over 30 years.  3531  When many developers have seen  their task as one of taming nature, Mr.  Hawbaker has built  living  environ ments in harmony with it. While some  have made fortunes by throwing up  developments with  little  regard  to  planning, Mr. Hawbaker has made his  own  fortune by making planning a  prerequisite to building. His success in  his field  is a  testament to this view  that  the designing and building of  communities is ""a marriage of beauty,  practicality, and economics.""  Mr. Hawbaker has stated that in cre ating human environment, we should  seek to serve not only needs, but also  aspirations. Today, I stand with the  citizens of State College  in saluting  this man's unique accomplishments,  and wish him the best in fulfilling his  own aspirations.e  TAX-EXEMPT PRIVATE SCHOOLS  NOT A ""RELIGIOUS FREEDOM""  ISSUE  HON. JULIAN C. DIXON  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 8, 1982  e ",1982
111,House,97,0.221,889,3,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from  Ohio  <Mr.  ECKART) for his contribution and par ticularly for highlighting the diversity  of representation we have had here  today and also in remarks that will be  submitted by our other colleagues.  I think, as the gentleman from Ohio  pointed out, there is a broad consensus  of concern that exists in the Halls of  Congress in terms of the effort of the  Japanese in providing for free world  security as well as for the impact it  has on the economic problems of this  Nation.  The gentlewoman from Ohio <",1982
112,House,97,0.263,915,3,Mr. TRIBLE.," Mr. Speaker,  today  my colleagues, STAN PARRIS and FRANK  WOLF, and I have introduced a bill to  require the Office of Personnel Man agement  to hold an open season at  least once every 12 months for the 9.2  million participants in the Federal em ployment health benefits program.  More than 15 months have elapsed  since the last open season. During that  time, health insurance premiums for  the FEHB program have risen by an  average of 30 percent, and benefits  have been cut back by an average of 16  percent. Despite these drastic changes,  the participants in this program have  not been allowed either  to  transfer  their health coverage or to leave the  program. It is unconscionable to force  these people to pay higher prices for  less  coverage without  giving  them  these opportunities.  It now appears that the Office of  Personnel Management will hold an  open season  in May 1982. Although  this  is welcome news,  the Congress  must act to assure that in the future  there is an open season at least once  every 12 months.  My bill would accomplish three ob jectives. First,  it would  require  the  Office of Personnel Management  to  hold an open season each year.  In  1981, there was no open season at all.  It would also  require  that no more  than 12 months elapse from the begin ning of one open season to the begin ning of the next open season. This is  to prevent OPM from scheduling, for  example, an open season in January  1983 and the next open season in De cember of 1984. This would meet the  requirement of an open season at least  once each year, but 23 months would  have elapsed from  the beginning of  the 1983 open season to the beginning  of the 1984 open season. My bill would  prevent  this by  requiring  that not  more than 12 months elapse between  open seasons.  Second,  it would  require  that the  Office of Personnel Management give  at least 4 weeks notice before the be ginning of an open  season of any  changes in benefits or premiums. Suf ficient notice is essential to making an  informed choice.  Third, my bill would  require  the  Office of Personnnel Management to  hold an open season before reducing  benefits or increasing premiums. Con tracts between OPM and the  insur ance carriers are for a period of 12  months, beginning on January 1 of  each year. My bill would require an  open season immediately before a new  contract begins  if the new contract  will result in lower benefits or higher  premiums for the recipient. An open  season would also be required if OPM  and a carrier make any modification  during the term of the contract which  results  in decreased benefits or  in creased premiums.  The Congress must guarantee an  open season at  least once every 12  months for the 9.2 million Federal em ployees, retirees, and dependents who  participate in the FEHB program. Re quiring an open season would contrib ute substantially to the morale of Fed eral employees. It would permit those  with a pressing need to amend their  health coverage  to do  so.  It would  eliminate  the hardship and expense  now  imposed on Federal employees,  retirees, and their families. In sum, re quiring an open season would restore  fairness to the system.  I urge your support and cosponsor ship of this legislation.e  THE FIRST-TIME HOMEOWNERS  OPPORTUNITY ACT  ",1982
113,House,97,-0.499,915,3,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing the First-time Home owners Opportunity Act. This bill will  give  new  hope  to  young  families  unable to purchase what we have long  considered the American dream-one's  own home.  First-time homeowners  find  them selves  locked  out  of  the  housing  market by factors totally out of their  control-high  interest  rates.  Even  those who diligently  save and who  have  very  reasonable  incomes  are  unable to afford a mortgage on only a  moderately price dwelling. Make no  mistake,  high  interest  rates  have  many victims in addition to first-time  buyers-homebuilders,  construction  workers, building suppliers,  realtors,  and  those  in  financial  institutions.  The inability of first-time buyers  to  purchase homes also means that those  wishing to sell will have added difficul ty. The historic mobility which Ameri cans have enjoyed  is  threatened by  this crisis.  As millions of  the postwar baby boom generation have reached adult hood, the problem has only exacerbat ed. Interest rates on mortgages have  remained  unacceptably  high  for  months on end and show no sign of  significantly decreasing any time soon.  Added to this is an administration ab solutely unwilling and unable to sense  the magnitude of the problem or to  propose concrete solutions.  The First-time Homeowners Oppor tunity Act would provide mortgage as sistance  in fiscal year 1983  to more  than 100,000  first-time  homeowners  whose incomes are no more than 130  percent of area median. For example,  in the Boston, Mass., area, the income  eligibility  limit would be $37, 700;  in  the Fall River area, $30,420. This as sistance would be utilized  to  reduce  the  cost on an FHA-insured mort gage-by direct payments to the mort gage holder-to as low as 9 % percent  but would be limited to no more than  the  amount  necessary  to  reduce  monthly  payments  for  mortgage,  taxes, and insurance to 30 percent of  the homeowner's income.  It is important to emphasize that be cause of this limitation-requiring the  homeowner to expend 30 percent of  income-the mortgage will not neces sarily be subsidized to as low as 9%  percent. These payments would con tinue for 10 years-unless the home owner sold the home-but could con tinue after 10 years if the Secretary of  ",1982

116,Senate,97,0.641,954,3,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President,  the bill I introduce today has two pur poses. First, it is an authorization for  the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration <NTIA> at  $12,400,000  for  fiscal  year  1983.  Second  it authorizes the Secretary of  State t~ designate private individuals  to speak on behalf of and  for  the  United States at conferences involving  international telecommunications mat ters.  Mr. President, the NTIA was estab lished by the Secretary of Commerce  in 1978, pursuant  to Reorganizati_on  Plan No.  1 of 1977  and Executive  Order No. 12046. These measures abol ished the White House Office of Tele communications  Policy  <OTP>  and  consolidated its functions with those  of the Commerce Department's Office  of  Telecommunications.  Additional  functions, including administration of  the public  telecommunications facili ties program <PTFP), were conferred  on NTIA in 1978.  NTIA's major responsibilities in cal endar 1981  included: First, serving as  the principal executive branch adviser  to  the President on communications  policies; second, developing executive  branch policies  concerning  telecom munications and information services;  third prescribing policies for and man aging Federal use of  the radio  fre quency spectrum, in accordance with  section 305  of  the Communications  Act of 1934, as amended <47 U.S.C. 305  <1976)); fourth, together with the De partment of State and other agencie~,  developing international telecommum cations plans and policies, and coordi nating U.S. Government positions in  and for international telecommunica tions meetings and conferences; fifth,  serving as a Federal  telecommunica tions research and study center, and  providing expert technical support to  other agencies, chiefly through the In stitute  for Telecommunications Sci ences in Boulder, Colo.; sixth, adminis tering the public telecommunications  facilities  program;  seventh,  advising  the Office of Management and Budget  and other Federal agencies on policies  governing the use and acquisition of  telecommunications systems, services,  and products, including the protection  of sensitive, though unclassified, infor mation transmitted by telecommunica tions  systems;  eighth,  coordinating  Federal research efforts regarding the  biomedical effects on nonionizing elec tromagnetic radiation; and ninth, fa cilitating expanded world trade oppor tunities  in  the  telecommunications  and  information  services  sectors,  through the reduction and avoidance  of nontariff trade barriers and other  constraints.  Additionally, NTIA published exten sive  technical  reports,  detailed  eco nomic and policy studies, and developed regulatory proposals in respect of  broadcast and cable television services,  domestic and international communi cations and information services, tele phone rate and pricing policies, trans border  data  flow,  and  information  policy topics generally.  NTIA's principal  program  efforts  were  in  the  following major areas:  First, domestic and international tele communications; second, Federal radio  frequency management;  third,  the  public  telecommunications  facilities  program;  fourth,  telecommunications  and  information system applications;  and fifth, providing expert technical  support  to other agencies'  telecom munications operations.  Mr. President, NTIA has served us  well. Under the able leadership of Ber nard Wunder, the Agency has been in  the forefront of the development of  executive branch policy  in  the con stantly changing  telecommunications  policy. NTIA has been a highly reli able  source  of  sound  counsel  and  advice throughout all of our delibera tions on  telecommunications  legisla tion.  The sharply decreased authorization  level reflects the administration's and  my belief that most of NTIA's partici pation in regulatory proceedings is not  needed and, in light of the decreased  legislative  activity on  the domestic  common carrier front,  its  legislative  functions should be curtailed. Most of  NTIA's  expanded  activity  occurred  during  the  Carter  administration.  When OTP's functions were  reorga nized  into NTIA,  the annual budget  was less than $10 million. Then it in creased to over $17 million-primarily  from increased participation in regula tory agency proceedings. With this ad ministration's emphasis on decreased  regulation and our efforts to deregu late many  telecommunications  serv ices, NTIA's participation  in  regula tory proceedings is not needed. Its im portant policymaking  and  spectrum  management functions, however, will  not be impaired and, in fact, our com mittee will continue to encourage the  United States to improve the develop ment of international telecommunica tions policy through more effective co ordination  within  the  executive  branch and the FCC. NTIA must play  a key role in the process.  The second purpose of this bill is to  authorize  the Secretary of State  to  designate private individuals to speak  on behalf of  the United States at  international conferences where  tele communications matters are at issue.  The purpose of this bill is to draw  upon  the  expertise  in  the  private  sector, especially  since  the  topic of  telecommunications is one of such a  technical nature, and has such broad  implications for both our defense and  our commercial activities.  ",1982
117,,97,-0.444,1032,3,Mr. STUDDS.," Mr. Speaker, our very  distinguished  colleague, Mr. WIRTH,  has teamed up with his brother, Prof.  John Wirth, director of Stanford Uni versity's Center of Latin American  Studies, to produce a most insightful  analysis of U.S. policy toward El Sal vador. While the authors concur with  the administration's position that our  Nation does indeed have important in terests  in  the region,  they conclude  that the current policy is unlikely to  serve  these  interests.  Instead,  they  suggest that a negotiated settlement,  implemented with the cooperation of  Venezuela and Mexico, would be more  effective.  I would like to insert the Wirths' ar ticle, as printed in the Denver Post,  into the RECORD now for the benefit of  all of my colleagues:  CFrom the Denver Post, Feb. 26, 19821  AMERICA SHOULD PuRSUE EL SALVADOR  SETTLEMENT  <Tim Wirth is the congressman from Colo rado's 2nd District. His brother, Prof. John  D. Wirth, is director of the Center of Latin  American Studies at Stanford University.)  The United States should seek a negotiat ed settlement to the civil war in El Salvador,  which has claimed an estimated 20,000 lives  in the past two years.  Our current policy as defined most recent ly by Secretary of State Alexander Haig is  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  counterproductive. Increased economic and  military aid to maintain the Duarte junta is  likely to prolong the conflict, increase the  probability of massive human rights viola tions, and undercut moderate elements on  both sides of this complex, protracted and  tragic conflict.  The United States does have longstanding  and  legitimate  strategic  interests  in  the  region. But these can be served best by a  forward policy for the Caribbean Basin as a  whole, rather than by reacting piecemeal as  we do to epic changes sweeping through a  region which until recently was comfortably  under our influence and control.  Foreign aid legislation passed by Congress  last year took a step toward promoting a ne gotiated settlement by stipulating that fur ther military aid could only be sent to El  Salvador if demonstrated progress was made  on human rights and political reform. The  administration has declared  the situation  improved and is sending $55 million in emer gency military aid. But many in Congress  disagree, and a resolution introduced Feb. 2  <co-sponsored by Tim Wirth> would prohibit  military aid until Congress determines that  conditions established by  law have been  met.  Yet there are several paths to a more just  and economically viable social order. The  future need not be lit in neon flashing from  Havana. Thus, the United States must learn  to live with a variety of regimes, while de veloping an overall vision for a strategically  important world region that can no longer  be ignored.  El Salvador  is but one of many crises,  both real and potential. But it is a test of  statecraft. The task is not as the administra tion contends, to confront revolution which  it claims is formented from the outside but,  essentially, to channel the forces of change  toward political and economic solutions that  promote  economic  growth  and  human  rights.  To this end, the United States must end  its confrontation with Nicaragua, a  left leaning regime through which arms pass to  the Salvadoran  insurgents. Learning  to  work with Nicaragua is linked to promoting  a lasting settlement in El Salvador. In turn,  this links to placing restraints on Guatema la-a terrible violator of human rights while continuing to promote a more open,  less-aggressive regime in Honduras, to sup port democratic Costa Rica, and to maintain  close relations with strategically important  Panama. The parts must then be set in a co herent vision of the whole.  A settlement negotiated now, before more  violence and polarization occur, would be a  calculated risk. There can be no ironclad as surance that the loose coalition of centrist,  center-left and radical left elements which  currently comprise  the opposition Demo cratic Revolutionary Front <known as FDR>  would be able or willing to build a new polit ical system based on pluralism and demo cratic liberties.  Nor can we expect extreme right forces in  the junta, including the paramilitary death  squads, to acquiesce necessarily in the kind  of settlement that would be acceptable to  business and middle-class elements backing  Duarte.  It is certain, however, that more fighting  will further polarize, embitter and erode the  coalitions on both sides of this insurrection.  El Salvador will then ""fall,"" to use Haig's  term, by force of arms. Is there still time to  encourage a solution more compatible with  long-range U.S. interests?  A settlement, to be lasting and effective,  must be embedded in a larger program to  March 9, 1982  make the Caribbean Basin viable, both eco nomically and politically. Gone is the nearly  half  century of  regional  stability under  rightist dictators who  freed Americans  to  fight the Nazis and later the Cold War else where  than  in our back yard. Change  is  sweeping  through the region-however in convenient to us.  Rippling  outward,  a  coherent  forward  policy would be coordinated with oil-rich  Mexico and Venezuela, the emerging middle  powers of the Caribbean Basin.  The Japanese, who enjoy an enormously  one-sided trade advantage with the region,  should be asked to join a Caribbean Basin  Development Plan.  The Europeans should be asked as well to  support a program of  targeted  loans on  long-term, concessionary rates of interest to  offset the devastating impact of U.S. high  interest rates and the lack of capital in the  Basin.  Current policy toward El Salvador will not  work for long. Furthermore, the logical out come of confrontation is to treat the Carib bean Basin as our equivalent to the Soviet  Union's Eastern Europe. But the Soviets are  showing that imperial solutions for Poland,  the other captive satellites and Afghanistan  work poorly. if at all.  Needed is a new American policy toward  El Salvador in particular and  toward  the  Caribbean Basin  in general, a policy.  to  defend and advance legitimate vital  inter ests in ways that are compatible with Amer ican traditions and aspiration, while accom modating the equally legitimate forces for  change.e  H.R 5755 HOLDING THE LINE ON  ELECTRIC RATF.S  HON.

119,,97,-0.174,1045,3,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  today  to recognize and applaud  the  commitment to quality and excellence  in aviation made by the Reading Aero  Club, which celebrates its 50th anni versary on March 13, 1982. The Berks  County area is well served by this out standing organization.  It is my understanding  that  this  club, which has been in continuous op eration since March 1932, is the oldest  flying club in the Nation. It is a non profit corporation in which all mem bers hold equal shares and are eligible  to participate in the running of the  club. The basic purpose of the club  has remained the same for the last 50  years:  CTlo encourage aviation in general, to ac quire, preserve and disseminate valuable in formation and knowledge  through books,  lectures and pamphlets on the subject of  aviation; to acquire, own and maintain air craft, hangers,  club house and personal  property for the use of club members, and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to promote the safe use thereof in the inter ests of the protection of public and private  property.  Aviation was  first  established  in  Berks County, Pa., with the building  of Whander Field, our first official air port, just south of Leesport in October  of 1927.  It was at  this field  that a  group of aviators  joined together to  jointly own an aircraft. After  three  years  o_f  informal  operation,  the  group, mcorporated,  and  the  first  meeting of the Reading Aero Club was  held. In 1935, the group left Whander  Field, which had become too small for  their use, and established themselves  at Madeira Field, opposite the Read ing Fairgrounds. When this field could  no  longer be used because of  the  growth of the club, a strip of land was  selected comprising 60 acres about a  mile north of the present Reading Mu nicipal Airport.  In September 1937,  the members began construction of  the airstrip and hangers. The official  name of this field was Berks Airport.  One of the members of the club, Earl  Savage,  is credited with the first air  mail flight out of Reading in October  1937.  By October 1939, the Reading Mu nicipal Airport was a reality. In 1943  an all-girls flying club based at Madei~  ra Field, called the Flying Ten Club  asked to join and was accepted int~  the Aero Club. By 1946, the club had  100 members ranging in age from 16 to  60 years old. Berks Airport continued  to grow, and seven airplanes belonging  to the club were housed in two hang ers reserved for their use. In 1950, the  club acquired its first four-place plane  a Stinson Station Wagon. Throughout  the 1950's and 1960's the club main tained and  improved  its quarters at  Berks Airport. In 1965, the club began  to investigate the advantages of leas ing a space at the Reading Municipal  Airport. A suitable building was found  where  the club  today keeps  its air planes.  The outstanding accomplishments of  all the members of the Reading Aero  Club through the last 50 years are too  numerous to mention. A special trib ute, however, should be given to Mr.  Grant Blimline, president of the Read ing Aero Club from 1955 to 1957 and  presently the chairman of their board  of directors. It has been through his  tireless and continuous efforts  that  the club has been  able  to  survive  through difficult times. Mr. Blimline  became a member of the club shortly  after its formation and has served the  members faithfully ever since.  The members of the Reading Aero  Club can be proud of their excellent  contribution to the history of aviation  in Berks County and of their consist ent dedication to benefiting the avia tion community  in general and par ticularly at  the Reading Municipal  Airport. I know my colleagues will join  me in congratulating the members of  3739  t~e Read~g Aero Club on the occa sion of their golden jubilee anniversa ry and will wish  them many more  years of continued success.e  SOCIAL SECURITY PANELS  HON.

120,,97,-0.32,1045,3,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Speaker, in Decem ~er of 1977, the Congress created an  mdependent, bipartisan, nine-member  National Commission on Social Securi t~ .. The panel was made up of private  c1t~ns wh? were to conduct a 2-year  review and mvestigation of all areas of  social security and related progyoams  and then develop a report on the kind  of system that would best serve the  United States in the future.  A year ago this month, that Com mission  issued a  report  totaling 414  pages. This report included 88 recom mendations for improving the current  s?Cial security system. The Commis sion made these recommendations in  order that we could work to restore  the  program's  financial  soundness  strengthen public confidence  system and, finally, present ways  to  better our  social  security program.  Furthermore, the Commission recom ~ended specific changes in the medic a1d and supplemental security income  programs. Today, however, it appears  as though that report has been forgot ten, along with the time and energies  of those nine Commissioners and the  $2.5 million of the taxpayers' money  that went toward the study.  The present administration  is now  asking that a new social security panel  be created.  Its purpose:  to help  im prove and reform the social security  system by proposing  realistic,  long term  reforms  to put social security  back on a sound footing and to forge a  working, bipartisan consensus so that  the necessary reforms can be passed  into law.  On January 6, the Sheboygan Press  of Sheboygan, Wis., printed an editori al asking why the President plans to  have yet another commission complete  the same assignment. Then, on Janu ary 14, James J. Dillman, former vice  chairman of the National Commission  on Social Security, responded to the  editorial. I would like to share the edi torial and letter at this point in the  RECORD.  WHY, MR. PREsIDENT?  It was less ihan 10 months ago that the  National Commission  of Social Security  issued a provocative 414-page  report-the  result of an intensive two-year study-call ing for specific measures to rescue the ailing  Social Security system.

121,,97,0.494,1058,3,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  Congressman  and  myself, are reintroducing a bill which  will help  the housing  industry and  allow first-time home buyers a tax de duction to purchase a home.  As you know, the housing industry is  in a prolonged downturn. The need to  create  incentives  for  individuals  to  invest in the purchase of a home is  tantamount to the success of revitaliz ing the housing industry. We believe  the ""individual housing account""  is  one tool that can be used as a  long term solution to bring about a cure for  our ailing timber and housing indus try.  The concept is very similar to indi vidual retirement accounts, in fact the  bill  is  titled ""Individual housing ac count."" This bill will create a tax de duction for first-time home purchasers  if they start an ""individual housing ac count."" A single  individual may con tribute $5,000 yearly over a 10-year  period, with a maximum allowed con tribution of $20,000. A married couple  may file jointly and make a maximum  yearly  contribution  of  $10,000  and  $40,000 over a 10-year period. This bill  also allows a couple the flexibility of  establishing  two  separate  IHA  ac counts but the maximum allowed con tribution of $40,000  over  a  10-year  period does not change.  No one needs to tell you the econom ic costs to the Nation of the current  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  housing downturn. The Federal Treas ury lost more than $10 billion in per sonal  income  tax, corporate  income  tax,  and  social  security  payments.  Local  jurisdictions lost over $2.5 bil lion in real estate taxes in 1979 alone.

122,,97,0.312,1058,3,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, at  the  bottom of Capitol Hill on the left side  of the Mall rests the Air and Space  Museum of the Smithsonian. It would  do well to visit again this living tribute  to American inventive know-how. To  realize that the Wright Brothers, the  and  the Space  Shuttle are all homegrown, stirs in us  a deep sense of pride. Less glamorous,  but no less important, is  the special  exhibit on jet aviation. It is U.S. tech nology on parade. One of the principal  reasons contributing to the spectacu lar achievement in American aviation  is  the encouragement and protection  of invention, indeed it is part of our  Constitution. Article  I, section 8 di rects Congress to ""Promote the prog ress of science and the useful arts, by  securing for limited times to authors  and  inventors the exclusive right to  their respective writings and discover ies.""  More often than not, success is con tingent on cumulative effort and com bined inventions-the building blocks  of teamwork and ideas. Jet aviation is  a prime example. No one can do  it  alone.  In this special exhibit on  jet  aviation we can observe engineering  masterpieces, we  can appreciate  the  brilliance of the technical effort that  went into such engines as the J-47 and  the J-57.  They are the prototype for high per formance jet aircraft. One of the es sential elements  to the operation of  these complex engines is a fuel control  system and acceleration system invent ed  by Prof. Franklin Offner,  now  teaching at Northwestern Univesity in  Evanston, 111. Dr. Offner's credentials  as an inventor and scientist are with out peer. He was part of the Manhat tan project and has a number of other  patents to his name. He has contributMarch 9, 1982  ed to advancement in medical science  through his work  in medical  instru mention.  When Professor Offner should be  enjoying the fruits of his labor, he has  only a 30-year horror story to tell. His  saga threatens the patent law system  and the protection of small inventors  everywhere. He has fought a  lonely  battle against corporate giants  and  Federal Government  in  court  for  almost a generation.  Briefly, I would like to relate some  details about his legal battle to obtain  just compensation. In 1943, Professor  Offner, on his own initiative and his  own expense, started development of  an electronic fuel control system for  jet engines. By 1945, his development  had proceeded far enough so that the  Air Force asked for a voluntary, no cost demonstration. It was considered  a great success. He continued his de velopmental work and the Air Force  asked to purchase one of his fuel con trol systems at a total price of $7,500.  He built one for them, which they had  tested by an engine manufacturer. It  was again found to operate well, and  the development proceeded.  Because of this one sale of a device  he developed at his own expense, the  Government held it had a free license  to use his invention. They purchased  millions of dollars worth of controls  based on his invention from a major  jet engine manufacturer, and denied  him any compensation based solely on  this single purchase. He sought relief  in vain for years through the Court of  Claims. After this ugly experience Pro fessor Offner has avoided defense-re lated projects  like  the plague. The  public record documents the value of  his work with  respect  to electronic  control systems. A companion case in  another  court  says  of  Professor  Offner's invention:  It is clear that COffner'sl contribution to  the defense  effort was historic and  im mense .... It gave the U.S. a decided edge  over our international rivals. It saved the  government millions of dollars  in money  and time.  In  the  interest of  justice, science,  and protection for a small inventor, I  am introducing a bill for the private  relief of Professor Offner. No direct  compensation is provided, it merely is  a congressional referral to the Court  of Claims to review the issue. There is  no dispute as to who invented the elec tronic speed control system, the issue  concerns the use of that patent given  to Professor Offner.  Before concluding  I would  like  to  note  for  the  record  that Professor  Offner was offered $1 million by the  Air Force  to settle  this case out of  court. I believe it gives us a feel for  the strength of his claim. Ultimately,  the Offner case may lead to the pro tection  of  small  inventors  every where.e  ",1982
123,House,97,0.541,1071,3,Mr. BADHAM.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I would first  like  to  take this opportunity to commend my  good friend and colleague, the gentle man from Illinois <Mr. ANNUNZIO), for  his  leadership on  the Subcommittee  on Accounts. Under his chairmanship  the subcommittee has checked com mittee  spending. After a  decade of  ever accelerating committee spending,  ",1982
124,House,97,0.014,1084,3,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to commend the Secretary of Agricul ture, John Block, on a recent speech  that he gave at the Western States  Dairy Conference  in Seattle, Wash.,  on March 3, 1982.  During the House-Senate conference  debate on the 1981 farm bill, I asked  the administration to develop a pro gram  that would penalize  those  re gions the most which contribute the  most  to  the overproduction of milk.  Because the administration failed  to  develop such a proposal, I, as well as  many of my colleagues,  accepted a  level of milk supports that would not  cause  serious  economic problems  in  those production regions where supply  and demand for milk and milk prod ucts has been in relative balance. One  of those regions is the New England  States, especially my own State of Ver mont. January milk production in my  State, according  to  the U.S. Depart ment of Agriculture, was 2 percent less  than the 1981 production level for the  same month and 1 million pounds less  than the 1980 level of production for  the same month.  In his speech, the Secretary percep tively recognizes thatThe Western States must share their fair  responsibility for this problem <overproduc tion). California alone accounted for 24 per cent of CCC butter purchases last year       and 26 percent of the dry milk purchases.  Four Western States-and I am referring to  California,  Idaho, Oregon,  and Washing ton-accounted for 31 percent of our total  CCC purchases and 38 percent of our non fat dry milk purchases last year.  The Secretary thus recognizes  the  regional disparity in production, and, I  am convinced, is working toward devel oping an equitable solution. I support  and endorse his call for a 2-day nation al dairy economics symposium  to be  held in Kansas City later this month  in order to discuss ways to bring milk  production under control in an equita ble manner.e  A NEW PROPOSAL ON  ANTITRUST CONTRIBUTION  ",1982
125,Senate,97,0.078,1175,3,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, a recent  article  in  the Los Angeles Times,  brought  to my  attention  by Paul  Hoboy  of Hunter Engineering Co.,  says all that needs to be said about the  need for a strong Eximbank and the  erroneous economic assumptions upon  which the administration is basing its  bank policies. I ask that the text of  the article be printed in the RECORD.  The article follows:  [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. l, 1982]  ECONOMIC ILLITERACY AT THE TOP-CRIPPLING  EXPORT-IMPORT BANK AS BENEFIT FOR RICH  HURTS UNITED STATES  <By Ernest Conine)  If advance word is correct, the budget that  President Reagan sends to Capitol Hill next  week will again seek a sharp reduction in  funding for the U.S. Export-Import Bank.  It would be hard to find a clearer case of  being penny-wise and pound-foolish.  Most Americans  have  probably  never  heard of the Export-Import Bank. That's a  pity, because the Ex-Im could be of great  help in preserving American jobs in the face  of rising unemployment.  The bank is owned and operated by the  U.S. government. Its function is to make or  guarantee loans to foreign buyers of Ameri can-made goods on terms reasonably close  to those offered by heavily subsidized Euro pean and Japanese competitors.  All  the money  is spent in this country.  And, far from being a monstrous burden on  taxpayers, the Ex-Im over the years has ac tually returned more than $1 billion in divi dends to the U.S. Treasury.  Recently, the bank has been caught be tween the high interest rates at which it  must borrow and the lower rates at which it  must lend to compete with this country's  trading rivals. It is now losing money for the  first time in its history-an estimated $200  million in the current fiscal year.  Last year, when budget director David A.  Stockman was drawing up lists of proposed  cuts  in social programs  that benefit  the  poor, he shopped around for cuts  in pro grams that benefit the ""rich"" to prove the  Administration's evenhandedness.  Ex-Im was elected. At Stockman's urging,  Reagan proposed massive cuts in the bank's  lending authority for fiscal 1981 and 1982proposals that fortunately were blunted by  Congress. Even so,  the Ex-Im has had to  drastically curtail its operations.  Now the Administration is said to have de cided on still another proposal for a $700  million cut in the bank's direct-lending au thority and a $1.2 billion reduction in its  loan-guarantee activities.  The idea the Ex-Im credits are a form of  welfare for the rich at the expense of the  poor  is an extraordinary example of eco nomic illiteracy.  Keep in mind that lending authority isn't  the same as an appropriation. Ex-Im loans  come out of taxpayers' pockets only to the  extent that the bank's cost exceed loan re payments. The relatively small losses now  being experienced are more than offset by  the economic activity and the tax revenues  generated by Ex-Im loans.  One of every nine manufacturing jobs in  the United States is created and maintained  by export sales. Government experts figure  that every $1 billion worth of additional ex ports creates 50,000  taxpaying jobs; it fol lows that every $1 billion worth of lost sales  translates into 50,000 fewer jobs.  Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associ ates, after studying the economic effect of a  proposed Ex-Im loan to support the sale of  U.S.-made equipment  for a Buenos Aires  subway, concluded that the project would  result in a net gain to the U.S. government  of $762 million over a 10-year period.  Critics point out that a disproportionate  share of Ex-Im loans go to foreign custom ers of a relative handful of large U.S. com panies. But that is because the sort of big ticket items involved-commercial aircraft,  nuclear power plants, steam  turbines and  the like-are made only by large companies.  Even so, a substantial portion of the loan  money ends up in the pockets of smaller  companies and  their workers. More  than  1,000 suppliers, for example, are involved in  the manufacture of every nuclear power  plant exported by Westinghouse.  Yes, the critics say, but these sales would  be made anyway; these huge multinational  corporations can take care of themselves.  This  overlooks  the  realities  of  todays  global marketplace.  While the United States has been squeez ing its Export-Import Bank, foreign govern ments have been plunging ever more deeply  into the business of subsidizing export inter est rates substantially below those that can  be offered by U.S. exporters.  In  times past, U.S.  companies  enjoyed  such a huge  technological advantage that  they could do quite well despite predatory  financing  by  foreign  competitors. Those  days are over.  More often than not, the quality of U.S.  and foreign equipment is about the same.  The nod goes to the seller who can offer the  best credit terms. <A 1 % interest-rate differ ential can amount to tens of millions of dol lars on the sale of a nuclear power plant or  a fleet of airliners.)  U.S. exporters cite chapter and verse.  A French manufacturer won a $1.4 billion  order for two nuclear plants in Korea when  American companies were unable to match  French government lending terms. That one  order would have meant 33,000 man-years of  employment for U.S. workers.  Egypt was ready to sign a $1.8 billion con tract with an American consortium for the  modernization  of  its  telecommunications  system when  a European  group offered  more attractive financing terms. The Euro peans got the contract.  Boeing Vertol appears on  the verge of  losing  a  $56 million  helicopter  sale  to  Norway  because Aerospatiale  of France  offers financing at three percentage points  lower.  The list goes on and on.  The Reagan Administration  recognizes  these realities, but is putting its faith in dip lomatic efforts to persuade Japan and West  European countries to abstain from preda tory financing.  Progress was made in talks last October,  but not enough. Negotiations will  resume  this month, but the United States, having  unilaterally moved  to  cripple Ex-Im,  is  working from a weak negotiating position.  Some worried members of Congress are  pushing a ""war-chest"" bill to strengthen the  American hand by putting Japan and the  Europeans on notice, in effect, that we are  prepared to fight and win an interest-rate  subsidy war  if  the negotiations  fail  to  produce real results. But the Administration  won't go along.  It's odd that Ronald Reagan, who under stands that genuine arms reduction is more  likely if the Russians know that the alterna tive is an arms race that Moscow can't win,  is willing to practice unilateral disarmament  in the vitally important export field.e  COMPETITION, NOT CARTELS RECOMMENDATION  OF  THE  JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE  IN ITS 1982 REPORT  e ",1982

LEE H. HAMILTON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  OF INDIANA  Wednesday, March 10, 1982  e ",1982
127,,97,-0.171,1188,3,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like  to insert my Washington  report for Wednesday, March 10, 1982,  into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  SOLVING FARM PROBLEMS  The  depression-like  conditions  in  the  housing and automobile industries are well known, but Americans are becoming increas ingly aware of the acute problems faced by  farmers. Two consecutive years of unprofit able operations have pushed many farmers  to the brink of economic disaster. The pros pects for a quick recovery are not good.  The basic problem has been one of rising  production costs and falling r.rop prices. In  1981, good weather and more planting led to  a bumper crop which, when combined with  a  soft economy world-wide and slack ex ports, depressed commodity prices. Those  prices fell every month in 1981 <the first  time such a thing has happened since the  Great Depression), closing out 13 percent  lower than in 1980. At the same time, pro duction costs continued to rise. They went  up approximately 10 percent in 1981 after  an unusually steep climb in 1980. Fertilizer,  seed,  fuel, and  interest rates were all up  sharply. It now costs a farmer half again as  much to produce his commodities as it did  only four years ago.  The cost-price squeeze has caused a dra matic decline in net farm income. After a  good year in 1979, farmers in 1980 saw their  net income, adjusted for inflation, plummet  to the lowest level since the Great Depres sion. Net farm  income slid even  lower  in  1981  to a level of about $19 billion. There  may be a further decline this year.  Several specific steps to help the farmer  pull  through  these hard  times should be  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  given  serious  consideration. We might  broaden his access to credit, expand storage  facilities for his crops, increase his opportu nities for work off the farm, help him im prove his marketing techniques, and expand  his direct contact with consumers. However,  the two most important steps to assist him  are more difficult: We must boost agricul tural exports and bring interest rates down.  Over  the  past  decade,  exports  have  become the mainstay of our farm economy.  Two of every five acres harvested  in  the  United States  last year produced  for  the  export market. Our farmers have set twelve  export records in twelve years despite a per formance last year that was not as strong as  had been anticipated. Altho'..lgh several fac tors-such as growth of the world's popula  tion, rising demand for better diets in other  nations, and less foreign land which can be  committed to the production of food-indi cate more exports for the American farmer  over the long term, he may face ups and  downs in demand during the next few years.  For  example,  a  thirteenth  farm  export  record will probably not be set this year. We  must be more active than ever in our work  to promote farm exports.  First, we must improve our access to mar kets in other countries. This means oppos ing the massive export subsidies used by the  European  Economic  Community  in  an  effort to undersell us abroad. It also means  that we should try to lower barriers to our  exports, such as those now in existence in  Japan. At the same time, we should be cau tious about the tendency to protect our do mestic industries with unfair restrictions on  imports since such restrictions could well  lead to retaliation against our farm exports.  We must expand our programs to develop  markets and provide commercial loans as we  orient those programs more toward the de veloping nations of Latin America, Asia, and  Africa,  nations which  soon will  replace  Japan  and  the  developed  countries  of  Europe as our principal buyers.  Second, we must improve our ability to de liver our farm products to markets abroad.  This means that we do a better job of main taining our agricultural infrastructure and  cutting regulations which create domestic  barriers to our exports. It also means that  we should strive for more efficiency in the  export  sector,  perhaps  by  stimulating  export programs among co-ops or by pro moting export trading companies.  Third, we should try to minimize erratic  fluctuations in export demand, fluctuations  which have led to considerable variation in  net farm income over the past decade. The  pursuit of bilateral purchase-supply agree ments with Mexico, the Soviet Union, and  the People's Republic of China is very help ful  in  this connection. Embargoes, which  have damaged our reputation as a reliable  supplier and prompted our customers  to  look elsewhere for their purchases, basically  should not be used to achieve foreign policy  goals.  Farming  is  capital-intensive,  and  farm  debt has nearly doubled  in  the past five  years. Those farms with large borrowing rel ative to assets, mainly beginning and fast growing ones, have been hit hard. Defaults  and delinquencies are up sharply.  It is clear that an assault on high interest  rates is the other major action we need to  take. High interest rates are the major cost  production burden carried by our farmers.  Interest costs last year were up 19 percent  over  the 1980  level, with  farmers paying  almost as much for money as they paid for  their fuel and labor combined. Outlays for  March 10, 1982  interest reached $19 billion in 1981, an im mense sum equal to net farm income that  year.  It is my view that the federal budget defi cit is a primary cause of high interest rates.  The  deficit  undermines  investors' confi dence in the economy and forces the federal  government to borrow an excessive amount,  thus crowding others out of credit markets  and driving interest rates up. As long as the  federal government must borrow heavily to  finance the deficit, interest rates will stay  high.  The present economic program of  the  Reagan Administration depends on a loose  fiscal policy <the deficit is huge) and a tight  monetary policy <the supply of money  is  growing very slowly and interest rates are  high). The difficulty with such a program is  that  it  throws onto monetary policy  the  entire burden of the fight against inflation.  This approach is exactly the reverse of what  it should be. What is needed is a fundamen tal shift in the mix of fiscal and monetary  policies. Our goal should be to tighten fiscal  policy <move the budget rapidly toward bal ance) so  that monetary policy can be re laxed <the supply of money can be allowed  to grow somewhat more rapidly). One im portant result of such a shift would be a de cline in the interest rates which are proving  to be so harmful to farmers.e  IN THE BEGINNING-NOT GOD,  BUT THE IRS  HON.

128,,97,0.621,1188,3,Mr. HANSEN of Idaho.," Mr. Presi dent, in the beginning was not God,  but  the  Internal Revenue  Service.  Then came God with His great celes tial construction project-the creation  of Heaven and Earth.  It had to be so, else who would have  collected the taxes to pay for all the  Federal  inspections-or who would  have furnished the W-4's to determine  the withholding  tax of  those white collared heavenly paper shufflers and  those  blue-collared working  angels.  And certainly God could not be relied  on  to  file  those quarterly employer  taxes without being made to feel the  awesome power of the IRS.  Since the best way to get a taxpay er's attention is to smash the person  next to him, the IRS went after Satan.  They seized his possessions, including  his  last suit of clothes, and embar rassed him so badly that he is still a  ripe red.  The biggest problem  the IRS had  with old Belzebub's estate was how to  dispose of that kind of hot property  which was on the wrong side of the  tracks, populated with spiritual slum dwellers, not suited for development,  and infested with rats.  And God was  impressed-impressed  that the IRS could kick the devil out  of things like that.  ",1982
129,,97,-0.044,1201,3,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing a resolution to desig nate the week beginning June 7, 1982,  as National Theater Week.  The theater is one of our Nation's  finest  cultural  and  educational  re sources. It also generates significant  economic benefits, by providing jobs,  tourism, and other assets. It is entirely  appropriate that we focus attention on  the institutions, organizations, and in dividuals that bring theater to Ameri cans throughout our country by desig nating a week  in  their honor. This  week will make us realize that our the ater is perhaps the best in the world,  and will also pay tribute to the thou sands of  individuals  in professional  theater companies, high schools, col leges and universities, and community  theaters that work to bring the stage  alive for audiences across the land.  The American theater is not only a  cultural resource, but also an educa tional resource. The theater provides  access  to great literary works, and a  means to nurture talent and self-ex pression. To put it simply, the thea ter-whether a  large Broadway thea ter in Manhattan, or the stage of a  small  town-enriches  us  personally  and improves the quality of life in our  communities.  A nation's greatness is measured in  her cultural achievements. The Ameri can stage  truly graces our country,  and we should recognize its contribu tions by designating a week hailing its  strength  and vitality. Eleven State  arts councils, 48  theatrical organiza tions, and almost 100 theaters from 35  States across  the country have en dorsed the idea. I hope a majority of  my colleagues will join us in celebrat ing American theater by cosponsoring  this bill. My colleagues may be inter ested to know that a similar measure  has already been  introduced  in  the  Senate by Senator ExoN.

130,,97,-0.359,1214,3,Mr. PEYSER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to bring to the attention of my  colleagues another example of human  rights violations in the Soviet Union.  Igor Guberman is a Soviet Jew who is  presently  languishing  in  a  strict  regime  labor  camp  in  the  Soviet  Union.  In December 1978, Guberman and  his family applied for emigrations to  Israel and was refused. Soon after he  submitted his application Guberman  was approached by KGB agents who  wanted him ""to keep an eye on emi grating Jews and to denounce and pre pare provocations against Jewish ac tivists."" Guberman  refused  and  re fused again when the proposition was  repeated to him time after time. Final ly, on August 13, 1979, Guberman was  arrested. He was falsely charged with  the illegal purchasing and selling of  icons. For many years he has been col lecting these medieval relics which, in cidentally,  is  not  forbidden  under  Soviet law. That, however, seems  to  have been the pretext for the KGB to  bring criminal charges against him.  Yet, when KGB agents searched his  apartment, they were solely interested  in Guberman's notebooks, manuscripts  and letters from Israel. When asked  why they were not taking the icons,  they replied that the icons were of no  value. Despite  this, Guberman was  sentenced  to 5 years,  of which he  served the first 9 months of his sen tence in various prisons. Presently, he  lives with his wife and young son in a  ""free  settlement,  under  guard""  to  ""labor for  the national economy""  in  Rybinsky Rayon in Siberia.  Thursday, March  11, marks  the  second anniversary of the ""trial"" and  conviction  of  Igor Guberman, my  adopted prisoner of conscience. The  March 10, 1982  U .S.S.R. has confiscated his property  and continues to deny him his basic  human rights. I am here today to draw  the attention of all Americans to the  plight of this young man and to urge  that they contact Soviet officials  to  press for his release. The free world  must continue to protest actions such  as these and do all we can to condemn  the Soviets' noncompliance with inter nationally  recognized  human  rights  standards.e  THE  ADMINISTRATION'S  MIS MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONO MY  HON.

131,,97,-0.377,1214,3,Mr. MOFFETT.," Mr. Speaker,  the  administration's mismanagement  of  the economy has become so great that  virtually every segment of  the busi ness community is now speaking out  against  it.  In stark contrast  to  the  showers of praise that preceded and  followed  the passage of the Reagan  tax and budget program last year, we  are now confronted by increasing criti cism of the deepening recession and  endless, spiralling deficits.  There is a consensus among econo mists  and  businessmen  nationwide  that the deficits created by Reagan omics will render any recovery from  the current recession weak at best. As  the Government  incurs hundreds of  billions of dollars in new debt, it will  absorb as much as one-half of all the  credit available in the economy. These  deficits are the direct consequence of  the administration's excessive and in equitable slashes in the revenue base  of the Government combined with a  spectacularly  wasteful  Pentagon  budget.  The specter of ever-increasing defi cits has kept  interest  rates at very  high levels-levels so high that many  businesses  are  unable  to  borrow  money to invest in the future. Rather  than inspiring a huge new surge of in vestment, Reaganomics has  led  to a  significant crisis of confidence among  investors, as reflected in the 150 point  drop  in  the stock market since  the  Reagan  administration  took  office.  Indeed, as the leaders of the Nation's  savings institutions have put it, these  ""high  interest rates are creating an  economic and financial crisis  in  this  country."" I would like to enter in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  the complete  text of a  recent  statement by  the  presidents of the leading savings insti tutions of the country, in which they  called for a  fundamental  reversal of  the economic plans of this administra tion.

133,House,97,-0.316,1240,3,Mr. FROST.," Mr. Speaker,  unem ployment is now spreading into areas  generally considered  to be  recession  proof.  I represent a district in the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex and it is not ex actly the boom area it was before the  recession. Unemployment in the area  rose from 3.9 percent in December to  5.4 percent in January.  At the General Motors plant, which  is  located  in my district, 900 of  its  4,500-person work force were perma nently laid off in December. Another  3,000 have been off the job for 5 of the  first 9 weeks of 1982. And just 3 days  after returning from a 2-week  layoff  recently,  those 3,000 were  told  they  would be out of work  the week of  March 22.  Braniff Airlines, another major em ployer  in  the area, employed 15,000  workers 2 years ago. Now, only 9,500  of  those original 15,000 still have a  job.

134,House,97,-0.042,1253,3,Mr. HOLLENBECK.," Mr. Speaker,  this is a time for reflection.  I can recall my first meeting with  Cliff Case. It was in 1966 at a county  rally and I was a candidate for local  office, my first campaign. Of course,  I'd heard of him and read about him.  Everyone said that he was first elected  because of a pig farmer named Kra jewski but that he was a great vote  getter now. So all of us running were  happy with him heading the ticket.  But many people there did not know  Cliff Case the man, and many of them  were less than enchanted with his phi losophy. In fact,  there was almost a  ""we'll embarrass him tonight"" attitude  permeating over the crowd. Well, Cliff  stood there that evening in his rum pled brown suit and blue shirt and  talked of his love for America, his con cern for people and his convictions as  to what he saw our party standing for.  And he received a standing ovation.  Since that evening I had occasion to  call upon his advice and counsel on  several occasions  as  I  held various  public positions. He gave it sincerely  and frankly to me as he did to others.  And one of the many impressive traits  of  the man was  that he seemed  to  follow the careers of those of us who  sought his counsel. I shall never forget  a moment on an afternoon when he  traveled  from Washington  to New  Jersey in a near hurricane in the fall  of 1980 to appear at a labor rally for  me. He said to me,  Son, I'm proud of you. I see you're making  the same friends I have, and the same en emies too.  I shall always cherish those words as  words of praise from a man who felt so  deeply  and  compassionately  for  human beings and  their  rights and  dignity and who fought so hard in the  causes of peace and justice.  Another moment remains  fixed  in  my memory. Shortly before the 1978  primary, we shared a plane ride back  to Washington after a  rally on his  behalf. We were the only passengers.  Relaxing, he explained to me the phi losophy he had adopted and lived up  to for the past 30 years. I can only par aphrase it because I do not have his  eloquence. It was a simple philosophy  of kindness, courtesy, and unwavering,  unselfish compassion for, and under standing of all the people of this socie ty and a dedication to world peace. I  hope his goals and  that philosophy  will not be forgotten. I, for one, will  never forget.e  e ",1982

136,Senate,97,0.1,1318,3,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased  to  introduce  legislation  that  would restore unemployment compen sation benefits for veterans who have  honorably served their country. This  bill would correct  inequities enacted  last year  as part of  the Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act.  To effect savings in the federally fi nanced unemployment compensation  for  ex-servicemen  <UCX>  program,  Congress approved several changes in  the eligibility of former service mem bers to collect unemployment compen sation. Unfortunately, while  the  law  needed to be tightened, Congress went  too far and created unfairness in its  attempt at reform. The reconciliation  act establishes new requirements that  prevent honorably discharged veterans  with excellent records from receiving  unemployment  benefits  simply  be cause they chose not to reenlist. An in dividual receiving a general discharge  who did not measure up to reenlist ment criteria is, however, permitted to  collect unemployment. In effect,  the  new law penalizes those veterans who  have served their country honorably  and effectively but who are unable to  immediately  find  new  civilian  jobs.  More  than 110,000 veterans are ex pected to be denied benefits in fiscal  1982 under the new criteria.  When  the results of  the new  law  became apparent, veterans' organiza tions,  several Members of Congress,  and the General Accounting Office all  criticized the unfairness of the new re strictions. I heard from many Maine  veterans who had not been informed  of the change in the law and suffered  financial hardship because they were  ineligible  to receive benefits, despite  being unable to find employment.  Military  service  managers  inter viewed  by  the General Accounting  Office pointed out several differences  between civilian and military employ ment which cause the new law to be  unfair  to  former  service members.  Unlike most civilian  jobs, enlistment  in the service is a contract for a speci fied period, and it is not desirable for  all who enlist to make careers of the  military. Second, it is difficult for serv ice members to have access to the ci vilian job market near their place of  residence as they are often stationed  far from their homes. A veteran re turning  to  his  hometown may  be  unable to find new work immediately.  The legislation that I am proposing  would eliminate the inequities in the  existing law, while strengthening the  eligibility  requirements  that existed  prior to passage of the reconciliation  act.  My bill would require an individual  to have a full 2 years of active, contin uous military service and  to be dis charged or released under honorable  conditions in order to qualify for UCX  benefits.  Also,  a  former  service  member could not begin to receive un employment compensation until  the  fifth week  following his  separation  from the military. This 4-week waiting  period provides an incentive for veter ans to seek employment immediately  and answers  the concern  that some  former service members might apply  for unemployment compensation and  not really seek employment until their  benefits  expire.  Finally,  veterans  would be permitted to receive no more  than 13 weeks of benefits. These provi sions are modeled on language includ ed  in  legislation  approved  by  the  House last December, the Miscellane ous Revenue Act of 1981, and intro duced  by  several Members  of  the  House of Representatives. I hope that  my  bill's  similarity  to  the House passed bill will enable the Senate to  quickly rectify the problems in current  law.  Mr. President, I believe that the re strictions  imposed by my bill would  meet the concerns of those who feel  that the UCX program was  too  lax  prior to the passage of the reconcilia tion bill last year. At the same time, it  would  insure  that our veterans,  to  whom we owe so much, are given some  assistance in their transition to the ci vilian work force.  The present rate of unemployment  means that it will be even more diffi cult  for  former service members  to  find  suitable  civilian  employment  upon leaving the military. That is why  it is imperative that we act quickly to  implement more equitable eligibility  requirements for the UCX program.e  By Mr. MITCHELL:  S. 2193.

137,Senate,97,-0.355,1357,3,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President,  I  re cently cosigned a letter with a number  of my colleagues  indicating my ex treme concern about the possibility of  advanced weapons sales to Jordan. I  am  increasingly  apprehensive  about  the  impact  that  these  particular  sales-of advanced F-16  fighter  air craft and Hawk mobile missiles-could  have on the strategic and tactical bal ance of forces in the Middle East.  I am apprehensive for a variety of  reasons, not the least of which is Jor danian King Hussein's view of  the  prospect and desirability of peace in  the Middle East. In the March 15 edi tion of U.S. News & World Report,  King Hussein was quoted in an inter view. When asked if Jordan would ever  join the Camp David peace process,  the King replied:  What peace process? I believe the end is in  sight for Camp David with the Israeli with drawal from Sinai. The Palestinian auton omy proposals will never work.  The ominous tone in King Hussein's  remarks does not lead me to conclude  that Jordan will be a willing and con structive partner in bringing a peace ful resolution to the critical problems  of the region.  Furthermore, the official Jordanian  attitude about Egypt's phenomenal ef forts  at peacemaking under Anwar  Sadat left much to be desired in terms  of Jordanian support for U.S. goals  and  initiatives. Consider the further  comments by King Hussein from the  March 15 U.S. News & World Report  interview.  Q. Would the return of Egypt to the Arab  world strengthen this Arab consensus you  say you seek?  A. The fact that the situation developed  where Egypt did not play  its role  in  the  Arab family has caused me great pain.  I  hope and pray that before too long this will  be  rectified  and Egypt will  once  again  resume its rightful position and responsibil ities. But in the end we have to form a sort  of collective cooperation among the overall  majority of Arab States.  What ""role in the Arab family"" did  Egypt fail  to play  in attempting  to  make peace with Israel? The role of  participating in a  jihad, or holy war,  against Israel? The revelation of the  depth and pervasiveness of the idea  that Israel must cease  to exist as a  state, even among Arab States we are  now calling moderate, is disturbing in  itself,  though  it  is no surprise. The  surprise to me, Mr. President, is that  the administration seems so eager to  pursue arms deal after arms deal with  nations committed to the destruction  of Israel, it is counter to every tenet of  American policy.  I have repeated over and over again  in this body my arguments in favor of  maintaining our  traditional  reliance  on the strength and stability of Israel  as the linchpin of our policies in the  Middle East. During the F-15 debate  in 1978,  the AWACS/F-15 enhance ment debate of  last year, and  in a  series of lesser battles over the future  of U.S. policies and priorities in the  Middle East, I and many of my col leagues have cautioned about the un dercutting of  Israel  in  the Middle  East-not because of tradition, and not  simply for the very real and important  moral and political commitments  to  which we are properly bound; but for  the security and stability of the region  itself.  These issues have recently been ad dressed in a letter to President Reagan  from  12 American  Jewish organiza tions and 108 local Jewish community  relations councils.

138,,97,0.178,1396,3,Mr. EVANS of Delaware.," Mr. Speak er, I  rise to commend a new private  sector  jobs  training  initiative, ""Win ning a Stake in America."" This bold  program has been undertaken by the  life and health insurance companies of  America, with other representatives of  the business community.  In a recent meeting several Members  of Congress have agreed to work with  the chief executive officers of the in surance companies,  to examine new  approaches to job training through a  private-public partnership. Together  we will closely  review any proposed  jobs  training  legislation, drawing on  the vast  experience of  the private  sector to insure a successful approach  to a vital issue.  Initiatives such as the one undertak en through the Center for Corporate  Public  Involvement will allow us  to  avoid many of  the mistakes of  the  past, while insuring that hope and op portunity remain central to the Ameri can dream.  I ask unanimous consent to include  in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a sum mary of  the program,  ""Winning  a  Stake in America.""  SUMMARY  Building upon a 15-year program of public  involvement by its companies, the life and  health insurance business, working in part nership with other business organizations,  has committed itself to help stimulate and  support voluntary community initiatives de signed to help train and place more hard-to employ disadvantaged  citizens  in perma nent, private-sector jobs.  The initiative will concentrate particular ly  upon  hard-to-employ  disadvantaged  youth and young adults, single low-income  women with children, and those with special  problems  such as  ex-offenders and drug  abusers.  Working  at  the  community  level  in  tandem with other businesses, the schools,  civic  and  community-based organizations,  labor, and local and state governments, this  initiative by life and health insurance com panies will attempt to help:  (1) Identify hard-to-employ disadvantaged  citizens in a community who can be placed  in private Jobs through improved job infor mation, training, and placement;  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  (2)  Inventory private  job openings  in a  community for which hard-to-employ disad vantaged  citizens  can  be  recruited  and  trained;  <3>  Improve  opportunities  for  hard-to employ disadvantaged citizens to gain basic  skills required in private jobs;  <4> Help  hard-to-employ  disadvantaged  citizens with special problems such as low income single women with children, ex-of fenders, and drug abusers, cope with these  problems as a pre-condition to finding and  holding a private job;  (5) Provide pre-job exposure of hard-to employ disadvantaged citizens  to  the  re quirements of the privatC' job market and  workplace so that they can gain the know how and confidence required  to find and  hold a job; and  (6) Assist businesses in providing compen satory on-the-job training and counseling to  help hard-to-employ disadvantaged workers  upgrade their jobs and income.  Life and health insurance companies can  bring five special strengths as partners in  voluntary  community  initiatives  to  deal  with  the problems of  the hard-to-employ  disadvantaged citizen:  Leadership  from  company chief execu tives and other officers to galvanize a spe cial community-wide or company-sponsored  initiative;  Volunteered time from employees and af filiated agents to help provide instruction,  counseling, information, job placement, and  administrative and  financial management  for  a  community-wide or  company-spon sored initiative;  Investments  in  job-creating commercial,  industrial, and residential projects that pro vide special opportunities to train hard-to employ young adults while permanently im proving the job base and physical well-being  of communities and neighborhoods;  Financial  contributions  to  community  education,  training, counseling and place ment projects and day care drug and alcohol  abuse, and ex-offender rehabilitation pro grams; and  Company hiring and personnel develop ment programs designed to place and train  more hard-to-employ disadvantaged citizens  in jobs within the life and health insurance  business.  The Center for Corporate public Involve ment, working closely with such organiza tions as the National Alliance of Business,  the Committee for Economic Development,  the American Bankers Association, the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, National Associa tion of Manufacturers, the National Insti tute for Work and Learning, and the Acade my for State and Local Government, will  provide information and technical advice on  request to any company planning and imple menting its own program or participating in  a community-wide effort. A team of expert  consultants convened by the Center will be  available to any company on call.  The Center will also serve as a clearing house and regularly disseminate  informa tion useful to companies, monitoring and re porting on their experience and progress.  The director of the center is Mr. Stanley  G. Karson, 1850 K Street NW., Washington,  D.C., 20006 (202) 862-4047.

139,,97,-0.4,1396,3,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker,  the  U.S.  Customs  Service  seized  3,748  pounds of cocaine, with a street value  of $950 million, at Miami Internation al Airport yesterday. The seizure was  due to the alertness of a single cus toms  inspector, Mr. Al Tagliaferro,  and he certainly deserves our highest  commendation for this achievement.  Howev~r. such seizures are normally  the result of the work of dozens or  more agents, months of investigative  work and the cooperation of a number  of Federal, State and  local agencies  working together. It requires a strong,  on-going commitment at the highest  levels of Government of the personnel,  equipment and  resources  to make a  dent in the huge illegal drug business  in the United States.  The administration has recently as signed a Federal task force  to south  Florida to attack the related problems  of crime, narcotics trafficking and ille gal immigration which have afflicted  this community. The  task force has  pledged a  temporary influx of scores  of additional agents and money into  the State of Florida for this purpose  and this is indeed welcome and long awaited.

140,Senate,97,-0.426,64,7,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President,  the  Downriver  Community  Conference  Job Center is a unique and highly ef fective  job  retraining  center.  Its  growth and success if truly phenome nal, and it can serve as a model for  other programs around the Nation. I  have worked closely with this fine or ganization and have seen firsthand the  benefits it has brought to the Down river area. The D.C.C. not only offers  services, but it also offers hope for the  people of Michigan that the present  economic conditions will take a favor able turn.  I ask that an article by Pat Henegar  which appeared in the Lincoln Parker  of Lincoln Park, Mich., describing the  successes of the D.C.C. be printed in  the RECORD.  WHY Is DCC's Jos CENTER SuccESSFUL?  <By Pat Henegar)  WYANDOTTE.-There  are  other  efforts  being made to return the unemployed to the  active work force, but none as comprehen sive as the Downriver Community Confer ence Job Center at 140 Superior.  Here, under one roof, are retraining class es, skills workshops, business assistance and  aid for the families of the unemployed-a  variety of services which combine to make  this ""the only center of its kind anywhere,""  according to those who administer the pro grams.  And, according to the participants in one  workshop, ""These people <the center staff)  are doing one helluva job for us!""  The DCC, a cooperative organization of  the governments of 15 <currently) Down river cities and townships, first got into the  job training business on a  limited basis in  1979 when programs were set up through  the Wayne County Comprehensive Employ ment and Training Act <CETA), explained  Richard Buss, the center's business assist ance manager.  The concept of the extensive retraining  program, he said, was born in the summer  of 1980 when the mayors of Ecorse and Wy andotte came to the DCC for help in dealing  with the problems of plant closings in their  cities: Dana Corp. in Ecorse and the BASF  South Works in Wyandotte.  In response, the DCC formed the Down river employment task force, made up of  business people, local government officials,  representatives of organizations and unions.  The task force put together a plan for re training  and  re-employment,  termed  the  ""economic readjustment project,"" that was  the basis for an application to the U.S. De partment of Labor for grant money.  A $1.2 million grant was approved as a na tional demonstration project to be initiated  on Oct. 1, 1980. A year later, the labor de partment awarded the DCC a $4.8 million  planned expansion grant.  ""This  is  the  only  publicly,  federally  funded retraining program in the county,""  according  to DCC director Dewitt Henry,  who pointed out that there were 700 new  enrollees in the retraining program just in  the past month.  One of the first steps in the DCC's ap proach to Downriver's unemployment situa tion was the establishment in June 1980 of a  ""hot line"" to assist telephone callers find  help for those problems related to being un employed. The ""hot line"" was started with out extra funding. Buss said, since it was  staffed with CET A workers.  According to Nancy Nagle, supervisor of  the ""hot line,"" the service is currently aver aging 55 to 95 calls a day during the hours it  is staffed, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. The workers  have  an  extensive  file  containing  about  3,000 cards  listing agencies, organizations,  special programs and other sources of aid.  Local newspapers are read regularly to keep  the files up to date and possibly locate new  sources.  A unique service of the ""hot line,"" Nagle  said, is the Health Care Referral Network  which offers free or low cost medical treat ment  to unemployed. Started with seven  physicians last July, the program now lists  51 volunteer physicians and has the coop eration of all seven Downriver hospitals,  Nagle said. Pre-employment physical exams  are also provided. The Wayne County Medi cal Society was ""a great help"" in setting up  the program, Nagle added.  Other areas in which the ""hot line"" com monly helps, according to Nagle, include referring  people  to  the  proper  place  for  energy assistance; acting as advocate in case  of trouble with other agencies; referring to  various types of counseling, or to the DCC's  substance  abuse  program;  and  finding  sources  for  emergency  clothing or  food  needs. In the latter case, Nagle said local  churches have been particulary helpful with  their food banks.  Calls for emergency shelter, she said, are  a big problem. While the ""hot line"" workers  can sometimes find  temporary shelter for  people in an emergency situation, the area  has no public housing and if people have  lost  their home of been evicted,  there  is  really no where to refer them.  The major retraining program that was  funded by the federal government as a dem onstration project, according to Buss, is lim ited  to persons who have  lost  their  jobs  from a specific company's closing. The ini tial grant was for those who had been em ployed with Dana and BASF.  The second grant will assist people who  have lost jobs because of the closing of Ford  Motor Company's Michigan Casting Center  in Flat Rock and Firestone Steel Products  Co. in Riverview. Some persons laid off from  Pennwalt Corp. in Wyandotte will be includ ed in the new program for comparison pur poses, Buss said. The idea is to compare the  situation of workers who have been laid off,  possibly indefinitely, with those who have  lost their jobs because of a plant closing.  In addition to the major program, there  are CET A funds  to assist anyone laid off  within the last six months. However, Buss  pointed out that this  is  the  last year of  CETA as it is currently funded.  CET A, or some other form of job retrain ing,  is currently being considered by  the  Congress, the business assistance manager  said, and Job Center director Freda Ruther ford was in Washington last week testifying  before a Senate labor subcommittee on job  retraining. Center personnel were also asked  to review proposed legislation in terms of  what other funds are also available for eco nomically disadvantaged persons who can  best learn a skill in an on the job situation.  This program pays half their salary during  the training period up to a maximum of 44  weeks.  One aspect of retraining is classes set up  by the center which are concentrated nearly  full time training in highly skilled catego ries. These generally  run from 18  to 39  weeks.  In other cases, persons with suitable skills  and background interested in a good career  area are enrolled in a community college or  trade or proprietary school. The aim here,  center personnel explained,  is  to develop  marketable  skills  in one  year,  targeting  toward an associate's degree. Occasionally a  person might be enrolled in a four-year col lege, especially if a year or less is all that  would be  required  for  them  to complete  work toward a degree.  The center also holds  job seeking skills  workshops aimed at reinforcing unemployed  persons' confidence,  and providing  them  with such skills as resume writing and effec tive interviewing.  While unemployed persons are  learning  new skills,  their families are getting rein forcement  through a  spouse support pro gram.  The spouse, a staff member commented, is  often ""trying to hold everything together"" take some of  the pressure off the unem ployed person,  explain  to  the kids why  there isn't money for a special treat, put off  the bill collectors.

145,House,97,0.332,103,7,Mr. BUTLER.," Mr. Speaker, econom ic uncertainties have been a way of life  for  the American  farmer  for many  years. For a variety of reasons, these  have  become  increasingly  acute  in  recent years and have nothing to do  with the policies of the Reagan admin istration. All of you, I am sure, will  recall that the recent tractor descent  by farmers on Washington took place  under  another  administration  at  a  time when both Houses of Congress,  as well, were controlled by the other  party.  For the most part, the problems of  the American farmer have been a long  time in the making. In part they are  structural and are tied to policies pe culiar to agriculture. But the problems  of the American farmer are also tied  to the state of the general economy  and  are made worse  by  the  same  plagues that beset industry and com merce:  continued high  interest,  the  previous high rate of inflation, the ef fects of over regulation on productivi ty,  the  availability  of  capital  to  expand and of loan money to finance  an adequate cash flow. Well, the Re publican Party did not get us in this  economic mess; it was Democratic poli cies and Democratic  leadership  that  did  it. Now Republican policies and  leadership are beginning  to address  these problems and  I  am confident  that we will be successful. Just last  month, inflation dropped to its lowest  level in 17 years and interest rates are  down from a high of 21.5 percent in  1980 to 16.5 percent as of April 1982.  In  addition,  progress  is  also  being  made  on  problems peculiar  to  the  farmer, such as exports.  Fundamental to the future success  of the American farmer is finding new  markets for his products. Increasingly,  this has been accomplished by expand ing exports to both developing and de veloped countries; in fact, in the past  10 years, agricultural exports have in creased 450 percent.  Agricultural exports to Japan have  contributed to this growth. However,  Japanese trade barriers have artificial ly restricted the market for American  agricultural  products,  exacerbating  our trade imbalance with Japan and  fueling  public  sentiment  that  the  United States adopt reciprocal meas ures.  In January of this year, I traveled to  Japan as a participant in the United  States-Japan  parliamentary  ex change program. I am satisfied that  the Japanese Government does under stand our concerns and is sincere in its  desire to respond to them. While we  certainly have a long way to go on this  road, already, trade talks with Japan  have resulted in the liberalizing of 36  nontariff barriers affecting agriculture  and there are positive signs of addi tional movement on  these matters.  For example, after a series of meetings  and consultations, Japan has agreed to  meet next October-6 months ahead  of schedule-to negotiate the removal  of quotas on beef and citrus products.  In  addition,  after  several  years  of  trying,  the Government has  finally  gotten  the Japanese Government  to  agree to focus on the legality of their  agricultural quotas  terms of  the  GATT.  While trade barriers have been the  focus of debate for improving agricul tural exports to Japan, new coopera tive programs between our countries  has further expanded Japanese mar kets.  For  example,  the U.S.  Feed  Grain Council has worked closely with  Japanese livestock producers for more  efficient production of high quality  Japanese beef. This has created a rap idly  growing market  for American  in  ",1982
146,,97,-0.269,116,7,Mr. HEFTEL.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  honored to  introduce a  joint resolu tion today with my distinguished col league  from Hawaii, Mr. AKAKA,  to  designate January 28, 1983, as ""Native  American Day."" This resolution calls  on all Americans to reflect upon the  contributions Native Americans have  made to our culture and to mark the  occasion with ceremonies and activi ties which reinforce the pride which  we all have in those first Americans.  The Native Americans are a link to  our cultural past. We, in Hawaii, have  been greatly influenced by our unique  ethnic  origins  and  are  particularly  proud of our heritage. Many Ameri cans are probably not even aware of  the  role our  indigenous populations  played  in our Nation's development.  By setting aside a day  to reflect on  past accomplishments of Native Amer icans, we, as a nation, will benefit. In  gaining new insights into our past, we  will  learn more  about ourselves  as  Americans. The very essence of  the  American way is rooted in the lasting  contribution of our Native Americans,  a proud people who joined with an im migrant population to forge a united,  pluralistic Nation, the envy of every  society on Earth. We must never lose  sight of our Nation's roots. Hopefully,  Native American Day will  raise  the  consciousness of the American people  to look back to their humble begin nings and to look to America's future  with pride and with optimism.  I am pleased to note that companion  legislation,  introduced  by  Senators  INOUYE and MATSUNAGA and 26 other  Senators, has already been approved  by the Senate. I hope my colleagues in  the House will join with me in cospon soring this resolution to pay tribute to  our Native citizens and to honor the  American spirit. The  resolution  fol lows:  H.J. RES. 472  Joint resolution to designate January 28,  1983, as ""Native American Day""  Whereas Native Americans have made im portant contributions  to  the cultural and  social history of the Nation; and  Whereas Native Americans are now as suming a greater role in the economic life of  the Nation; and  Whereas it is appropriate to extend recog nition  to  Native  Americans  for  their  achievements as citizens of the Nation: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  May 3, 1982  in Congress assembled, That January 28,  1983, is hereby designated as ""Native Ameri can Day"".

WILLIAM FRENCH SMITH,  Attorney General, U.S. Department of Jus tice, Washington, D. C.  DEAR MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL: At yester day's Judiciary Committee hearings on the  budget for the Department of Justice, we  discussed  the  bills  pending  before  the  Senate which would withdraw the jurisdic tion of the Supreme Court over federal con stitutional issues. In response to your sug gestion, I am formally requesting the De partment of Justice views on S. 17 42.  This legislation, if enacted, would remove  Supreme Court and lower federal court ju risdiction over the issue of prayer in the  schools. An identical provision passed the  Senate in April of 1979 by a vote of 51 to 40.  Following that vote,  the House Judiciary  Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and  ORDER OF PROCEDURE  ",1982
149,House,97,0.342,207,7,Mr. DERWINSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I  join  in  expressing my  support  for  House Resolution  200, which  con demns  the unjust  imprisonment of  Benedict Scott, an American citizen,  sentenced to hard labor by Soviet au thorities.  Benedict Scott, also known by his  Lithuanian name Vytautas Skoudis,  was born the son of Peter Scott Skou dis  and  Elizabeth Markevicius  on  March 21, 1929 in Chicago, Ill., birth  certificate number 13870. He was also  baptized at Our Lady of Vilna Church,  2327 West 23d Place, Chicago, Ill., all  of which is fully documented. In the  1930's Scott  returned  to Lithuania;  however, following  the aftermath of  World War II and the illegal Soviet oc cupation of Lithuania, Scott had been  denied his U.S. citizenship.  Skoudis, a geologist, was arrested in  January 1980,  for working with  the  Catholic Committee for  the Defense  of Believer's Rights in Lithuania, and  for expressing his protest of the illegal  Soviet occupation of Lithuania. He is  now serving a 7 year sentence since  December 1980,  in a  remote Soviet  prison camp in Mordovskaja, U.S.S.R.  As a member of the Lithuanian Hel sinki Group,  Skoudis  appealed  to  Soviet authorities for full implementa tion of human rights guaranteed by  the Soviet constitution; however, this  appeal was denied. Skoudis was then  dismissed  from  his  faculty  post at  Vilnus  University  for  supposed  ""amoral conduct."" Finally,  this was  followed by his full arrest in 1980, and  then sentencing  to 7 years of hard  labor  for  anti-Soviet  agitation  and  propaganda.  This blatant  and  callous manner  used by the Soviets to repress religious  beliefs and human rights guaranteed  by their nonfunctioning constitution is  just another example of the massive  failings of communism in the U.S.S.R.  The Soviets' complete  disregard of  Skoudis' American  citizenship  show  clearly the unwillingness of the Sovi ets to deal honestly within the frame work of the Helsinki accords and will  only make a mockery of any further  negotiations  involving false promises  to individual rights.  It is  time to call the bluff of the  Soviet Union and put an end to their  excellent propaganda, which is openly  exposed by the number of imprisoned  dissidents like Benedict Scott serving  sentences throughout Siberia.  I regret that a recent accident keeps  me from being on the floor today.e  ",1982
150,House,97,0.07,207,7,Mr. FISH.," Mr. Speaker, when a U.S.  citizen is held against his will in a for eign country, it is our duty and respon sibility to do our utmost to seek his re le&.Se.  In the case of Benedict Scott,  the subject of House Resolution 200,  we  in  the Congress should demand  that this American citizen be permit ted to return to his homeland.  Benedict Scott, an American born of  Lithuanian parents in 1929, was 1 year  old when his family moved to Lithua nia in 1930. Ten years later, Lithuania  was  invaded  and  occupied  by  the  Soviet Union. The United States has  always refused to recognize this illegal  annexation. Each year, Members of  Congress,  on Lithuanian  Independ ence  Day,  strongly  condemn  the  Soviet attack on Lithuania.  Benedict Scott has been active in the  movement for  religious freedom and  independence  in Lithuania for many  years. As  a  scientist, geologist, and  teacher at the University of Vilnius,  Scott became a  leader on behalf of  basic rights in Lithuania. For his ac tions, the Soviet authorities arrested  him and charged him with anti-Soviet  agitation  and propaganda. Benedict  Scott is now in prison, serving 7 years  hard labor.  ",1982
151,House,97,-0.267,233,7,Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.," Mr.  Speaker, we have a good number of  Members who would like to participate  and  I would  like  to enter  into  the  RECORD  just a couple of statistics.  I  will be very brief.  I mentioned earlier that in the Agri culture Committee  this morning we  were talking about FmHA loan def er rals, that is, the proceedings used by  the Farmers Home Administration to  foreclose on a client or a borrower.  Some statistics I used this morning il lustrate how serious the situation is.  There is something called an accel eration notice, and I  think it means  what  it says.  If you are borrowing  money from a bank or from the Farm ers Home Administration to be accel erated means what it says-they accel erate the terms of the loan.  I want to provide you with a statistic  with respect to the acceleration notice.  A Department of Agriculture spokes man told our committee earlier that  there were about 600 acceleration no tices sent out from October 1981  to  December 1981 by the Farmers Home  Administration.  Six  hundred. That  came  from Mr. Naylor  of USDA,  before the full Agriculture Committee.  As of March 31, 1982,  there were  2,078  acceleration notices  sent out.  That is a 250-percent increase between  February 1 and March 31 in accelera tion notices.  There is another thing called servic ing by the Farmers Home Administra tion, and if I ever get serviced, I guess,  in any capacity with respect to credi tors,  I hope  it  is not  the way  the  Farmers Home Administration  serv ices.  Some of that servicing suggests that  if you do not do it their way you have  got 3 months or 6 months left on the  farm.  We hear these stories all of the time.  We had a USDA report, dated March  31, 1982, stating that 5,137 servicing  letters were sent out in the month of  March. That compares with 2,074 sent  out in the month of February. The  fact  is  that we have nearly doubled  the number of servicing letters in the  month of March from  the previous  month. All of the statistics that deal  with the industry of agriculture and  with family farming show that we are  headed toward very, very serious trou ble. The farmers are in the worst fi",1982

I  will  be  proud  to  join with  ""Mother"" Nellie Grier,  the parade's  grand marshal, and many others  in  marching through the streets of our  city to honor the rich cultural herit age of America's black people. This  year's parade celebrates the contribu tions of black women to our country,  and  the selection of  the 82-year-old  Mother Grier as the grand marshal is  an outstanding reminder of the many  roles that black women play in build ing better communities. As the found er  and  director  of  the Emmanuel  Senior Citizens Day Care Center, she  has offered comfort and healing to our  city's elderly; and as organizer of the  Newark Senior Citizens Council and a  member of the board of the anti-pov erty agency, United Copununity Corp.,  she has been an activist for positive  social change. She  is  a  leader who  serves as an example to black women  everywhere.  Mother Grier will  be  joined  on  Sunday by 11 other black women from  my district who have distinguished  themselves as leaders in the cause for  social  justice. They are Dr. E. Alma  Flagg, Newark's  first  black  female  May4, 1982  principal; Trish Morris, director of the  Newark Day Center; State  senator  Wynona Lipman; Dr. May Burch,  founder of the Leaguers, Inc.; former  municipal court judge Golden E. John son; Betty Austin,  founder of Neo Fight,  Inc.; Essex County Register  Larrie Stalks; community activist Eliz abeth Beaman; Essex County Demo cratic  committeewoman  Queen  E.  James; Amelia  Steward,  owner  of  Steward's Restaurant; and Doris E.  Green,  placement  advisor  at Essex  County College.  These dedicated individuals follow in  the  footsteps  of  countless  black  women who have enriched our Na tion's culture over the course of the  past 206 years. In education, we, of  course, look to Mary McLeod Bethune  as a model; in literature, Gwendolyn  Brooks comes to mind as one of Ameri ca's finest, most beautiful and  rele vant, poets;  in medicine, Dr. Mary  Chinn toiled for a lifetime to improve  medical services  in Harlem and Dr.  Jane Wright of New York is dedicating  her life to cancer research; in the arts,  black women have overwhelmed us  with  their brilliance  in music, with  such  names  as Marian Anderson,  Leontyne  Price,  Aretha  Franklin,  Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana  Ross, Sarah Vaughn, Dionne Warwick,  and Lena Horne; and in the theatre,  Cicely Tyson serves as an outstanding  example  to  young  blacks,  as  does  Althea Gibson  in the sports field.  I  had the good fortune of serving in the  Congress with one of  the most elo quent and dedicated stateswomen ever  to serve our country, Barbara Jordan  of Texas.  In this full tradition of black wom anhood,  the Newark Black Heritage  Day Parade will honor America's black  women past and present. I know that  the  parade's  chairman Kurt  Cul breath, has worked very hard to make  the parade a success.

McMillan, Sr.  I had known Billy McMillan since  becoming involved in politics. He was  one of the special people held in high est esteem by all factions of political,  economic and social life. Billy McMil lan came from a distinguished family  of the Pee Dee area of South Carolina  and added great distinction  to  that  family. He was an agricultural leader.  He was a leader in the church. He was  a friend and counselor to those in his  community.  I was particularly pleased that Billy  McMillan was able to serve on my Ag ricultural Advisory Committee, and he  brought to this committee a wealth of  knowledge as a result of the many ex periences he had had as a participant  in farm credit and agricultural activi ties. South Carolina and the Nation  are both a greater and better place be cause Billy McMillan lived and served  among us.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the obituary  notice which appeared  in  the State  newspaper, an editorial from the Mul lins Enterprise, a letter to the editor  from his good friend, Lacy Edwards,  Jr., and finally,  the eulogy prepared  by his pastor, Rev. George Ganey, be  inserted in the RECORD as a fitting me morial to a man who lived his life as a  good man and a Christian man, com mitted  to his neighbors and  to his  community. We shall all miss him.  BILLY McMILLAN, TOBACCO FARMER DIES  'THuRSDAY  William Vandyke McMillan, Sr., 60, died  Thursday in the Mullins hospital after an  illness of several months.  Born in Mullins, he was the son of the  late George Reaves McMillan and Sallie  Reams McMillan. He was a  life elder and  trustee of the Mullins Presbyterian Church.  Mr. McMillan was a gradutate of the Uni versity of South Carolina with a bachelor's  degree in civil engineering. He served as cap tain of the 1943 football team and was elect ed by his teammates for the ""Most Valuable  Player Award"". He also won  the Jacobs  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Blocking  trophy  for  the state of South  Carolina. A Navy veteran of World War II,  he served as executive officer of a ship that  saw duty in the Atlantic and Pacific.  Mr. McMillan was currently serving as  chairman of the Mullins School District No.  2 board of trustees. He was also a member  and past chairman of the Marion-Mullins  Vocational Education board, and was a past  chairman of the Mullins Hospital Board of  Trustees.  Mr. McMillan was the senior partner and  general manager  of McMillan Brothers  Farms of Mullins. He was active in many  farm organizations and was currently serv ing as chairman of the board of directors of  Carolina Production Credit Association of  Marion and Dillon. He was member and  former chairman of the board of the Farm  Credit Banks of Columbia and the Federal  Land Bank of Mullins. He was a member of  the Clemson Unversity Fertilizer and Tobac co Advisory Committee and formerly served  on the Governor's Agricultural Study and  Advisory Committee.

This is eminently true of Billy Mac  McMillan, whose untimely death  in  the  prime of life takes from the scene one who  lived life to its fullest, leaving contributions  that will influence for many years.  In the realm of agriculture, he was an out standing leader; in the realm of education  he served unstintingly; in the realm of com munity life, he was an example to be emu lated; in the realm of spiritual activity, he  was  influential  leader  in his church;  in  family devotion he was unexcelled. His at tributes of character will long be remem bered by  those who worked with  him,  shared those days when the great shadow of  disease hovered over him, and hold fast to  the memories of a true ""Southern Gentle man"".  LETTER TO THE EDITOR  Dear Editor: Enclosed you will find a trib ute to a man that I was extremely proud to  have known. I have never attempted to put  my feelings into words before. If you see fit  to use them, fine! If you do not, then you  know the high respect that I held him in!  Sincerely,  LACY EDWARDS, Jr.  A TRIBUTE TO A MAN  God, with all his infinite wisdom, designed  and created a world for man to live on and  enjoy. A true world of plenty. A most impor tant part of this world is God's laws and  rules for living. Many men, in their stupidi8683  ty, have attempted  to make mockery of  these laws and rules, thinking that real hap piness and enjoyment can only be obtained  by breaking them. Misery and unhappiness  always becomes their constant companion.  Some men are wise enough to live in harmo ny with these laws and rules; thereby creat ing a world of personal happiness for them selves and all whose lives they touch. I was  fortunate .to have known such a man. One  who emulated all the qualities of manhood,  physical, mental, moral,  and  spiritual.  I  shared some of his moments of happiness. I  shared some of his moments of sadness. In  neither, did I ever fail to see his faith and  belief not shine. Those moments are gone,  his presence will be missed, in his office, in  the tobacco fields with the people he loved,  on the warehouse floors,  in the organiza tions that meant so much to him,  in his  church, and in his home. And in my heart, I  love you ""Billy Mac.""  A FRIEND.  THE WORSHIP OF GOD IN HONOR OF WILLIAM  VANDYKE McMILLAN, SR.  ""Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the  will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto  the church of God which is at Corinth, with  all the saints which are in all Achaia: Grace  be  to you and peace from  the Lord Jesus  Christ. Blessed be God even  the Father of  our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies,  and the God of all comfort; Who comforteth  us  in all our tribulation,  that we may be  able to comfort them which are in any trou ble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves  are comforted of God. ""-II Corinthians 1:1-4  Today we are gathered to worship God  and to honor Billy McMillan. I suppose that  if a Christian had a choice of departing this  life it would be at the Easter Season, the  Season of Victory in the Resurrection.  When we  realize  that God  loved His  people so much that He gave His only Son  to die, then to overcome the grave through  the Resurrection, we may  say with  the  Apostle Paul, ""For I reckon that the suffer ings of this present time are not worthy to  be compared with the glory which shall be  revealed in us ... "" The risen Lord Jesus  Christ is our hope, our comfort, and our as surance. Billy McMillan loved the Lord and  His church and he believed in a Resurrected  Saviour!  What can be said about a man whose  eulogy  is already carved  in each of our  hearts and minds? He was tirelessly involved  in business, education, civic affairs, and the  church. Because of this dedicated involve ment, he was held in highest esteem by his  friends and associates. He believed in hard  work and in each person carrying his own  load. His untiring strength exerted in behalf  of his fellow man and his loving devotion  heaped upon his family are examples for us  all to emulate. His competitive spirit and his  desire for success as an athlete never waned  in his struggle to attain his goals, in life. He  never evaded a challenge but met it head on. Defeat was not a word in his vocabulary.  His stature of character and strong will  never hindered  his  gentle  affection  for  those about him. Seldom does a man pass  our way whose death will be felt so keenly  as a personal loss for so many.  Today is a difficult day for us all. Our  hearts are heavy; questions fill our minds;  we grope for words in what seems to be an  impossible situation.

157,Senate,97,0.589,324,7,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President, I  would like to address this amendment  in my capacity as chairman of  the  Subcommittee  on Preparedness  be cause the amendment applies to the  0. & M. budget over which the Sub committee on Preparedness has juris diction, as well as the broader area of  preparedness  in general,  and  to be  sure this amendment also goes to the  matter of preparedness.  The Senator from Ohio is certainly  right. We must find a way to induce  our allies to spend more on defense.  And I certainly will join with him in  finding ways  to do  it. But I suggest  that this amendment is not one that  will accomplish the purpose.  The  Senator  from  Ohio  would  induce our allies to pick up $31 million  in  operations  and maintenance  ex penses  for POMCUS sites 5 and 6.  Indeed, in his letter to his colleagues,  the Senator from Ohio states that his  amendment will ""require our Europe an NATO allies to increase their share  of the burden,"" and so on.  Well, of course, nothing that we do  in the way of legislation can require or  will require our allies to do anything.  And as the Senator from Texas, the  distinguished chairman of the Armed  Services Committee, has pointed out,  passage of this amendment would ab rogate an agreement entered into by  the United States with its allies.  Mr. President, this $31 million would  be spent primarily on preparing equip ment for shipment to POMCUS sites 5  and 6. Those  sites have been pur chased and constructed already  ac cording  to our agreements with our  allies  in which  they supported  the  bulk of the expense for that stage of  the site. The next stage  is  to begin  shipping equipment. Of course,  the  third and final stage, you might say, is  to maintain that equipment once it is  on site.  The $31 million addressed by  this  amendment does not affect the first  category, nor the third and last cate gory, but that intermediate category preparing  equipment  for  POMCUS  sites 5 and 6 in the Netherlands. Pas sage of this amendment would delete  those funds and would delay for at  least 1 year these necessary prepara tions to bill POMCUS sites 5 and 6. So  those programs could be set back for  at least 1 year, which would directly  affect readiness.  Now whose cause are we hurting  here if not our own? In the event that  our troops had to mobilize to Europe  and  fall  upon  those  pre-positioned  weapons stored at some six sites, al though the fifth and sixth sites are  just beginning to be filled, it would be  obviously to our disadvantage and per haps tragic, likely tragic, disadvantage  if those weapons were not there.  We have made the commitment to  pre-position weapons. That is part of  our fundamental strategy. Changing  that is one thing as a formal decision,  but to take a step that would make it  impossible to carry out that strategy is  another thing. Yet that is what this  amendment would  do  in  practical  effect. Its intention is noble-I support  the intention-but the practical effect  is something completely different. Mr.  President.  It would  reduce our pre paredness by making it impossible this  year to go forward with the filling of  those sites.  Those who are  familiar with  the  shortages of equipment and supplies  in the European theater must be very,  very concerned with any further delay  in the filling of these sites. I join the  chairman of the committee in urging  our colleagues to def eat this amend ment.  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.  ",1982

DEAR CHAIRMAN GARN:  I am pleased  to  transmit, on behalf of the Securities and  Exchange Commission, the attached legisla tive proposal, which would amend the Secu rities Exchange Act of 1934. The legislation  the Commission is proposing would permit  the Securities and Exchange Commission to  accept, under circumstances carefully  tai lored  to  avoid conflicts of  interest, pay ments and  reimbursements which defray  the cost of travel and subsistence incurred  when Commission members or employees  attend  non-federally  sponsored meetings  concerned with the functions or activities of  the Commission.  The proper administration of the federal  securities laws and the rules thereunder de pends, in large part, on the existence of an  informed industry, securities bar and public.  The Commission has, over the last 45 years,  found that a particularly effective means to  achieve this goal  is for Commission mem bers and employees  to participate  in and  attend meetings  and  conferences which  focus on developments and emerging trends  in securities regulation and related topics.  In most instances, such participation and at tendance have been in the form of Commis sion officials speaking at such programs.  The existing constraints on accepting such  reimbursement, coupled with  the  restric tions on the size of the Commission's travel  budget, have compelled members of  the  Commission to limit their participation in  educational and similar programs aimed at  examining the federal securities  laws and  their impact.  Sponsoring organizations are often willing  to pay the actual expenses of Commission  members and employees invited to partici pate in meetings and conferences of an edu cational nature. While Commission employ ees may often accept such offers, an inter pretation of the federal conflict of interest  laws by the Comptroller General prohibits  acceptance by Commissioners  in most  in stances.

The chart simply catalogs those  small business failures that have been  identified by Dun & Bradstreet.  the gentleman  from Maryland  has pointed out there are many, many  others  in  various  small  businesses  which are not  recorded  in Dun &  Bradstreet. Counting only those that  are recorded, we recognize, as Dun &  Bradstreet has  recognized,  that  this  amounts to the very highest rate of  business failures in the United States  since the year 1932, and that is indeed  an alarming prospect.  Surely the overwhelming reason for  this preponderant rate of business fail ure this year, 125 percent above the  level of 2 years ago,  is the sustained  high level of interest rates that are  suffocating small business.  For the years 1960 until 1978, small  business people were paying an aver age of 4 percentage points above the  inflation rate in the interest rates that  they paid. They could sustain that and  stay in business.  This year, however, they have been  paying  consistently  14  percentage  points  above  the Consumer  Price  Index, a rate of real interest which is  at least three times higher than that  rate of interest which they customari ly have had to pay. They cannot do  that and endure. As a consequence, we  see  this  rate  of  business  failures,  which I fear will continue until some how the Federal Reserve Board is pre vailed upon to do those things neces sary to bring interest rates back to a  livable level and to keep them there.

I also would like to compliment the  gentleman from California <Mr. CLAU SEN) and the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. UDALL)  in working with us  to  make sure that we could accomplish  these things.  I particularly want to single out the  gentleman  from  California  MILLER) for his attitude of cooperation  and his effort to try to work out some  (Mr.  of these very difficult problems that  have existed for many, many years.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge  my colleagues  to vote  in support of  H.R. 5539, a sorely needed measure to  reform  the  outmoded  reclamation  laws. Before I explain the rationale for  support of this measure, I would like  to commend  the  leadership of both  the House Subcommittee on Water  and Power Resources, the Honorable  ABRAHAM KAZEN  and DON  CLAUSEN,  and the full Interior Committee, the  Honorable Mo  UDALL  and MANUEL  LUJAN. This issue, after more than a  half  dozen  years  of  often  bitter  debate, is now on the eve of resolution.  From great diversity of opinion, these  two gentlemen have wrought cohesion.  H.R. 5539 represents a carefully con structed-artfully fashioned-compro mise between these once diverse inter ests.  I would urge my colleagues  to  consider the fragile nature of this leg islation, and to reject attempts to alter  what  the  committee  has  brought  forth.  The Reclamation Act was passed in  1902 in response to pressures to stimu late the economic development of the  West-economic  development  that  would be contingent upon the avail ability of sufficient amounts of water.  As was stated by Elwood Mead, one of  the best known Commissioners of Rec lamation,  at  the  Trans-Mississippi  Commercial Congress  in Houston  in  1900:  The potentials of irrigation are, however,  to be measured not alone by the possible  extent of the agricultural industry, but by  the development of other resources which  they will make feasible. The best and larg est use of the grazing lands, the utilization  of the forest, the development of mines and  quarries and the maintenance of railroads  and commerce in the western half of the  United States, all hinge upon the control  and use of the streams in connection with  the fundamental industry of agriculture.  Evidence that the West was crying  for economic development was abun dant. The East was becoming crowded  and the westward migration was under  way and intensifying. Jobs and indus try were necessary in the West. There  was an increasing demand for port and  railroad facilities to expand trade with  Asia. The political leaders of the West ern States and territories were press ing the Federal Government for new  opportunities for expanded commerce.  Earlier  legislation-Desert Land Act  and the Carey Act among others-had  not done  the  job. Pressure mounted  for Government development of the  major irrigation resources in the West.  Shortly after the passage of the act,  however, certain pitfalls were discov ered in the initial plan. For example,  the residency requirement was relaxed  to clarify that a farmer could live as  much  as  50 miles  away  from  farm-a considerable distance in those  days.  his  In the nearly 80 years to follow, a  great many changes have taken place,  with  economies of  scale,  and  rural  lifestyles changing considerably. It is  time  to  address  these  changes-to  bring the reclamation laws and poli cies in conformance with these fiscal  realities.  Although this legislation has usually  been discussed in terms of how it af fects large farmers, the small farmers  of the West also have a large stake in  this legislation.  For the small farmer, the bill is im portant because it preserves his free dom  to  farm when  and where he  wants,  to  live where he wants,  to  expand  if he  is so  inclined. and  to  leave his farm to his children.  There are  those who believe  that  reclamation  farmers should have  to  meet some kind of a participation test  in order to get reclamation water. A  participation test would require that  landowners be involved in the day-to day decisionmaking on the farm and  that they derive a significant percent age of  their  income  from  farming.  This would mean that a small farmer  who relied to any degree on off-farm  income-either the husband's or the  wife's-would be  ineligible  to receive  water from a reclamation project. This  requirement would not make sense in  our current economic state in which  many, many small farmers must sup plement their farm income by working  at off-farm  jobs. A participation re quirement would work a hardship pri marily on small  farmers, not  large  ones.  This would  also have an adverse  effect on farmers who want to leave  their land to their children. The chil dren in all likelihood have their own  families and their own careers and in  most cases are living away from their  parents' farm. A participation require ment would require the children to get  back into farming-whether or not the  farm was big enough to support all the  children and their families.  Although most farms  in the West  are small, the freedom of reclamation  farmers to own more than 160 acres if  they want is important. Up to now, if  they wanted  to  expand  above  160  acres, they either had to have more  children or do so on the basis of leased  land. Under this bill, they can begin to  acquire additional  land  if that suits  their family's objectives. Ownership of  land is important in the face of finan cial adversity after bad crop years.  And, of course, the specific provision  that residency is not required of recla mation farmers is important to small  farmers and to many older people who  have moved off their ranches and are  relying on rental income to provide a  part of their retirement. Most knowl edgeable attorneys do not believe that  residency is a requirement of present  law, but the official position of the De",1982

163,House,97,-0.387,428,7,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Chairman, I have  been an observer of the House for a  long time now. One of the satisfying  things about serving on the Commit tee on Interior and Insular Affairs has  been the bipartisan approach we have  to most problems, less of the combative arguments that are heard in some  of the other committees.  It is true, as so many have said here  this afternoon, that we had statesman ship and fairness on both sides of the  aisle which enabled us to put together  this compromise bill.  The  gentleman  from Texas  <Mr.  KAZEN) does not have many reclama tion projects in his area or many Indi ans, for that matter. And yet he has  been  the  leader  this year  in  three  major pieces of legislation coming out  of the subcommittee.  GEORGE MILLER of California made  this whole thing possible by knocking  some heads together and talking sense  to all of us.  The gentleman from California, Mr.  COELHO, and Mr. PASHAYAN, our friend  DoN CLAUSEN, who brings a great deal  of expertise and fairness to this job,  and Mr. LUJAN, have also performed  exceptional service in helping us put  this together.  It took us about 100 years to start on  the east coast and to develop America  and to settle it. As the development  pattern went west, we ran out of land  where  the Almighty  delivered  the  water you needed for  farms. Some where in the tier of States, the Dako tas and Nebraska, and Kansas,  the  patterns shift and there is not enough  reliable water from rainfall.  We soon learned if we were going to  settle the West and have farming and  have a productive country, we were  going to have to bring water to the  land.  So it was that the 1902 act was en acted as a follow-on to the Homestead  Act which has given away millions and  millions of acres of publicly owned  land to people who would get on the  land and work the land and build their  homes. And it was a good program.  And the reclamation program which  extended this idea to the arid States  was a good program.  We started out in 1902, as someone  said today, with the idea that the 160  acres was a pretty good farm, and it  was. A family could live on that.  But  times have changed and  the  country has to change with them. And  so we tried these last 5 or 6 years to  modernize  this act.  In  fact,  I have  talked to half-a-dozen Interior Secre taries in my years here. All of them  wanted to do it. It seemed insoluble.  There were just too many contentious  people involved, and interests, and we  could not bring it together.  This year  in 1982  I  think we are  going  to  finally modernize  this  law  and end the confusion and conflict we  have had about it.  0 1745  Let me  say  something before we  close  this debate  today  to my good  friends from the so-called Snow Belt,  the Northern States in America.

164,,97,0.278,454,7,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speak er, yesterday the House agreed to pass  S. 2244, a bill which would implement  the 1979 Halibut Convention between  the United States and Canada.  Due to other official commitments, I  was unable to be present when this bill  was taken up by the House. I, there fore, enclose my remarks on the bill at  this point in the RECORD.  REMARKS IN SUPPORT OF S. 2244, A BILL To  IMPLEMENT  THE  UNITED  STATES/CANADA  HALIBUT CONVENTION  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S.  2244, a bill which would implement the Hal ibut Convention signed by  the U.S.  and  Canada in 1979.  The halibut fishery in the waters off the  State of Alaska  is very  important to the  fishermen  in my State. For many years,  Alaskan fishermen had to compete with Ca nadian fishermen who were also allowed to  fish  in U.S. waters. The 1979 Convention  ended that competition by providing for a  phase-out of Canadian fishing. To date, the  Convention has been complied with on a  voluntary basis; however, it needs to be for mally ~plemented by law. This bill will do  so.  I would like to call your attention to one  section of the bill which has raised some  concerns among some fishermen in Alaska.  Section 5<c>  allows  the Regional Fishery  Management Councils who have jurisdiction  over the waters concerned to propose a lim ited access system for the halibut fishery.  Such a system would have to comply with  certain  guidelines  set  forth  in  Section  303<b><6> of the Magnuson Fishery Conser vation and Management Act. If the system  did not meet these guidelines, it could not  be approved by the Secretary of Commerce.  Some  fishermen  in Alaska are worried  that the North Pacific Fishery Management  Council will adopt one particular form of  access limitation. I think it should be made  clear that the Congress is not endorsing any  particular system. In fact, the Congress is  not even proposing that a  limited access  system be established.. Rather,  it  is  the  intent of this body that the Council look  fully and fairly at all management systems  that might be proposed,  including  those  that do not involve access limitation. Fur ther,  it  is our  intent that  the Secretary  May 5, 1982  insure that the guidelines mentioned above  are followed. All fishermen will have the  right  to propose management schemes to  the Council, with  the  expectation  that  those schemes be carefully considered.  I would also like to make clear for the  record that it is not my usual policy to agree  to move a bill on the Floor without an op portunity for public input through Subcom mittee and Committee hearings. However,  we are faced with a problem: the 1982 hali but season starts on May 11th. If we do not  pass a bill prior  to  that season, we will  greatly delay  the ability of the Regional  Fishery Management Councils to establish a  management system. Thus, at the request of  the North Pacific Fishery Management  Council, the United Fishermen of Alaska,  the Alaska Longline Fishermen's Associa tion, the Pacific Seafood Processors Associa tion, and other fishing industry groups, I  have agreed to the expedited passage of this  bill.  Mr. Speaker, I urge that we pass this legis lation today so that both the fish and the  fishermen can benefit.e  ZIPPO LIGHTERS-50 YEARS AND  GLOWING STRONGER  HON. WILLIAM F. CLINGER, JR.

DEAR CONGRESSMAN MCCLOSKEY: We un derstand that the House of Representatives  may begin consideration of H.R. 4326, the  Small Business  Innovation Act,  in early  May. As you know, the bill requires federal  agencies, including the U.S. Department of  Agriculture,  to allocate  three percent of  their research funds to small businesses.  Farm Bureau opposes H.R. 4326 because  the allocation of three percent of USDA for mula funds to small business firms to con duct research is not the most appropriate  way to promote the well-being of small re search  firms or  to stimulate agricultural  productivity.  The allocation requirement would negate  the small increases in formula funding re cently received by the USDA. In addition,  the number of small firms specializing in ag ricultural research is limited. A diversion of  USDA research funds to them could mean  exceptionally large contract awards without  necessarily increasing the quantity or quality of agriculture research.

Part of the luncheon  will be devoted to honoring the coun cil's outgoing officers. The retiring of ficers  this year are president, Frank  Pacino, M.D.; vice president for pro grams, Joyce Dixon; and vice president  for publicity, Norman Schultz.  Dr. Pacino brought to his term in  office a wealth of experience in the  medical field as well as a tradition of  demonstrated caring for his communi ty. Dr. Pacino received his M.D. from  the University of California's College  of Medicine in 1962, and supplemented  that with a master's degree in public  health from Loma Linda University in  1971. He has served as a district health  officer with the Harbor /Torrance Dis trict of Los Angeles County's Depart ment of Health Services. In 1975 he  was elected president of the American  Association of Public Health Physi cians. He is president-elect of the Cali fornia Chapter of the Public Health  Physicians Association and served as  president of the California Chapter in  1970. He has just recently completed a  year as president of the Physicians As sociation of Los Angeles County.  Joyce Dixon also has a long personal  history of  community  contribution.  After receiving a B.S.  in social work  from Bluffton College in Ohio in 1962,  Ms. Dixon went on to obtain in 1964 a  B.S.  in  elementary  education  from  Central State University in Ohio. In  1969, she received a M. Ed. in counsel ing and guidance. In the years follow ing her formal education, Ms. Dixon  has provided her skills to several com munity organizations across the coun try, including the Welfare Department  of Montgomery County in Ohio, the  Springfield Massachusetts Welfare  Department,  the Grand Forks Air  Force Base school  in North Dakota,  the Mills Lawn Elementary School in  yellow  Springs, Ohio,  the Central  State University in Wilberforce, Ohio,  the  United  Way's  Neighborhood  Youth Corps of Los Angeles, and the  Neighborhood Youth Association of  Los Angeles.  Ms. Dixon is an active member of  such organizations as  the American  Personnel and Guidance Association,  the Coordinating Council of Carson  and San Pedro as well as Wilmington,  the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.,  and Kappa Delta Pi.  Norman Schultz, head counselor at  the Banning Carson Community Adult  School, has likewise made a significant  contribution  to his community, par ticularly in the field of adult educa tion. Mr. Schultz has devoted his edu cational career  to  insuring  that his  adult students receive the best possi ble counseling. Adult education is an  often-overlooked portion of our Na tion's  total  education  and  Schultz's contribution has not been in significant. His dedication  is under scored by his service as president of  the Adult Educators' Association of  Mr.  8891  Los Angeles, and president of the Los  Angeles Adult School Counselors' As sociation. On the State level he has  served as both treasurer and president  of the California Adult and Continu ing Education Counselors' Association.

168,,97,-0.334,493,7,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker, last week  I  introduced H.R.  6190,  legislation  amending title 38, United States Code,  exempting GI bill education benefits  received by a veteran or eligible survi vor  from  the eligibility criteria  for  Federal education assistance.  Prior to enactment of the Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981,  previous law assessed GI bill readjust ment  benefits  as  income  allowing  those veterans,  especially  those  at tending high-cost schools, to compete  on an equal basis with their peers for  additional education assistance  from  the Federal Government. Current law  <section 2013 of title 38) continues to  exempt or disregard GI bill benefits in  determining  the needs or qualifica tions of participants  in any public  service  employment  program,  job  training program, or any other man power training <or related) program fi nanced in whole or in part with Feder al funds. That provision was based on  two assumptions:  First, the Vietnam-era GI bill is basi cally an income assistance allowance,  unlike  the World War II education  program which provided direct educa tion tuition assistance.  Second, historically, all GI bills were  designed to provide readjustment as sistance in granting benefits to those  who have served their country in war time to help make up for the time, ex perience, and earning capability which  those who did not serve continued to  enjoy.  The unique nature of the GI bill led  the Congress to exempt these benefits  from the eligibility criteria for other  Federal assistance programs. Rather  than penalize the veteran, his widow,  and his orphan further because of this  service, and undermine the basic pur pose of the program, my bill would  expand that provision to include Fed eral education assistance as well.

The amendment I intended to off er  with the gentleman from Illinois <Mr.  CORCORAN)  would  have  transferred  funds from the Synfuels Corporation,  which subsidizes major oil companies,  and put it into a program to stimulate  our  housing  industry-an  industry  that  impacts on millions of people  across the country.  Our plan attracted so many of my  colleagues on the other side of  the  aisle that the majority leadership fig ured they needed their own approach.  Typically, their new plan will simply  appropriate new  funds  to put  into  housing  assistance.  This  approach  from the born-again budget . balancers  in the House leadership adds to the  deficit and does not reduce subsidies to  Mobil, Tenneco, and the rest.  Mr.  Speaker,  the Evans-Corcoran  housing  initiative gives Members  a  real  choice-subsidizing  big  oil,  or  helping Americans buy homes.

170,House,97,0.429,506,7,Mr. GREGG.," Mr.  Speaker,  last  night and yesterday  in New Hamp shire the rain fell. It was a rain which  had an acidity level of approximately  4.1. That is just a little bit higher than  orange juice. The effect of that acid  rain is that it is killing the aquatic life  in New Hampshire.  Studies have shown it is not only  killing the aquatic life in New Hamp shire. It is killing the aquatic life in  Canada.  Close  to  10,000  lakes  in  Canada have been identified as dead.  Close to 2,000 lakes in northern New  England and New York are identified  as dead.  Furthermore, a  recent study by a  major forest products corporation in  Canada concluded, that as a result of  acid precipitation, we have seen a sig nificant  reduction  in  forest growth.  There is also  the distinct possibility  that acid precipitation is affecting the  growth agricultural products.  Further, we know for a fact that we  are having to treat the reservoirs in  New England  in order  to neutralize  the acidity of those lakes so they will  not  impact adversely  the health of  New England citizenry.  The National Academy of Sciences,  the foremost  force  in American sci ence, has concluded  that  the over whelming  circumstantial  evidence  points out that acid rain is related to  emissions  from utility plants  in  the  Midwest.  We must move, and we must move  positively, on the issue of acid rain.

171,House,97,-0.39,558,7,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speak er,  today I am  introducing the Tax  Compliance Act of 1982. Earlier this  year Senator DOLE, chairman of the  Senate  Finance  Committee,  intro duced a similar measure in the Senate,  S. 2198, the Taxpayer Compliance Im provement Act of 1982. I commend his  efforts in this regard, and I share his  belief that in the interest of fairness  to the large number of taxpayers who  do comply with  the  tax  laws, every  effort must be made to insure that our  tax system is not undermined by the  actions of a few who flaunt or other wise ignore its rules.  The bill I am introducing today con tains many provisions similar to those  proposed in S. 2198. In preparing this  bill, the provisions of the Senate bill  were carefully studied. In many cases,  those suggestions were adopted while  taking into account comments and rec ommendations that have been received  from the public since the introduction  of the Senate bill. The bill that I am  introducing today also contains provi sions  in  two major  areas-foreign  transactions and  the  illegal sector that were not included in S. 2198 but  are consistent, I believe, with its basic  philosophy. Preliminary estimates in dicate  that  the  increased  revenues  under this act could be as high as $3 to  $4 billion. Today, I am also announc ing that the Committee on Ways and  Means will begin hearings on this bill  and  related  legislative proposals on  May 18, 1982.  I want  to briefly summarize each  title of the bill and present the ration ale for  including  these provisions  in  the bill.  TITLE 1: CRIMES, ABUSIVE TAX SHELTERS, FRAUD,  ET CETERA  Title I contains a number of provi sions designed to deal more effectively  with  the  types of  transactions  that  occur in the course of illegal activities,  with  abusive  tax  shelters  and  tax  frauds, and with tax protester activi ties.

ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES  The bill contains provisions which  permit a presumption of jeopardy with  respect to collecting the tax on cash  that is  linked  to  illegal activities or  cash that has no known owner. The  provisions of present law which pro vide for expedited administrative and  court reviews of any jeopardy assess ment by the IRS are retained in full.  The bill also requires that Treasury  obligations,  State  and  local  tax exempt bonds, and most private sector  debt obligations issued after December  31, 1982, be in registered form. Bearer  bonds present serious problems for tax  administrators and are often used in il legal activities and to evade Federal  taxes. The solution to this problem is  to require registration of debt obliga tions that are generally issued to the  public,  and  the bill  takes  this  ap proach for newly  issued obligations.  To reduce the burdens of compliance  with this requirement, book entry sys tems of  registration  are  authorized  and most commercial debt will be ex cluded by  exemptions  provided  for  short-term obligations and for obliga tions not offered to the public. Regis tration  in conjunction with  the ex panded information reporting require ments included in the bill should sub stantially close the tax gap with re spect to interest payments, obviating  the need to institute withholding on  such payments.  B. ABUSIVE TAX SHELTERS  A  new  penalty  is  established  to  apply  to  those promoting or selling  abusive tax shelters. In addition, the  IRS is authorized to seek an injunc tion against those persons subject to  the penalty. These measures are  intended  to deter those who organize,  promote, and sell tax shelter schemes  based on representations of fraudulent  tax benefits or of tax benefits that are  based on grossly overvalued assets or  services. Under present law,  the tax payer who  invests in such a scheme  may be subject to penalties but the  promoter is not.  C. OTHER PENALTY PROVISIONS  The bill also increases the fraud pen alty of present law by adding a  time  sensitive element, based on 50 percent  of the interest payable on the under payment due to fraud.  A new civil penalty is proposed to  apply to those who aid, advise, or oth erwise participate knowingly  in  the  understatement of the tax liability of  another  person  <including  corpora tions). This  penalty  is  directed  to  those persons who are not subject to  the preparer penalties of present law  because they do not prepare the tax  return but who are otherwise involved  in deliberate understatements of tax.  Finally, a new penalty of $500 will  apply for filing a  tax return that is  frivolous  on  its  face.  A  growing  number of taxpayers annually file re turns which fail to disclose any item of  income or deduction on the basis of  claims that have no legal foundation  or which devalue the items of income  and deduction based on a ""gold stand ard"" computation. These returns pose  a serious administrative burden to the  IRS and individually may take years  to resolve. It is hoped that a flat dollar  penalty assessed at the time of filing  will discourage this type of tax pro test.  D. ADMINISTRATIVE SUMMONS  The bill revises the summons proce dures  to  require  a  taxpayer who  wishes  to  challenge  a  summons  to  begin a proceeding in court within 20  days. Under present law, the taxpayer  need only send a letter to the IRS and  the third party recordkeeper within 14  days to stay compliance with the sum mons, and then the IRS must initiate  a court action  to enforce  the sum mons. A small proportion of taxpayers  challenge third party summons pres ently, but of those who do,  the vast  majority never appear in court. In this  situation,  the  taxpayer has  gained  delay in enforcement of the summons,  while the IRS has been required  to  devote resources  to the enforcement  effort. The change proposed is intend ed to place a greater initial burden on  the  taxpayer  to challenge  the sum mons, but thereafter the burdens of  proof are to remain the same as under  present law.  In addition,  the bill  clarifies  the  point at which an administrative sum mons may not be used by the IRS.  Under the proposal, the IRS could not  use these procedures while a referral  to the Justice Department for prosecu tion is in effect.  ",1982
172,House,97,0.049,571,7,Mr. LEATH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  am  introducing  legislation  which will limit the Office of Manage ment and Budget's authority  to  re quire the Veterans' Administration to  convert services performed by Federal  employees in VA hospitals to contract.  On April 27, 1982, Chairman G. V.  (SONNY) MONTGOMERY of the Commit tee on Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee  on Oversight and Investigations held a  hearing concerning an OMB proposed  draft revision to their circular A-76  ""Policies for Acquiring Commercial o;  Industrial  Products  and  Services  Needed by the Government."" This re vision proposes drastic measures  to  dictate  conversion  to  contract  for  those services with 25 or less employ ees without requiring cost comparison  studies to demonstrate the cost eff ec tiveness  of  such  conversions.  The  OMB proposal would  also mandate  that new requirements be satisfied by  contracting out without even consider ing if it would be less expensive to do  the work with  in-house  personnel.  Chairman MONTGOMERY  invited Mr.  Donald E. Sowle, Administrator of the  Office of Federal Procurement Policy  of OMB, to our hearing to explain the  reasons  for  the  proposed  revision  which totally ignores the cost compar~  ison process in determining which VA  activities should be converted to con tract. Mr. Sowle declined  to appear  and I can readily understand his reluc~  tance to try to explain such capricious  and  irresponsible  recommendations.  Other witnesses at the subcommittee  hearing were quick to point out that  the  proposed  revision was  an  un abashed and flagrant abuse of taxpay ers' moneys,  and would  probably  signal the demise of the Federal work  force as we know it today. The presi dent of  the National Federation of  Government Employees, Mr.  James  Peirce,  told us that his organization  considered  the proposed  revision  to  the circular so onerous to Federal em ployees that they had requested that  Mr. Sowle resign from OMB.  Other committees of the Congress  are  also  concerned with  this OMB  drive  to  convert  the Federal work  force to contract. In my other commit ~ee, the Committee on Armed Services,  m H.R. 6030,  the Department of De fense Authorization Act of 1983, we  placed a  1-year moratorium on  the  performance of cost studied and new  contract conversions under OMB cir cular A-76 during fiscal year 1983.  The Armed Services Committee con sidered that the contracting out pro gram had gotten out of hand when the  Department of Defense, acting on the  ",1982

I hope every body, not only in the gallery and back  in the rooms, but I hope everybody in  this country will read it in the newspa pers and hear it on radio because he  has clearly put the problem in this  country.  The statements of Senator GARN and  Senator GOLDWATER are  the reasons  why I ran for the U.S. Senate and why  I am so glad I am here, because it is  time people started laying it down just  exactly the way it was.  We are not here to demagog, we are  here to solve problems, and what he  has so clearly placed  in  the record  today is the problem of our country  and the solution to that problem, and  it ought to be in the history books.  Anything that can be attributed to  solve these problems is in his state ment.  I would just like to add one further  comment and that is that we all know  that we ought  to  lay demagoguery  aside because I am tired of it, too. It is  all the entitlement programs, Senator  GARN,  you are exactly  right. They  have only been in effect, indexed for  what, 7 years, and we have overcom pensated for $21 billion in just 4 years  by miscalculation. That is something  that everybody in this body needs to  acknowledge.

178,Senate,97,-0.313,636,7,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I was  recently struck by an article which ap peared in the American Oxonian by  Bryce Nelson. The article, which  I  shall submit to the RECORD to be pub lished in its entirety, questions the ap propriateness of a large monument as  a  tribute  to President Franklin D.  Roosevelt.  Mr. Nelson suggests what seems to  me to be a more fitting tribute-the  preservation  of  ""FDR's  trees"" -222  million  trees planted  from  1935  to  1942 as a part of the Prairie States for estry project.  I have asked that Committee on En vironment and Public Works to exam ine the proposal of Mr. Nelson and I  commend it to my colleagues as, per haps a more appropriate reminder of  the vision of our 32d President.  I ask unaminous consent that the ar ticle be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  A MEMORIAL FOR FDR  <By Bryce Nelson>  While crossing  the Great Plains ""Dust bowl"" in July of 1932 as he sought the presi dency, Franklin D. Roosevelt conceived the  idea of planting large numbers of trees to  reduce the wind erosion which was then kill ing the Plains.  FDR had seen with his own eyes the black  blizzards of blowing  topsoil and swirling  sand which drove farmers off their land,  stopped auto traffic at midday, and deposit ed dusty debris over cities as far away as  New York and Washington, and on  the  decks of ships in the Atlantic.  ""This is my baby,"" Roosevelt later said of  the projet to plant. 100-foot wide shelter belts or windbreaks in long, east-west strips  along farmers' fields to reduce erosion and  to protect crops from the hot winds out of  the south. Unlike many of man's grandiose  schemes, this dream had practical result.  More than 222 million of ""FDR's trees""  were planted in the Prairie States Forestry  Project from 1935 to 1942. From the Dako tas, these shelterbelts stretch south a thou sand miles into the Texas Panhandle in a  200-mile wide belt in the transitional area  between the Tallgrass Eastern Prairies and  the Shortgrass Western Plains.  ""Never before or since has man planted so  many  trees  in so  few  years under such  trying  environmental  conditions,"" wrote  John R. McGuire, then chief of the U.S.  Forest Service, in a 1976 foreword to an im pressive study of Plains trees by Wilmon H.  Droze, a Texas scholar.  FDR's  trees  have  not  only  protected  crops, livestock and humans from the high  winds,  the piercing winter cold and  the  scorching summer heat of the Plains, but  they have also provided places for farm chil dren to play, for families to picnic, for game  animals and birds to flourish. These half  mile  long rows of conifers and deciduous  trees have provided unusual places of natu ral beauty and human refuge in a largely  treeless region so sparse and  lonely  that  early travelers called it the ""Great Ameri can Desert.""  The project's first tree, an Austrian Pine  planted on the cotton farm of Horace E.  Curtis 46 years ago this spring, survives as  does  the satisfied farmer who supervised  the planting of that first group of shelter belt trees five miles west of Willow in south western Oklahoma. Many of the other shel terbelt trees-a living memorial to one of  man's most  ambitious  efforts  to  temper  nature-still stand, but time  is  taking  its  toll.  Given very little national attention since  FDR's death in 1945, the shelterbelt project  has become a program of largely forgotten  trees.  While the trees were planted with Federal  financial assistance, the plantings were done  on private land with maintenance left to in dividual  farmers. As  the memory of  the  duststorms  of  the  ""Dirty Thirties""  has  faded, many farmers and agri-business oper ators have allowed their shelterbelts to de teriorate. As these windbreaks lose efficien cy in shielding crops and farmhomes, high  costs pressure some farmers to bulldoze the  shelterbelts and plant crops in the cleared  land. There  is  little educational work  to  inform farmers of the benefits of keeping  these trees.  ""It's not that people on the Plains don't  appreciate trees,"" explains David F. Van Ha verbeke, a research forester in Lincoln, Ne braska. ""There Just isn't any cost-sharing  program to give a  lot of farmers the eco nomic incentive to keep them up.""  As all too many of FDR's trees are bull dozed  and burned, Washington officials,  mostly unaware of the shelterbelt project,  discuss what kind of memorial the nation  should have to honor the 32nd President.  Congress approved an FDR memorial 26  years ago, but the nature of the memorial  has been hotly debated ever since.  The chairman of the FDR Memorial Com mission,  Eugene  J. Keogh,  formerly  a  Democratic Congressman from New York  City, has been trying to persuade Congres sional authorizing committees to hold hear ings on a revised plan by landscape architect  Lawrence Halprin to build the FDR Memo rial on the western edge of the Tidal Basin  near the Jefferson Memorial in Washing ton.  This revised $23 million plan is a scaled down  version  of  a  $50 million Halprin  design. In the latter part of the Carter Ad ministration, Secretary of the Interior Cecil  D. Andrus announced that administration's  opposition  to  this more  elaborate plan.  Andrus said that its construction and oper ating  costs  ""are  remarkably  high""  and  added  that ""President Roosevelt himself  made it very plain that he did not want a  large, costly monument erected to his honor  in Washington."" The sole monument  to  FDR  in Washington  is  a  simple marble  stone on Pennsylvania Avenue near the Na tional Archives.  Andrus emphasized  that he understood  the desire among FDR's many admirers for  a  suitable memorial by  the  time of  the  lOOth anniversary of FDR's birth-January  30, 1982-and suggested the renaming of a  park in Washington. ""As a leading conserva tionist, and a celebrated planter of trees on  his estate at Hyde Park, N.Y., he surely  would believe such recognition appropriate  if he were among us today,"" he said.  On the Plains, however, FDR's trees are  already in place and bringing benefits. With  a little extra effort, the nation could come  to regard these shelterbelts as a suitable  living memorial to that ""celebrated planter  of trees."" Now,  there  is neither a center  where the history and purpose of the shel terbelt project is explained nor even high way historical markers pointing to the exist ence of these trees.  Even if Congress did not want to fund a  historical center on the Plains to explain  FDR's trees, it might spare something to  make education on the shelterbelts avail able and to give farmers some economic or  tax incentive to renovate existing shelter belts and to plant more trees where needed.  The nation would regain manyfold what ever was spent on such a plan in the form of  sustained agricultural productivity and pro tection of necessary farmland, especially im portant now that large parts of the Plains  face another potentially devastating period  of drought.  Trees meant a lot to FDR; he listed his oc cupation as ""tree grower"" when registering  to vote in New York, William R. Emerson,  director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Li brary at Hyde Park, points out. ""The plant ing of these shelterbelt trees was very close  to FDR's heart,"" says Emerson. ""Nothing  except the rebuilding of the Navy was so  close to his life and concerns. Attention to  these shelterbelt trees would be the most  seemly observation of the lOOth anniversary  of his birth in 1982.""  While it might seem a bit unusual to advo cate a memorial to a Democratic president  during a frugal, Republican administration,  many remember that Ronald Reagan sup ported FDR throughout Roosevelt's lifetime  and  that,  even  in  the  1980  campaign,  Reagan often wrapped himself  in FDR's  words and memory. In fact, he often seemed  more aware of  the  importance of FDR's  legacy than did his Democratic opponent.  It somehow  seems possible and  fitting  that President Reagan could lead in desig nating a  living memorial  to a president  whose wisdom helped sustain farmland in  Reagan's native Midwest and whose eco nomic  initiatives  helped  Reagan's  own  family survive in Illinois during the Great  Depression of the Thirties.  FEDERAL STUDENT FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  ",1982
179,Senate,97,-0.371,636,7,Mr. BURDICK.," Mr. President, the  concerns regarding Federal student fi nancial assistance are ongoing. The  speculation about the size of the pro posed cuts and the possible changes in  student eligibility make it difficult for  both students and institutions to plan  for the future.  That funding for education is a wise  and  necessary  investment  in  the  future  is widely recognized We need  more scientists, more engineers, more  technicians, more computer operators.  We need a highly educated citizenry to  make the wheels of this very techno logical, post-industrial society turn. It  takes 20 years to provide this kind of  education. Cuts now cannot be made  up later. Education lost now is lost for ever.  Cutting education in order to pay for  military programs, as this administra tion is proposing to do, is like cutting  off our nose to spite our face-for an  educated citizenry, in itself, is one of  our best defenses. Not only do we need  an educated military to operate and  maintain the complex equipment we  now have, but  the better educated  American workers  are,  the  higher  their productivity and  income.

180,Senate,97,-0.224,662,7,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, today, I  am introducing a resolution to herald  the coming of a very special event to  south Florida. From June 4 to 26 of  this year, Greater Miami and Dade  County will host the New World Festi val of the Arts, an international spec tacle of  the performing and visual  arts. Some of you may already be fa miliar with the festival, as the event  has been publicized and acclaimed by  cultural interests all over the Nation.  In fact,  just in  the past few weeks  there have been advertisements and  feature pieces in principal newspapers  and periodicals  across  the  country.  But for those of you who are not yet  aware of the affair, I am here to tell  you that .it will be an unprecedented  cultural extravaganza. For 23 days and  nights, Miami will be aglow celebrat ing the arts of the Americas. The festi val will feature major productions in  music, dance, opera, theater, and the  visual arts created and performed by  famous artists and performers  from  throughout North America, Central  America, and South America. Included  in this ambitious agenda are over 200  live performances, 27  of which are  world premiers commissioned expressly for the festival. Among the more  notable  artists participating  in  the  celebration are Tennessee Williams,  Cynthia Gregory, Edward Albee, Geof frey  Holder,  Zubin Metha,  Chick  Corea, Lanford Wilson,  and many,  many more. All and all,  the festival  promises to make the Miami area the  place to be this June; for 3 weeks, it  will transform the area into the cul tural  entertainment  center  of  the  Western Hemisphere.  The New World Festival of the Arts  is the creation of Mr. Robert Herman,  who continues  to shape  its develop ment while serving as executive direc tor. Mr. Herman is also general man ager of the Greater Miami Opera, one  of the leading companies in the United  States. Mr. Herman's idea was basic,  yet unique and  tremendously ambi tious:  He wanted  to  organize  an  annual  artistic  event which would  stage major productions in a number  of different artistic media. The event  would draw on the talents of major  artists and performers from all over  the globe, and through this interna tional recipe, would encourage worldly  exchange  in the arts. Essentially,  it  would be a yearly showcase for some  of the world's greatest creative artists.  As a further example of prestigious  bill that has been planned, the follow ing groups will be highlighted:  the  Israel Philharmonic;  the Minnesota  Orchestra; the New World Ballet Com pany; the Paul Taylor Dance Compa ny; the Chamber Music Society of Lin coln Center; and  the Fusion Dance  Company. To convey a sense of the  international flavor  the festival will  offer,  I would cite: The Maracaibo  Symphony of Venezuela, which is ac claimed as South America's finest or chestra;  Camerata  Bariloche,  the  famous Argentine chamber orchestra;  Omar Mejia, the world renowned Sal vadoran pianist; Caio Pagano, Brazil's  most  famous  pianist;  and  the Five  Points of View Exhibit, which will  present the diversity of styles and in fluences  of  five  prominent  Latin  American artists: Botero, Cruz-Diez,  Manzur, Sanchez, and Zuniga.  As for the choice of location, what  better place than Miami could have  been selected as the home for an inter American arts f es ti val. Miami has tra ditionally served as the bridge between  the people and cultures of the Ameri cas. Its tropical climate, its position as  a point of entry for  those entering  from the south, and its thriving com mercial atmosphere have combined to  attract people from other American  countries to settle there. In fact, there  is probably no city  in  the country  which  sustains  as many  different  American cultural groups as Miami; it  is a  true pan-American city. In addi tion to its diversified makeup, it is im portant to note that Miami has also  experienced a tremendous swelling of  artistic interest on the part of its citizens. The people of the Greater Miami  area have in the past few years dem onstrated a support and generosity for  the arts which is much envied by cul tural interests in other cities. In short,  the city is a unique cultural crossroads  which is ripe for a major artistic cele bration, such as the New World Festi val of the Arts.  I am introducing this resolution to  acclaim the New World Festival of the  Arts because I believe it represents an  extraordinary artistic event. I feel that  all those connected with this momen tous undertaking deserve recognition  and praise. In a broader perspective,  however, I am also placing this resolu tion before you  as means  through  which the Senate can express its con tinued support for the arts, and for  cultural exchange in the arts among  the countries of  the Americas. Any  one with a concern about the vitality  of the arts in the United States has, in  my mind, an interest in the success of  the New World Festival of the Arts. In  the future,  the festival could easily  become one of the world's foremost  e..nnual artistic affairs. In light of this  potential, I feel that an expression of  support through a Senate resolution is  warranted. I realize that we have more  pressing matters before us today than  the state of the arts in this country,  but I think it is important that, from  time to time, we turn our attention to  the vital contributions that art makes  to improving the quality and color of  our  lives.  the American  artist,  Robert Motherwell said, ""Art is  less  important than life, but what a poor  life without art.""  In closing, I hope other Senators will  join me in sponsoring this resolution  which aims to promote art and artistic  exchange through acclaiming the New  World Festival of the Arts. In effect,  we will be supporting the cultural en richment of our society through art.e  As  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED FOR  PRINTING  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE  AUTHORIZATION, 1983  AMENDMENT NO. 1441  <Ordered to be printed and to lie on  the table.)

181,Senate,97,-0.422,688,7,Mr. HART.," Mr. President, a key fea ture of the voting rights legislation,  which the full Senate will soon consid er,  is extension of the 1975 amend ments requiring bilingual registration  and voting assistance in areas with a  significant percentage of language mi nority citizens. These provisions cover  major  portions  of  the  Southwest  United States, including 34 counties in  the State of Colorado.  The effectiveness of  the bilingual  provisions has been a subject of dis pute throughout hearings and debate  over the Voting Rights Act extension.  This is  largely because the bilingual  provisions have been in effect for so  short a  time that information about  their implementation and usage is still  sketchy.  Last week,  however,  the  Mexican  American  Legal  Defense  Fund released the results of an exten sive study providing new, useful infor mation about the impact of these pro visions on Hispanic political participa tion in the Southwest. The study re veals, among other things, that 1 in 7  American citizens of Mexican descent  do not speak English; and that almost  one-third of the participants  in the  study, including some who speak Eng lish, would be less likely to register to  vote  if Spanish  language assistance  were not available.  This study, funded by the Carnegie  Corp. demonstrates that the bilingual  provisions of the Voting Rights Act  have made political participation a re ality for thousands of American citi zens. I commend it to my colleagues  and request those portions of the exec utive summary describing the major  findings and conclusions of the study  be  reprinted  in  the RECORD at  this  point.  The summary follows:  BILINGUAL ELECTIONS AT Woruc IN THE  SOUTHWEST  <A Mexican American Legal Defense and  Educational Fund Report>  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The Voting Rights Act amendments of  1975 expanded the protection of the land mark legislation to language minority citi zens: Hispanics, Asians,  Indians and Eski mos. A key feature of the 1975 amendments  requires bilingual assistance in registration  and voting in areas with a significant per centage of language minority citizens. The  issue of bilingual elections  is once again  before the Congress as it moves to renew  the Voting Rights Act before August 6,  1982, when many of its provisions expire.  A paucity of information on the impact of  bilingual elections and their need and usage  prompted the Mexican American Legal De fense and Educational Fund <MALDEF) to  undertake this study. Bilingual Elections at  Work in the Southwest presents the results  of our research. The findings indicate that  the bilingual  elections provisions of  the  Voting Rights Act have had a positive effect  on Mexican American participation in the  political process.

182,,97,-0.163,714,7,Mr. LUKEN.," Mr. Speaker, 166 Mem bers of Congress have sponsored or co sponsored  legislation  to  remedy  the  action of the Federal Government in  cutting off the social security student  benefits program without reasonable  notice.  Through the changes in the Omni bus Reconciliation Act of 1981, high  school seniors who have not enrolled  in postsecondary institutions and at tending classes  full  time by May  l,  1982 will lose their social security stu dent benefits. Obviously,  this unrea sonable deadline has eliminated thou sands of seniors who will not graduate  from high school until June 1982 and  have not been able to attain early en rollment into colleges.  Thousands  of  students  have  ar ranged  their college careers around  these promised social security benefits  with the impression that they would  be forthcoming. In fact, seniors were  given  erroneous notification by  the  Social Security Administration  that  they would be eligible for benefits this  fall. Now, students graduating in 1982  do not have sufficient time to make al ternate financial arrangements.  Although each of my distinguished  colleagues,  Representatives  MOTTL, SOLOMON, VOLKMER,  and PAT  WILLIAMS, has sponsored legislation to  rectify  this outrageous  treatment of  high school seniors across the country,  we have decided to unite our efforts  behind one bill, H.R. 6183, to insure  expeditious passage. The  legislation  that I  introduced on April 28, 1982,  will provide relief for 1982 high school  graduates by extending the college en rollment deadline from May 1, 1982 to  October 1, 1982.  Mr. Speaker, the May 1, 1982 dead line, together with the Social Security  Administration's  erroneous  notifica tion, has created undue hardship and  worries for families with deceased, dis abled,  or  retired  parents who  are  highly dependent upon their social se curity benefits to send their children  to college.  Even though the May 1, 1982, dead line has passed, we must continue to  work toward correcting this injustice.  Therefore,  I  strongly urge my col leagues to  join our bipartisan effort  and cosponsor H.R. 6183.e  LENT,  ",1982
183,,97,-0.631,727,7,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, much  debate has arisen in recent years over  the United  States  balance-of-trade  status with Japan. The majority of the  rhetoric has portrayed Japan as em ploying  exclusionary  business  prac tices that work to the benefit of the  domestic Japanese industries.  While in some cases it is unfair to  make this statement, it is true in the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  high technology sector. In particular,  the inability of American industry to  penetrate the Japanese market is caus ing  irreversible damage  to American  firms in the development and market ing of semiconductor  technology. A  recent study prepared for  the Joint  Economic  Committee  of  Congress  states:  The loss of leadership in this one industry  would mean the loss of international com petitiveness in many of the advanced tech nology sectors that have been the basis of a  U.S. advantage since the second world war.  The study characterizes  the Japa nese economy as one of ""controlled  competition"" whereby the intensity of  competition is directed and limited by  State actions and by the formal and  informal collaborative efforts of indus trial  and  financial  enterprises. By  acting both as a doorman who restricts  entry, and as a promoter who subsi dizes growth  in particular industrial  sectors, the State places itself in a po sition which wields authority over the  development and  international com petitiveness of these industries.  Historically, the Ministry of Interna tional Trade and Industry <MIT!) has  been the Japanese Government's chief  tool for implementing restrictive poli cies. These  policies,  among  others,  have included: First, requiring Govern ment approval of all applications for  direct  foreign  investment  in Japan;  second, limiting import penetration via  high tariffs and exclusionary customs  procedures; and third, limiting access  by licensing advanced technology and  know-how. The  result  of  this  last  policy has been a controlled diffusion  of  advanced  technology  throughout  the Japanese semiconductor industry.  The  experience  of Texas  Instru ments in the 1960's is a good example  of this last point. Texas Instruments  applied for Japanese patent licenses  for  its  technology, but approval was  held up by the Japanese Government.  In the  interim,  the  timelag allowed  Japanese firms to catch up technologi cally to Texas Instruments. This strat egy thus is one means by which Japa nese  firms  are  able  to mimic  the  timing of technological achievements  in the United States.  Other examples of restrictive poli cies from the joint committee report  and a Ways and Means Trade Subcom mittee report on its Trade Mission to  the Far East include: First, the past  policy of NTI' <Nippon Telephone and  Telegraph)  to  refuse  to  allow  the  equipment supplied to them by Japa nese firms to include imported semi conductors; second, the refusal to li cense to American firms proprietary  production  technology  that  comes  from  Government-funded  research  and development  that  is  otherwise  available to Japanese industries; third,  the denial to American producers of  the same access  to Japanese stand ards-setting procedures  as  Japanese  9125  producers enjoy in the United States.  Also, Japan rarely accepts American  test data to certify compliance with  test standards-a costly and time-con suming problem for importers.  In addition  to  these Government  policies,  the  Japanese  distribution  system is confusing not only because it  is so rooted in old relationships and  obligations, but also by its length and  complexity which combine to become  prohibitively expensive, even for goods  which  start  on  a  cost-competitive  basis.  It is  important  to  remember  that  these  ties created during  the  period of  time when formal market  controls were  in effect do not end  quickly because the Government an nounces the implementation of a more  open market policy. As  the Japan United  States  Economic  Relations  Group <Wisemen's Report) noted:  Other factors, such as administrative pro cedures, regulatory requirements, business  practices, and cultural and social barriers  are very difficult to compare <with the U.S.  system). It is our judgment, however, that  these informal barriers make it especially  difficult  for  foreigners  to  fully penetrate  Japanese business and society.  In a recent issue of the Journal of  Japanese Trade and Industry, MITI  states that it feels the proper role of  the Government was to do no more  than to provide guidance to the pri vate sector. However, the above exam ples clearly do not look like mere guid ance-they  are  unfair  protectionist  policies that harm the United States  to the benefit of Japan. Such a posi tion is clearly not in keeping with the  prevailing Japanese rhetoric about the  openness of  their markets and  the  fairness of their system.  There is a common awareness that  both sides want and need to trade with  one another. However, the present sit uation  is  clearly unacceptable  from  the American viewpoint and the Japa nese can rest assured we will not allow  it to continue. We are not going  to  take it any more.  It takes more than mere words to  make a market be truly open. Tangible  evidence  through sales  in Japan of  American hi-tech products  such  as  semiconductors is what we want. The  Joint Economic Committee report con cludes that ""given the history of dis crimination     the burden rests on  the  Japanese  to  demonstrate  that  their markets are in fact open."" Only  when they have done that can Con gress and the American people rest as sured that we really are on the road to  a more  equitable,  and  acceptable,  trade balance.e  ",1982
184,,97,-0.553,740,7,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker,  in  the past, we have been blameless in  pollution disasters only through lack  of awareness or full understanding of  the problems our society was creating  for itself and for future generations.  Acid rain  is unlike  these past prob lems; we  can  see  this one coming.  Unlike the past, we have an opportuni ty to act now before it is too late; an  opportunity to act to stop the pollu tion debacle  before  it  is  upon us;  before we become engaged in a mas sive and costly battle to roll back the  damaging effects of acid rain.  My concern is that, unlike water pol lution, the effects of acid rain may be  irreversible.  Some 15,000 lakes in Sweden are al ready dead from  the effects of acid  rain.  In  the  Province  of Ontario,  Canada, 45,000 lakes are showing the  effects of acid rain and many there are  already dead. Lakes in the Adirondack  Mountains  and  in  the  Boundary  Waters canoe  area of northeastern  Minnesota are already the victims of  acid fallout. We ignore these warning  signs only at our own peril. We cannot  def er action on the repeated appeals  of certain special interests for delay in  cleanup because we have not achieved  absolute  scientific  certainty  about  cause and effect, cost and benefits of  acid  rain  and  abatement  actions.  Future generations will hold us ac countable  and  they will  not  ask  whether we spent  too much or  too  little; did we know enough; or was our  knowledge inadequate? They will only  ask, did we act in time to preserve a  decent quality of life for them?  Mr. Speaker, I was one of the very  early supporters of acid rain research,  and was  instrumental  in convincing  the Carter administration to put to gether  a multiagency, multimillion  dollar  task  force  to  research  the  causes and prevention of acid rain.  While I certainly support continued  research, it is clear to me and to the  people  of  northeastern Minnesota  whom I  represent that we must act  now on the basis of what we already  know, to control acid rain to the great est extend possible.  We know that some of the lakes of  the Northeast are severely acidified;  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  and  that many  in  the Midwest are  threatened.  Studies  have  indicated  that acid rain has caused damage to 15  percent of  the  lakes  in Minnesota,  with another 2,000 in immediate jeop ardy.  We  know  that  acid  rain  causes  damage and death to aquatic life, to  forests, vegetation, and  farm  crops,  can directly damage human health  through  respiration,  and  indirectly  through  contamination  of  drinking  water.  Another study estimates that acid  rain could cost Minnesota alone up to  $64 million annually in reduced forest  productivity, and another $400 to $600  million in loss of soil fertility.  These costs are, in large part, trans ferred from the sources of acid rain to  the recipients.  Mr. Speaker, this is a grossly unfair  trade.  To refuse to control acid rain on eco nomic grounds is a totally false econo my; such arguments may spare those  who  cause  the  problem,  but  the  burden does not go away; it simply is  passed on to innocent recipients.:._the  farmers,  foresters,  fisherman,  and  resort owners and citizens of Minneso ta and many other parts of the coun try.  Congress must, this year, include a  strong  acid  rain  provision  in  the  amendments to the Clean Air Act. I  pledge my assistance, working with my  colleagues and  the vast majority of  Americans, to bring that provision into  law.e    FAILURE TO ACT ON URGENT  SUPPLEMENTAL  FOR  FISCAL  1982 <H.R. 5922)  HON.

185,,97,0.315,740,7,Mr. ERLENBORN.," Mr.  Speaker,  one has to wonder why a bill labeled  ""urgent""  is allowed  to  linger for 44  days after committee approval before  being brought to a House vote.  That is what has happened to the  urgent  supplemental  appropriations  bill for fiscal 1982, H.R. 5922; and it is  no easy matter to explain to constitu ents who are calling about funds for  wa.stewater treatment plans, or the 20percent interest they will have to pay  on tax bills being appealed which are a  part of a 47,000-case backlog at the  Tax Court.  It is harder still to explain to Feder al workers whose jobs are on the line  who are wondering whether they will  have full paychecks in June.  H.R. 5922 is called an urgent bill, be cause it is urgent. I may not support  every item in the bill, but we know it  will be acted upon at some point-and  May 6, 1982  it is morally wrong and cruel, as well  as bad management, to delay action.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms will have to furlough 1,600  employees if it does not get the $15.7  million provided in H.R. 5922 by June  27. Under present plans, 950 of the Bu reau's 1,200 agents will be furloughed,  and law enforcement activities there  will virtually come to a standstill.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics sent  out furlough notices April 13 to 1,900  people. If they are  furloughed, our  monthly reports of the consumer price  index, unemployment, and producer  prices are not going  to be made on  schedule.  The Employment and Training Ad ministration's 30-day furlough notice  went out this week to 2, 700 employees,  and 3, 700 notices are to go out tomor row to employees at the Employment  Standards Administration.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5922 is urgent and  it is in your power to move this bill. I  urge you to act with urgency.e  TOWARD A PEACEFUL SETTLE MENT OF THE CONFLICT  IN  CYPRUS  HON.BERNARDJ.DWYER  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 6, 1982   ",1982
186,,97,-0.373,740,7,Mr. DWYER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to  join my colleagues who have  participated in the recent Cyprus Day  commemoratives here in the Congress  in calling for a peaceful resolution of  the conflict in Cyprus.  The forced occupation of any terri tory is a situation which we, as citizens  of a country dedicated to freedom and  self-determination, must do what we  can to help resolve through peaceful,  diplomatic initiatives.  This July will mark the eighth anni versary of the invasion and occupation  of Cyprus. The time for an easing of  the tension in that country, and like wise, an easing of the hardship and  suffering of the 200,000 Cypriot refu gees, is long overdue.  The United States has a vital inter est in fostering a peaceful settlement  in Cyprus, first as humanitarians dedi cated to international human rights.  We must also recognize the emerging  Soviet presence in the Mediterranean  and the consequences of allowing that  presence  to  thrive unchecked  in the  type of environment the Soviets know  best: conflict and discontent.

192,Senate,97,-0.395,909,7,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President,  I  am  today introducing legislation designed  to parallel the National Industrial De velopment  Act  introduced  in  the  House by Congressman STAN LUNDINE.  I am pleased to introduce this bill be cause I believe it may point us toward  a  long-term strategy of economic de velopment.  Right now, most of our attention is  focused on the immediate problems we  confront-the budget crisis, the unem ployment rate, the interest rate, the  general lack of economic response to  the various stimuli we have sought to  apply. And given  the seriousness of  those immediate problems, it is a good  thing we are focusing on  them. My  point, however, is that no matter how  we manage  to muddle  through  this  crisis, no matter what ""quick fix"" we  use  to get by this time, we are still  going to need to face some fundamen tal questions about the nature of our  economic system.  The plain truth is that for a number  of years we  just put our economic  engine on automatic pilot and let it  run down the highway. And it worked.  We had so much technology, so much  of an edge over our competitors, that  we could afford to operate that way.  But things have changed. Energy costs  have soared, productivity has sagged,  our competitors have advanced, and  our access to foreign markets has been  restricted.  In this new environment, we cannot  afford  to continue operating as we  have. We need to look at where we are,  how we got there, and most important ly, where we want to be and how we  can get there from here.  In that context, it seems to me that  one of the major structural causes of  our current plight springs  from  the  kind of relationship we have allowed  to develop between labor and manage ment and Government in this country.  During the ""salad days"" of unlimited  growth, we allowed an environment to  develop which pitted these institutions  against each other. They developed an  adversarial  relationship  rather  than  an alliance. They became foes rather  than friends. Each one seemed to view  their relationship as a zero-sum game  in which  someone had  to win  and  someone else had to lose. The result  was a lack of cooperation and a loss of  competitive strength.  If we are to improve our economic  climate and find ways to adapt to new  markets, new technologies, new orga nizational designs, and new work pat terns, we have  to have a  structure  which allows Government and  labor  and management  to work  together.  Recent economic conditions-reaching  a crisis state  in distressed  industries  like  autos  and  trucking-have  pro duced ad hoc ""solutions"" and tempo rary truces. But unless we build on the  base that these actions have created,  we will lose momentum and forgo an  opportunity to structure industrial re lations in this country.  In order to avoid that, the legisla tion I am introducing today would es tablish a National Industrial Develop ment Board charged with the respon sibility of developing a national indus trial policy. The Board's specific duties  would be  to make  recommendations  for  national  development  priorities,  and to make recommendations at the  request of executive agencies or con gressional committees on specific  in dustrial  policy  problems  pending  before them. Since any strategy devel oped by the Board can only succeed if  it has  the common  support of  the  principal sectors of the economy, the  Board will be  a  quadripartite body  composed of leading representatives of  business, labor, Government, and the  public. The members of the Board will  be appointed by  the President from  among those candidates nominated by  the majority and minority leaders of  the Senate and the Speaker and mi nority leader of the House of Repre sentatives and will be eligible to serve  up to two 6-year terms. The Board can  hold hearings and will publish a brief  annual report outlining development  priorities for  the United States and  recommend legislative and administra tive actions in support of them.  Mr. President, shortly before he left  office in 1980, Secretary of Transpor tation Neil  Goldschmidt  issued  a  report on the state of the auto indus try. But it did more than simply look  at that specific  industry. It also ad dressed  some of  the basic concerns  that I have raised here. In that report,  Mr. Goldschmidt called for the development of what he called a new socio economic  compact  between  govern ment  and management  and  labor.  That is precisely the task that I think  we need to move ahead on-and that is  precisely  the  task that the National  Industrial Development Board would  tackle.  We simply have got to find ways to  transform potentially antagonistic sec tors of our economy into a multifacet ed force for rational and sustained na tional economic growth.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have the text of the bill print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 2518  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SHORT TITLE  SECTION 1.

Ca) The Congress hereby  SEc.  that< 1) the vitality of industry in the United  States has declined precipitously in recent  years;  (2) such decline constitutes a severe threat  to the economic future of the United States;  (3) many factors have contributed to such  decline,  including lagging productivity and  product quality, increasing imports, reduced  competitiveness of goods in foreign markets,  high energy prices,  shortsighted manage ment  strategies,  inadequate  supply  of  skilled workers, hostility between manage ment and labor, insufficient employee par ticipation in the workplace, and inadequate  Federal commitments in such crucial areas  as transportation, and other infrastructure,  and research;  (4) the numerous causes of economic de cline in the United States can be redressed  only by a comprehensive national industrial  strategy;  (5) such a strategy should also encourage  the development of emerging high-technolo gy  industries that can provide substantial  economic growth and employment;  (6) such a strategy will succeed only if <A>  it has the common support of the principal  sectors of the economy, including business,  labor, Government, and the public; and CB)  each such sector is willing to make sacrifices  to ensure mutual recovery; and  <7>  the  antipathy  that  often  prevails  among such sectors hampers development  of a consensus necessary for economic re covery in the United States.  Cb) It is the purpose of this Act< 1) to establish a Federal board designed  to produce a national  industrial strategy  that will have the support of each principal  party  to  the  industrial problems of  the  United States;  (2) to establish a mechanism for the devel opment,  outside  of  the normal  political  process, of consensual solutions to specific  industrial problems confronting  the Con gress or any Federal department or agency;  (3) to establish a mechanism for the an ticipation of future industrial problems and  the timely identification of shifts in interna tional markets and competitive standings;  ",1982

194,House,97,0.353,961,7,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, H.R.  6294  is a  try for a quick fix for our  housing dilemma. Our housing reces sion is a serious, urgent problem.  It is tainted as the only housing so lution. It is, instead, the only solution  the leadership of this House will allow  to be presented to us. It will cost $1  billion in new appropriations. It will  make a bad deficit worse.  Another proposal, which the House  leadership  refused  to allow  to come  before us, would have financed assist ance to this distressed industry by re ducing unnecessary Federal expendi tures in other areas.  This bill  is not  the way  I would  pref er to deal with the problem. I fear  it may cost more in future problems  than it brings in benefits in fiscal year  1983.  I believe the housing industry really  needs lower deficits and lower interest  rates. This bill takes us in the other di rection-the Chrysler direction.  It is solving problems in the old, dis credited way of  throwing somebody  else's money at a problem.

195,House,97,-0.404,961,7,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of  the Single-Family  Housing Production Act of 1982, one  of the single most important economic  stimulus actions which can be  taken  by this Congress.  One of  the  real  tragedies of  this  high  interest  rate,  recession-plagued  economy has been the terrible disrup tion of the housing market. Homeown ership,  so  important  to American  family life, and homebuilding, one of  the most productive activities of our  economy, have suffered tremendously  during recent years. This Congress has  an obligation  to  take swift, effective  action to promote new home construc tion and to make housing affordable  for low-and middle-income Americans.  As  others  have  pointed out,  the  housing industry has led the Nation  out  of  recession  seven  times  since  World War  II. Homebuilding has a  multiplier  effect,  which  generates  spending and employment in scores of  diverse services and industries. The $1  billion in budget authority contained  in H.R. 6294 would assist in the cre ation of 140,000 new jobs in housing related  industries; no stronger argu ment than that single statistic need be  made for this important legislation as  we consider the unconscionable trage dy of a 10-percent unemployment rate  in our land.  But in addition to creating jobs, H.R.  6294 would assist up  to 74,000 home  buyers. And it would increase Federal,  State, and local tax revenues by $1.2  billion-which more than pays for the  cost of this program.  By acting now, we can put this stim ulus into effect in time for this sum mer's building season.  As  a  cosponsor of  the Patterson AuCoin Family Housing Production  Act,  the  essential  components  of  which  have been  incorporated  into  H.R. 6294,  I enthusiastically endorse  the passage of this important legisla tion and the supplemental appropria tion for it, which we will be consider ing in the very near future.  Let us put thousands of Americans  back to work and help put an end to  an economic nightmare that has shad owed  the American dream of home ownership.e  e ",1982

197,House,97,0.646,974,7,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Chair man, I hate to disturb the love-in that  has been going on over this piece of  legislation with all of my colleagues  from the Judiciary Committee singing  its praises. But once again the Judici ary Committee has put the cart before  the horse. Rather than bringing a bail  reform bill to the floor of the House,  the committee has brought a money  bill to attempt to solve the problems  of bail jumpers and inadequate inf or mation being given to magistrates and  judges by expanding the bureaucracy  and by throwing more scarce taxpay ers' dollars at the problem.  I dissent from  that. I believe  that  this bill should not be passed until  such time as substantive bail reform  actually comes before  the House of  Representatives and is passed.  As one who witnessed the tortuous  progress of the pretrial services bill in  the last Congress when it was defeated  on the floor,  I was gratified by  the  prospect that it would enjoy a similar  and well-merited death in this budget conscious session.  At one  time  it appeared  that we  might at least correct one of the fun damental deficiencies associated with  this bill by postponing  its consider ation until this body could also act on  a measure to correct the disastrous ef fects of the Bail Reform Act of 1966.  Unfortunately, as one has learned to  expect from the Committee on the Ju diciary, the money bill before us today  advanced with lightning speed, while  more crucial  legislation moves at a  snail's pace.  Mr. Chairman, my objections to this  bill are basically three. First, I am not  convinced, given our perilous budget  situation, that a compelling need for  pretrial services has been demonstrat ed.  My  second objection  involves  the  mechanism used  to provide pretrial  services under  the bill.  It does not  place the services in the existing pro bation offices, but instead expands the  bureaucracy needlessly.  If we are, indeed, serious about limit ing  Federal  spending,  we  cannot  afford to ignore any potential avenue  for cutting costs, or at the very least,  preventing  an  expansion  of  those  costs.  Although  several  cost-saving  fea tures were added to this bill, including  a specific dollar authorization and a  sunset provision,  companion  legisla tion in the other body does not con tain these improvements.  Who knows what will emerge from  the conference?  Mr. Chairman, my third objection to  this bill relates to the committee's pri orities. At the beginning of this Con gress,  two bills  to  improve  the Bail  Reform Act, which  this present bill  implements, were introduced. On May  19, 1981, the committee favorably re ported  this bill, but the bail reform  bills languished in subcommittee.  Almost 1 year ago we were assured  that action would finally be taken on  bail  reform,  but nothing has  hap pened.  Mr.  Chairman,  action  has  been  taken on bail reform, to quote an infa mous Supreme Court decision, ""with  all deliberate speed"" and I am certain  that my colleagues  recall  from civil  rights  history  just  how  slow  such  action may be. While a subcommittee  markup on bail  reform has  indeed  been scheduled at long last, I would  point out to my colleagues that similar  legislation was reported by the full Ju diciary Committee in the other body  months and months ago.  Unless  bail  reform  legislation  is  moved promptly through the subcom mittee, the full Judiciary Committee  and the Rules Committee and on to  this floor, it will die as certainly as it  did in many previous Congresses.  At that point, as usual, we will be  left with the distinction of having only  passed a highly questionable money  bill and done nothing else.  Mr. Chairman, my opposition to this  bill  is  unqualified.  In  particular  I  object to the illusion that it will solve  our pretrial release problems. It may  temporarily patch the cracks, but the  underlying statute is in such disrepair  that a major overhaul is in order.  We do not need an expanded and ex pensive bureaucracy when reform of  the bail laws will accomplish the same  effect at much less cost.  This bill should be defeated.  Mr. SA WYER.

202,House,97,0.23,1013,7,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Speaker, may  I,  too, off er my thanks and appreciation  to the two gentlemen from Ohio, Mr.  LATTA and Mr. MILLER, for taking this  special order so  that we might  talk  about our  good  friend,  JOHN ASH BROOK.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  say  something about JOHN ASHBROOK in a  little different vein.  My first rememberance of JOHN ASH BROOK was when I came to Washing ton  in 1939  as  a  graduating senior  from Pataskala High School. Each of  the 16 high schools in Licking County  selected its so-called best citizen for an  all-expense-paid, 8-day trip to out Na tion's Capital. I was fortunate enough  to be selected  from Pataskala High  School. We really crammed a lot into  our  trip,  including a visit with our  Congressman,  William  Ashbrook,  JOHN'S father.  I mentioned  to Con gressman Bill Ashbrook having played  basketball against his son BILL where upon he brought out a picture of his  family  which,  of  course,  included  JOHN.  JOHN'S father was a Democrat  who  supported  President  Franklin  Roosevelt. My father was a Republi can who could never bring himself to  vote  for  President  Roosevelt  but  thought Congressman Bill Ashbrook  was all right and voted for him. That  is what he told me when I came home  and said that I had met Congressman  Ashbrook. My mother said she always  like Congressman Bill Ashbrook, but  then she was a Democrat. She was a  Democrat that is until I entered poli tics in 1948. Then she saw the light  and switched.  But  just as  JOHN'S dad attracted  votes  from members  of  the other  party, so did JOHN.  I would recall a  couple of reflections about JOHN.  Shortly after I was elected to Con gress, I was on a plane to Washington  seated  next  to  Congressman  Sam  Devine. JOHN ASHBROOK spotted us as  he got on the plane and said, ""There's  a couple of big spenders."" As the plane  landed, JOHN said to everyone in hear ing  distance,  ""Lucked  out  again.""  These were  scenes  to  be  repeated  many times, and they always brought  a laugh.  JOHN was an  insatiable  reader of  newspapers.  He  would  frequently  come on the plane or to the House  floor with a stack of newspapers under  his arm. When he  finished  reading  them, he would  leave  them  there which  caused  Congressman  Frank  Thompson to refer to him as ""Trash brook.''  These episodes reflect a humorous  side to this intense person who was so  conservative  in his political philoso phy.  ",1982
203,House,97,-0.435,1026,7,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, it may  be true that you can learn more about  a man from what is said about him by  his adversaries than by his friends. I  was one who seldom agreed with JOHN  AsHBROOK's  conservative  views.  In  fact, we approached most issues from  opposite ends of  the political  spec trum; and, as members of the Judici ary Committee, we were frequently at  odds. While JOHN was always a force ful advocate for what he believed was  right, he never fought in anger or with  ad hominem arguments.  Instead he  relied on his courage, intelligence, and  integrity in fighting his legislative bat tles. For these qualities, he had my re spect, and the respect of all his col leagues.  JOHN  ASHBROOK  was  a  tireless  worker who was devoted to serving the  people of Ohio. They  returned his  dedication by electing him 11 times to  his House seat. It is a  true  tragedy  that this vibrant man has been taken  from us so soon, and I want to express  my deepest sympathies to JOHN AsH BROOK's family at this most difficult  time.e  e ",1982
204,House,97,0.271,1026,7,Mr. SCHULZE.," Mr. Speaker, I was  shocked and saddened, as were we all,  by the untimely passing of our dedi cated colleague, JOHN ASHBROOK. His  wise and able counsel will be sorely  missed during the difficult debate to  come on the pressing issues facing our  Nation.  It could always be said of JOHN that  he cared for  this country  in a way  which made us all proud to know him.  His tireless fight for what he believed  to be best  for our Nation set him  above  the average man. He did not  seek the limelight, but instead sought  the truth. Many times he faced this  body on an issue with the cards clearly  stacked against him, but he  fought  anyway knowing that he would be less  than true  to his beliefs  if he aban doned the fight in the face of opposi tion. This  type of devotion will be  sorely missed in this body.  JOHN has embarked on what some  have called the last great adventure. I  am certain that he will succeed in this  as he has in everything he did in life. I  wish him eternal peaceful  rest and  extend to his family my sincerest sym pathy.e  e ",1982
205,House,97,0.333,1026,7,Mr. ROBINSON.," Mr. Speaker, it is  with sadness and a deep sense of loss  that I rise at this time to off er a few  words in tribute to the service of my  valued  colleague  and  friend,  JOHN  ASHBROOK.  While I had enjoyed the beneifts of  JoHN's friendship and advice through out my congressional service,  it was  through our work  together on  the  House Permanent Select Committee  on Intelligence that our rapport was  reinforced in a way which makes his  passing  a wrenching experience  for  me.  As all of my colleagues in this House  know, this committee is not one which  seeks the limelight. To be effective, it  must  rely on  the dedication of  its  members, and of the supportive staff,  to the intelligence elements of our na tional security effort. JOHN ASHBROOK  made a  full commitment to the mis sion of  the committee, without any  thought of increased political visibili ty.  His  other  assignments  in  the  House, and his work in behalf of the  constituents of his district were not  neglected  in any degree, but when  JOHN ASHBROOK came to the meetings  of the Intelligence Committee, he gave  these sessions full attention, and his  contributions always were responsible  and constructively  responsive  to  the  questions at hand.  The  loss of  JOHN ASHBROOK  is  a  severe one to this House. It is a major  loss  to his constituency and a most  grievous one to his family. His was a  voice of responsible, realistic conserv atism  in the national  interest which  the House profited by in its delibera tions and decisions.  I will miss him sorely, and so will all  here who had the privilege of working  closely with him and  receiving  the  support of his well-considered  judg ments and balanced perception.   ",1982
206,House,97,0.372,1026,7,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, I never  thought it would be my sad chore to  speak in memory of our dear, departed  friend, JOHN ASHBROOK.  I had always  considered him to be a hardy man, in defatigable, but then, every now and  then, we are brought  to our senses  that the worst can happen at any time  and it is with a deep sense of loss that  I  join  in  this  tribute  to JOHN ASH BROOK.  Our  friendship  stretches  back  to  those days when we were considered to  be young Republicans and ever since  he came  to this House he has been  something very special to this institu tion.  I know of no one during my  better than 25 years as a Member of  this body who has stood more solidly  and consistently for the principles in  which he believed. He was  one of  those who never flinched from stand ing alone  if that was necessary. He  always knew where JOHN would be on  an issue. We never had to speculate on  how he would vote and the tougher  the issue, the more he committed him self to a cause and battled fiercely for  his point of view.  He was a gifted and able debater. He  knew how to dish it out and how to  take it. He could be oh, so partisan,  but I dare say no one was more re spected by his adversaries and political  opponents than was JOHN ASHBROOK.  Whether it was in committee or on the  floor of this House you could always  count on JOHN having done his home work and he never needed anyone to  pull his irons out of the fire, and when  all  the debate was over, whether in  committee, at a convention, or on this  floor, he could always be  the most  gentle and kind person to talk to and  to make light of all the verbosity that  had just taken place.  He was one of those who could truly  be characterized as a super patriot. He  had to live his life that way, because  he felt so intensely about it and I will  tell you when we flew out to Johns town, Ohio, for his funeral, one had to  ",1982

Mr. CONTE is  one of the able Members of the House.  In answer  to  the gentleman from  Michigan <Mr. DUNN)  as  the gentle man in the well remembers, in the ap propriation bill that passed the House  on October 6 of last year, we had the  amount of $370 million in the bill for  this particular program. My  friend,  SILVIO CONTE will tell you, we believed  on our subcommittee that that was a  proper amount. We put it in the bill.  We brought  it  to  the House. The  House passed it.  On the other side, that amount was  reduced to $290 million. The gentle man's inquiry, as I understand, is if on  the other side that amount is brought  back  to  about  the House  figure,  whether or not we would carefully  consider  it. With  the persmission of  the gentleman in the well, as far as I  personally am concerned, I would say  to the gentleman that if the figure is  brought back to the House level, cer tainly we would approve it.

215,House,97,0.091,1169,7,Mrs. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  for  yielding,  and  I  would like to associate myself with his  remarks and also to congratulate the  gentleman in the well for his tremen dous effort on the part of small business, as well as the gentleman from  Pennsylvania <Mr. MCDADE), the rank ing minority member on  the Small  Business Subcommittee. I clearly have  enjoyed my service on the Small Busi ness Committee the last two terms in  Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I  think it appropriate  at the outset of this Small Business  Week to stop a moment and reflect on  the vital importance of the small busi ness sector of our American economy.  The small business sector unques tionably represents the vast majority  of the total number of business estab lishments nationwide. When new jobs  are created, you are more likely than  not going to find that growth spring ing  from  small business. The small  business community originates a  full  50 percent of all major innovations in  this country.  I might add that that  figure could be significantly increased  if H.R. 4326, the Small Business Inno vation and Development Act is agreed  to by  this House. Furthermore, ap proximately 40 percent of the entire  U.S. gross national product is gleaned  from small business. Additionally, the  small business sector provides oppor tunity for women, minorities, and dis advantaged to fulfill  their desires to  become total1y self-reliant.  Our  job, which we must not  lose  sight of,  is  to  facilitate  this much  needed  growth  through  coherent,  steady business policy. However, one  ingredient  for growth  in  the  small  business sector  that no government  can provide is an individual's initiative.  While we as legislators may help pro vide favorable tax laws and a benefi cial business climate in which to work,  unless an individual possesses the initi ative to pursue his or her dream, there  is virtually nothing that we as  law makers can do. During this small busi ness week, I would like to point to the  Maine small businessman of the year  as an example of someone who saw op portunity and invested himself fully to  attain his goals. Mal Sibulkin,  from  Avon, Maine, took a concept that his  mother and father devised and built a  thriving business, manufacturing moti vational teaching aids for the handi capped. Lauri, Inc., as the company is  known, started with a  few hundred  dollars, an  idea, and has burgeoned  into a multimillion dollar corporation  which now exports  to 25  countries.  The point is, that there are potentially  millions of Mal Sibulkins in America  who have the desire to contribute and  the will to succeed. It is our duty to be  the catalyst, to lend the helping hand  that  the  small  business men  and  women of this Nation need. By build ing a solid small business foundation  for America, we  insure a prosperous  future. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  ",1982
216,House,97,-0.347,1169,7,Mr. BAILEY of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Maryland <Mr. MITCHELL).  I will be  very brief.  I serve on the Ways and  Means Committee, and I want the gen tleman to know that part of the work  that we had tried to do to supplement  and add to the efforts that the gentle man has so nobly advanced were  to  write  tax  legislation which  in  fact  would assist in the reinvestment incen tives and those  types of things that  the gentleman has worked so hard on.  I suppose I really cannot add much  to what has been  said here  today  except to compliment the gentleman. I  know the work that he has extended. I  know particularly  the concerns  that  he has had for minority small busi ness. One of the problems with our  country has been providing equal op portunities and opportunities to move  into middle-class businesses and small  businesses  essentially of  that  type,  which  is something that I know the  gentleman has worked very hard on. I  would like to bring that to the atten tion of the country.  I  think  the gentleman should be  complimented for his efforts in that  regard particularly; black citizens and  minority citizens of all genre in our  country really owe  the gentleman a  debt of gratitude.

218,Senate,97,0.508,1247,7,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  the Budget Committee, which  has  been subjected to quite a lot of criti cism-most of it, at least in this in stance,  unfair  criticism-really  has  done nothing more than face the facts  in its resolution. I should note in pass ing that there are a lot of good rea sons to criticize the Budget Commit tee,  and on some other occasion  I  would be glad to join those who criti cize it. But the notion that somehow  the Budget Committee is getting after  social  security  recipients,  trying  to  take something away from social secu rity recipients, is just a classic example  of criticizing the bearer of bad news.  And I am not unmindful that in an cient days the practice was to behead  the messenger who brought the king  news which he did not wish to hear. I  hope we are not going to be beheaded,  but it is  important that we face the  facts,  and  that  is  literally  all  the  Budget Committee has done.  First of all, the Budget Committee  faced the unmistakable fact that the  trust funds are in jeopardy. We are in  trouble.  Second, the Budget Committee has  faced the fact-and I trust this to be a  fact; I am sure it is-that we are not  going to let social security go broke.  We are not going to do that. We are  not going to have social security trust  funds make late payments. We are not  going to break faith with the 36 mil lion people who have their lives orga nized on the assumption that they are  going to get a check.  Third,  the Budget Committee also  has recognized and faced squarely a  fact that some may be a lot less willing  to face readily and that is that there  are not very many options.  I compliment the Senator from Lou isiana for his statement earlier. I do  not agree with his proposed solution  to the problem of financing social se curity, but he  is meeting  the  issue  head on. He has said what his ap proach is going to be. He has made a  prediction that may be borne out-he  has been known to be right-as to how  we are going to solve this problem.  Option No. 1: If you start with the  basic premise  I  have  just outlined,  that social security is indeed in trouble  and we are not going to let it go broke,  the first option  to be considered  is  raising taxes. Since 1950, the tax for  social security has increased 2,011 per cent. During the same period of time,  real wages have gone up, I comment in  passing, 490 percent.  So it is my belief that with the tre mendous increase in payroll taxes in  recent years, with the mounting evidence of what this has done to small  and large businesses, but particularly  small businesses, with respect to their  economic activity, and the realization  that  the average working man and  woman in this country pay more in  social  security  taxes  today  than  in  Federal income taxes, I regard it as an  unwise policy and a most unlikely de velopment that we are going to fur ther increase the payroll tax beyond  the scheduled increase. Even so, that  is option No. 1.  Option No.  2  is  that we might  change eligibility standards, and that  has been the recommendation of many  of the people to whose reports I have  alluded in my earlier remarks. Many  people have suggested various forms  of changes in eligibility standards.  Option No.  3  is  that we might  change the rate of increase in benefits.  I do not know of any person in or out  of Congress who  really  thinks we  should or will cut the average level of  benefits. There may be such a person.  I do not know of anyone. what is being  suggested, for the most part, is a re duction in the rate of increases in ben efits in the future.  I want to make it absolutely clear  that in suggesting that, in one way or  another, through revenue measures or  through a reduction in the rate of in crease  in  expenditures,  there be  a  ",1982

It is a harsh, unpleasant fact that  the social security system faces grave  financial problems and that the retire ment trust fund may not be able to  pay benefits beyond June 1983. Obvi ously, there is no easy, painless solu tion to this problem. However, in an  attempt to resolve both the short-term  and  long-term  financial  problems  faced by the social security system, on  December 16, 1981, the President es tablished the National Commission on  Social Security Reform. It is the task  of this Commission to study the prob lems and make recommendations by  the end of this year which will insure  the fiscal soundness of the system.  The amendment before the Senate  states that this body will await the  recommendations  of  the  National  Commission  on  Social  Security  Reform prior to making any specific  changes  in  the  social  security pro gram. It also calls for the payment of  the full 7.4 percent cost-of-living ad justment in July of this year on sched ule;  it reaffirms the Senate's solemn  commitment to preserve and protect  the social security system; and it de clares  that  any  corrective  actions  taken by the Senate shall not include  any more than absolutely necessary to  preserve the financial integrity of the  social security system.  Mr. President, I am confident that  any abrupt reductions in social securi ty benefits can be avoided if Congress  faces  its  responsibilities squarely on  this issue. Hopefully, it will not be nec essary  to make any cuts  in benefit  levels of current recipients. However,  it may well be that the rate at which  these benefits are  increased  in  the  future-the annual cost-of-living ad justments-will have to be scaled back,  along with other  reasonable adjust ments in the program affecting future  beneficiaries. After receiving the rec ommendations  of  the  Presidential  Commission,  Congress  must  act  promptly so that beneficiaries will be  able to plan for whatever adjustments  might be necessary, and so that the  long-range stability of a worthwhile  social security program can be main tained.

225,,97,0.287,1364,7,Mr. PARRIS.," Mr. Speaker, since the  beginning of this year, this House and  the other body have been paralyzed by  the  failure  to  reach  a meaningful  budget compromise.  Much of the debate regarding this  impasse has been partisan with  the  Democrats blaming President Reagan  for failure to compromise and the Re publicans  blaming Speaker O'NEILL  for his failure to compromise.  I have heard from many of my con stituents who simply wish  the Con gress and the President would sit down  and do the work necessary to reach a  reasonable compromise.  I  could not  agree with them more. It is  time to  end  this political speechmaking and  get on with the business of governing.  There was recently printed an excel lent article by  James  J. Kilpatrick  which clearly summarizes my opinion  and what I believe to be the consensus  of the American citizenry. I heartily  commend it to my colleagues' atten tion.  The article follows:  WASHINGTON.-It  is time to talk common  sense on this matter of a federal budget for  fiscal '83 and thereafter. We have had en tirely too much, on both sides, of playing to  the galleries, of striking  ideological  atti tudes, of looking to the elections in Novem ber. Knock it off, I would say to the presi dent and to Speaker Tip O'Neill. Just knock  it off.  We start with fundamentals: The prospec tive deficits are too large. It is almost imma terial that in times past, as a percentage of  the gross national product and as a percent age of total spending, the nation has sur vived relatively larger deficits. The prospec tive federal borrowings are a major factor in  keeping interest rates at the absurdly high  levels that now maintain.  Call it Catch-22 or call it a vicious circle:  So long as the deficits stay high, the inter est rates stay high; so long as the interest  rates stay high, unemployment stays high.  Bankruptcies soar. The economy remains in  recession. The key to recovery lies in reduc ing these fantastic rates of interest; and the  key to these rates of interest lies in doing  something positive about the deficits.  OK? The prospective deficits can be re duced in two ways only-by increasing reve nues, or by reducing outlays, or of course by  a combination of both.  Let me  interject one more fundamental  proposition: National security comes  first.  No other function of the national govern ment is even close. After we have met the  requirements for a strong defense, we can  talk about the needs of health, education,  welfare, housing, the farmers, the old folks,  the college students, the arts and sciences  and all the rest.  Those are the starting points, and so far  as I can perceive, these propositions attract  nearly universal support. Our problems are  not problems in kind; they are problems of  degree.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  If this is the case, it ought to be possible  for men of good will  to  find  acceptable  common ground. I happen to believe that  the president's ideas on tax reduction are  basically sound: By cutting the rates of tax ation  on both  business  and  individuals,  enough new economic activity should be  generated that in time we produce more tax  revenue than the former rates would have  produced. But the structure of a tax reduc tion plan is not cast in concrete. As a tool  for  reducing  the prospective deficits,  the  program of tax reduction can be adjusted.  The same common-sense rule applies  to  federal outlays. These ruinous deficits are  largely a product of  the entitlement pro grams that have gone out of control. Never  mind  the partisan politics: Both Republi cans  and Democrats  are  responsible  for  these loose cannons. We simply are spend ing  too much  on  food  stamps,  school  lunches, health care, crop subsidies, busi ness subsidies, educational grants and other  programs. Nothing but political cowardice  stands in the way of making responsible re ductions in Social Security benefits.  Mr. Reagan will have to yield on parts of  his defense budget. The Democrats' chief  spokesman, Richard Bolling of Missouri,  may be quite right when he insists that the  president's program amounts to too much,  too  fast. The concept of  strong defense  comes first, but within that concept reason able minded men may disagree. The less im perative defense measures can prudently be  postponed.  But by the same token, Mr. Bolling and  Speaker O'Neill will have to yield on non defense items. A decent society must meet  the minimum social needs of those who are  truly unable to fend for themselves. All of  us understand that. But the '83 budget is  still larded with fat. If we are in earnest  about reducing the deficits, as a key to ev erything else,  then  the merely desirable  social programs must be cut to the bone.  Nothing in the whole fiscal problem strikes  me as mysterious-and damned if I see why  it should be so hard to resolve.e  May 12, 1982  presented  Mr.  plaque  expressing  Charles  Thomas,  McCLORY with  a  their appreciation.

229,,97,-0.516,1377,7,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er, the Committee on Post Office and  Civil Service today reported out H.R.  6310, the Air Traffic System Personnel  Improvements Act.  This bill is designed to insure the re building of the Nation's beleagured air  traffic control system. Unless correc tive steps are taken by this Congress  the system will continue to limp along  for some time.  I urge  the House  to move expedi tiously  to  insure  that  this will not  happen.  This bill is designed to address three  problems now  faced by  the Federal  Aviation  Administration.  First,  it  would insure sorely needed personnel  management  improvements  at  the  agency. Second, it would improve sag ging morale of FAA employees. And  third, it would facilitate  the prompt  return of the air traffic control system  to full capacity-a move that is essen tial to economic recovery of the Na tion's airlines industry.  The administration's air traffic con trol bill <H.R. 5038) would do none of  these things. It ignores serious man agement problems and does nothing to  restore the system to full capacity.  There  is now  incontrovertible evi dence of critical management short comings within the Federal Aviation  Administration. If these are not cor rected, there is every likelihood that,  in the near future, the Nation will be  confronted with another painful dis pute involving air traffic controllers.  At the same time, the Nation's air lines are in an economic tailspin with  losses  in the millions and layoffs in  the  thousands.  Related  industries  have been severely affected.  A  return  to profitability expected  later this year as a result of improved  economic conditions could be thwarted  by a failure to remove the slot alloca tion system and return the air traffic  control system to its prestrike level. In  order  to  prev €nt  the  system  from  being overworked during the control ler shortage, the FAA restricted flight  slots at 22 major airports. This situa tion will continue until the system is  rebuilt.

For the benefit of my colleagues I  am inserting the text of this resolu tion in the RECORD at this point.  H. CON.

DON BONKER  OF WASHINGTON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 12, 1982  e ",1982
231,,97,-0.336,1390,7,Mr. BONKER.," Mr. Speaker,  the  Subcommittee on Human Rights and  International Organizations has  fol lowed  the  situation  in Guatemala  closely. Last July we had a compre hensive hearing with the Inter-Ameri can Affairs Subcommittee, and since  then have carefully documented the  ""Violations  of  the  Lucas  Garcia  regime.""  A coup took place on March 23 by  Gen. Rios Montt, which followed the  non-Democratic elections.  I welcome  and support the new President's prom ises to reform the government and put  an end to human rights violations.  The  administration  has  proposed  $250,000 in IMET for Guatemala in its  supplemental fiscal year 1983 foreign  aid request. It has also informally re quested  congressional permission  to  reprogram $50,000  in IMET now, as  well as grant licenses for the sale of  $3. 7 million worth of helicopters  to  the Guatemala Army.  Today, at a meeting of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee, we contin ued consideration of the administra tion's supplemental request. I put the  administration on notice  that  I  am  concerned  about  their  request  for  Guatemala, for a number of reasons.  Time and time again, the Reagan ad ministration has ignored the instruc tions of the Congress, both as articu lated in the law, and in the committee  report accompanying the foreign aid  bill. Other subcommittee chairmen are  familiar with this phenomenon.  It is my concern that if the Congress  does not make its concerns about Gua temala  explicit,  the  administration  will ignore existing human rights laws,  and steamroll ahead with plans  for  military assistance.  What assurances does this commit tee have that the Reagan administra tion will not provide military support  to countries with poor human rights  records? How can we be sure that their  initial  request will not be  followed  with larger and larger support even if  the human rights conditions are still  poor?  I believe that the Congress should  make it clear to the Reagan adminis tration that we will not support any  military assistance to Guatemala until  it is clear that the human rights situa tion has really changed. I would like  to see these conditions met:  First. The government is complying  with  internationally  recognized  human rights standards.  Second.  It is  exercising  complete  control over the army, police, security  forces, and militias.  Third.  It is committed  to holding  free and fair elections with the partici pation  of  all  democratic  elements  within a reasonable period.  Fourth.  It  has  investigated  and  brought  to  justice  those  responsible   for the murders of three U.S. church  people last year: Fr. Stanley Rother,  Brother Miller, and Mennonite Mis sionary John Troyer.  Fifth. No Army officers or civilians  have  been  prosecuted  for  human  rights violations: Gen. Rios Montt has  yet to charge, try, or punish a single  military officer for the thousands of  assassinations committed during  the  Lucas Garcia presidency. Until there  has been a thorough housecleaning of  the army, police, and security forces,  ",1982

235,House,97,-0.355,113,14,Mr. RATCHFORD.," Mr. Speaker, I  have been brought up in the tradition  of  a  bipartisan American  foreign  policy. But I confess that this adminis tration's  approach  to  El  Salvador  makes that tradition difficult,  if not  impossible, to observe.  How  in  the world can we at  this  point certify more aid to El Salvador?  I will give you one  reason why we  should not be doing this at this time.  That reason is the unresolved murders  of  four American  religious workers.  One of these, Jean Donovan, lived in  my State,  the State of Connecticut.  And yet since December 1980,  there  has been no real progress on solving  the murders, no trial for the murders,  no answers to the American families  of these murdered religious workers.  Mr. Speaker, without these answers,  there should be no new aid to El Sal vador.

Mr. Chairman,  I have  listened  in tently to the remarks of the gentle man who offers the amendment, and I  really cannot see any reason for the  amendment  except  that  instead of  really proposing the so-called Axe that  the amendment would authorize, what  we are doing really is killing the Tri dent II or the D-5 missile that is to be  produced for our Trident submarine.  Now, the gentleman served for sever al years on the Armed Services Com mittee, and he is very knowledgeable.  He speaks with authority on many  subjects. But if you will examine what  he would propose to do, whether it be  with this amendment of other amend ments, he  is against  the B-1, he  is  against the Trident, he is against the  MX,  and he  is  against most  any  system coming down the line. He has a  better  alternative which would,  in  effect, kill the system we are talking  about. He  is  talking about this Axe  system we already have, which is noth ing more than a conceptual design. We  have the MRASM cruise missile that  will destroy runways, and take out air fields and this  is what the so-called  Axe would do.  The Department of Defense has not  asked for this; the Air Force has not  asked for this. I do not know of any body who thinks this is a good weapon  system except the proponent of the  amendment. He says that we will take  out the Trident and try a new concept,  but that concept is still on a piece of  paper.  I think we would be very shortsight ed on the Armed Services Committee  and very shortsighted as Members of  the House  to kill a weapon system  that has been  studied and  that  is  needed and accept a conceptual weap ons system that may or may not be ef",1982

242,House,97,0.097,152,14,Mr. MITCHELL of New York.," Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the requi site number of words, and I rise in op position to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to point  out to my colleagues that the primary  purpose of our troops overseas and our  support of NATO  is  to protect  the  United States. We  believe  that  in  unity there is strength.  This amendment would have a dev astating effect on our foreign policy. If  we just take Europe, for example, first  of all we would be reneging on our  commitment  to provide 10 divisions  within 10 days in case of war. Then,  too,  if we  reduce  our  strength  in  NATO certainly our allies will want to  reduce their strength.  I would like to point out to my col league that at the present time we are  already way behind the Soviets as far  as quantities are concerned.  In  total military  the Soviets  are  ahead 1.5 to 1;  in main battle tanks,  3.3  to  1;  antitank  guided weapon  launchers, 3 to 1; artillery mortars, 3  to 1; armored personnel vehicles, 3 to  1.  The only place we are ahead is  in  attack helicopters and we have a 1.7to-1 ratio there.  So we already have too few people in  NATO to really do the job we should.  We will exacerbate an already danger ous situation.  It also would be perceived by our po tential enemy, the Soviet Union, as a  lack of interest in our defense, a lack  of will. It will appear to be a  trend  toward  isolationism  or  a  ""Fortress  America"" mentality.  It would be encouragement to the  Soviet Union to spread their influence  even further than they have.  So I do not think it is a good idea at  all for strategic reasons. But it is not  even good as far as  the economy  is  concerned.  As  the chairman pointed out,  this  program in the first year would cost  over  $2  billion. During  the  entire  course of the program it would cost us  something like $20 billion.  I am sure there are very few Con gressmen who want  to  increase  the  budget by $20 billion and in the proc ess seriously weaken our security.  0 1420  The only way you can save money  with  this program  is  to bring  the  troops back to the United States and  send them home, chase them out of  the Armed Services.  So I urge a ""no"" vote.  ",1982
243,House,97,-0.429,152,14,Mr. SOLARZ.,"  I  thank the gentle man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I have great respect  for my very good friend,  the gentle woman from Colorado, the author of  this amendment, and I have no doubt  that she means very well. But it seems  to me that the adoption of this amend ment would have the gravest conse quences not only for America's inter ests but for the preservation of peace  around the world.  At a  time when  there are 100,000  Soviet troops on the march in Afghan istan, when there are 185,000 Vietnam ese troops on the march in Cambodia,  and when there continues to be sub stantial Cuban forces  in Angola and  Ethiopia, it is not the time for us to  reduce by 50 percent the number of  American troops stationed overseas.  There are other Members here who  can speak with greater expertise than  I to the precise military consequences  of the withdrawal of these forces from  Europe and Asia. But let me offer a  few judgments about the political and  diplomatic consequences of the adop tion of this amendment.  For one  thing,  it would eliminate  whatever chances we have of achiev ing an  agreement with  the Soviet  Union within the framework of the  mutual and balanced force reduction  negotiations which are still underway  in Europe.  Surely, it is in our interest to bring  about a  reduction in the number of  Soviet troops in Eastern Europe. But  we will have no chance of doing that if  we unilaterally cut by up to half the  number of American troops stationed  in Western Europe.  Second, at a time when we are expe riencing some real tension and trouble  in our relations with our NATO allies  as a result of the pipeline decision and  other differences that have developed  in  recent months between  us,  the  adoption of this amendment would be  seen by our European allies as a re treat from our commitment to the alli ance. And  it would be much more  likely to exacerbate the accommoda tionist tendencies which have already  developed in Western Europe, leading  eventually  to  the Finlandization of  Western Europe, than it would be to  lead to a much greater commitment on  to  the part of our European allies  their own defense.  In Asia, where we have a very pre carious  balance  of  power  on  the  Korean Peninsula and where in fact  North Korea has substantially greater  air, armor, and artillery than South  Korea,  the withdrawal of American  forces  from below  the 38th parallel  could very well tempt North Korea to  make another effort  to  reunify  the  Korean Peninsula under its control.

246,,97,-0.106,256,14,Mr. APPLEGATE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  strongly denouncing  the  recent  action by  the U.S. Senate's Public  Works and Environment Committee  calling  for  ""arbitrary and extreme""  changes in the Clean Air Act. Specifi cally,  these changes mandate drasti cally reduced amounts of sulfur diox ide in the air in about one-half of the  country. The provision must now go to  the full Senate for approval.  In amending the Clean Air Act, the  Senate committee passed  legislation  that would reduce sulfur dioxide <S02)  by 8 million tons below the 1980 actual  levels, estimated to be between 16 and  21 million tons. The reduction would  have to be achieved over a period of 12  years  in  the 31-State  region of  the  country that is east of the borders of  the Mississippi River. The provision  also places a cap on S02 emissions at  that level from that time on.  I am in favor of a healthy environ ment and believe  that certain con straints should be enforced, but these  excessive standards will be highly in flationary as a result of the tremen dous costs associated with their imple mentation with no guarantee that the  scientific phenomena known as acid  rain will be eliminated or even  re duced. To date there is no substantive  scientific  documentation  indicating  that S02 emissions are the direct and  major source of acid rain. It is for this  purpose that I have supported the ac celerated 5-year study  into  the  true  causes and effects of acid rain, so as to  know what course of action would be  proper to take.  These provisions are an adaptation  of the so-called Mitchell bill, S. 1706, a  bill introduced last year in the Senate  by  Senator  GEORGE  MITCHELL  of  Maine, which basically called for a 10million-ton reduction over 10 years in  the same geographic area as that em bodied in the legislation encountered  above. Under  this  latter  proposal,  Ohio Power, a divison of the American  Electric Power system found that, be tween now and 1990 in higher electric  bills,  increases  in Ohio utility costs  alone would amount  to more  than  $500 million each year.  In addition,  the passage of this bill would close the  rest of Ohio's and many other Appa lachian States' deep mines because of  its high sulfur content coal;  thereby  adding 12,000 to 15,000 to the ranks of  the unemployed.  I regret very much that the Senate  has taken the action it has without  waiting for the results of the ongoing  studies. Their  spontaneous,  actions  are  ill conceived,  strongly  and  ex",1982

249,Senate,97,0.241,334,14,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. President, I am  disappointed in the recent announce ment merely to extend, for 1 year, the  present long-term agreement with the  Soviets  and not  renegotiate higher  minimums. We are not doing enough  to promote agricultural exports.  Farmers have not asked too much  even though net farm income will be  the lowest in history this year. They  have clearly taken their share of cuts  in response to the President's plan for  this Nation's economic recovery and  now we are throwing our farmers a  bone. I do not believe farmers will un derstand because many are the same  people who supported the administra tion all the way through.  It is my feeling that most farmers  would be willing to move  to a more  free-market approach  to agriculture,  but it  is  totally  inconsistent  to ask  them to do that when we deny them  the markets  they need  to sell  their  products at a ""fair"" price.  I have said many  times  that our  farmers cannot afford to pay for our  foreign policy decisions. We continue  in this facade of not wanting to send  the wrong signal while our biggest  competitors in the world marketplace  take our place in third-country mar kets. Being a farmer myself, I know  that the majority of farmers do not  want their income to come from the  Federal Treasury, but decisions  like  this leave them absolutely no choice in  the matter. Their destinies are taken  completely out of their own hands.  Now is the best time to negotiate an  agreement with the Soviets. The total  planted area in the U.S.S.R. has been  leveling off  in  recent years, as has  their production, while their demand  for wheat and  feed grains has  in creased dramatically. USDA has just  downgraded  the Soviet 1982 harvest  figures  from 185 metric  tons  to 170  metric tons, which almost insures the  fact that the Soviets are  looking at  their fourth consecutive deficit crop  and will probably be importing record  amounts of grain. <At the same time  the United States  is  looking at the  prospects of a  record winter wheat  crop of 2.1 billion bushels and a record  feed grain harvest.) There is no ques tion  that our  farmers  can provide  those grain  stocks more  efficiently  than any other country in the world.  We are attempting to make all of  the supply adjustments within our do mestic policies.  I believe most of us  who have been paying attention to our  farm price problems know  that the  only market for increased production  is exports. Farmers have not reacted  incorrectly to market conditions, but  as long as we use grain as an economic  sanction, we have no ""free market"" or  true market condition. We are in fact  cutting farmers off from one of their  biggest markets.  Secretary Block, in testimony before  the Senate Agriculture Committee in  early February of  this year,  stated  that in 1970 U.S. agricultural exports  to  the Soviet Union  amounted  to  about  $16 million.  ""By  1979,  this  market had grovm to $3 billion-about  one-tenth of the total export market  for U.S. farm products,"" the Secretary  pointed out, ""but this growth came to  a sudden halt in January 1980-U.S.  farm product exports to the U.S.S.R.  feel to $1.2 billion that year. Since the  lifting of the embargo last April, there  has been only a moderate recovery in  these exports.""  The Secretary went on to say that in  1979 about 10 percent of Argentina's  grain exports were  shipped  to  the  Soviet Union. In 1982 their shipments  to the Soviets are expected to reach 65  percent of their export total. Canada  shipped about 10 percent of its pro duction in 1979. In 1982 they are ex pected to ship 35 percent of their pro duction  to  the Soviets. Australia's  share was practically nothing in 1979  and now could reach 15 percent. It is  quite  clear  that  this  irresponsible  policy is causing us to export our agri cultural productivity to our competi tors.  Under our long-term agreement with  the Soviets, our share of their wheat  and coarse grain market rose from 55  percent in 1977 to 66 percent in 1978,  ",1982
250,House,97,0.287,347,14,Mr. PARRIS.," Mr. Speaker, the bill  before us today would provide death  benefits to survivors of Federal law en forcement officers and firefighters. It  has my support and commendation.  I am sure I do not need to remind  this body that because of the police of ficers of this country, America is ""the  land of the free."" We are free from the  type of crime and terrorism that is at  this moment threatening many other  societies in the world-societies where  citizens who do not have capable and  dedicated  law  enforcement  cannot  leave  their homes without  fear of  harm.  Because of the police officers in this  country, America is ""the home of the  brave."" In this city a police officer and  a Secret Service agent were wounded  while protecting the President of the  United States. It is because of acts of  bravery like this, that America contin ues to be the land of the free.  I also would ask my colleagues  to  recall the valiant firefighters of this  country who protect lives and proper ty and risk their own lives daily for  those in extreme danger. They deserve  the full support of Congress.  Currently, local firefighters and law  enforcement officers receive survivors  death benefits under Public Law 94430. Should we not provide the same  benefits  to  hard-working  Federal  safety officers?  Over 5,000 Federal law enforcement  officers and almost as many firefight ers enlist our support for this legisla tion. I strongly urge my colleagues to  support this worthwhile endeavor.e  e ",1982

263,House,97,-0.685,542,14,Mr. DYMALLY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr.  Chairman,  my  friend,  the  famous speaker from California, Jesse  Unruh,  used  to  say,  ""You  cannot  amend a bad bill with a good amend ment,"" and I believe this is the case.  But I think I am going to make this  the exception. This is a good amend ment for a number of reasons.  In the first place,  the reason why  the CBI  is in trouble is because the  people in the State Department do not  know the difference between the Car ibbean and Central America.  1710  This station is designed to stop the  rise of communism in the Caribbean,  so let us examine the Caribbean.  The Caribbean, as defined by Dr.  Jose Dominguez, the famous historian  at Harvard, is those islands surround ed by  the Caribbean Sea, plus  the  Guyands and Belize, because of their  long Anglo-Afro relationship with the  British  Commonwealth  countries.  That is the Caribbean.  This  station, Radio Marti,  is  de signed to beam programs to counteract  the spread of communism in the Car ibbean.  Where is communism in the Carib bean? Let us examine it.  The Cubans were  in J a.maica. The  Jamaicans  took care of  the Cubans  through the democratic process. The  man in power at the time who enter tained the Cubans called for elections  long before his term expired and the  people of Jamaica, in a democratic set ting, took care of the Cubans.  Now, then, they say then they are in  Grenada. A member of  the Armed  Services Committee on this floor here  today, Mr. DELLUMS, will  talk about  his visit  there. The gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. CROCKETT)  the gentle man  from Michigan <Mr. CoNYERS)  and I have been down there looking  for the Cubans.  Yes, they are there, building an air port. But the people who run Grenada  are basically Fabian socialists. They  come from the London School of Eco nomics and one of my friends on the  other side of the aisle will tell you a  little bit about that school.  The  free enterprise system  is un touched  in Grenada. The  business  sector, the private sector, was up here  for  the big bash that the President  had at the OAS auditorium with Mr.  Rockefeller.  The  free  enterprise  system is flowing freely in Grenada.  So on what other  islands are  the  Cubans  present  in  the Caribbean?  None.  They are not in Guyana. Guyana is  a socialist country without the pres ence of the Cubans or the Soviets.  So when you take those three coun tries; Jamaica having taken care of it  by  the democratic process, Grenada  having a  free enterprise system, and  you take Guyana, you have no island  described by historians and scholars as  being part of the Caribbean.  So what you are really talking about  is beaming  these programs  for  the  benefit of Central Americans. These  programs will not beam into Central  America. They will jam stations in the  Dominican Republic,  in Haiti,  in Ja maica; friendly countries to the United  States would be disrupted by this sta tion.  So the first premise about your bill,  the geographical premise of this Radio  Marti is incorrect.  The State Department does not un derstand the difference between the  Caribbean and Central America and  that is the reason why the CBI is in  trouble.  That was the first mistake that they  made.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, let me say  the reason why I have not spoken out  against this, as some of my other col leagues have, is because of my great  respect for the manager of the bill. I  do not think there is a Member of this  House who is as concerned about the  future of the Caribbean as my friend  who is managing the bill, ",1982

266,Senate,97,-0.314,594,14,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, that is  what I have been doing for some time,  examining my conscience. This is the  first  time  I  have  spoken  on  this  matter-not that that is of any great  import  to anybody except  to me.  I  have voted on all of the amendments  so,  to that extent, I have spoken to  them.  I have been seeking a rationale that  would allow me to vote for what is ob viously a politically very popular thing  to do, to balance the budget. It is phil osophically compatible with the way I  think,  that we  should  have  some  means of keeping a lid on what we do,  because obviously, we are unable  to  discipline ourselves by ourselves thus  far. We are all looking for mechanical  devices to force us to do what is very  difficult  to do;  that  is,  tell  interest  groups no, whether they be defense or  social  programs  or whatever  they  happen to be.  So,  for  those  two  reasons,  it  is a  very, very  tempting thing to go out  and support this. I said to my constitu ents at home that I would support the  amendment  if,  in  fact,  there were  some way, other than a declaration of  war, to be able to work with the super majority  requirement. But we keep  coming back to the point-at least, I  keep coming back to the point-that  the Senator from Colorado so accu rately raised. I quote him:  There is no definite point of reference.  He hit the nail right on the head.  There  is none.  I do not know how,  short of some mechanism  like  this  one, and it is not very perfect; there is  no point of reference.  ",1982

268,,97,-0.559,698,14,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, the wars  of Central America continue. The vio lence there is unabated, and what is  even more alarming is that the various  conflicts are becoming regionalized.  Honduran and Salvadoran troops are  fighting together against the guerril las in El Salvador. Nicaragua, because  of its increased sense of isolation,  is  August 3, 1982  talking about buying Soviet or more  French warplanes to compete with the  growing Honduran Air Force. Guate mala is still seeking U.S. financial as sistance, and it desperately wants to  purchase spare parts for their helicop ters from the United States.  This  increased  militarization  is  taking place at the expense of escalat ing human rights violations and severe  economic  crisises  among  Central  American nations. None of these na tions are economically or politically  solvent. They are all suffering from  the tremors of dissent and worldwide  recession. They can ill afford to pay  the price of an expanding Inilitary. Le gitimate dialog would seem to be the  most reasonable course of action for  achieving stability.  Yet, the only dialog that seems to be  taking place is one sided, aimed at fur ther alienating Nicaragua and antago nizing even the most reasonable left of  center groups. It is, of course, legiti mate and proper for the United States  to support friendly governments. We  must safeguard our interests. I do not  believe, however, that this should be  done at the expense of regionalizing  the conflict in Central America, or fur ther polarizing  the various political  factions there.  We are going to have to live with the  nations of Central America for the in definite future. That is why we must  make a  realistic assessment of their  problems,  and  try  to  promote  an  honest dialog among warring political  groups that will eventually lead to sta bility. This is the only way we will be  able  to achieve  reasonable, strategic  security with our Central American  neighbors.  A recent press release from the dis tinguished Council on Heinispheric Af fairs <COHA> discusses a newly formed  Central American political organiza tion, the Central American Democrat ic Committee <CDC). The COHA re lease points out the underlying signifi cance of the CDC, and what it may  represent to both United States and  Central American policy  interests.  I  submit the press release for exainina tion by my colleagues.  [Press Release]  On January 19 of this year the foreign  ministers of Honduras, El Salvador and  Costa Rica met in San Jose to proclaim the  creation of the Central American Democrat  ic Community <CDC), ""to promote democra cy, obtain backing to resolve economic di.ffi culties, and  to utilize  the  inter-American  system as a  defense against aggression.""

269,Senate,97,0.271,737,14,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, over  the past several months I have devot ed a great deal of attention to Senate  Joint Resolution  58,  the  balanced  budget-tax  limitation  amendment.  Achieving a balanced budget has been  my major goal since I took my seat in  the Senate. Last February, I proposed  a plan to the Senate Budget Commit tee  that would have allowed us  to  work out our fiscal problems and to  achieve a balanced budget by 1985. My  budget proposal was introduced as an  alternative to the unacceptable budget  sent to Congress by the President.  The  President's  budget  was  unacceptable and not a single Member  of Congress supported it for a number  of reasons, the first of which was the  fact  that the Federal budget would  remain unbalanced for the foreseeable  future and that the projected deficits  were  substantially  too  large.  The  President's budget included a substan tial increase in the rate of defense ex penditures, did not face up to the un controlled  growth  of  entitlement  spending, and recommended addition al cuts in discretionary spending pro grams which had been cut substantial ly the previous year. It was thus both  ineffective and unfair.  Given  the political realities of the  time, the Budget Committee and the  Senate adopted a plan which, while  vastly superior to the President's in  that  it made  substantial  progress  toward  the reduction of future defi cits, still will not achieve a balanced  budget in the foreseeable future. I be lieve that had we faced up to the real  challenge  last spring and adopted a  fiscal policy similar to the one I pro posed, which included meaningful en titlement  reform,  economic  recovery  would not now be so seriously threat ened by high interest rates.  This  recent  experience with  the  budget process led me to give close and  serious scrutiny to the proposed con stitutional amendment to balance the  budget. Senate Joint Resolution 58 is  designed to deal with a perceived bias  within  the  Federal  Government  toward  increased  levels  of Federal  spending. It is evident to me, and to  almost  everyone,  that a  substantial  bias does exist in favor of even more  Government  spending. The  persist ence of Federal deficits over the last  four decades, during economic good  times and bad, is ample testimony to  this fact. The existence of this bias  may be accounted for by the fact that  the benefits of each spending program  are concentrated among a relative few  persons, while the costs are dispersed  among all taxpayers. The beneficiaries  have every incentive to lobby to con tinue and to expand  their programs  while  the  individual  taxpayer  has  much less incentive to resist those ef forts. Given these incentives, the spe cial interest groups win and the tax payer loses.  The proposed constitutional amend ment to balance the budget, as report ed,  is  unfortunately  so  seriously  flawed  as  not  to  redress  the bias  toward  every-increasing Government  expenditures. Moreover  this amend ment is misnamed, for there is nothing  in the amendment reported by the Ju diciary Committee that would insure  an annually balanced budget. All that  is required is that the Congress adopt  a  statement of outlays and  receipts  that is in balance. That is all that is  required unless a  three-fifths vote of  the entire membership of both Houses  can be mustered to pass an unbalanced  statement-not  an  unbalanced  budget-but an unbalanced statement,  which is not at all the same thing, as  the debate on  the amendment has  made abundantly clear.  Suppose, after adopting a statement  that is in balance, receipts fall below  the level projected so that an unbal anced budget is in prospect. What will  happen then? According to the amend ment  the Congress may amend  its  original  statement-the  operative  word is may since Congress is not re quired  to do so. Congress  is,  in my  opinion, unlikely to amend its original  statement  and  likely  to  allow  the  actual budget  to  remain  in deficit.  Such a deficit will be constitutional.  Senate  Joint Resolution  58  simply  does not require a balanced budget but  only a balanced statement; it is simply  not enforceable as drafted by the Judi ciary Committee.  89-059 0-86-24 (pt. 14)  ",1982
270,Senate,97,0.498,776,14,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President, we are  currently  in  the midst of debate on  the constitutional amendment to bal ance the budget. Our current budget  process, while it has helped to inform  the Congress on spending and fiscal  matters, has become  extremely un wieldy and time consuming. If we are  to carry out the purposes of the bal anced-budget amendment, the budget  process will need to be reformed in a  number of ways.  Today, the budget process is so time  consuming that it barely leaves time  for  normal  legislative  activity. The  current  cycle, which  calls  for  two  budget resolutions every year, results  great  uncertainty which makes  long-range planning difficult for indi viduals  and groups participating  in  in  Federal programs. We clearly need to  move to a longer budget cycle.  The July 16, 1982,  issue of Science  carried an article by Willis H. Shaply  that explains the importance of long term planning  in budgetary matters  for major R. & D. projects in the sci ences. I ask that this article be printed  in the RECORD.  The article follows:  R & D IN THE FISCAL 1983 BUDGET  The President's budget for fiscal year 1983  treated R & D fairly well, given the econom ic exigencies and the policy orientations of  the Reagan Administration.  Within these  policies, some fine-tuning of  the amounts  for R & D deserves serious consideration;  some of this may be done by Congress as it  acts on the details of the budget. What will  be the outcome in Congress? The spending  targets in the budget resolution leave open  the possibility that the R & D budgets final ly approved by Congress could approximate  closely the recommendations in the Presi dent's budget.  For budget function 250, the only catego ry that consists entirely of R & D (National  Science Foundation, Department of Energy  general research, and NASA), the resolution  provides exactly the same amounts as in the  President's  budget.  This  is  preferential  treatment. The general congressional guide line of freezing 1983 budgets for discretion ary spending at the fiscal 1982 budget levels  would have meant a cut of about 10 percent.  Totals for most of the other functions also  seem adequate to include the amounts budg eted for R & D, except for national defense  R & D, where the 3.6 percent reduction in  total budget authority could mean a cut of  as much as $1 billion in the $4.4 billion in crease recommended in the budget.  The final outcomes, however, will depend  on how R & D is treated by Congress in the  detailed authorization and appropriations  bills, and whether the appropriations bills  as passed are acceptable to the President.  Detailed congressional action could produce  R & D budgets that are revised, perhaps im proved, versions of the President's budget.  But a presidential veto and another stand off between  the President and Congress  would probably result again this year in per centage across-the-board reductions applied  indiscriminately to R & D along with pro grams.  The longer term outlook for R & D is, at  best, bleak. Even under optimistic economic  assumptions,  total  funding  available  for  nondefense R & D faces a reduction in con stant dollars of as much as 30 percent over  the 5-year period FY 1983  to FY 1987,  unless continued high deficits, substantial  increases in taxes, a major cutback in de fense, or some combination of  these be comes acceptable economically and political ly. The establishment of plans and priorities  for federal support of R & D within a total  level of resources that is declining in real  terms is the single greatest challenge facing  the scientific and  technical  leadership  in  the government and the scientific and tech nical community as a whole.  There are plemy of other challenges. I  will mention only three:  (1) There is the challenge to all of us to  see that something, besides talking, is done  about the problems of science and engineer ing education at all levels. Our decentralized  education system needs leadership. Will the  federal government provide it? If not, who  will?  <2> There is the challenge to industry to  show that the U.S. private sector, in the fa vorable regulation and tax environment of  the Reagan Administration, can match com petition from other nations  in developing  and marketing new and improved products  based on advances in science and technolo gy.  <3> There is an urgent challenge to Con gress and the Executive Branch to find ways  to temper the operation of the budget proc ess.  I  counted 160  distinct  steps  in  the  budget process as it now ""works."" At a mini mum, we must insulate from controversies  on overall budget policy the core of largely  noncontroversial  functions of government  for which the range of likely budget adjust ments does not have an appreciable impact  on the size of the deficit, the level of reve nues, or  the  state of  the economy. We  should be able to conduct important activi ties like R & D within the framework of ap proved long-range plans and clearly defined  envelopes, without  the  continual disrup tions and uncertainties  that characterize  the present budget process.e  ",1982
271,Senate,97,0.185,776,14,Mrs. HAWKINS.," Mr. President,  I  rise in support of Senate Joint Resolu tion 58, a proposal that will  impose  sorely needed fiscal restraints on the  Federal Government.  The Federal Government is not only  in a state of gross imbalance, it is in a  state of self-contradiction. Presently,  the Government's budget objectives  contradict what actually happens at  the end of the budget process. Stable  prices, low interest rates, low deficits,  low taxes, and low spending are Con gress' budget objectives. Yet,  some how,  these objectives elude us year  after year. We might say that the idea  of budget restraint contradicts the re ality of budgetary  excess. Rhetoric  and results are in conflict. We are not  the only ones who  say  it,  though.  Eighty percent of the people in this  country say it. Thirty-one States say it  by calling for a constitutional amend ment  to  balance  the  budget. The  President says  it. A national debt of  over $1  trillion says it all. Taxes and  spending are at peacetime records of  GNP that says it and I am up here  saying it again. We need a way to end  this contradiction.  Only a constitutional amendment as  proposed by Senate Joint Resolution  58 will eliminate this conflict. History  has proved that statutes are not tough  enough. As Senator GRASSLEY pointed  out recently, Public Law 95-435 man dated a balanced budget for fiscal year  1981. Yet, when the books were closed  for fiscal year 1981, the deficit stood  at $58 billion. The lesson the Senate  must learn is simple. Only a constitu tional amendment can guarantee long term fiscal prudence. Only a constitu tional amendment can end the coun try's dilemma.  Mr.  President,  there  are  three  schools of fiscal restraint in this coun try. They seek  to close  the gap be tween words and deeds. The first  is  the balanced-budget school. It fears  the effects of deficits on inflation and  ",1982
272,House,97,0.345,867,14,Mrs. MARTIN of Illinois.," Mr. Speak er  there is no doubt that the hard ships of unemployment continue to .be  a pressing problem. These hardships  are becoming even more difficult be cause a number of States have fallen  below the minimum level upon which  a State may offer an additional 13  weeks of extended unemployment ben efits.  Ironically,  Congress  is  currently  planning to add a second round of 13week supplemental benefits for a total  of 52 weeks-which will, in all likeli hood  never  reach  the majority of  thos~ who need  them because  their  State no longer qualifies for the ex tended benefits program upon which  the Federal supplemental benefits will  be offered.  Yesterday, I, along with Mr. FINDLEY  of Illinois, introduced a bill that would  make sure that States with continued  increasing joblessness will continue to  receive extended unemployment bene fits.  I urge my colleagues to show their  unified support for  this proposal so  that the conferees on the tax package  receive  the clear message  that it is  more appropriate to put back fairness  and equity  in the extended benefits  program than to offer 13 more weeks  of supplemental unemployment bene fits of which only a fragment of the  unemployed will be able to receive.

Well,  rejoice,  all  who are within hearing of my voice,  because the failures that they are re citing all came from a recession which  did not begin last August; it began last  July 1981, 1 month before the Presi dent's economic recovery program was  passed and 3 months before the first  dinky little tax cut of 5 percent took  effect in October 1981.  So  the  recession which began 13  months ago has caused the doom and  gloom that has been described and ev eryone knows that that recession was  the result of decades of misadventure  by a big spending Congress which has  been controlled for a quarter of a cen tury by those who are protesting here  today.  The President's program has in fact  begun  to work. When he came  into  office the prime interest rate was 21.5  percent. Now, it is 15 percent. When  he came into office the inflation rate  was 13 percent per annum. Now, it is  down to 6 percent per annum. He has  cut taxes across the board by 25 per cent, increasing real incomes, putting  money in the pockets of the peo~le.  What do the Democrats say in  the  context of all this? ""Let's go back to  the policies of President Carter. Let's  get our economy moving. Let's raise  taxes and keep on spending and regu lating with big, central government.""

It  places a strong emphasis on youth and  displaced-worker  training, creates an  active role for the States, encourages  local  and  regional  cooperation  be tween different programs, and places a  strong emphasis on education.  .  Job  training  does work,  both m  terms of  increasing  income and em ployment potential. Ther~ is a definite  need to bring the chromcally unem ployed into the economy, but private  industry will not train those .who 13:ck  basic skills. Publicly funded JOb tram ing is necessary to give individuals the  skills and experience they require to  become productive members of our society.  .  This legislation will also serve an rm portant social purpose by giving the  unemployed  an opportunity  to  advance.  .  Not only will this legislation atd low income jobless individuals, it will also  assist unemployed youths and laid-off  skilled workers who need new skills.  The Job Training Partnership Act will  provide high quality  training which  will lead to permanent jobs for partici pants, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  .  ",1982

277,House,97,-0.651,893,14,Mr. CROCKETT.," Madam Chairman,  I  rise in support of House bill, H.R.  5320.  I wish  to identify myself with  the very pertinent comments made by  my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Michigan  (Mr. BoNIOR). Perhaps no  other part of the country is more in  need of this kind of legislation than  the State of Michigan, where current  unemployment is in the vicinity of 15  percent, notwithstanding a  national  average of 9¥2 percent.  In my own 13th Congressional Dis trict in the city of Detroit unemploy ment today hovers in the vicinity of 23  percent,  approximately  one  out of  every four workers in my district  is  seeking employment.  Just  the other  evening my  good  friend  and  colleague, Doug Fraser,  president of the International UAW CIO, called attention to the fact that  employment in the automobile indus try in all likelihood will never again be  what it was in 1978.  That means, Madam Chairman, that  there is a great need for Federal assist ance to retrain the thouands of unem ployed  automobile workers  so  that  they can be available to assist and to  work  in the new  industries  that we  hope to attract to our State of Michi gan.  I urge all of my colleagues to sup port the passage of H.R. 5320.  ",1982

The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mrs. CoLLINS of Il linois: Page 58,  line 15,  insert ""(1)"" after  ""(b)'' and on page 59, after line 20,  insert  the following new paragraphs:  <2> In determining whether to impose any  sanction authorized by this section against a  prime sponsor for violations by a subgrantee  of such prime sponsor of this Act or the reg ulations under this Act, the Secretary shall  first determine whether such prime sponsor  has adequately demonstrated that it has<A> established and adhered to an appro priate system for the award and mortitoring  of contracts with subgrantees which con tains acceptable standards for ensuring ac countability;  <B> entered into a written contract with  such  subgrantee which  established  clear  goals and obligations in unambiguous terms;  <C> acted with due diligence  to monitor  the implementation of the subgrantee con tract, including the carrying out of appro priate  monitoring  activities  <including  audits> at reasonable intervals; and  <D> taken prompt and appropriate correc tive action upon becoming aware of any evi dence of a violation of this Act or the regu lations under this Act by such subgrantee.  <3>  If the Secretary determines that the  prime sponsor has demonstrated substantial  compliance with the requirements of para graph <2>. the Secretary may waive the im position of sanctions authorized by this sec tion upon such prime sponsor. The Secre tary is authorized to impose any sanction  consistent with the provisions of this Act  and any applicable Federal or State law di rectly against any subgrantee for violation  of this act or the regulations under this act.  Page 62, line 19, strike out ""Nothing"" and  insert in lieu thereof ""Except as provided in  subsection <b><l> and (2), nothing"".  Mrs. COLLINS of  Illinois <during  the reading). Madam Chairman, I ask  unanimous consent that the amend ment be considered as read and print ed in the RECORD.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to  the  request of  the gentlewoman  from Illinois?  There was no objection.  Mrs. COLLINS OF  ILLINOIS. Madam  Chairman, I am offering this amend ment which clarifies  the  liability of  prime sponsors and subcontractors.  In a nutshell, this amendment states  that if a prime sponsor has acted with  due diligence in administrating its job  training program and if violations of  the law or regulations are committed  by a subcontractor, then the Secretary  of Labor has  the discretion not  to  apply  sanctions  against  the  prime  sponsor.  The amendment spells out what due  diligence is and places the burden of  showing due diligence on  the prime  sponsor. It also makes it clear that the  Secretary of Labor could proceed with  legal  action  and  sanctions  directly  against the subcontractor.  The amendment does not displace  the general rule that prime sponsors  are liable for violations of the law and  regulations, but rather, it does provide  an exception to that rule.  The  exception  requires  that  the  prime sponsor must prove that: First,  it has adequate systems  in place  to  award contracts to the best qualified  subcontractor; second,  that it has a  system for monitoring subcontractor  performance;  third,  that  contracts  have  clear  goals  and  obligations,  stated in unambiguous terms; fourth,  that it has monitored the subcontrac tor's actions  through  timely audits  and other appropriate methods; and  fifth, that it has taken prompt action  when possible violations are indicated.  If these are demonstrated by  the  prime sponsors, the Secretary of Labor  may choose not to impose sanctions  against  the  prime  sponsor.  This  amendment is intended to deal with  the inquity of holding a prime sponsor  strictly liable when it has done every thing that could reasonably be expect ed of a recipient of Government funds.  The inequity poses another danger  to the efficient administration of job  training programs. If the over 50,000  subcontractors are  to be monitored  and  evaluated,  prime  sponsors will  have to do it. The Federal Department  of Labor cannot possibly be an effec tive monitor over such a large and de centralized system. Under the present  law, a prime sponsor may not be so  thorough in monitoring and auditing  subcontractors once it realizes that if  misspent  funds  are  discovered,  the  prime might have to pay for them.  Let me also state that the Secretary  of Labor should make use of this ex ception when circumstances warrant  and not wait until the transition year  shall have been completed.  Finally, this amendment is based on  several years of work and numerous  hearings  by  the Subcommittee  on  Manpower and Housing which I chair.  The Government Operations Commit tee has  issued  two  reports on  the  CETA program. I wish to have pages  19 and 20 of House Report No. 96-1426  which deals with the liability issue, in serted into the RECORD at this point,  and I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment:  HIGH-LEvEL EMPHASIS ON ACCOUNTABILITY  NEEDED IN CET A  (C) LIABILITY FOR DISALLOWED COSTS OF  SUBGRANTEES  Accountability is at the root of one of the  current controversial  issues  in  the CET A  system, an issue that the Committee noted  in its first report. At that time, we made no  recommendations because the investigative  staff was advised that the issue was under  study and a  resolution could be expected.  Since  then,  however,  there has been  a  flawed resolution. Controversy stems from  the Department's regulations that hold the  prime sponsors strictly liable for disallowed  costs incurred by their subgrantees. Prime  sponsors are under pressure to use commu nity-based organ!zations. Many of these or ganizations,  of  course,  are  commendable  service deliverers and well-managed finan cially and programmatically. However, when  a non-profit subgrantee  is responsible for  expending funds in violation of laws or reg ulations, the Department establishes a debt  against the prime sponsor. The prime spon sors argue it is  inequitable  to hold them  liable for the Inisspent funds of a subgran tee when the primes have exercised due dili gence in selecting and monitoring the sub grantee. Although the subgrantee is liable  to  the prime sponsor  for  the disallowed  costs, this is of small comfort to the prime  sponsor if the subgrantee has no money.  The inequity in this situation poses an other danger to efficient adininistration of  CET A programs. If the sub grantees are to  be monitored and evaluated, prime sponsors  have  to do  it. They are already held ac countable for seeing that subgrantees are  audited. The thoroughness of prime sponsor  monitoring and the auditing of the subgran tees may be jeopardized by the realization  that if this monitoring turns up disallowed  costs,  the prime sponsor will have to pay  them.  The general  rule of holding  the prime  sponsors to account for the actions of sub grantees  that  they select  is a good one.  However,  the potential  inequity described  above must be  faced. Perhaps a  solution  would be for the Department to move di rectly against  the subgrantee  responsible  for the misspent funds. The law provides  that when a recipient, including a subgrant ee, fails to comply with the CETA law or  regulations, the Secretary may order appro priate sanctions or other corrective action.  If the Secretary orders termination or sus pension of funds, for example, he can act di rectly against a subgrantee to enforce an  order.32 While the Secretary can hold the  prime sponsor accountable for subgrantee  malfeasance, and should where the prime  sponsor is at fault, we do not believe the law  can be construed as saying he must do so in  all cases. Instead, we believe the grant of au thority perinits the Secretary to act to re cover disallowed costs from subgrantees.  Unfortunately,  in  many  cases  the  subgrantee may be unable to pay back the  funds. In these cases, the procedures for ter minating claims will have to be used. The  challenge will be to devise criteria for decid ing when prime sponsors should not be held  strictly  liable  for  the disallowed costs of  their subgrantees.  The Committee recommends that Labor's  criteria demand, first of all, that the prime  sponsor show that it acted with due dili gence. The contract with any subgrantee  should be well written and have clear goals.  Monitoring should occur as often as practi cal,  and when such monitoring discloses  problems, every effort should be made to  minimize the damage. An audit should be  started shortly after the program year and  handled expeditiously when received by the  prime sponsor. If a prime sponsor shows it  acted with due diligence and with proper  regard for stewardship of tax dollars, the  Committee believes that the Labor Depart ment should exercise its option to deal di rectly with the subgrantee.  32 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act,  Section 106(d) <1> and <2>.

284,Senate,97,0.346,1140,14,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President,  today I am introducing legislation to  encourage the development of hydro electric resources at existing Bureau  of Reclamation projects  in  the  17  Western States.  In 1977, the Department of the Inte rior's Bureau of Reclamation  pub lished  a  report  entitled  ""Western  Energy Expansion Study."" The report,  as part of the Bureau's general investi gations program examined the poten tial for the development of hydroelec tric power, including pumped storage,  at both new sites and existing bureau  projects. A total of 127 proposals for  development  of  hydroelectric  re sources were examined of which 61  proposals were recommended for fur ther study at that time. Since then,  studies have been conducted, but with out real  results. The potential  that  was identified, even at existing dams,  has never been built.  Has our Nation forgotten so quickly  our  need  to  develop  domestic  re sources? Have we forgotten the strate gic value that is concommitant with  the development of an energy resource  whose fuel is free and would never be  subject to foreign embargo?  During this Congress, my Subcom mittee on Water and Power has taken  extensive testimony regarding the de velopment of our Nation's hydroelec tric  resources.  Legislative  hearings  before the subcommittee have concen trated on the opportunity to develop  new power producing facilities at ex isting Bureau  projects.  In  turn,  a  series of oversight hearings held joint ly with Senator HUMPHREY's Subcom mittee on Energy Regulation exam ined the difficulties surrounding the  licensing  process  for  non-Federal  projects and the associated problem of  raising capitol for such development.  The bill that I am introducing today  is directed toward the problems of de veloping Bureau of Reclamation hydro  resources. During  the course of  the  hearings, two distinct opportunities to  encourage such development present ed themselves; first, a need to allow  non-Federal power development at ex isting Bureau dams where found ap propriate and second a new source and  method of funding Bureau construc tion of power facilities.  This bill addresses both opportuni ties and would authorize the Secretary  of the Interior to contract with non Federal entities for the development  of hydropower  resources and would  also establish a  ""reclamation hydro power fund"" to be used by the Secre tary of  the  Interior as a  source of  funding for Bureau hydropower con struction activities.  I believe the time has come for the  Congress and the Nation to face up to  the fact that we are in a  transition  period  in  the  development  of our  water resources and in particular hy dropower. We cannot, in the face of  $100 billion deficits,  try to continue  business as usual and trust in the Fed eral Government's coming  through  with appropriated funds. This bill de creases the dependence upon Federal  funding and at the same time expands  the opportunity for non-Federal par ticipation.  I want to see our Nation's hydropow er developed. I am an enthusiastic sup porter of this clean, renewable, energy  source. But it must be developed re sponsibly. As introduced, this bill re tains the protection that is needed for  the water users on Bureau projects re gardless of whether there is Federal or  non-Federal development. It is para mount that these rights be honored.  We must keep in mind that hydropow er is a national resource. We cannot and should not-walk away from the  60 years of history, guidelines, proce dures, and law, which have been craft ed to address the issues surrounding  the development of our hydroelectric  resources. But what we can and should  do  is  reexamine  this history  in  a  modern context.  This bill provides the focus and talk ing point for such an examination. I  earnestly solicit the views and opin ions of the water and power resources  community and the administration. I  look forward to support as well as crit icism.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be includ ed in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be printed  REcoRD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  S.2814  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled, That this  Act shall be known as the Reclamation HY  droelectric Development Act of 1982.  TITLE I  SEc. 101. Notwithstanding any other pro vision of law, the Secretary of the Interior,  acting pursuant to the Federal reclamation  laws <Acts of June 17, 1902, Stat. 388 and  Acts amendatory thereof and supplemental  thereto, except as provided for in Sec. 102 of  this Act>,  is authorized  to contract with  non-federal entities for the development, in  eluding but not  limited  to development  costs,  financing, construction, and owner  ship of hydroelectric powerplants and ap purtenant facilities at locations and in the  approximate capacities as determined by  the Secretary of the Interior as being justi  fied for the public purpose of providing ad ditional hydroelectric power to the appro  priate Federal Power Marketing Adminis trations.  SEc. 102. Where the Secretary of the Inte rior determines that existing Reclamation  project  facilities may be  advantageously  used by the appropriate Federal Power Mar keting Administrations for the public pur pose of providing hydroelectric energy  to  preference customers,  then no  licenses or  permits shall be issued under the Federal  Power Act <Acts of June 10, 1920, 41 Stat.  1063 and Acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto>, nor shall any applica tions for such licenses or permits be accept ed for filing. The non-federal entity desig nated by the Secretary of the Interior shall  not be subject to the permitting and licens ing requirements of the Federal Power Act.  All contracts entered into by the Secretary  of the Interior and the non-federal entities  intending to develop the designated hydro electric projects shall be granted on a com petitive negotiations basis and no prefer ence  in the development process shall be  given to preference customers <as defined  under the various reclamation acts).  SEc. 103. The Secretary of the Interior is  hereby authorized to contract with non-fed eral entities for the development of the des ignated hydroelectric projects in the follow ing manner:  <a>  The  designated  hydroelectric  and  transmission sites, improvements, and fall ing water privileges shall be ground leased  to the non-federal entities for a term not to  exceed  forty <40)  years  for a negotiated  sum;  (b) The non-federal development entity  shall assume all risk inherent in the devel opment process  including, but not limited  to,  the financing and construction of the  project facilities and shall retain title to all  project  improvements  for a  term not  to  exceed  forty  (40)  years, whereupon  title  shall be transferred to the Secretary of the  Interior, based upon a negotiated predeter mined royalty formula paid annually to the  non-federal developing entity for the hydro electric energy subsequently produced at  the facilities;  <c> Hydroelectric energy generated by fa cilities developed pursuant to the Title shall  be delivered to the Secretary of Energy for  distribution and marketing by the several  existing Federal Power Marketing Adminis trations as provided by existing  law and  policy and consistent with the provisions of  this Act. Hydroelectric energy so delivered  shall be purchased by  the Secretary of  Energy for a  term of not to exceed forty  <40) years at rates and conditions estab lished through negotlll,tion between the Sec retary of Energy and the non-federal devel oping entity, and such rates will be suffi cient to amortize all costs of development,  return on  investment, operation, mainte nance, and replacement.  SEc. 104. The Secretary of the Interior  shall  review  and  approve  construction  design plans and specifications. The Secre tary of the Interior is hereby authorized to  grant to the non-federal entities the right of  access to the designated sites for the pur pose of necessary pre-construction activities.  SEc. 105. The Secretary of the Interior or  his assigns shall be responsible for the oper ation and maintenance of the powerplant  and appurtenant facilities under an annual ly adjusted allowance budget established by  the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of  Energy and  the non-federal development  entity pursuant to Sec. 103(c) of this Act.  SEc. 106. The Secretary of Energy is au thorized to purchase replacement capacity,  energy, or both in order to maintain deliv eries  to  customers  during  unit  outages  which result from non-federal construction  of the powerplant and transmission facili ties constructed pursuant to this Title, and  such cost will be added to the cost of the  project and amortized over the life of the  power purchase contract.

But the point I would  make to my colleagues here is that it  can be made actuarially sound  in a  number of ways.  Maybe FHA up-front insurance pro gram  just works,  then  there  is no  problem. However, one way to make it  actuar'.ally  sound  is  to  raise  the  income limits that people have to have  in order to qualify for an FHA loan,  because that would make it actuarially  sound.

288,House,97,-0.37,1231,14,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. Chairman, the  issue which the nuclear freeze resolu tion addresses is the most fundamen tal matter facing humankind today survival. This resolution springs from  the knowledge  that all  life on  this  planet is  in imminent jeopardy from  the continuous escalation in the arms  race. The resolution is committed to  the most basic of values-the desire to  keep life going on this planet.  The nuclear freeze issue is a middle  America  issue which came  to public  prominence from the realization by an  increasing number of people that nu clear war must be prevented. Those  who support  the  idea of a nuclear  freeze  understand  that  we  need  schools, not bomb shelters; highways  built  and  harbors  dredged,  not  unworkable evacuation plans.  Nuclear war  is nothing short of a  grim, goulish, and gruesome business  which would devastate life as we know  it. Efforts by the administration and  its defense planners to convince the  public that nuclear war is survivable,  even manageable, is little more than a  deception of the American public. The  idea that we must continue in escalat ing the arms race by deploying and de veloping ever more nuclear weapons to  close the so-called window of vulner ability is folly.  We now have both a foreign policy  and budget  that beats ploughshares  into spears. How disgraceful.  I urge my colleagues to support this  vital legislation and cast their vote in  favor of the continuation of life on  this planet.  ",1982
289,House,97,-0.024,1231,14,Mrs. BYRON.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the Broomfield substi tute.  The urgency of  the arms control  must not prevent our careful construc tion of  verifiable  force  levels  that  retain our capability to deter potential  aggressors. Reducing  the number of  weapons on both sides will reduce the  risk of nuclear warfare. The Broom field substitute will get us to accepta ble, verifiable,  flexible,  and  reduced  force levels.  Our commitment should be to the  success of significant reductions before  negotiating for a freeze on arms at ex isting and higher levels. Yet we must  have the flexibility to modernize our  forces, to redress technology gains by  the Soviets so that we can provide a  capable and lasting deterrent.  No arms control agreement can, by  itself, prevent or deter  the develop ment of new systems. We cannot put  technology back on  the  shelf, but  arms control agreements can reduce  the levels of nuclear forces.  We can provide for our national se curity within this negotiation of the  reduction of levels.  Mr. Chairman, I have spent a great  deal of time on this issue. I have met  in Geneva with General Rowny, head  of our START talks negotiating team.  I have met with Mr. Nitze, the head of  the INF negotiating team.  I am convinced we must give them  the flexibility available to meet their  challenge.  We have the new weapons systems  such as the B-1 and the MX going into  our  inventory.  I have a  son who  is  flying a B-25. That B-25 was built in  1957. My son was built in 1955.  We must  look  to action  that pro motes the long-range national security  of the United States.  We do not want to freeze nuclear  weapons; we want to reduce them. But  we want fair and equitable reductions  that lead to greater stability. Support ing the Broomfield substitute gives us  that flexibility.  ",1982
290,House,97,-0.553,1231,14,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of the Zablocki nuclear  freeze resolution.  Mr. Chairman, the principal conse quences of our failure to pass the nu clear freeze  resolution may well be  that there will be no history to record  our  failure,  that  there will  be no  future generations to lay blame upon  us.  Those of us who support the nuclear  arms freeze should be under no illu sion that adoption of today's resolu tion is the end of a struggle. It will be  the beginning of an effort  to give  meaning to the words of our resolu tion,  to make sure  that the United  States takes the actions necessary to  carry out the spirit of the resolution  before the House today.  We must not fail to pass this resolu tion today. Anything less than a victo ry for House Joint Resolution 521 will  break faith with the millions of Ameri cans who, without regard to partisan  political  persuasion,  are  demanding  forceful  action by  this House. The  people want us to take the first step  toward ending the threat of an instant  nuclear holocaust. Since 1945,  arms  control and nuclear armaments have  been the virtually exclusive domain of  specialists.  Suddenly,  however,  not  only are the experts talking about nu clear warfare, the issue has been the  subject  of  public  demonstrations  throughout Western  Europe,  town  meetings in New England, dinner table  discussions  in  private  homes  and,  thanks to Ground Zero Week, commu nity forums in cities throughout the  State of Minnesota and across  the  entire United States.  The transformation of this issue into  one of popular citizen debate is one of  the most refreshing developments in  public policy discussion in more than  two decades.  It is a new and healthy challenge to  political  leaders  and  to  executive  branch  ""experts,""  forcing  them  to  defend or, better yet, to rethink long held views on nuclear weapons devel opment.  What I find refreshing about the nu clear freeze movement  is  that it re flects the refusal of the average citi zen, American or European, to accept  the proposition that nuclear war is as  inevitable as death. Citizens are saying  to their governments that something  can and should be done and that they  want action now.  Until recently, for most of us, nucle ar war was unthinkable-so we left the  thinking  about  it  to  the  experts.  People are now saying that no longer  will they leave the setting of nuclear  policy to professionals. Since nuclear  war involves everyone's life, it is also  everyone's business.  The people who joined in the nucle ar freeze movement have come to the  realization that the fate of mankind is  in their hands, not exclusively in the  hands of experts, and that something  can be done to prevent the unthink able-nuclear war.  The bomb dropped on Hiroshima  leveled  the city and killed half  its  people. That bomb was called Little  Boy; its explosive yield was 12% kilo tons. Today,  there are  some 50,000  warheads in the world's nuclear arse nal, among which the Hiroshima bomb  would be classified as merely a tactical  weapon. That nuclear arsenal totals 1  million times the destructive capacity  of Little Boy or 4  tons of TNT for  every man, woman, and child in the  world. That  fact  alone  should  be  enough to stir profound and thought ful consideration in public debate on  nuclear arms limitation.  It is the great strength of our politi cal system that our people can express  their views on this issue, that they can  provide the leadership, the direction,  the  incentive for  the nuclear freeze  movement. Our democratic, dynamic  political  system gives  this Congress  the freedom  to  take  the first step,  which,  frankly,  the Soviet Govern ment-closed, secretive, isolated, dicta torial-cannot take.  This 97th Congress will not vote on  any foreign policy issue which makes  as much commonsense as House Joint  Resolution 521. I am proud to have co sponsored House Joint Resolution 521,  ",1982
291,House,97,0.21,1283,14,Mr. ERDAHL.," Mr. Chairman,  the  use, deployment and awesome poten tial of nuclear weapons is the most se rious threat to civilization  today. In  the past year Americans  have  ex pressed a genuine concern for  their  government  to  reduce  the  risk  of  atomic destruction. This sentiment is  strongly felt in my home State of Min nesota.  Eliminating the specter of nuclear  war  is not a partisan  issue. That is  why I am an original cosponsor and  supporter of House Joint Resolution  521, calling for a mutual and verifiable  freeze on and reductions  in nuclear  weapons.  I do not take this position lightly be cause I recognize the sincerity and the  dedication  of  the  gentleman  from  Michigan (Mr. BROOMFIELD),  the gen tleman from New York <Mr. CARNEY),  and  the other gentleman from New  York <Mr. STRATTON), and the others  who have offered an alternative pro posal.  0 1640  There are two resolutions being de bated here  today. Some of our col leagues support one which, they say,  goes beyond a freeze and reduces nu clear arms. The other resolution, ap proved by the Foreign Affairs Com mittee, also does just that. It calls for  a mutual and verifiable  freeze  and  then for arms reductions. If we are  going  to work for effective strategic  arms reductions, at some point in that  process we must call for a complete  halt in the arms buildup. It is kind of  analogous to throwing a ball straight  up in the air. Before it can start down,  it has to stop someplace. This resolu tion is not based on faith or trust; it is  based  on  verifiability. Verifiability  must be adequately assured  to both  parties, and certainly to our own ad ministration, before any  freeze goes  into effect.  Second, House Joint Resolution 521  is  in the mutual best interest of all  parties. We on this planet are perhaps  the only rational beings in all creation.  Yet now we possess the overwhelming  capability to completely exterminate  the human race and all other living  things on Earth. It is possible to pre vent  this destruction  if  the United  States demonstrates its willingness to  take the initiative on arms reductions.  Finally, this resolution need not con flict with current negotiations on arms  control. Rather, the ideas in this legis lation  are wholly  compatible with  START,  and  I  commend President  Reagan for his initiative in that direc tion. This resolution does not in any  way, tie the hands of the administra tion in dealing with the Soviets. It is  merely a sense-of-Congress resolution.  Mr. Chairman,  there are forces  in  the universe  that are even greater  than the force within the atom.  One of them is reason. Let us let  reason prevail today. I urge my col leagues to join with me in affirming  this critical initiative for peace.  We have a duty as elected officials to  encourage every approach which will  diminish  the  possibility  of nuclear  war. It is only  logical  to combine a  freeze with reduction efforts. Other wise, eventual reduction will be post poned in an endless search for imaginary parity. The struggle for nuclear  superiority and fear are the fuels that  have propelled the arms race to the  present brink of disaster.  Mr. Chairman, it was Albert Einstein  who said: ""The unleashed power of  the atom has changed everything save  our thinking, and we thus drift toward  unparalled  catastrophy."" We must  also now change our  thinking. Ein stein also said; ""The fourth world war  will be fought with bows and arrows.""  I support this resolution because it  sends a signal to the whole world that  the American people and their elected  representatives accept the responsibil ity to prevent this drift toward catas trophe.

292,House,97,0.863,1296,14,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Chairman, I am cer tain that no one here today has come  to his or her decisions on the various  nuclear freeze proposals without care ful consideration of the historic sig nificance of our actions. I would like  to  take  this opportunity  to explain  why I am compelled to oppose a nucle ar freeze as outlined in these bills. Al though  the wording of House Joint  Resolution 538 is preferable to that of  House Joint Resolution 521, I feel that  both resolutions are severely flawed  on several accounts.  Let me make it very clear from the  outset that I believe our present stock  of nuclear weapons is more than ade quate for the purposes of our current  defense policies.  I  have consistently  opposed the development or deploy ment of any new nuclear weapons.  ",1982
293,,97,-0.267,1413,14,Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.," Mr.  Speaker. the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe  in North Dakota has faced serious  problems in effectively using its limit ed reservation lands. As a result. the  tribe has lost ground in its reach for  self-determination. At the 1manimous  request of the tribal council. I have in troduced a bill to help the tribe merge  and retain its tribal land  The bill takes the same basic steps  as S. 503. which was reported favor able by the Senate Select Committee  on Indian Affairs.  Two major snags have hindered eco nomic development on the Devils Lake  Sioux Reservation. Since non-Indians  own over  three-fifths of  the  land  within the reservation. this creates a  checkerboard  ownership  effect  and  prevents  the  tribe  from  effectively  managing its limited land In addition.  the tribe  loses more and more land  when it is inherited by a person who is  not a  tribal member. This erodes the  tribal land base.  My bill seeks to solve these problems  and to promote economic development  on the reservation by giving the Secre tary of  the  Interior-as  the  tribe's  trustee-the right to consolidate and  prevent the loss of tribal lands.  The bill includes many safeguards to  protect the rights of the tribe. tribal  members. and non-Indians alike. Any  land sales or exchanges are limited to  reservation land. The tribe must con sent to all transactions. The bill also  protects the rights of both member  and nonmember heirs. Any money  credited to the tribe from sales permit ted in the bill must be held in a special  account for land purchases only.  A final part of the bill clarifies who  has legal jurisdiction on the reserva tion. By declaring  the Devils Lake  Sioux Reservation  the  tribal home land of the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe,  the bill confirms in statute the opera  .  ing views of tribal. State. and Federal  Governments and prevents costly law suits.  In sum. the bill seeks to help the  Devils Lake Sioux Tribe become self sufficient by strengthening  its  land  base. without  infringing upon any one's rights.  I  encourage anyone with concerns  about this bill to contact me or to tes tify here in Congress when hearings  are held Any comments will be care fully reviewed  I might underscore the fact that this  bill does not appropriate any funds for  tribal land purchases. Nor does the bill  affect any land outside the reservation  boundaries. It simply intends to help  the tribe better manage land within  the  historic  reservation  boundaries  and thus improve the chances of tribal  self-sufficiency.e  CENTRAL AMERICA:  IUXX>GNIZ ING OUR NATIONAL INTEREST  liON.

294,,97,-0.45,1413,14,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, one of the  serious issues facing  this country is  the way we defend our national inter ests in Central America. Unfortunate ly, that debate has all too often been  polarized on the basis of people's ster eotypes about Marxism on one band  and U.S. imperiallsm on the other. As  a consequence. it has been very diffi cult tO get people to differentiate be tween the kind of U.S.  involvement  which is just and sensible and prudent  and the kind which is irrational, short sighted, and counterproductive.  Mr. Pastor has written an extremely  thoughtful article on the subject and I  commend it to my colleagues.  £From the Atlantic Monthly. July 19821  OUR REAL .IRTBusTs m Cmrra.&I. AlaBICA  <By R&bert A. Pastor>  [Robert A. Pastor is a faculty research as sociate at the School of Public Affairs at  the University of Maryland. He served as  senior staff member responsible for Latin  American and cartbbean affairs on the Na tional Security Council from 1977 to 1981.  He is the author of Congress and the Poll tics of U.S. Foreign Economic Polley.]  In early February of 1981. as he was draw Ing a line publicly in El Salvador, Secretary  of State Alexander Halg privately sent a  strongly worded message to Omar Torrijos,  the head of the National Guard of Panama  and the power behind the presidency. Halg  let Torrijos know that the flabbiness in U.S  foreign policy had been firmed up; no longer  would the U.S. government tolerate Torri Jos's adventures with the Cubans. The goal  of U.S. foreign policy in the hemisphere was  now the containment of Cuba. replacing the  half-dozen different goals that the Carter  Administration had tried to pursue simulta neously. Torrijos would have to shape up, or  else.  U.S. Ambassador Ambler Moss. Jr . was in .structed to deliver the message to Torrijos  immediately, and Moss helicoptered to the  military barracks at Farallon. He found Tor rijos in a hammock. swinging and mediating,  and savoring his every puff of a Cuban  cigar-a ColuDa, a personnel present from  Fidel castro. Torrijos had not heard from  Ronald Reagan since Reagan's inaugura tion; before that, Reagan had referred to  him as  tinhorn Marxist dictator,"" and  Torrijo& had reserved some choice quips for  Reagan, ""in the spirit of reciprocity,"" he  liked to say.  ...

Moss said, ""I have a message  to you from Secretary of State Haig,"" and  he then read the message.  a  Torrijo& listened with no visible sign of  emotion, exept that he began puffing more  rapidly on his Cohiba. When Moss was fin ished. Torrijo&  lifted himself out of  the  hammock, and asked  if our ambaSS'Pdor  would mind writing down his response. Moss  took out his pad and pencil and Torrijos dic tated:  ""Mr. Haig, I cannot acknowlege receipt of  this message. It was obviously intended for  another destination. It should have gone to  Puerto Rico. <>mar Torrijos. ..  So much for the Big Stick in the 1980s.  Much has cbanged in Central America  since Teddy Roosevelt boasted that he had  taken Panama. One change is that Central  America. like the late Omar Torriios. seems  to be lisf:ening to us less, while we seem to  be lisf:ening to Central America more-more  intensely if not with more comprehension.  Another change has occurred in the nation al interests of the United States: we have  fewer vital interests in the region. but we  seem to care about them more. Last March.  '192 foreign journalists, more than were in  VIetnam during the height of the war. were  in El Salvador to observe an election for a  constituent assembly. The political. econom ic. and military turmoil in Central Amer iea---especiaJJy in El Salvador. Guaremala  and Nicaragua-has been on the front pages  of American newspapers and on the televi sion news shows for months. Why are we so  preoccupied with the crisis? Is all this atten tion justified?  Americans cannot help but ask whether  El Salvador might not be better off if we  were a little less possessive. H we are better  off today by letting the Panamania.m run  the canal, and we are. why wouldn't we be  better off tomorrow if we let El Salvador be  El Salvador? In short, why bother?  Before I attempt to answer these ques tions. I would like to consider briefly the  origins of the Central American crisis.  Two rather simple explanations have been  offered. In his speech at the Organization of  American States <OAS>, on February 24,  President Ronald Reagan attributed  the  crisis to .. imported terrorism."" a  .. new kind  of colonialism"" that .. stalks the world today  and threatens our independence. It is brutal  and totalitarian. It is not of our hemisphere  but it threatens our hemisphere""; it is com munism, and it is exploiting the economic  crisis caused by the increase in the price of  petroleum and the fall in the prices of the  principal exports of the region-coffee, ba nanas, sugar, and cotton.

295,,97,-0.367,1439,14,Mr. PATTERSON.," Mr. Speaker, the  present administration is launching an  unprecedented assault on older Ameri cans. At every opportunity, programs  which assist senior citizens are being  ripped to shreds. Decades of progress  are being undermined through lopsid ed budget recommendations and hasty  revocation of programs created to help  ease the burdens of old age.  I fear these actions are just a sneak  preview of the hardships to come. We  must stand up now and object, lest our  Nation become populated by destitute  elderly. Without uncompromising sup port by  this Congress, our commit ment to the elderly could be lost.  A majority  of Americans  do not  want  to sit by and watch  the aged  suffer from hunger, inadequate health  care, decrepit housing, or lost hope. In  fact, a number of Americans polled re cently, indicate they would prefer to  contribute a substantial share of their  personal income to insure that the elEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  derly  are well  cared  for. Workers  today also believe Government must  not be indifferent to the needs of the  elderly.  I am personally inspired by these re sults. We have made much progress in  changing attitudes and  in advancing  reforms in programs which serve our  seniors. We must not allow this admin istration to take it away. Surely, there  are those fortunate enough to setaside  funds  for  retirement. But what of  those who do not have the ability or  those who meet unfortunate circum stances rendering them unable to pre pare in advance for a handsome retire ment? Should we  ignore  them com pletely? Should we provide them with  a mere pittance from which to eke out  an existence  in  their senior years?  Should we force them to live fright ened  and  frail without  affordable  health care? I say ""no"" to those who  demand that we adopt legislation to  slash and eliminate programs for the  elderly; and  I hope  to  remind  this  House over and over again until the  threats to our seniors stop.  This year,  seniors participating  in  the title V program were angered by  the administration's recommendation  that over 54,000 positions be terminat ed. The success rate of the title V pro gram  is well known, particularly  to  seniors who have gained self-sufficien cy and who have developed on-the-job  skills  significant  to  future  employ ment. The administration's plan  to  eliminate  this program has been se verely criticized on all counts, most re cently  in this House with  the over whelming  approval  of  a  resolution  calling for continuation and expansion  of the title V program.  Everyone knows about the deceiving  tactics the administration has used to  convince older Americans  that  they  have nothing to fear. They point to  the annual cost-of-living adjustment  and claim credit. We all know that this  administration recommended delaying  this adjustment. Each of us recognizes  the tradeoffs this administration has  demanded.  Income security, vital  to  those advancing in age and declining  in health, is at stake. The administra tion continues to recommend delays in  automatic cost-of-living adjustments,  elimination of benefits, and increases  in health care contributions. Instead  of protecting the economic status of  seniors, this administration is letting  seniors down.  The administration's move to relax  nursing home  inspection  regulations  comes after years devoted to the estab lishment of safe, long-term care facili ties for the aged. This is an unaccept able proposal, particularly for institu tions with patterns of violation.  Methods for accelerating the period ic review of disability insurance recipi ents  have  been  instituted  by  the  present administration to make up for  promised budget reductions. Hasty re19889  moval of disabled beneficiaries from  the social security program has result ed  in grave  financial  hardship  for  many too ill to seek work and too dis traught to arrange alternative means  of  support.  Congress  has  had  to  counter attacks by the administration  by redefining procedures for review of  disabled beneficiaries and  insuring a  phased reemployment plan for those  terminated.  Like every Member of the House of  Representatives,  I  am eager  to  see  waste and fraud eliminated from our  current system of public assistance.  However, I firmly believe that the el derly should not be made to suffer the  consequences of austere budget deci sions. We  in public  service, we  as  American citizens, have a responsibil ity to the seniors of our Nation. And,  we must continue to acknowledge  it.  After all, our elders gave us our free  and strong American society,  let us  keep the faith with them.e  BASIC STANDARDS FOR  NURSING HOMES  HON. NORMAN Y. MINETA  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, August 5, 1982   Mr. MINET A. Mr. Speaker, as a  nation, we have a collective responsi bility to care for the elderly and our  sick. There is no excuse for avoiding  this obligation.  One of the ways we carry out this re sponsibility is  to have a set of basic  standards  for  those nursing homes  which receive Federal funds through  medicare  or medicaid. Earlier  this  year, a move to drastically weaken and  relax those standards was halted by an  outcry of public opposition.  Now, we are faced with a proposal to  significantly change the procedures by  which we  insure  compliance with  those standards. I am very disturbed  by these proposed changes, and have  formally objected to them.  The Health Care Financing Adminis tration <HCFA> has offered for com ment a  regulatory package that pro vides  for  sweeping  changes  in  the  process by which we inspect and certi fy nursing homes receiving medicare  and medicaid reimbursements.  Logic  and  sound  public  policy  demand  that any agency making a  major regulatory proposal must dem onstrate:  Why the existing regulations are in adequate. The details of the problem  to be solved should be spelled out;  How  the  proposed  changes will  eliminate existing problems; and  Why  the proposed  regulations are  superior to other possible alternatives.  The proposal from HCF A  fails all  three of these tests.  ",1982
296,Senate,97,-0.38,33,18,Mr. EAGLETON.," Mr. President, the  Founders  of  this Nation  combined  genius and pragmatism. Thus, at the  same time that they were crafting the  breathtakingly  innovative  system of  government outlined in our Constitu tion, they realized that their plan for  a stable and lasting constitutional de mocracy would only be realized if they  protected the rights embodies in that  document against  the political pas sions that can arise in the body politic  and in the State and National Legisla tures. The Founders clearly recognized  the need, to quote Alexander Hamil ton in Federalist No. 78, to ""guard the  Constitution and the rights of individ uals  from  the  efforts of  those  humors which  the arts of designing  men or the influence of particular con jectures  disseminate  among  the  people .... ""  I submit that the proposal before us  to strip the Federal courts of jurisdic tion over cases involving so-called vol untary school prayer is a perfect ex ample of  just how  foresighted  the  Founders were. For, here we have a  clear instance  in which Members of  this body allow their strong disagree ment with a Supreme Court interpre tation of  the Constitution  to  reach  such a fever pitch that they endorse  an extraordinary and, I submit, uncon stitutional  congressional  response.  ill  For, simply put, what Senator HELMs  proposes is to amend the Constitution  by passage of a mere statute, rather  than  through  the  constitutional  amendment process provided by arti cle V of the U.S. Constitution.  If we follow this route, we will open  up a vast array of civil liberties protec tions embodied in our Constitution to  wholesale  revision  or  nullification  whenever a bare congressional majori ty might  find  it appropriate. This  result is fatally inconsistent with the  scheme of government  intended by  our Founding Fathers,  the  trend of  almost 200 years of constitutional ju risprudence and  the warnings of a  host of legal scholars and experts who  are appalled by the longrun implica tions of amending  the Constitution  through the back door.  A BACK DOOR ATTEMPT TO AMEND THE  CONSTITUTION  It is  important  to  realize at  the  outset  that, however  its proponents  might choose to portray it, this pro posal  is nothing less-or more-than  an attempt to change the legal effect  of the first amendment to the Consti tution through enactment of a mere  statute.  In our constitutional democracy, the  provisions of the Constitution of the  United States are the ""Supreme Law  of  the Land . . . any Thing  in  the  Constitution or Laws of any State to  the Contrary notwithstanding."" <arti cle VI, clause 2). The final interpreter  and expounder of the Constitution's  terms  is  the U.S. Supreme Court.  From these commonplace truths that  have characterized our system since  the early days of  the Constitution,  there flows a straightforward result:  when the Supreme Court ruled in the  1962 case of Engel against Vitale, and  in subsequent cases,  that prayer  in  school violated the clause of the first  amendment which prohibits govern mental  establishment  of  religion,  these decisions became part of the law  of the land binding on the States. The  Court's decision in the school prayer  cases became  inextricably bound  in  the fabric of the Constitution.  Indeed, this is shown by the subse quent actions of those who found the  decision  objectionable.  Recognizing  that the Court's interpretation of the  Establishment of Religion clause of  the first amendment was the law of  the land, various Senators and Repre sentatives have proposed literally hun dreds of amendments to the Constitu tion to remove the judicial gloss on  the first amendment they find so ob jectionable.  Senator IIELMs would reject the ad mittedly time-consuming avenue of a  constitutional amendment, in favor of  a simpler and more  ingenious route.  He and his  followers would  simply  have Congress strip the Federal courts  of jurisdiction to hear cases involving  89-059 0-86-2 <Pt. 18>  ",1982

298,House,97,-0.345,111,18,Mr. HERTEL.," Mr. Speaker, the un employment rate in Michigan is over  14 percent. The State budget has now  been cut 25 percent in these 2 years.  In 1980, President Reagan campaigned  on Labor Day in Detroit and he prom ised to create 13 million jobs. Instead,  there are 13 million people out of  work. His theories have failed.  Today we can do something for jobs.  Mr. Speaker, C. S. Lewis wrote ""The  road to hell  is a gradual one."" Now  even that road is filled with potholes.  Potholes are caused when the support  structure of the road or bridge is eaten  away. There is  too much decay, and  the overlying pavement buckles and  collapses.  Potholes are a metaphor for our Na tion's economic  ills. The supporting  structure of our economy, our workers,  the industrial base have been under mined by high  interest rates,  reces sion, and unemployment.  Just as we cannot allow our roads to  collapse, we cannot allow our workers  to wallow  in  the hell of unemploy ment. Today's jobs bill will address the  deterioration  of  our  vital  roads,  bridges, and waterways and most im portantly, it will create new jobs par ticularly  for  the most  devastated,  those who have exhausted their unem ployment benefits.

That is the biggest waste of human  resources that this country has today.  No country in this world should allow  that kind of a waste.  We are spending billions of dollars  on the State level and on the Federal  level  to support unemployment and  welfare programs  that are another  waste  of  human  resources,  those  people who are not working, and using  up taxpayers' funds.  Would it not make more sense if we  put our people back to work?  Mr. Speaker,  today  I  am  talking  about a  jobs bill that we will be dis cussing later today. I think it is time  that we make the decision here in the  Congress to get some of these people  back to work.

300,House,97,0.215,137,18,Mr. GRAMM.,"  man for yielding.  I rise in opposition to this bill and in  opposition  to  the Republican substi tute.  Mr. Chairman, we have heard a lot  of people talk about jobs here today  and I would like to know if there is  anybody in the House who is against  jobs. So far as I know I have never met  that person.  What  I  have not heard discussed  here today is why we do not have jobs.  Why do we have a recession? Is this  the 1930's type recession where people  are out of jobs because there has been  a collapse  in spending power where  government can come  in and pump  new  jobs  into  the private sector by  spending money?  I  think the facts fly in the face of  that assertion. We have unemploy ment because in June of last year, 4  months before any budget cut or any  tax cut  took effect,  the cumulative  impact of high interest rates collapsed  the automobile industry, collapsed the  homebuilding  industry and sent  the  economy into a tailspin.  In June of  last year  the average  American family saved only 4.5 cents  out of every dollar of after-tax income.  Why? Because  for  the previous  15  years every  time  they saved money  they found themselves losing ground  because prices were rising and the in terest rates they earned at the bank or  the savings and loan were lower than  the inflation rates.  Government  in June of  last year  borrowed 55 cents out of every dollar  being borrowed, creating massive com petition for savings and causing high  interest rates.  We are called on today to spend $1  billion to create jobs. What a worthy  goal. I wish we had the $1 billion. But  unfortunately we do not have $1 bil lion. We are going to have to go out  and borrow  that $1 billion. We are  going to have to take that $1 billion  away from the private capital market,  from people who want to build new  homes, build new farms, build new fac. tories, create permanent new jobs in  the private sector of the economy.  We are going to destroy a private,  permanent, producing  job  for every  public, nonproductive. make-work job  we create here today.  Mr. Chairman, this is a return to the  very programs that we are trying to  eliminate. This is a great leap back ward to the policies of the 1960's and  the 1970's that have brought us to this  sorry state.  If you want real jobs in the private  sector vote to cut something. When we  vote on the appropriations bill, which  will be voted on after this bill is dis posed of,  if you want to create jobs  vote  against  it because  it  is  over  budget.  If you want to create jobs, try to put  the Federal Government on a budget  so that we can continue to bring infla tion down to encourage people to save,  so money can be borrowed at interest  rates business people can afford  to  pay.  That is  the path to recovery. This  bill is a path to a new inflation, to new  high interest rates and to a new a re cession at higher rates of unemploy ment than in the past.  This is a poor choice. This is a poor  program and I urge my colleagues to  vote no.  Even  the Republican plan which  seeks to take money out of synfuels is  flawed  because  that money  is  not  going to be spent in synfuels.  I urge a no vote on the bill whether  on  not  the Republican  substitute  passes and I  thank my colleague for  yielding.  ",1982
301,House,97,-0.377,137,18,Mr. MOF'F'ETT.," I  thank the chair man for yielding this time and for his  work on this measure.  As I understand it, this is an emer gency bill. Sometimes I wonder if we  in this Chamber any longer have the  ability to judge what an emergency is.  We do have what many Democrats  think is an emergency.  We have 3 million people who have  lost their  jobs since Ronald Reagan  took  office. There  are  11 million  people, nearly, out of work and only  two-fifths of those people are receiv ing any benefits.  We keep hearing from that side of  the aisle about how we are only creat ing 200,000  jobs. Only 200,000  jobs.  What a fantasy land we live in when  we are not prepared  to  take some  action to put people to work, not on  leaf-raking,  unproductive  jobs,  but  building things that we need.  I think that the excuses over there  really do not fly. You say you have  other proposals, you have other bills.  We are not going to pass other bills.  This is your chance.

303,House,97,-0.3,176,18,Mr. YOUNG of Missouri.," Mr. Speak er,  throughout this Congress I have  been  forecasting  sharp  increases  in  natural gas prices  for  this  fall and  winter. As you know, Mr. Speaker, I  introduced legislation earlier this year  addressing this problem of skyrocket ing gas prices and to provide residen tial consumers protection from unrea sonably high natural gas prices.  Mr. Speaker,  this week articles  in  both U.S. News & World Report and  Business Week confirm my unhappy  predictions. According  to U.S. News  the Energy Department has predicted  residential natural gas prices 20 per cent higher this winter than last. Busi ness Week forecasts gas price increases  of up to 50 percent this winter.  Experts  universally  blame  the  phased-in deregulation of natural gas  prices established by Congress in the  Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978  for  these increases. U.S. News quite accu rately points out that  this act <the  NGPA> forces utilities to pay higher  prices for gas even though currently  there exists a surplus of natural gas  supplies  such  that  some  producers  have shut down wells because  they  cannot sell the output.  Mr. Speaker, I emphasize once again  that unless the Natural Gas Policy Act  is amended, gas prices will continue to  increase faster than the rate of infla tion and many people will be unable to  afford to heat their homes this winter.  My bill provides the means necessary  for Congress  to  protect  residential  consumers from unreasonbly high nat ural gas prices by containing  those  prices at just and reasonable levels.  I urge my colleagues to take a look  at this week's issue of U.S. News and  Business Week relative to the problem  of natural gas and begin work now to  prevent a disaster this winter.  Mr. Speaker, I include copies of the  articles referred to here in the RECORD,  as follows:  [From U.S. News and Business Week, Sept.  20, 1982]  A PRICING PLoY To KEEP INDUSTRY HooKED  ON GAS  With  individual buyers of natural gas  facing rate increases of up to 50 percent this  winter, competition between oil and natural  gas for industrial customers is heating up.  Plagued by soaring natural gas costs, reces sion-crimped demand for energy in industri al markets, and sinking fuel oil prices, the  nation's gas utilities are losing the battle  Now, in a scramble to retain high-volume  industrial customers, a handful of the utili ties are asking state regulatory commissions  to approve price discounts for these custom ers, even  though consumer gas rates are  rising sharply. Favorable rulings from the  commissions are  likely  to send more gas  companies scurrying for similar assistance.  Over the past year, gas prices have bal looned by 20 percent. Under the Natural  Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA>, written in re sponse to supply shortages, price controls  are gradually being lifted from about 40 per cent of the nation's gas supplies from now  to 1985. But with a steady supply of gas now  assured well  into  the 1980s, U.S. utilities  find themselves facing unexpectedly fierce  price competition from residual fuel oil. In  many regions of the country, ""residual"" is  selling at below $5 per million Btu to indus trial customers, while the industrial price of  gas has risen  to $5.18 per million Btu or  more <chart).  Industrial buyers, who  last  year burned 40 percent of the 20.5  trillion  cu. ft. of all gas used, are switching to oil  with alarming frequency.  In response, local gas utilities are seeking  lower rates for their eroding industrial mar kets.  In August  the Pennsylvania Utility  Commission granted Pittsburgh-based Equi table Gas Co. permission  to set a special  ""floating rate"" that will allow the utility to  tie its industrial gas price to the price of  fuel oil-now underselling gas by 14 percent  in the area-without holding public hear ings. People's Gas, Light & Coke Co., a Chi cago distributor, is hoping for approval of a  similar plan by the Illinois Commerce Com mission by December. ""We're hurting right  now,"" says John A. Lawrisuk, a vice-presi dent at People's. ""Gas prices are going to be  higher than residual straight through 1983,  and we  expect  sizable  [industrial]  load  losses if the new rate is not approved.""  Up in a1""771.3  Utilities contend that unless lower prices  to industrial users are approved, gas rates  will be forced up for all customers. If signifi cant industrial fuel-switching occurs, utili ties would have to increase rates to their re maining customers to earn an allowed rate  of return on assets now ranging from 10 per cent to 15 percent. But consumer groups are  already up in arms over price increases that  analysts expect will average 20 percent over  the next year. In California, Michigan, and  Illinois, some consumers may see stunning  increases of up to 50 percent in their gas  bills, which will make price breaks to indus trial users a bitter political pill. ""We're be tween a rock and a hard place on this one,""  says Charles Pavalko, a staff analyst at the  Ohio Public Utility Commission.  Over the past few years, however, indus trial customers have carried much of the  burden of rising gas prices. The incremental  pricing provision of the NGPA charged in dustrial customers up to 50 percent more  than other users for increased gas consump tion. With the supply uncertainties of the  1970s, such burdens drove  industry away  from gas. Industrial consumption fell from  10.4 trillion cu. ft. in 1973 to 8.4 trillion cu.  ft. in 1980. Now, with gas supplies in excess,  utilities  are  struggling  to prevent more  losses.  Interstate  gas  transmission  companies,  which supply gas utilities, also are worried  about the industrial market <BW-Aug. 2).  In late August, Columbia Gas Transmission  Corp., which wholesales gas in eight North eastern states and is locked into expensive  long-term contracts with producers, asked  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  to allow a price cut of $1 per thousand cu.  ft. on 88 billion cu. ft. of gas slated for in dustrial use. Not surprisingly, distribution  companies that buy gas from Columbia are  applauding the move. ""It's a very interest ing proposal,"" says one executive at an Ohio  gas utility. ""Residential rates are going up,  but they'll go up even more if we don't hang  on to the industrial market. If we don't save  those customers, everyone loses.""  [From U.S. News & World Report, Sept. 13,  1982]  SAY GOODBYE TO CHEAP GAS HEAT  Even  as  air conditioners  continued  to  hum, grim news came in early September  for many Americans  about  the winter  ahead: Costs of heating and cooking with  natural gas will shoot up sharply.  Gas  utilities  throughout  the  country  warned customers to prepare for the same  kind of shock experienced in recent winters  by owners of homes heated by oil or elec tricity.  Utility officials blamed phased deregula tion of natural-gas prices, approved by Con gress  in 1978. The  law,  executives com plained, forces  them to pay higher prices  for gas even though the fuel  is in such a  surplus  that  some  producers  have  shut  down wells because  they cannot sell  the  output.  Nationwide, the Energy Department pre dicted, residential natural-gas prices will be  20 percent higher this winter than last. But  costs will differ widely from place to place.  Southern California Gas Company said  residential customers will find their heating  bills 70 percent higher. Residents in Massa chusetts and New Jersey face 20 percent in creases.  Lone Star Gas Company requested a rate  increase that could raise residential gas bills  by 13 percent in Texas and up to 67 percent  in Oklahoma. In Cleveland, East Ohio Gas  plans to boost prices 15 percent in Novem ber on top of a 15 percent rise in May and a  4 percent hike in August. Gas costs in Cin cinnati will increase 33 percent.  In Maryland, home-gas rates are going up  30 percent, and costs to commercial and in dustrial users are jumping 50 to 60 percent.  Baltimore Gas &  Electric Company  ran  newspaper ads putting the blame for  the  rises solely on  its gas supplier, Columbia  Gas Transmission Corporation.  ",1982

ADJOURNMENT  ",1982
320,,97,-0.418,241,18,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to  join with my distinguished  colleague from New York, Mr. LENT, in  remembering the plight of those citi zens in the Soviet Union seeking immi gration to Israel. I would like to take  this opportunity  to  thank Mr. LENT  for organizing and leading this year's  vigil  and  for  his many  efforts on  behalf of those Soviet Jews who are  not allowed to immigrate to Israel.  I would now like to address the issue  of  the  fate of a Mrs. Galda Nuhi movna Levina, a woman who has con tinually applied for an exit visa for the  last 12 years, only to be refused after  each subsequent request. The pain and  disappointment this woman has expe rienced must be indescribable. Unfor tunately though, her situation is not  at all unique. Over the decades, many  people have applied for visas only to  be repeatedly refused, becoming virtu al prisoners in a country which will  not grant them their humble request.  In the specific case of Mrs. Levina,  she is a 67-year-old widow who is suf fering from cancer, and her prognosis  for the future is dim. She survives on a  minimal pension provided for her by  24057  the government, who also prescribed  for her a communal apartment which  she shares with two women who are  strangers  to her. Mrs. Levina's only  son was granted an exit visa in 1978,  and although he did not wish to leave  his mother, he did so at her insistence.  Since that time, he has married and is  now living in my district in Massachu setts.  At this point in her life,  it would  seem normal for Mrs. Levina to be en joying the fruits of her many years of  labor in a missile factory, but due to  her alleged knowledge of state secrets  learned during her employment, she  has lived in a state of limbo, waiting  for her freedom to be granted, away  from her only  child  and  suffering  from a debilitating disease. It is my  belief that this is a horrendous way  for any elderly person to be spending  the final years of his or her life.  We in these United States are ex tremely  fortunate  to have  the  reli gious and personal freedoms that our  forefathers made such an integral and  crucial part of our Constitution. We  are one of the few nation's on  this  Earth whose citizens are guaranteed  the right of self-determination, which  I fear we all too often take for grant ed. Refuseniks of the Soviet Union,  such as Gaida Levina, do not know  what this rare ability is like, but they  do know that it is something for which  they will  fight with every ounce of  strength they possess.  This dreun of freedom which is held  by all the Soviet Jewry is that which  has led them this far in their quest for  emigration  rights  to  Israel. We are  keeping this vigil in the United States  in remembrance of their courage and  fortitude against a government  that  holds them captive, though they have  committed no grievous act. It is my  fervent hope for the future that these  people we are supporting and praising  today will soon know that security we  have as free citizens. And perhaps one  day soon, all those who have so val iantly sought freedom and have final ly attained it may be seen standing on  the shores of a new land, with dreams  of a new future before them.e  ",1982

I have consulted with  the chairman and ranking member of  that committee and have received as surances that they have no objection  to the Senate's taking up H.R. 5288.  The  Environmental  Protection  Agency, which under the terms of the  Resource Conservation and Recovery  Act must review and approve proposed  interstate compacts, supports congres sional approval of the bill.

We cannot turn  a blind eye to these incredible slayings  if we have any intellectual integrity at  all. We in this House bear a special  onus. For all too long this House has  been mute as a tomb on the ongoings  in Lebanon.  Is history going to ask someday: And  where were you when unarmed men,  women,  and  children were  slaugh tered? Where was your voice? Where  was your conscience?  I commend the President for speak ing out on  this affront  to  the con science of the human race. We in this  body,  in  this House of Representa tives, have a special onus because we  spend billions and billions of dollars  for arms overseas over which we have  no control. The American  taxpayers  and our conscience and the voice of  mankind must ask us to reassess our  policy.

325,House,97,0.371,410,18,Mr. CONABLE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I support passage of  H.R. 7094, which provides for taxes on  trustees and managers of multiem ployer pension plans who take action  which they know, or should know, will  violate conditions contained in deter mination letters issued to those plans  by the Internal Revenue Service.  In 1976, the Internal Revenue Serv ice withdrew the tax-exept status of  one of the largest of the multiemploy er pension  funds. That  tax-exempt  status was reissued, on the condition  that a large percentage of the plan's  assets be controlled, not by the trust ees of the fund or the fund manage ment, but by independent asset man agers.  The cumulative effect of the withdrawal of tax-exempt status from that  fund or any other fund so situated,  could have an adverse effect on the  rights and pensions of  thousands of  workers who are protected by  these  pension plans. This bill would give the  Government  a  better alternative,  a  more direct means of imposing sanc tions on those individuals who violate  conditions imposed upon plans and a  way to avoid withdrawing tax-exempt  status.  The bill has the support of the De partment of Labor, and I ask my col leagues to approve it. H.R. 7094 will  provide the Federal Government with  an additional and needed tool to en force conditions which have been at tached to Internal Revenue Service de termination letters.  ",1982

It  r.~hools all  Mr. Speaker, today we have an op portunity to take a relatively painless  step that would have important, posi tive consequences for the economy of  this country.  By supporting H.R. 5573, the Com puter Equipment Contribution Act, we  can see to it that computers become  available  to  across  this  Nation.  This legislation would extend a pro vision added last year to the Tax Code.  For a single year, it would allow deduc tions for companies who donate com puters to schools.  is estimated  that by 1985  this  country will have a shortage of 100,000  engineers  in the electro.aic  industry.  At a  time when so much of our eco nomic  future depends on our high  tech  industries,  it is folly  for us  to  ignore this statistic. High tech train ing and education is essential to our  Nation's future. This bill is a simple,  positive way of  responding  to  that  need.  When this bill was  first proposed,  some objections were raised. The final  bill responds to most of those objec tions. For instance, the bill's original  30 percent of income cap has been low ered to the 10 percent applicable to  other  charitable  contributions. Re strictions have been added to assure  that contributions are not limited to  wealthy schools or narrow geographic  areas.  This Nation has already suffered un necessary economic setbacks. We have  seen it in autos, and we have seen it in  steel.  In  The time for America to prepare for  its high tech future is now.  This bill helps see to it that we will  have  the  trained personnel  to keep  this critical  sector of our economy  strong and thriving.  ",1982

334,,97,-0.347,514,18,Mr. BAILEY of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, last week, I  introduced H.R.  7107, a bill which would amend the  tariff schedules and result in all like  cordage made from plastic material to  be  identically classified at the same  duty rate regardless of the dimensions  of the plastic material from which it is  manufactured. Under  current  tariff  schedules, some foreign-made cordage  has received preferred tariff treatment  because of an inadvertent and unin tentional discrepancy  in  the custom  laws. The result of this discrepancy is  that  two  identical  importations  of  plastic cordage of identical character istics and use are classified under dif ferent  tariff  schedule  categories at  substantially  different  duty  merely because o!le product was manu factured from plastic material over 1  inch in width while the other was not.  Today, I WCluld  like to present de tailed information about the impact of  these unfair imports on the U.S. cord age  industry.  I will  include a paper  prepared by  th~ Cordage  Institute  that summarizes the economic condi tions of the industry in relation to for eign competition. The paper was pre pared to provide  information to  the  U.S. Trade Representative for his bi lateral negotiations with the Republic  of Korea in support of the Cordage In stitute's need  for  relief against  the  flood 0f  imoorts  in Korean cordage  products. The U.S. 'i'rade Representa tive did negotiate a quota in the sub ject tariff iteiDS as a resu~t of the re quest.  The paper demonstrates the precari ous nature of the domestic cordage in dustry in regard to the low-priced for eign imports-a case that was convinc ing to the U.S. Trade Representative  before it was known :-hat foreign im ports were entering the United States  duty free through the loophole in the  tariff schedule that H.R. 7107  is de signed to correct.  Since  the  in_f'Jux of  the duty-free  cordage products, m~inly from Korea,  the U.S.  industry has suffered even  further. In the first 4 months of 1982,  for example, sales by the U.S. industry  decreased  by  :5 percent,  dropping  more than 2 millio:'l pounds down to  t...om  for  the  comparable pE  iod of 1981.  In 1981,  sales had fallen by 2 '12 ~nillion pounds  fer the year, with most of that drop  coming in the last quarter when ship ments under the tariff loophole began  to be noticed.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the  amendment  reluctantly,  but  I  think we have to face the fact that  unless the bill stays as it is, it would  remove the requirement for life-cycle  costing and would take us back to ini tial costing.  There  is  really no guarantee  that  the authorizing bill will pass. If it does  pass,  it  supersedes  this. However,  there is no guarantee.  There has also been some question  whether  it might be vetoed by  the  President if indeed it does pass. If we  are going to continue to have life-cycle  costing it is necessary to continue to  have this language in the appropria tion bill.  I, therefore, reluctantly oppose the  amendment of my colleague and hope  it will be voted down.  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1982
336,House,97,0.231,579,18,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Chairman, for  the REcoRD,  this Member supported  this  appropriations measure which  funds the operations of our vital farm  programs. I should not need to call to  the attention of my colleagues the dire  situation on the farms and ranches of  America today. Commodity prices con tinue to fall far below the cost of pro duction.  Interest  rates  continue  to  exact a staggering toll on family farm ing operations. And this year, for the  first time in many years, exports of ag ricultural products will  actually de crease over last year. There  is  little  reason for optimism in farm country,  even as we approach another binbust ing harvest.  The bill before us does offer some  assistance, however, in the funding of  the export credit revolving fund which  was authorized by the 1981 farm bill.  Despite the refusal of the administra tion and officials of the Department of  Agriculture  to  request  these needed  funds, the Appropriations Committee  has recommended a $500 million ap propriation for  the establishment of  this export promotional effort, and I  strongly urge my colleagues to support  this provision of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, without a strong and  sustained effort in the area of export  promotion, there is no light at the end  of  the  tunnel  for  the American  farmer. We must make clear the com mitment on the part of American agri culture to meeting the food and fiber  needs of the world, and the revolving  fund provisions of this bill will be of  great assistance in that effort.

337,House,97,0.33,592,18,Mr. LOWERY of California.," Mr.  Speaker, reserving the right to object,  and I shall not object, on May 27 of  this year,  I  introduced House Joint  Resolution 496, which we are consider ing today, declaring the week begin ning November 21, 1982, as ""National  Alzheimer's Disease Week.'' In the 4  short months since  its  introduction,  the legislation has attracted the sup port of 257 Members of the House who  have cosponsored the resolution. The  fact that the bill has generated such a  strong show of support in so short a  time  in  this  normally  slow-moving  body is an indicator of the tragic and  widespread effect that Alzheimer's dis ease  has  had  on  our  constituents  across the United States.  Alzheimer's disease is a surprisingly  common disorder that destroys certain  vital cells of the brain, producing in tellectual disability-senile dementia in 15 percent of persons aged 65 or  older. This mind-ravaging disease ac counts for more than 50 percent of all  nursing home admissions, and affects  1.5 million Americans. The disease  which is not a normal consequence of  aging,  is  the  fourth most  common  cause of death in the United States behind  heart  disease,  cancer,  and  stroke; accounting, directly or indirect ly for up to 120,000 deaths a year.  Surprisingly enough, however  con sidering the vast numbers of Ameri cans  suffering  from  the  disease,  Alzhemeimer's disease is relatively un known. It is, in fact, a silent epidemic.  The symptoms of Alzheimer's dis ease are slow and insidious, with the  earliest  impairment  being  that  of  recent memory. As  the disease pro gresses, memory  loss  increases  and  reasoning deteriorates. Soon,  simple  daily tasks become impossible chores:  Balancing a  checkbook,  following  a  recipe,  or  even  putting  together  simple,  coherent  sentences. Usually  the victim becomes depressed, agitat ed,  irritable,  and  restless.  In  some  cases,  he  becomes  violent,  and  in  others, placid and inert. In the final  stages of the disease, the Alzheimer's  victim  is  totally unable  to care  for  himself, and requires constant, round the-clock care.  There is no known cure for Alzhei mer's disease. No way  to reverse or  retard the unrelenting process of dete rioration. It is one of the most ignored  and uniquely  tragic diseases of our  time, not just for what it does to the  victim, but for its devastating effect on  family and friends.  In the earliest stages of the disease  the victim can be cared for at home by  the family and spouse. However, as  the disease progresses, the victim be comes  increasingly combative, unrea sonable,  and,  finally,  incontinent.  Ultimately, the vast majority are com mitted to nursing homes, placing a tre mendous burden, both financial and  psychological, on family members. An  estimated $17,000  a  patient will be  spent on nursing home care for Alzheimer's victims  this year-an expense  virtually uncovered by private  insur ance or medicare until the family's fi nances are depleted to public aid level.  Thus, in their golden years, husbands  ",1982

339,,97,0.337,722,18,Mr. CARMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  on this occasion in praise of my Wash ington and district office staff. In my  time here,  I have come  to know a  number of congressional staff persons.  I have found them all to be compe tent, dedicated, talented, hard-working  individuals. Yet,  I know of no Con gressman as fortunate as I am when it  comes to the first rate group of men  and women who serve on my staff.  I have come to know each individual,  both  professionally  and  personally.  Each has shown exemplary dedication  both to the House of Representatives  and to me. They have worked  long,  hard hours in support of my public  and legislative activities, and I have  come to value highly their depth of  knowledge and useful counsel. They  deserve a great deal of credit for the  work I have been able to do well in  this Chamber. I rise today to extend  public recognition and my own deep  personal gratitude  to  these  individ uals.  I have developed a deep respect for  my Washington staff. Kate Caldwell,  Jeff Craven, Lee Ann Frank, Steve He minger, Jonathan Hill, Len Johnson,  Andre LeTendre, Gene Meyer, Lois  McKenna, John Palafoutas, and Felice  Pelosi have accomplished every task I  have given them with admirable dili gence and dedication. They have dis played a true professionalism in their  dealings with the offices of this House,  with the interests and problems of my  constituents, and the numerous gov ernmental agencies both in and out of  Washington  with  which  I  have  worked.  Joan Camisa, Ethel Contogine, Larry  Cregan, Anthony  Fabrizio,  Robert  Mazze, Barbara Sposato, and Nancy  Wohlsen on my district office staff  have served ably and well. During the  past 2 years, they have developed an  excellent  relationship with my con stituents in the Third District of New  York. As I am sure every Congressman  ideally desires, my district office staff  has served as a highly effective liaison  between me~ in my congressional work  in Washington, and the good people of  Long Island whom I represent.  I also have learned to respect and  appreciate the contributions made by  the interns in my office. Ginna Calcagnini, Paul Fishbin, Lori Harmon,  will be  Maria Humeres, Lois Mary McKenna,  Patricia Roberts,  and Robert Shea  have performed consistently well  in  their service to the Congress and to  my staff.  When  I  leave  this Congress, my  deepest and most  lasting memories  those of my staff. We have  worked hard together; we have accom plished a great deal together; we have  enjoyed the thrills and shared the sor rows of public life  together; we are  professional  associates  and  dear  friends.

341,,97,-0.343,735,18,Mr. BARNES.," Mr. Speaker,  this  year marks  the  lOth anniversary of  the Kaiser-Georgetown  Community  Health Plan, a noteworthy occasion  for  thousands of residents of Mary land, Virginia, and the District of Co lumbia.  The Kaiser-Georgetown Community  Health Plan, in association with the  Capital Area  Permanente Medical  Group, provides and arranges health  care services to approximately 75,000  people. Kaiser-Georgetown is a region  of  the Kaiser-Permanente medical  care  program,  the Nation's  largest  nongovernmental prepaid group prac tice  health  care  delivery  system.  Kaiser-Permanente provides and ar ranges health care services for 4 mil lion people nationwide.  In August 1980, the Kaiser-Perman ente medical care program acquired  the Georgetown University Communi ty Health Plan, which had been in op eration since 1972. The health plan  was renamed the Kaiser-Georgetown  Community Health Plan, and since ac quisition has grown to 75,000 from a  membership of 52,000. Members are  served at  locations  in Gaithersburg  and Kensington, Md.; Reston  and  Springfield, Va.; and Northeast Dis trict of Columbia. A new medical facil ity will open this fall in Landover, Md.  Kaiser-Georgetown  Community  Health Plan's anniversary marks the  maturity of a health care delivery pro gram founded as a cost-effective and  efficient alternative to traditional de livery modes.

342,Senate,97,0.196,787,18,Mr. DANFORTH.," The Statistical  Abstract lists about 90 religious bodies  in this country with more than 50,000  members each. One of  those  is  the  Buddhists. Imagine a recently arrived  Vietnamese child who is a Buddhist, a  fourth grader, in a classroom of stu dents who were raised in the Judea Christian tradition. That child is guar anteed his religious rights under the  Constitution as much as any child. A  refusal to join prayers led or, at any  rate,  supervised  by  school  officials  would surely result in embarrassment  for this child, and I cannot conceive  that such embarrassment would serve  the purpose of either religion or Amer ica.  There are other examples along this  line. The Muslim population of  the  United  States  is  increasing.  For  Muslim, a follower of Islam, prayer in volves a detailed ritual of turning to  Mecca and prostrating oneself. The  prayer itself is a simple adoration of  Allah, and does not involve requests or  any  asking of  a  blessing,  as most  Christian prayers by contrast do.  As these hypothetical situations il lustrate-and it would not be difficult  to multiply them-the United States is  more and more a  religiously diverse  Nation. The free exercise of religion is  a guarantee to all citizens of all faiths.  The suggestion that a period for vol untary prayer would bring  religion  into public schools raises the question:  What is sufficient to pass for religion?  For those within a religious tradition,  it simply is not true that one prayer is  as good as any other. Prayer arises  from the content of the faith, and it is  the job of the churches, not the Gov ernment, to describe what that con tent is. Any thought that the form of  prayer is of no matter to the various  denominations should be put to rest  by considering the enormous contro versies  triggered by recent  liturgical  reform  in  the Roman Catholic and  Episcopal Churches.  In addition to the wording of prayer,  the time and place of public worship is  of great concern to religious denomi nations. The time of worship; for ex ample, the Sabbath, the Day of Resur rection, and days of obligation. And  the place-its religious art and archi tecture-both point to the content of  the underlying faith. No denomination  would be willing to delegate the orga nization of public worship to a school  board, and it is unlikely that any wor ship  organized  by  a  school  board  would bear any  relationship  to  reli gion.  In a time of weakened public values,  it is not surprising that many Ameri cans are hoping that religion will save  the day. This is perfectly appropriate  and understandable. But the real ques tion is whether the sort of prayer con templated for public schools is authen tic  religion,  rooted  in  tradition and  practiced in all its richness, or wheth er it only bears the label of religion af fixed to it by well-meaning politicians.  The point I am stressing is not lost  on some of the key supporters of the  Helms prayer amendment. Jerry Fal well, the founder of the Moral Majori ty, knows the difficulty of asking men  and women of diverse faiths to join in  prayer. In a meeting with the Reli gious Newswriters Association in New  Orleans, Mr. Falwell is quoted as ob serving that:  If we ever opened a Moral Majority meet ing with prayer,  silent or otherwise, we  would disintegrate.  Pressed for an explanation of this  remark, Mr. Cal Thomas, director of  communications for the Moral Majori ty said, according  to  the New York  Times, that meetings of the organization were not opened with prayer be cause it is a political organization that  includes  Jews, Catholics, Mormons,  Protestants, and even ""nonreligious""  members. Mr. Thomas put  it well  when he asked: ""What kind of prayer  would we use?""  Now I ask the Senate: If Mr. Falwell  and Mr. Thomas understand the divi siveness of questions over prayer  in  the context of Moral Majority meet ings, how could they possibly miss the  same point when  the question over  prayer  in  public  school  classrooms  arises? Mr. Thomas says that prayers  are not said at meetings of the Moral  Majority because it is a ""political orga nization"" rather than a religious one.  Then what would Mr. Falwell and Mr.  Thomas consider a room full of public  school children to be? The children of  the various religious faiths in this Na tion's public schools would  feel  the  same unease and disquiet over prayer  that adult members of the Moral Ma jority would were prayer to open their  meetings. Perhaps Mr. Falwell thinks  that young children do not have the  same sensibilities  that adults do on  questions of religion. To some extent a  difference in sensibility is obvious. But  it is just as obvious that children are  even less understanding of differences  between them than are adults. As I ob served earlier, even in the restrained  setting of the U.S. Senate, Senators  cannot refrain from referring,  in of fensive terms, to the religious faith of  other Senators. Imagine the scenes we  can expect in public school classrooms.  The  advocates  of State-sponsored  school prayer betray, it seems to me, a  view  that the churches,  the church  schools, and the homes of our land,  can no longer do the important work  of promoting religious faith, can no  longer bring to the content and con duct of our children's lives the moral  framework of religion. It is as though  we are told that religion is too impor tant to be left to the church and the  home, and that here too, there must  be a  role for Government. I do not  share this lack of confidence in church  and home, nor do  I share the view  that urges Government to enter every  aspect of American life. The home and  the church and  the private church  school are precisely the places where  attentive, reverent, and humble prayer  can be practiced, where religion can be  embraced in its fullness.  During the course of last autumn's  debate on this bill, the senior Senator  from North Carolina asked me  if  I  could think of any circumstance when  prayer could do a student any harm.  At the time of that question, I was not  sufficiently quick to come up with an  example. Soon  thereafter,  however,  examples came readily to mind. Now, I  would like the Senate to consider one  of my concerns before voting on the  Helms amendment.  ",1982
343,House,97,0.146,826,18,Mr. WAMPLER.," Mr. Speaker, Ire cently joined as a cosponsor of House  Concurrent Resolution 384, which ex presses the sense of the Congress that  Federal  involvement  in and support  for child nutrition programs should be  maintained.  Food assistance programs play an in tegral part in feeding the needy people  in this country and represent an in vestment  in  the well-being  of  the  needy elderly, disabled, and children  who rely on these programs. The food  stamp program, as well as child nutri tion  programs  such  as  the  school  lunch program and the WIC program,  are examples of these programs. These  programs were initiated to address the  problems of hunger and poor nutrition  that existed. While many of  these  problems have been reduced-the con tinuing need for these programs still  exists.  This resolution expresses the sense  of Congress that child nutrition pro grams should continue as  they are  now administered. I support that concept and until a better proposal is sub mitted to Congress I will continue my  strong support for programs that con tribute to improved nutrition among  needy people in our country.  I might  take  this opportunity  to  mention another phase of this  issue  that goes hand in hand with food asis tance programs. This is nutrition edu cation.  Food  assistance  programs,  while an integral part of any nutrition  policy, are not the entire solution to  the problem of poor diets. Education  programs  are  needed  to  help  low  income families acquire the knowledge  and skills necessary to improve their  diets.  I urge Members  to support House  Concurrent Resolution 384.

The Soviet Union  is consistent. It  always fulfills its evil responsibility to  make sure that oppressed nations stay  oppressed. The United States  is  the  leading Nation of the free world. Are  we going to shirk the moral responsi bility to further democracy wherever  or whenever we can? With leadership  comes the difficult responsibilities of a  great nation to help small nations that  are trying to build democratic institu tions. Lebanon is suffering greviously.  We cannot turn our back.  Israel, a loyal ally for decades, is in a  most difficult situation at the conclu sion of their ""Operation: Peace in Gal ilee."" They have developed a dilemma  similar to the one the United States  found itself entraped by in Southeast  Asia. While  trying  to end  terrorism  and support the formation of a demo cratic government, the United States  was viciously criticized for every move  we took without any regard for the al ternative  nightmare-the  nightmare  that exists in Vietnam today.  Israel wants to maintain peace and  to see Lebanon  turned again  into a  stable nation, but they are too close to  the bloodshed and fighting,  too en twined  in  the deep passions of  the  area. Israel needs our stabilizing influ ence, so, therefore, I think the Presi dent has made a courageous decision. I  give him my wholehearted  support  with full knowledge that it is a danger ous decision, and that it does place our  fine marines in jeopardy.  Those officers and men on their way  back to Lebanon know the risks and  fully expected, when they joined the  corps, to occasionally be ordered to go  in harm's way.  May God watch over them.

I am  personally sympathetic to the rights  of workers to strike, and so I support  the right of the engineers in taking  the only recourse they feel is available  to them. They did not take this action  casually. It is a painful decision, but it  is their right.  The strike, however, has serious im plications  for our  already battered  economy. The Reagan economic pro gram has given us record deficits and  brutal  unemployment  rates. A  rail  strike aggravates these problems-wit nesses  testified  yesterday  that  the  strike could cost our economy any where from $80 to $1 billion per day.  As industrial plants close around the  Nation unemployment would spread  widely. A long strike could devastate  our Nation.  Compounding  the problem  is  the  consensus of the parties involved that  an additional cooling off period would  accomplish little. Witnesses before the  Energy  and  Commerce  Committee  seemed to agree that another 60 or 100  days of negotiation would not resolve  the pay differential issue.  My reluctant decision is to support  Senate Joint Resolution 250. In taking  this course I fear the effect this might  have in setting a precedent in future  labor controversies. I  fear the effect  this action might have on manage ment-if Congress is willing to inter vene on their behalf in this instance,  perhaps management will  be more  willing to play negotiations to the last  dollar in other instances.

Final  debate in this House on legislation to  reauthorize  the  FTC  will  decide  whether these professionals will be al lowed  to police  themselves  through  reasonable  self-regulation or be po liced  by  an  administrative  agency  whose congressional charter never in cluded power over the professions or  over State regulatory activity.  If the FTC is allowed to regulate the  medical profession, local societies will  have real difficulty setting standards  by which medical care  is measured.  Nor will they be able to provide infor mation to patients on what fees are  reasonable or unreasonable, warn in quiring patients of physicians, clinics,  or other medical services with poor  performance records, and participate  in voluntary coalitions  to deal with  cost containment.  The  FTC  now  assumes  subpena  power  over  the  records  of  State,  county, and other medical societies,  very often for fishing expeditions. One  medical society in California spen~ an  initial $1 million in costs in an FTC  action, and then agreed to discontinue  publication of a relative value scale of  charges  for certain procedures.

353,Senate,97,0.322,982,18,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, I ap preciate this opportunity to succinctly  record my opposition to the Quayle Tsongas  amendment  <No.  2016)  to  reduce the support price under the do mestic sugar stabilization program. I  believe the current sugar program is  not only in the best interest of sugar  producers, but it is in the Nation's best .  interest.  This country has an extraordinary  sweet tooth-we consume more than  we produce. We are then compelled to  import the remainder of our Nation's  needs from the so-called world market.  But that market is relatively small currently about 18 percent of world  supply-and  the  overproduction  of  sugar-producing  nations  is  then  dumped at whatever price it can bring.  This world market  is  not, by  any  stretch of  the  imagination, a  stable  market. During  the years  that  this  country was without a domestic sugar  program, consumers were subjected to  sharp price  fluctuations. The world  price went from 9.3 cents per pound in  1973 to 64.5 cents in 1974, then down  to 14.2 cents in 1975, back up to 44.2  cents in 1980, and then plummeted to  less than 8 cents this summer.  The true dividend for the American  consumer  comes  in  those  years  of  short world supply. During those peri ods, if there were no sugar industry in  the United States, Americans would  pay  substantially  higher  prices,  if  there were any supplies available at  all. Indeed, some have estimated there  would be no world surplus <and thus  cheap prices)  this year if there had  been no U.S. production.  The simple fact is that U.S. produc tion cannot exist without a nearby  processing mill. And, since 1975, some  30  sugar mills  and  refineries have  closed down and an additional 4 are  scheduled for closing this fall. When a  mill closes,  the area producers must  then switch to other crops. It is not  likely that the plant will ever reopen  or that those producers will ever have  the option of returning to sugar as a  cash crop. Without our current domes tic program, the potential demise of  the U.S.  sugar  industry  could  cost  American  consumers  a  dearly high  price indeed.  I supported the adoption of the cur rent sugar program in last year's farm  bill since I felt it to be a carefully de signed program that struck a fair bal ance between the interests of produc ers and consumers of this commodity  which is in such high demand among  us Americans. For the interests of tax payers, the program is designed to be  administered in such a way so there is  no cost to the taxpayer and, in fact,  the  import  fees  that have been at tacked by some are actually increased  revenue  for  our  severely  strained  Treasury.  The current program is certainly no  bargain for U.S. producers-USDA es timates that the loan rate for the 1982  crop of sugar will cover only about 70  percent of the average cost of produc tion. I am convinced that we should  maintain  the  domestic  stabilization  program  for  sugar  at  its  present  modest  levels  and  I will  therefore  oppose any and all amendments  in tended to weaken it.

354,Senate,97,0.382,1021,18,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to cosponsor S. 1701, the Miss ing Children's Act,  and  I  urge my  fellow colleagues to support an issue  that is vital  to American families.  I  wish to recognize the tremendous ef forts of Senator PAULA HAWKINS, the  distinguished Senator  from Florida,  who originated this legislation and has  worked very hard to bring the problem  to national attention.  On October  20,  1981,  4-year-old  Danny Davis was shopping with his  grandfather in a supermarket in Salt  Lake City, Utah. Minutes later he was  gone.  Police  are  still  looking  for  Danny and his abductors.  Elements of this tragic crime are re peated  time  and  again  across  the  Nation. The children  face unknown  fates ranging from forced separation  from  their  loved  ones  to  violence.  Their parents face heartbreak and un certainty, and the police, all too often,  face cases without clues.  Each  year,  approximately  150,000  children are reported missing, and the  Department of Youth Development in  Health and Human Services estimates  that as many as 1.8 million actually  disappear. The parents of these chil dren may experience weeks, months,  or even years of uncertainty, of sleep less nights, of waiting and wondering.  In addition to the mental agony, the  parents encounter great difficulty in  trying to locate their children.  If I had a car disappear right now,  that disappearance would immediately  go on the Federal records. If I had a  child disappear right now, there would  be no commensurate action. Only 10  percent of the children missing for an  appreciable period of time are ever en tered into a national missing persons  file. The FBI collects information for  that file on a voluntary, not an obliga tory, basis from State  law agencies.  And most tragically, each year almost  2,000 cases involving the unidentified  dead are closed, leaving 2,000 families  a lifetime of uncertainty.  These bleak prospects for the resolu tion of cases  involving missing chil dren, and  the  terrible grief of  the  cases  thexnselves, underline  the  tre mendous need for a national registry.  Under  the Missing Children's Act,  missing children would be linked na tionally by a computer just as missing  cars and  refrigerators are currently  linked. The bill would also make pa rental  child  snatching  across State  borders a crime and tie the names of  5,000  unclaimed  bodies  of  children  buried annually into the national com puter.  The parents of Danny Davis are still  waiting. So,  too, are  the parents of  thousands of other missing children. I  believe that we must use the resources  and technology available today to aid  the search for those children. It would  be a tragedy of the first order if Amer ica were to abandon its lost children.  Once again, I urge my fellow Sena tors,  the House of Representatives,  and the President to make S. 1701 a  law, so that some of our missing chil dren can begin to be found.  ",1982
355,Senate,97,-0.314,1021,18,Mr. HUDDLESTON.," Mr. President,  today the Senate is considering a vital ly  important piece of  legislation. S.  1701, the Missing Children Act, was in troduced to provide some means for  addressing  the difficult problem of  identifying children who have disap peared from  their families. Hearings  which have been held on this bill have  dramatically shown the need for some  system to help locate missing children.  This legislation would establish a na tional clearinghouse  for  information  on missing children and the unidenti fied dead.  Currently, the National Crime Infor mation Center within the FBI main tains a national missing persons file.  Yet, even while this system exists, in formation for only 10 percent of all  missing children is now entered into  the system. There are many reasons  for the low utilization including lack  of knowledge regarding the existence  of such a  file,  limited resources and  manpower to provide  information  to  the system, and reluctance by local of ficals to use a nationwide system for a  local problem. S. 1701 would amend  present  law  to permit parents,  legal  guardians, and next of kin to list their  missing children with the NCIC. This  would help increase the utilization of  the national clearinghouse and hope fully  lead  to  the  identification  of  many more missing children.  S. 1701 will also establish for  the  first time a national center for infor mation about  the unidentified dead.  Each year,  2,000  dead persons  are  found and no information about their  identity is available. Because of this,  many families  live for years holding  out hope that their missing relatives  will be  found alive. By providing a  place where information about these  persons can be filed, we will help pro vide an end to needless suffering by  many families across the country. De tailed information about the undenti fied dead would have  to be entered  into this national system 15 days after  discovery to help provide positive iden tification and to help solve many cases  that were  previously  impossible  to  solve.  By approving S. 1701, we will be  showing our concern for families who  have known the anguish that comes  when a child is missing. We also will  be providing a means of preventing  ",1982

While there is considerable lan guage difference, there is no substan tial difference, with one small excep tion, between  the provisions of  the  House-passed bill and the Senate sub stitute.  When we passed the House bill on  July 19 of this year, there was pending  before the House a similar Senate bill,  S. 159. Normally, we would have vacat ed action on the House bill and passed  the similar Senate bill.  However,  the Senate managers re quested us to pass the House bill and  table the Senate bill to permit them to  correct an oversight which was con tained in the language of both bills.  Both bills authorized the Secretary  of  the  Interior  to  retain easements  across lands exchanged to the tribe to  provide  access  to  adjacent Federal  lands. This implied that no such access  was required for other adjacent lands.  The Senate substitute simply inserts  the language of S. 159 as passed by the  Senate and which would have been ac ceptable to us, but provides that the  easements for access shall be for any  lands, not just Federal lands.

370,,97,-0.318,1190,18,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, it has  recently  come  to  my  attention  through a published report that there  is a deficiency in the Bankruptcy Act  that is preventing units of government  from recovering funds spent to clean  up hazardous waste sites owned by  businesses that declare bankruptcy. I  am, therefore, today introducing legis lation to correct this deficiency.  I  insert in the REcoRD  the article  which appeared in the Newark Star Ledger which details the type of situa tion this Legislation is designed to ad dress.  [From.the Star-Ledger, July 25, 19821  QUANTA CASE PITS ECOLOGY VS. CREDITORS  <By Scott Muldoon)  Last October, Quanta Resources Corp., an  Edgewater-based recycler of waste oil prod ucts, filed for protection under Chapter 11  of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the result ing  proceedings may  present  a  test  of  whether environmental statutes can  take  precedence over the protection of creditors.  The company, whose former officers in clude Russell Mahler, sentenced to Pennsyl vania prison last year for dumping millions  of gallons of hazardous waste that ultimate ly seeped into the Susquehanna River, said  in its petition that it had $4 million of assets  and $3.5 Inillion of debts, $1.125 million of  those secured by the company's assets.  In  its  petition,  however, Quanta  said,  ""Midlantic National Bank, Elican Holding  Co., Equitable Life Assurance Co. and mis cellaneous banks have alleged liens on virtu ally all assets of the debtor. Debtor believes  that it has no equity in its assets.""  And there's the rub. Quanta's financial  straits, coupled with its record of pollution,  may well force a showdown between state  environmental  statutes  and  the  federal  bankruptcy law.  Both New York and New Jersey may want  a crack at the proceeds of the sale of Quan ta's assets to clean up hazardous wastes on  Quanta's properties in New York and New  Jersey, and both have filed proofs of claim.  New Jersey law provides that the state  can obtain the assets of polluting companies  to pay for cleaning up hazardous wastes, but  the U.S. Bankruptcy Code contains nothing  about environmental  concerns. The code  says secured creditors have  first priority  after employees. Midlantic, Quanta's biggest  secured creditor, is owed $600,000, followed  by Equitable Life with $100,000. Midlantic,  if it comes  to  that, will argue  the states  should get nothing from Quanta's corpse.  Quanta was formed two years ago, and,  through a series of corporate entities, it is a  wholly owned subsidiary of the old-line in vestment banking firm of Warburg Paribas  Becker Inc., which bought the 1,000 out standing shares of Quanta's common stock  from Mahler as an investment. Mahler con tinued as a senior vice president of sales,  and, according to the court papers, was paid  more than $100,000 from October 1980 to  October 1981.  Quanta owns or leases three storage and  recycling facilities-in Edgewater, Syracuse,  N.Y., and Long Island City, Queens, N.Y.  The  two  in Edgewater and Queens have  been found to contain PCBs, or polychlori nated biphenyls, one of the most feared oil based carcinogens and one of the most diffi cult to clean up.  New York, in a brief filed in the bankrupt cy court in Newark, has estimated that a  cleanup of at least 70,000 contaminated gal lons in Queens would cost about $1 million.  The  extent  of  contaminants  in  about  400,000 other gallons on the Queens site is  unknown, the state said.  In a deposition earlier this year, former  Quanta chairman, Eugene I. Prashker, of  Gladwyn, Pa., said a study of the tanks at  the Edgewater site showed 400,000 gallons  of oil feedstock were contaminated, and dis posing of the oil would cost between $1.6  million and $2 million.  In fact, it was the pollution problems at  Edgewater that forced Quanta to change  from a Chapter 11 proceeding, under which  the company would continue as a going con cern, to Chapter 7, a liquidation proceeding.  The New Jersey Department of Environ mental  Protection  <DEP)  had  licensed  Edgewater as one of the state's 20 proces sors of hazardous wastes despite its past his tory, but in July of last year it ordered the  site closed after news reports showed the  Edgewater Terminal,  a  related company,  was shipping highly toxic waste oil as heat ing oil to New York City.  The facility continued to operate, howev er, even after October, while the DEP and  Quanta, represented by the late Francis X.  Journik of the Middlesex law firm of Wi lentz, Goldman & Spitzer, tried to negotiate  a settlement that would implement a ""reme dial program."" Under an agreement filed in  October with the bankruptcy court, Quan ta's parent company, Warburg Paribas, had  said it would advance Quanta money for ad ministrative purposes, such as paying em ployees and  the bankruptcy  trustee's ex penses.  But several weeks later, when the settle ment fell through and the Edgewater site  was closed,  the  investment banker pulled  out and Quanta was forced on Nov. 12, to  file for Chapter 7.  One of the results of the changed status  was  that  all  of Quanta's property was  placed in the hands of the trustee, Thomas  O'Neill of the Newark firm of Nolan, Bell &  Moore, whose duty it became to liquidate  Quanta and sell its assets for the benefit of  the more than 100 creditors, all of whom  would be unlikely to get paid unless,  like  Midlantic, they held a security interest.  Meanwhile, the Queens site, which is adja cent to the Long Island Railroad and which  contains 52 storage tanks, had already been  closed and O'Neill was paying about $1,100 a  week for 24-hour guards. In its brief, New  York said the site was  in disrepair, with  leaking tanks, an inadequate fire prevention  system and no fire box.e  STOP REPUBLICAN DEFICIT  SPENDING  HON.

372,,97,-0.419,1203,18,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  join my colleagues  in honoring  the  memory of the late Keith Sebelius.  In a world sharply divided by think ers and doers, Keith Sebelius was a  doer.  ""Life  is marching on,"" Keith  would say, ""[and] there are so many  things you want to do."" Fortunately  for the people of the United States of  America, Keith really did go out and  accomplish these many things, and his  impressive  record of  legislative  suc cesses is a testament to that fact.  I consider myself fortunate to have  served with Keith on the Agriculture  Committee. There, it was clearly evi dent that this senior member was ex tremely  influential  because he  did  more than talk: He got things done.  Throughout many  times of heated  debate, Keith's was always the moder ating voice of reason. A master at the  art of compromise, Keith never al lowed party ideology to stand in the  way of forging the necessary programs  for his ""big first"" district of Kansas,  and for the continued best interests of  our country.  Keith was more than a superlative  Congressman: He was a great man. We  all know how much hard work and  dedication it takes to serve this great  Nation. Yet Keith devoted his pre cious extra  time  to his community,  serving the United Methodist Church  as lay leader, president of the board of  trustees, and Sunday school teacher.  We shall all miss not only the states man, but the compassionate and dedi cated human being who put his people  and his causes before himself. He very  well could have rested on the laurels  of congressional office, yet he spent  his last years quietly in law practice  with his two sons.  Keith Sebelius was a role model for  us all. And like all great men, his life  was so full of monumental contribu tions that we have much to remember  him by. In addition to his impressive  legislative record, the Keith Sebelius  Lake will preserve h~ name for poster ity, and the Sebelius tradition will be  perpetuated by his two fine sons, Gary  and Doug.  The best way we can pay tribute to  Keith  is by continuing his spirit of  generosity. If, by the end of our lives,  we can say that we have shown as  much of  the ""milk of human kind ness"" as Keith did, we will have served  his memory well.e  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  THE ARCHITECT OF MODEL  CITY, U.S.A.  HON. RONALD M. MOm  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 23, 1982  of 12,300  e ",1982
373,,97,0.021,1203,18,Mr. MOTTL.," Mr. Speaker,  if we  wanted to show a foreign dignitary a  model of local government efficiency  in America, we would be well advised  to escort the person to the Greater  Cleveland  community  of Brooklyn,  Ohio.  Brooklyn, Ohio, is a blue-collar city  just outside of Cleveland's  corporate limits. The suburb is presid ed over by Mayor John M. Coyne, who  has held that office since 1948. His  tenure as mayor is the longest in Ohio  and one of the longest in the country.  As one journeys through this city, one  is impressed with the neat homes and  yards, the litter-free streets, the im maculate city buildings, and the sepa ration of business and industry from  residential areas.  Under Mayor  Coyne's  direction,  Brooklyn has instituted a number of  services which are not only unique in  Ohio, but in the United States as well.  The Coyne administration plows snow  from streets and from sidewalks. Eligi ble senior citizens who enlist in the  program  can  have  their  driveways  cleared of snow courtesy of the city.  Those same seniors are eligible  to  have  their  lawns mowed  in  the  summer.  The efficiency with which the city is  operated is a tribute to my good friend  of  long  standing, Mayor  John M.  Coyne.  Besides  the  housekeeping  chores  that leave the streets clean enough to  eat off of, Mayor Coyne is well aware  that the future of our country and our  cities rests with the youths of today,  our adults of tomorrow.  To cater to young people, Coyne had  a $2.5 millon recreation center built in  1975. Brooklyn's skating  rink  is  a  model  for other Greater Cleveland  communities.  Despite  all  these  fine  amenities,  Brooklyn is on extremely solid footing  financially. That is not surprising in  view of the fact that Coyne schooled  himself on municipal finances when  he served as village treasurer in 1939  and 1940.  Business and industry now provide  about 75 percent of Brooklyn's tax  base. The city's real estate tax rate  and city income rate are among the  lowest in Cuyahoga County.  When the people of Brooklyn tum  out on election day,  they repay the  good mayor for his fine work. He regu larly swamps his mayoral opponent at  the polls, if he has any opposition.  Just recently John Coyne took on a  large undertaking. He was elected as  chairman of  the Cuyahoga County  25019  Democratic Party. The  strife-ridden  party has outnumbered its Republican  counterpart by about 3 to 1, but has  lost control of Cleveland City Hall and  the county administration building in  the past decade.  Coyne's new calling will have him  trying to bring together the divergent  views of  the Democratic Party and  weld them into a workable majority. It  is quite a challenge even for a person  of Coyne's stature.  Here's one vote that says he will be  successful in this endeavor, too.e  RULE 4 OF THE FEDERAL RULES  OF CIVIL PROCEDURE  HON. DON EDWARDS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 23, 1982  e ",1982
374,,97,-0.599,1203,18,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr.  Speaker, rule 4 of the Federal Rules of  Civil  Procedure  governs  service  of  process  in Federal civil  actions.  In  April of this year, the Supreme Court  promulgated certain changes in rule 4.  Those changes were  to have  taken  effect on August 1, 1982, but legisla tion that I  introduced, together with  my  colleague  from  Illinois,  Mr.  McCLORY, was enacted into  law and  delayed  the  effective  date  of  the  changes until August 1, 1983 <Public  Law 97-227>.  The changes proposed by  the Su preme Court were intended to relieve  the marshals of the burden of serving  summonses and complaints in private  civil actions. Unfortunately, the pro posals did not accomplish that goal; in  addition, the Court created a  flawed  type of mail service and deleted a pro vision in current rule 4 that permits  service of summonses and complaints  on certain defendants pursuant to the  law of the State in which the action is  filed.  Since the passage of Public Law 97227, consultations have been held with  representatives of the Judicial Confer ence <whose  advisory committee on  civil rules did the actual drafting of  changes promulgated by the Supreme  Court), the Department of Justice and  others who had raised objections  to  the changes proposed by the Supreme  Court.  On  September  I  introduced,  again with Mr. McCLORY, a bill that  accomplishes the objective of reducing  the role of marshals and establishes a  mail system based on a method used  successfully  in California  for more  than 10 years <H.R. 7154).  Although the Court's proposed lan guage ostensibly permitted marshals  to serve summonses and complaints  only in specific, limited situations, it  created a  loophole  that would have  swallowed the limitations. It required  21,  marshals  to serve process where ex",1982
375,Senate,97,0.213,1333,18,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President,  I  would like to express my support for  the committee amendment to S. 2879.  This amendment will insure the cre ation of .a competitive instrument for  our financial institutions.  South Dakota bankers have led the  fight for creation of this instrument.  They have unsuccessfully petitioned  the DIDC and will soon file suit in  Federal court to allow them to offer  super NOW accounts.  I  share  their  concern over the flow of dollars out of  South Dakota  into money market  funds in the East.  These accounts will serve two impor tant purposes. First,  they will keep  money  in South Dakota where it is  badly needed for  investment  in our  local communities. Second,  they will  provide savers with a high yield of  return while protection their invest ment. It is more important than ever  in these difficult economic  times  to  provide savers with this kind of option  provided by insured institutions.  I know that the South Dakota bank ers have been very frustrated with the  lack of action by the DIDC in allowing  the implementation of these accounts.  They feel, and I believe  justly, that  the DIDC has ignored its legislative  mandate. The language in the commit tee  amendments will  send  a  clear  signal to the DIDC that they must fi nally  take  action. Banks  in South  Dakota will be able  to offer  their  super NOW accounts within 60 days of  enactment and they will be spared a  costly court battle with the Federal  Government.  I want to commend Senator GARN  and other members of  the Senate  Banking Committee on address'ing this  very important issue, and I urge my  colleagues  to  support  the Banking  Committee amendment.e  ",1982
376,,97,-0.095,48,22,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of the State Justice Institute  Act,  an amendment  to S.  2411. As  original sponsor of this bill, I encourage  this amendment's  incorporation  into the Justice Assistance Act of 1982.  This amendment will establish the  State Justice Institute as a nonprofit  corporation to provide  technical and  financial assistance to further the de velopment and adoption of  improve ments in the administration of justice  in State and local courts throughout  the United States.  This concept has passed the Senate  previously in the 96th and 97th Con gresses. The purpose and objectives of  the State Justice Institute is consist ent and complements the goals of S.  2411.  I wish to thank my colleagues, espe cially Chairman  STROM  THURMOND,  Senator  JOSEPH  BIDEN.  Chairman  ROBERT DOLE,  and Chairman ARLEN  SPECTER,  for  their continued support  and able assistance on this most im portant legislation.  There are several important reasons  for the implementation of the State  Justice Institute.  First, the role of the judge is gener ally accepted to be changing. Earlier  in this century there was much debate  as  to whether a  judge's function  in cluded an obligation to see that cases  in thejr courts moved toward disposi tion in a regular and efficient manner.  Today, however, problems of adminis tration have taken their place along side problems of adjudication as pri mary responsibilities of judges. Nearly  everyone has  come  to  acknowledge  that  today's judges have a duty  to  insure that their cases do not simply  languish on  the docket, but  instead  are moved  to a  conclusion with as  much dispatch and economy of time  and effort as possible. This shift, along  with a heightened interest in continu ing legal education generally, has re sulted in thousands of judges attend ing intensive orientations or refresher  courses offered by such organizations  as the National Judicial College and  the American Academy  of  Judicial  Education.  A second reason for providing finan cial assistance the State courts is the  problem of crime in this country. It  has long been my belief that if we are  to significantly reduce crime, the Fed eral Government must share the re sponsibility of improving the adminis tration of justice with State and local  governments. The State Justice Insti tute would be immensely beneficial to  State and local governments in their  attempts to control crime and in their  efforts to streamline the administra tion of  justice once a criminal has  been apprehended.  Third, State courts share with the  Federal courts the awesome responsi bility  of  enforcing  the  rights  and  duties of the Constitution and laws of  the United States. However, in recent  years the workload of our State courts  has significantly  increased due  to a  number of factors, including decisions  of  the U.S.  Supreme Court, wide reaching  social  legislation  by Con gress, and a diversion of cases from  the Federal courts. Testimony before  the Subcommittee on Jurisprudence  and Governmental Relations of  the  Senate Judiciary Committee revealed  that State courts decide approximate ly 95 percent of all law suits tried.  It is, therefore, appropriate and nec essary that the Federal Government  provide financial and technical assist ance to State courts to help alleviate  many of the administrative problems  which  these actions at  the Federal  level have caused and aggravated. This  legislation would help insure that our  State courts remain strong and effec tive.  The Institute would provide funds to  State courts and national organiza tions which support or are supported  by State courts for research and devel opment  programs  that would  be  beyond the resources of any single ju dicial system.  The  Institute would  not  provide  funds for hardware, nor for ongoing  State court operations, but would spot light correcting problems and short comings of State judiciaries and pro vide national resources to assist in cor recting them.  The Institute may also provide funds  for  research,  demonstration,  educa tion,  training,  technical  assistance,  clearinghouse  and  evaluating  pro grams. The establishment of the State  Justice Institute to provide financial  assistance to the State courts does not  remove  primary  responsibility  for  maintenance  and  improvement  of  State courts  from  the States  them selves.  The State Justice Institute will be  supervised by an independent Board of  Directors consisting primarily of rep resentatives of State court judiciaries  to insure clear congressional recogni tion of the separation of powers prin ciple in the function of State govern ments and the constitutional require ment  of  an  independent  judiciary  which is essential for any program of  Federal assistance.  The concept of a State Justice Insti tute has been endorsed by such orga nizations as the Conference of Chief  Justices, the Appellate Judges Confer ence, and the American Bar Associa tion.  Mr. President, as a former State su preme court chief justice, I know full  well the importance of an independent  judiciary. I could not support legisla tion which infringes on that independ ence in any way.  It is quite apparent then that the  quality of  justice  in  this country  is  largely determined by the quality of  justice dispensed by State courts. We  in the Congress should thus be keenly  aware of the substantial Federal inter est involved in maintaining the quality  ",1982
377,House,97,-0.478,152,22,Mr. SCHEUER.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to raise  an issue of great concern, I know, to  every single Member of this House and  virtually every American.  I wish to ask my colleague, the gen tleman  from  Iowa,  some  questions  about an extraordinary incident in the  life of our country that I think will be  of concern to every single Member of  this House and virtually every Ameri can.  On November 4, 1979, 78 Americans  in Teheran, Iran, were seized or forced  into protective refuge, and 52 of them  were held imprisoned in the most de grading,  inhuman, uncivilized condi tions for 444 long days. We watched,  the American public and the Members  of this body, traumatized, shocked, in  horror and  anxiety,  day  after day  during this agonizing period.  Yet throughout this period and at  the end of this period, these 52 Ameri cans  emerged  from  this  incredibly  cruel and unusual punishment with  their spirits, their souls, their psyches  and their bodies,  for  the most part,  intact; certainly with their dignity and  their courage intact.  We were proud of every one of them.  They did us proud.  Now it is over 3 years since that inci dent, that harrowing incident that cut  through the heart and spirit of Amer ica and,  in a sense, unified us as we  have rarely been unified.  This Congress has failed to act. We  have done  little or nothing  that  I  know about to recognize the extraordi nary conduct of those 58 outstanding ly fine Foreign Service officers. Now,  Mr. Chairman, under the War Claims  Act of 1948, we are offered a precedent  which was  utilized  for veterans of  World War II, Korea, and the Vietnam  war for payment of token sums as, and  I quote, ""a symbolic gesture on the  part of the United States expressing  recognition of the hardships suffered  by the beneficiaries.""  D 1910  It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that  after more than 3 years the time has  come for us to act, and to act decisive ly-decisively and fairly-in. this issue  and  to  recognize  the extraordinary  courage and dedication and character  with which this remarkable group of  American  Foreign  Service  officers  upheld the honor and dignity of our  country and our flag.  Can I ask the gentleman from Iowa  what prospects  there  are  that  the  House and the Senate will act now,  after 3 years, with reasonable speed  and diligence in providing the grateful  recognition of a country that admires  these men and women?  ",1982
378,House,97,-0.056,165,22,Mr. LEVITAS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from Michigan  for  yielding time to me.  I want to say there is really only one  reason to vote for this bill, and that is  an act of symbolism-for the reasons  the gentleman from Michigan so ably  stated in his opening remarks. Sym bols are important, and it is for that  reason that I am inclined to support  the final passage of this bill.  Certainly, we can all agree that the  United States is not the only country  with an obligation to engage in fair,  open  trade practices. The Japanese  and others must recognize  their re sponsibility  as well.  This  bill  can  surely send a message to our trading  partners  throughout  the world  that  the time has come for them to change,  that we are not going to be the only  patsies in the world when it comes to  fair trade. Clearly, we are capable of  enacting protectionist policies of our  own.  This bill can also send a second im portant message-a message to our Na tion's millions of unemployed workers,  particularly  those  in  the automobile  industry. Congress must assure these  individuals that we hear their cries for  help,  that we care about  them and  their future welfare, that we intend to  enact legislation to put them back to  work, to get America moving again.  Although I am not convinced that  this legislation is the best way to ad dress these problems, there are good,  symbolic reasons for passing this bill reasons  that merit my  support  for  final passage.  But do not kid yourselves, the rea sons are only symbolic. This bill is not  going to pass into law. And I think it is  a  travesty of the procedures of this  House that we are going to waste an  entire  legislative day  in  the closing  days of this session on a bill that is not  going anywhere.  The time has come for us to put our  priorities on what  is  achievable.  seems to me that our attention should  be focused on legislation that has al ready passed  the other body and  is  awaiting action here. I especially refer  to  the  regulatory  reform  bill,  the  bankruptcy act, and the immigration  refo.Lm bill. They say we may not get  around to these bills because of sched uling constraints.  This is a travesty of the procedures  of this House. And it is because of this  perversion of our scheduling priorities  that I intend to vote against the rule.  Let my vote against the rule also serve  as a symbol-a symbol of my disdain  for  the scheduling priorities of  this  legislative body.  Someone made a bad political mis take by taking up an entire legislative  day in consideration of this legislation.  It  As one Member of this House, I resent  that priority assessment.  ",1982

KEN,  who has served his country, State, and  district for 8 years with great dedica tion, I am sorry to say will be retiring  from the Congress at the end of this  session.  KEN HOLLAND  is a man who speaks  his mind, honestly, and frankly. As a  member of the Ways and Means Com mittee, he has pulled no punches in  his efforts in support of the industry  which is so important to his Fifth Dis trict of South Carolina-the textile in dustry. He has fought unfair competi tion from foreign producers from his  position on the Trade Subcommittee,  and  has  further  championed  this  cause as chairman of the Congression al Textile Caucus.  On an issue that takes even greater  courage, KEN HOLLAND has made it a  point  to explain  the financial hard ships of being a Member of Congress.  KEN  HOLLAND  will  certainly  be  missed by his colleagues in this House,  and will be missed by the people he  has represented since 1974. His career  here has been unfortunately  short,  but it has certainly been one of accom plishment and I wish him the very  best in his future endeavors.

381,House,97,-0.265,191,22,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, with  the retirement of KEN HOLLAND we will  be losing one of the true leaders of  Congress.  KEN has always been in  the fore front of helping to solve the difficult  problems facing Congress. During the  1981-82 tax-cut debate, KEN's leader ship and skills were essential in find ing a reasonable solution that main tained the overall fiscal  integrity of  the Nation.  KEN has been an eloquent spokes man for South Carolina and a dedicat ed member of the Ways and Means  Committee. He has never avoided the  tough issues; he has always been will ing to work for what was best for the  Nation.  His retirement takes away from Con gress one of its outstanding Members.

The injustice  about which I speak was the suffering  December 9, 1982  six years will necessarily be used in the in terests of the United States.  India is dubious about the sale of 40 F16s  equipped with  electronic  countermeasure  equipment, although Zia recently stopped in  for lunch and a little stroking session with  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.  Some senators want to ask him specifical ly about the case of Irshad Rao. editor of a  pro-Bhutto newspaper. who has been in jail  and maltreated for almost  two years  for  ""printing  objectional  literature.  creating  unrest among the masses and disaffection  with the armed forces.""  Zia's transgressions were overlooked even  by the pro-human rights Carter administra tion when the Soviets marched into Afghan istan two years ago. The visit to the Reagan  White House gives him full ""allied status"" which to Hatfield shows that ""we are pre pared to abandon everything to our consum ing and myopic anti-Sovietism.""  Zia can play  the communist card with  Reagan. He attended Leonid Brezhnev's fu neral and met with Yuri Andropov. Paki stan is a member of a U.N. commission on  Afghanistan. Reagan could urge him to help  find a solution through a face-saving Soviet  exit.  But perhaps the best thing Reagan and  Zia could do  is  to watch the new British  film, ""Gandhi,""  together. It is a work of  dumbfounding excellence.  Reagan. who consorts with bullies and  views military action a::. the only way to stop  ""international terrorism,"" his term for com munism, would greatly benefit from watch ing  the uses of non-violence. It would do  him good, in the light of his Latin American  policies. to hear Gandhi saying that people  would  rather have a bad government of  their own than a good government imposed  by an alien power.  As for Gen. Zia, who. like his soul brother,  Gen. Rios Montt. believes that political ac tivity is murder. he needs all the instruction  he can get in the art of benevolent leader ship.  Sir Richard Attenborough,  the producer  and  director,  could  doubtless  arrange  a  screening of ""Gandhi"" for the pair.

383,,97,-0.265,334,22,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  submit an article which I cannot em belish with any added comments:  HAPPY 70TH, MR. SPEAKER, You'vE ALWAYS  BEEN TRUE  <By David Nyhan>  Not  the  least  reason  to marvel at Tip  O'Neill  is  the simple  fact  that he hasn't  made much money, when he's had vast op portunity to do so.  In 46 scandal-free years of winning elec tions, 30  in Congress, 6 as Speaker of the  House, he's proved almost totally inept at  padding his own income and salting some thing away on the side.  Politicians with far less potential for pelf  than he, have become millionaires on the  sly, but O'Neill's net worth is embarrassing ly meager. He's got about what a public  school teacher would have, if his kids were  grown and his wife worked. Not much, but  something.  His wealth is in coin of a different realm.  He is much loved by those who know him.  When he threw a party for his campaign  workers, what was astonishing about  the  crowd in the old Cambridge Hotel was that  so many were of his generation. The man,  whose highest accolade is ""Old Pal,"" kept  the friends he began with.  When Tip got up in front of the band, sin gled out his Millie, and knocked out a better  than passable rendition of ""Apple Blossom  Time,"" you couldn't picture any New Wave  Democrats doing likewise.  O'Neill is a living political monument for  a lot of reasons, but some of them are: He's  kept the same wife, the same friends, the  same  lifestyle,  the same values and  the  same philosophy he began with in the Thir ties.  His mother died of TB before he was a  year old, and he was raised by a father who  was a city councilor and superintendent of  sewers in Cambridge. ""He taught me loyal ty,"" O'Neill said years ago, ""to live a good,  ethical, honest life, that I'm truly my broth er's keeper; and to always remember from  where I came.""  In a  lifetime of political horse  trading,  O'Neill could be accused of many  things,  but none can say he forgot his roots. The  Irish yield to no one when it comes to bad mouthing  a  social  climber.  Those who  moved out of the three-deckers risked being  labeled  ""two-toilet  Irish,""  ""lace  curtain  Irish,"" and most spiteful of all, ""cut-glass  Irish.""  O'Neill never went high-hli.t, either in life style or in his politics. The hardest thing  he's said of Ronald Reagan was that the  President had forgotten where he'd come  from,  the Depression-era poverty of work ing-class Illinois, where most people needed  a government handout to get by.  When Reagan blew into Washington, scat tering demoralized Democrats  like  fallen  leaves, the middle class was beguiled by the  sonorous  siren song of  tax cuts. O'Neill  warned it would be open season on the poor.  ""People seem to hate the poor, that's the  kind of thing that got us into deep trouble  in the 1930s.  The O'Neill losses of 1981 have become  the O'Neill victories of 1982, and the incomEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ing Congress will line up much more behind  the Speaker than the President, a fact that  bodes well for the 12 million unemployed.  The right wing still hates Tip O'Neill and  all he stands  for. They see him as  the  symbol  of  the bloated  government that  forces some redistribution of wealth in this  country, a process Reagan has managed to  reverse.  There is not a man alive today who has  done more good for more people, in trying  to impose a semblance of fairness and shar ing the wealth on Congress, than this man  who turns 70 today.  A pillar of his party, a model to his profes sion, he's a testament to the best the Irish  brought to this country's politics.  James Michael Curley taught him to give  the crowd some words to remember. John F.  Kennedy taught him that when it comes to  raising dough, running for President was no  different than running for alderman. And it  is an old Irish legend that teaches us the  central fact of democratic congressional rule  today. ""Where the O'Neill sits, that is the  head of the table.""

384,,97,-0.387,334,22,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to  a  fell ow  Member and friend, BOB MOLLOHAN,  with whom I have had the privilege of  serving in the Congress during the last  two decades.  The  job  of  a  Congressman,  a  Member of the House of Representa tives,  is multifaceted, and an individ ual who devotes himself to this body,  as BoB MOLLOHAN has done, carves his  own special niche.  Some are called to be experts, others  leaders, and still others tireless work ers. Although BoB MOLLOHAN served in  each of these capacities, it was on a  few visits to Parkersburg, W. Va., that  I came to know and appreciate his spe cial  niche-an  unflagging  interest,  sense of duty and service, on a very  personal level, to the people he repre sents. To farmers, coal miners, steel  workers, business people, and others,  he has demonstrated his personal con cern and considerable accomplishment  in solving their problems. And his ef forts have earned him  their respect  and affection.  BOB MoLLOHAN's achievements in the  Congress are notable. He devoted him self to building a sound and solid na tional defense,  ably  serving on  the  Armed Services Committee  through out his 18 years in the House.  BOB MOLLOHAN was  the author of  the Emergency Medical Services Sys tems Act, putting  into place a  life saving plan for  improved emergency  health care for our Nation's communi ties.  December 9, 1982  As a member of the Congressional  Steel Caucus and  the congressional  coal group, BoB MOLLOHAN worked ac tively to promote American industry,  especially the welfare of workers.  He  executed  skillfullyand  often  without adequate  thankshis  job as  chairman of  the House Operations  Subcommittee  on  Office  Systems,  making all our  jobs and our lives a  little easier and more effective.  When he leaves this body, BoB MOL LOHAN will return to his friends and  his family  in ""wild, wonderful West  Virginia."" Down the road, we may find  him  overseeing  one  of  his  farms,  streamlining his own business of fices  for a change, and most likely traveling  as a private citizen or as a  former  Member of the House of Representa tives.  I know that whatever his pur suits, he will continue  to serve  the  democratic  process with  the  same  dedication and skill that he has exhib ited in his years of service in this body.  BoB can be proud, and we are fortu nate, indeed, that his son, Alan Mollo han, won election this year  in West  Virginia's First Congressional District.  I had the pleasure of getting to know  the younger Mollohan, and  I know  that he will  carry  on his  father's  record of service and make his own dis tinguished mark as a Congressman.  BOB MOLLOHAN will be missed-by  his constituents and by his colleagues  here-whom he has  served so well.  Most of all, he will be missed as a  friend. I hope we will not forget those  with whom he has served.

389,,97,-0.024,542,22,Mrs. BYRON.," Mr. Speaker, I urge  you to join Representative HOLT, Rep resentative DYSON, and me in support ing and cosponsoring H.R. 7358,  the  Natural Gas Marketing Act of 1982.  This bill addresses our growing con cern with the dramatic increase in the  price of natural gas going into effect  this winter. The average increase for  residents of Maryland alone is 30 per cent. But as you are aware, this is not  just a regional problem. It is one that  is confronting each of us from coast to  coast.  What we find is that the combina tion of the supply incentives of the  Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and  the structural  insulation of  the gas  producer and  transmission company  from  the marketing of natural gas  have prevented appropriate signals for  price reductions for natural gas costs.  On the heels of the gas shortages of  the 1970's, the transmission companies  raced to the producers and agreed to  sign what now are overly generous  contracts in order to be assured of ade quate  supplies  in  the  future. The  transmission  companies,  fearing  a  return of  their  shortage problexns,  agreed with the producers to include a  clause known as ""take or pay"" in their  purchase  contracts.  These  clauses  merely state that the pipeline is obli gated to pay for a set volume of gas, at  a set price, over the life of the con tract without regard to the fact that  conservation  and  supply  surpluses  would dramatically alter their ability  to sell the gas at any price.  It is for this reason that we intro duce H.R. 7358, the Natural Gas Mar keting Act of 1982. This bill does not  interfere with the supply incentives in  the NGPA, stands alongside the Natu ral Gas Act of 1938, and is designed to  make the natural gas industry market  sensitive from the ""burner tip of the  wellhead.""  The bill accomplishes this through  two approaches. First, the bill allows  from a distribution company or the  State public utility commission to peti tion the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission <FERC>  certifying  that  the proposed rates of the transmission  company  are not  competitive with  available and useable alternative fuels  within the service territory. Upon this  certification, FERC  is mandated  to  suspend the proposed rate increase for  a period of up to 6 months. During  this period, the transmission company  bears the burden of proof to show that  the proposed  rates  are  competitive  with alternative fuels. If FERC finds  the rates are competitive, it is author ized to approve the rates.  Second, if FERC finds that the pro posed rate is not competitive with al ternative  fuels,  it  is mandated  to  adjust the rate to make it competitive.  Once FERC makes  this adjustment,  the transmission company is automati cally given the right to presume that  these contracts, and Just the noncom petitive contracts, contain a ""market  out"" provision. This provision, when  exercised, gives  to  the  transmission  pipeline an opportunity to renegotiate  the gas purchase contract<s> if, in the  sole opinion of the transmission com pany, the gas is not marketable in its  service territory.  Through this legislation we have ac complished two goals: First, we have  assured  the ultimate  consumers of  natural gas that their rates will be the  lowest possible. Second, with addition al responsibilities to insure natural gas  price competitiveness, pipelines will be  certain to negotiate with the produc ers  in  their own  interests. A clear  signal will reach the producer that the  consumers will not pay  the prices  being  charged. With dwindling  de mands, the producers will react by re ducing the price on their reserves in  order  to protect  their share of  the  energy consuming market.  I urge my colleagues  to carefully  consider the contents of the Natural  Gas Marketing Act of 1982 and join  Mrs. HOLT, Mr. DYSON, and me in this  effort to protect the residential natu ral gas users.  For the benefit of my colleagues, I  am including the bill and a section-by section analysis at this time.  THE NATURAL OAS MARKETING ACT OF 1982, A  SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS  H.R. 7358, the Natural Oas Marketing Act  of 1982, would revise  the procedures and  standards by which  the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission <FERC>  approves  rate increases sought to be charged by inter state natural gas pipelines. Its purposes are:  < 1>  to assure that the views of the pipe line's wholesale customers with regard  to  the impact of the proposed rate increase on  their ability to resell the gas at retail re ceive a full and fair hearing;  (2)  to establish a minimum standard of  conduct  for pipelines  seeking a  rate  in crease, under which pipelines are held re sponsible to manage their gas acquisition  practices and gas purchase contracts with a  view to maintaining their gas prices at levels  competitive with alternate fuels; and  <3>  to assure that any pipeline rate  in crease ultimately approved by FERC will  not be inconsistent with the marketability  of that gas at retail in competition with al ternate fuels.  The bill is titled the Natural Oas Market ing Act of 1982.  Section 2 of the bill establishes procedures  and legal standards to govern FERC consid eration of pipeline rate increase filings. Sec tion 2<a> sets forth the event that will trig ger the procedures described in the remain ing paragraphs of Section 2. That ""trigger""  is the filing by a local distribution company  or  the public utility commission of any  state, including the District of Columbia, of  a complaint pursuant to section 4<e> of the  Natural Oas Act alleging that a rate pro posed to be charged by a pipeline is not Just  and reasonable, and certifying under oath  that such proposed  rate,  taken  together  with  any  prevailing  lawfully  imposed  charges for the retail delivery of such gas,  results in a retail price for natural gas that  is in excess of the per MMBtu equivalent  price of a competing fuel currently available  to and useable by existing retail customers  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor.

390,,97,-0.339,555,22,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to  bring  to  the  attention of my  col leagues the second installment of rec ommendations  for  social  security  reform put forth by the Community  Council of Greater New York's Ad Hoc  Committee  on Social Security. On  Monday, I placed the first installment  of these proposals into the CONGRES SIONAL RECORD which I hope will pro vide some insight for Members as we  grapple with the question of social se curity.  I also wish to hail the efforts of the  Community Council  in putting  this  report  together.  The  Community  Council  is an umbrella organization  which represents a number of human  service organizations for New Yorkers  of all ages. The Council has a vested  interest in this issue because it serves  not only current social security benefi ciaries but future ones as well. It is a  thought-provoking report and I com mend it to your attention.  AN APPROACH TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY  SYSTEM: CONFIDENCE NOT CRISIS, PART II  c. Age of retirement.-No increase should  be made in the retirement age for full bene fits and there should be no reduction in the  present benefits for early retirement.  Studies have  found no  relationship be tween  longevity and  the ability  to work  longer periods of time.  It has been suggested that providing in centives to employers and employees is an  alternative approach to encourage persons  to work longer.  Persons who continue working after age  65 could cease making contributions to the  Social Security Fund. Employers would con tinue to contribute their share but continue  to receive a tax credit.  Since persons who work  longer have a  shorter period of retirement,  their Social  Security pensions could be correspondingly  increased. At the present time this increase  is 3 percent. In actuarial terms, this could  be raised to approximately 7 percent.  d. Reinstitution of minimum benefits. Persons at age 65, at least who have not  paid into the System enough funds to qual ify for $122 per month of retirement bene fits should again be provided with a mini mum benefit of that amount. This should  not entail a means-test.  Persons who became eligible for minimum  benefits after January 1982, should receive  the $122 minimum.  The group that should be covered is usual ly composed of: women who spent many  working years  at home not covered by  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Social Security; farmers, members of minor ity groups or persons with problems of ill ness.  Many of  these persons, <e.g.  domestic  workers or farmers>, were only permitted to  enter the System fairly recently, and could  not amass enough equity to qualify for ade quate benefits. These people warrant special  economic protection.  PRESERVING CONFIDENCE IN THE SOCIAL SECURI TY SYSTEM RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMJllEDI  ATE ACTION  1. Educational campaign  There is an immediate need for a factual,  educational and highly visable campaign by  government and the private sector to reas sure retirees and working people that Social  Security  is sound and  is  the ""best buy""  available for Retirement, Survivors, Disabil ity and Health Insurance <Medicare>.  This ongoing campaign should include use  of the media, flyers, explanatory brochures,  factual  presentations. The  effort  should  begin with  the  educational  system,  and  extend  to  our  entire  society,  including  unions, employer groups, community orga nizations and others.  The campaign would explain that a siza ble percentage of beneficiaries <49 percent>  are not retired workers. They receive bene fits as dependents or Disability or Survivors  benefits. <See Community Council Research  Note No. 47, September, 1982.)  The campaign should also indicate the in dependent relationship between Social Se curity and private retirement benefits.  2. ""Welcome to social security"" letter  Every  new  Social  Security  registrant  should receive a letter accompanying his or  her Social Security card in which he or she  is welcomed to the System, advised of its  comprehensive coverage, including the vari ous payments available, and told of its im portance.  3. First steps toward periodic reporting  All participants should be assured  that  their covered earnings are appropriately  credited to their account.  To this end:  a. All available means should be developed  and utilized  to encourage Social Security  participants  to  request, on some periodic  basis, an update on their accounts. <Note:  presently only two million requests are re ceived each year out of almost 200 million  accounts extant.>  b. Priority should be given by the Social  Security Administration to the updating of  equipment and systems so that wage credits  are posted more promptly to participants'  accounts.  4. Social Security Advtsory Council  The Social  Security Advisory Council  should be appointed by the President of the  United States, instead of by the Secretary  of Health & Human Services.  Its report  should be sent to the President as well as to  the Speaker of the House, the President of  the Senate and to the Trustees of Social Se curity. This body should be convened by the  President more frequently than every four  years, if he or Congress deems this to be  necessary.  It should be bi-partisan. The  composition of the Advisory Council should  remain intact: a Chair, equal number of rep resentatives of the self-employed and the  public.  LONG TERM RECOJDIENDATIONS FOR FUTURE  STUDY AND ACTION  The social and the economic impacts of  any  long-term changes  in Social Security  must be carefully studied and not acted  30097  upon until the end of  this century. This  would provide sufficient time to fully con sider the impact of all options.  Social Security is an integral part of the  overall economy. Both the benefits paid out  and revenues collected by the System have a  direct effect on consumer spending and the  Gross National Product. Changes  in  the  System would influence the well-being of in dividual recipients as well as many of our  major  social  and  economic  institutions.  Public service programs and private pension  plans in particular would be affected.  No proposal should increase the number  of persons below the poverty line. Projected  changes  should be based on  a  realistic  standard, e.g.  the Replacement Rate, the  Poverty Index or the Bureau of Labor Sta tistics Lower Living Standard.1  1. The  following  recommendations  suggested for study:  are  a. Include the employer's share in an indi vidual's taxable income at the  time social  security benefits are received.--Social Secu rity benefits  for  those whose  income  is  below the median level, including Social Se curity benefits, should not be taxed.  The employer's share of an individual's  Social Security benefit <1/2 of the benefit  level> should be subject to income tax at the  time benefits are received. Revenues gener ated by this tax should be credited to the  Social Security Trust Funds. This provision  should be phased in. Also included in ~­ able income should be any portion of the  Social Security benefit that resulted from  an employee's payroll  taxes on which an  income tax credit had been received.  b. Study required of medicare financing. While emphasis is centered here on financ ing of health care for the aging, the entire  matter of planning  for health care  for  young and old must be studied.  Continued increases in health care costs  will pose major financing problems for the  Medicare  program  in  the  near  future.  Action needs to be taken to ensure the on going stability of this Program which is es sential to the health of older Americans.  Medicare now covers only about 44 per cent of the health care expenses of older  people. Solutions which entail reductions in  Medicare benefits would merely  shift a  greater burden of health care cost onto the  elderly.  Unlike retirement benefits, the amount of  Medicare benefits received by a recipient is  not related to past earnings.  In planning for the future of Medicare, it  has been suggested that the financing be  shifted  to General Revenues. A  visible  income tax surcharge dedicated to Medicare  could be enacted to pay for this. The payroll  tax revenues freed up by this change should  be used to support the OASDI Trust Funds.  Special concern  is expressed about  the  impact on medical coverage of any post ponement of  retirement benefits. At  the  present time, Medicare benefits have been  coupled with eligibility for retirement bene fits. Persons above the age of 65 are in spe cial need of adequate health insurance.  c. Study needed of the  tween  retirement  benefits  relationship be and dtsability  benefits.-Persons laid off work after age 50  or 55 because of health reasons, who do not  qualify for Disability benefits, and whose  unemployment benefits run out, may have  to lose all of their savings until such time as  1 The Bureau of Labor Statistics standards are no  longer being updated by the government.

395,House,97,-0.458,880,22,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday  I  introduced a  resolution <H.J. Res.  632) which is intended to bring relief  to natural gas customers around the  country who  are  facing  severe  in creases  in  their bills. Already  this  year, in my area in California, the bills  of gas consumers have increased over  50 percent from a year ago and they  are expected  to  rise  further during  this winter by another 50 percent.  With a surplus of natural gas and  with the price of oil on the decline, in creases of this magnitude are unneces sary and do not reflect  true market  conditions.  These  price  increases  have  come  about largely because of the wellhead  pricing provisions of the Natural Gas  Policy Act and  the practices of  the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commis sion which allow  interstate pipeline  companies to average in the price of  high cost gas in the supplies sold to  local  distribution  companies  even  though a sufficient quantity of  low  cost gas is available.  If distribution companies were given  the discretion  to purchase high cost  gas only when the market required,  they would be able to prevent these in ordinate increases from taking place.  What is needed is a regulatory mecha nism to provide this discretion. My res olution would  direct  the  Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission to ad dress this concern by initiating a rule making proceeding regarding pipeline  rate design. This proceeding would  consider the service agreements which  currently obligate distribution compa nies to purchase unnecessary quanti ties of high cost gas and the relation ship between pipeline companies and  local distributors.  This resolution does not attempt to  change any of the pricing provisions in  the Natural Gas Policy Act. Instead, it  is intended to bring about and facili tate the operation of a freer market in  the sale and purchase of gas at the  wellhead, in the pipeline, and at the  consumer burner  tip.  I urge you  to  study this resolution and join in sup port of it.  PROVIDING  FOR  CONSIDERATION OF HOUSE JOINT RESO LUTION  631,  FURTHER  CON TINUING  APPROPRIATIONS,  1983  ",1982
396,House,97,0.496,893,22,Mr. ARCHER., I am happy to yield  to the gentleman from Texas.  ,1982
397,House,97,0.017,932,22,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Chair man, I especially want to thank the  very able and distinguished chairman  of  the Subcommittee on HUD-Inde pendent Agencies, Mr. BOLAND, for his  leadership  in helping  to  resolve  the  automated data processing issue at the  Veterans' Administration. For several  years now the Veterans' Administra tion has been unable to make any deci sion as to the kind of computer system  that should be installed in the Veter ans' Administration hospital system.  The language contained in the reso lution being considered  is consistent  with my position and the position of  other members of the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs relating  to Depart ment of Medicine and Surgery com puter capabilities.  The  long history of providing  the  VA hospital system with clinical com puter capabilities has been  fraught  with planning difficulties,  imprecise  cost  projections,  overly  optimistic  schedules,  and management  indeci sion. During  this  regrettable period,  the Congress has expressed concern  that this lack of automated data proc essing service  in the Department of  Medicine and Surgery has adversely  impacted on the quality of health care  delivered in VA hospitals.  Many of us in the House were very  pleased when Mr. Robert P. Nimmo  issued his executive order of February  18, 1982, providing new direction  in  use and control of computers and ADP  technology in the Department of Med icine and Surgery with a policy of de centralization which places  the em phasis on quality of health care rather  than gathering data. When the House  and Senate Veterans' Affairs Commit tees were briefed on his directive we  were told that maximum effort would  be exerted in implementing decentrali zation and that there would be no fur ther development or expansion of the  old centralized ADP program, Apples.  We were also told that equipment and  other sources intended for the expan sion of Apples would be reprogramed  to  support  the  new  decentralized  policy.  We were later amazed to learn that  the Administrator's earlier executive  order had been reversed and that a  subsequent decision was made  to go  back to the original plan for a central ized system. Our committee  learned  that the expansion of certain Apples  <COMISS> sites was made unilaterally  by  the Office of Data Management  and Telecommunications.  Mr. Chairman  the Appropriations  Committee has taken the position con sistent with those of us on the Veter ans' Affairs Committee who support a  decentralized computer system for the  Department of Medicine and Surgery.  In a letter sent to the Administrator  on November 19 the ranking minority  member of our committee, the Honor able JOHN PAUL HAMMERSCHMIDT, and I  asked the Administrator not  to pro ceed with the centralized <COMISS>  system and  to begin  immediately  to  implement  the current decentralized  system developed by the Department  of Medicine and Surgery. At the same  time we did not suggest any limitation  on the Veterans' Administration to de velop options either through the pri vate sector or otherwise, where such  options could possibly enhance or im prove on  the decentralized MUMPS  system. Our position was simply that  until the Veterans' Administration has  a better system, it should begin imme diately  to  implement fully  the  inte grated MUMPS system. We feel  this  would be cost effective, but more im portantly, we feel the MUMPS system  is the only system currently available  that could be quickly  implemented.  VA hospitals must have computer ca pability  if we are to provide quality  care to veteran patients.  The overriding issue, Mr. Chairman,  is the quality of care to be provided to  veterans who  receive  their care and  treatment in VA medical centers. The  VA  is far behind the private sector,  and we must begin to catch up. We can  continue to conduct studies and imple ment pilot projects. That is not satis factory. There have been  too many  studies. Let us get on with getting the  job done. If the other body accepts the  language of  the House, we will see  major progress  in a short period of  time.  I compliment all members of the Ap propriations  Committee  who  have  joined in support of our efforts, and I  would urge the other body to do like wise. We  can no  longer  afford  to  wait-to  continue  to  haggle  about  what system should be provided. This  is  the best system available, and we  need to get on with it.e  ",1982
398,House,97,-0.368,932,22,Mr. LONG of Louisiana.," Mr. Chair man, I rise in support of House Joint  Resolution 631, to provide continuing  funding for a myriad of important pro grams which otherwise would be ter minated in the absence of their regu lar annual appropriations. I share the  concern of many of my colleagues that  ""government  by  continuing  resolu tion""  is not the way  to run the Nation's business. Nevertheless, we find  ourselves once again in the unfortu nate circumstances of making key de cisions on a vast range of Federal pro grams in the waning moments of the  congressional session.  As a Member of the House, I would  like  to commend our appropriations  chairman, Mr. WHITTEN,  for having  led us through passage of nearly all  appropriations measures for the cur rent fiscal year. And again,  I would  commend him for leading this effort  to keep the Government functioning  until the Senate can complete the ac tions for which it is responsible. It is  not an  easy  task. The urgency of  today's situation compels  a  stream lined procedure. Yet, the principle of  fairness demands the opportunity to  off er amendments or make changes in  our funding priorities over the next  few months. That delicate job of bal ancing the need for swift action with  the  legitimate need of Members  to  affect the pending legislation falls to  the Rules Committee.  Yesterday,  the Rules  Committee  identified  eight  amendments which  merit consideration by the full House  in its work on the continuing funding  measure. One of these amendments is  offered by a colleague of mine from  Louisiana, Congressman BILLY TAUZIN,  and I would like to take just a few mo ments to add my support for passage  of this effort. The amendment is nec essary to make sure that private sector  initiatives to help the elderly and the  poor  pay  high  fuel  bills  are  not  blocked by the actions of the Federal  Government. It is an amendment cru cial to the most vulnerable of our soci ety-people who are constantly walk ing an economic tightrope between the  choice of food or fuel.  The problem arose when Federal bu reaucrats  at  the  Department  of  Health and Human Services delivered  a strict ruling which states that a vol untary checkoff program for fuel as sistance, which is administered by the  utility companies must off set supple mental security income <SSI> benefits.  The effect is deadly. People  in need  simply will not take the heating assist ance  provided  by  this  voluntary  system for fear of losing their SSI ben efits. At a  time when reliance upon  private initiative and charitable giving  is so great, it would be regrettable to  allow  these efforts  to fall prey to a  misguided  Federal  interpretation.  I  strongly  urge  the  support  of  the  House for this measure, and I was de lighted  to be able  to work with my  friend from Louisiana in making sure  this amendment could be heard today.  In addition, I would like to call the  attention of other rural Members of  the House to the existence in this bill  of additional  funding  for watershed  and flood protection programs, and for  rural water and waste disposal systems  ",1982
399,House,97,-0.33,958,22,Mr. TRAXLER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  offer an amendment which has been  in order by the rule and duly printed  in the RECORD. It is amendment No. 1.

401,House,97,-0.374,971,22,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Chairman, The  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  <Mr.  COUGHLIN)  and  I  are offering  this  amendment today because the Clinch  River breeder reactor has become syn onymous with waste  in  the Federal  budget. It is, quite simply, the MX of  our Nation's energy policy.  The Clinch River breeder  reactor  has no economic or technical justifica tion. It is a horrendous subsidy to spe cial interests who have so little confi dence  in  the project  that  they will  only assume 3 percent of its cost. That  leaves the American taxpayer picking  up  the  tab  for  97  percent of  the  project's $8.5 billion total cost.  How can we, in good conscience, con tinue  this kind of wasteful expendi ture when 11 million Americans are  out of work, and we are asking Ameri cans everywhere to make tremendous  sacrifices? It is not fair. It is not right.  The Clinch River breeder reactor is  waste-pure and simple.  It deserves  the same fate on  the floor of  this  House that the MX missile received  last week.

403,House,97,0.238,984,22,Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska.," Mr. Chair man, I thank the gentleman from Ala bama for yielding me this time.  I oppose the amendment by the gen tleman  from Michigan.  I  speak on  behalf of the people of the Third Con gressional District of Nebraska with  respect  to the vital water-conserving  project in my district known as  the  O'Neill Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missou ri River Basin development program.  I am here because  the gentleman  from Michigan is offering an amend ment  that would deny a;iy  further  funding for this excellent, desperately  needed multipurpose reclamation proj ect.  This amendment would  inflict de structive mischief working against the  interests of both proponents and oppo nents of the O'Neill unit.  This is true because the O'Neill unit  and the question of its funding is in  litigation, with a trial being imminent  in the Federal District Court of Ne braska even as I address the House.  The issues in that trial are the very  ones that have been raised repeatedly  already in many hearings and in sever al debates here in the House and now  again in this debate.  The litigation of which I speak could  settle all these issues once and for all  if  the Judicial process  is allowed  to  proceed. But if the House again at tempts  to  legislate answers  to  these  issues,  the questions will  remain,  I  fear, simply because Congress has re peatedly examined, reexamined, reau thorized,  funded,  studied,  and  re studied again as it has repeatedly ap proved  this project for construction  every year since 1974.  In 1977, opponents of  the project,  having failed  to persuade either the  Congress or the executive branch of  the merits of their opposition, turned,  as they should, to the courts to seek  redress. And  that  is  exactly what  should  be  allowed  to  proceed  in  normal fashion to formal decision and  thence to appeal. In the meantime, a  court order prohibiting construction  remains  in  effect,  as  it has  since  March 4, 1977.  Therefore, I  implore my colleagues  to act responsible and wisely  in this  matter, to reject this unfair amend ment and any other improper and irre sponsible  legislative amendments  re lating to the O'Neill unit, and to help  me discourage any other restrictive or  limiting amendments relating to this  project. I am simply asking the House,  and later I will ask any other oppo nents, to let the Judiciary work its will  on this matter.  How wise a course this would be is  strikingly demonstrated by the litiga tion involving the Garrison project in  North Dakota. There, on May 6, 1981,  the court ruled,  in effect,  that con struction could not be resumed until  Congress reauthorized the project. On  November 20, 1981, the House refused  by an overwhelming vote of 317 to 67,  to overturn the court's ruling. And all  for  the best,  too. Subsequently, on  May 7, 1982, an appeals court reversed  the  lower court's demand  for  reau thorization, vindicating  the House's  position, preserving clear separation of  powers between legislative and Judicial  branches, and avoiding setting danger ous precedent in Judicial concrete.  In the lawsuit involving the O'Neill  unit, if the court rules adversely to the  project's  supporters,  the  project  almost certainly will face further con gressional action aimed at reauthoriza tion or be dropped from further con sideration. If the court rules for the  project, there will be ample time for  the gentleman from Michigan, Dela ware, and others to express themselves  in regular hearings on this project and  the 900 or more others whose funding  is considered and recommended annu ally by my Appropriations Subcommit tee on Energy and Water Develop ment.  In brief,  the main  issue being ad dressed in the lawsuit of major con cern to the Congress is whether Con gress must  reauthorize  the project  before construction can be  resumed.  The project's opponents insist that re authorization  is mandatory because  the indexed cost estimate allegedly ex ceeds  the  i.ndexed ceiling authorized  by the Congress as the result of sup posed  improper changes  in  indexing  procedures and as a result of ostensi bly unauthorized design changes  in  the project's principal dam. The court  also will rule on whether the Bureau  of Reclamation has  adequately  ad dressed three technical defects in the  environmental impact statement.  According  to research by the legal  division of the Congressional Research  Service, Congress has not yet passed  any law requiring that a project be re",1982
404,House,97,0.236,997,22,Mr. MYERS.," I thank our chairman  for yielding once again.  This is another one of the projects  that just keeps coming back. It seems  like we have a few of these that have a  way of having repetition.  The proponents of this amendment  this afternoon that would strike what ever funding might be available to the  Garrison diversion project would lead  you to believe that all of this is going  for destruction of natural wetlands  and that there is going to be a huge  take of land.  There is a total in the Garrison di version project of 216,000 acres. One  would believe  from  the proponents  that that is going to build dams and  lakes and, as the gentleman from Mas sachusetts said, canals.  The truth of the matter is that two thirds, 146,000,  is going for fish and  wildlife mitigation,  enhancing  the  wildlife in North Dakota, 146,000 acres  to create more ducks.  My gosh, you cannot kill them all  now.  I know my friend from Massa chusetts tries but he cannot get them  all.  We are going to improve the wildlife  by the building of this diversion.  Second,  the Audubon Society has  been mentioned  this afternoon. For  the past 4 years the Audubon Society  has been successful  in delaying  this  project. It has added to the cost by  $500 million for the completion of it.  Yet the project will be brought in  under index costs, the original index  costs.  The last thing, the Audubon Society  is now suing in South Dakota, alleging  that the water will be destroyed  in  South Dakota, yet, as our chairman  said,  the Governor of South Dakota  traveled here  just a  few weeks ago  asking that we complete this.  I think it would be only wise if the  Congress this afternoon, this commit tee, refuses this amendment.  ",1982

415,,97,-0.081,1322,22,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to make  this Chamber  aware that during the past congres sional recess the Honorable CARL D.  PERKINS of Kentucky was presented  with the National Rehabilitation Asso ciation's National Legislative Service  Award. The National Rehabilitation  Association <NRA>, the world's largest  organization of professionals, consum ers, and other individuals devoted to  improving  the  lives of handicapped  adults and children,  establshed  the  legislative service award in 1981 to rec ognize public officials who have dem onstrated leadership in improving re habilitation services for persons with  disabilities  through legislative action  at the national level. Recipients are  chosen on the basis of their creative  and effective political leadership over  a period of years on behalf of rehabili tation programs, To those of us famil iar with Chairman PERKINS' long and  distinguished  record  of  successfully  championing strengthened rehabilita tion services  in  this country, which  has already earned him the nickname  of ""Mr. Rehabilitation,"" it seems most  fitting that he was selected to be the  first  recipient  of  this  prestigious  award.  The selection of Chairman PERKINS  as the first recipient of NRA's Nation al Legislative Service Award was an nounced at th NRA's national confer ence in September by Jack G. Duncan  NRA's general counsel, who was  in:  strumental in establishing the award.  Appropriately,  however,  the  award  was actually presented  to Chairman  PERKINS in the Seventh Congressional  District of Kentucky-a region that he  has represented with distinction and  devotion since 1948. The presentation,  which took place at the Eastern Ken tucky Comprehensive Rehabilitation  Center in Thelma, Ky., on October 25,  was made by Jack Cline, regional man ager of Kentucky Rehabilitation Dis trict 14, which is in the heart of Con gressman PERKINS district. Mr. Cline  nominated Chairman PERKINS for the  award.  Before  the  presentation,  Joan  Barker, chairman of the NRA's Pro fessional Concerns Committee, and a  constitutent of Chairman PERKINS, ex plained why Chairman PERKINS  re ceived  the  commission's unanimous  vote to receive the award:  The Honorable Carl D. Perkins, Chairman  of the Committee on Education and Labor,  has been dedicated  to  the cause of  the  handicapped and disadvantaged since his  election to the U.S. House of Representa tives in 1948. He has been actively fighting  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  December 14, 1982  for the rights of disabled individuals since  he became a member of the Education and  Labor Committee in 1949. Since 1949, the  Rehab111tation Program has grown from an  tion program as a separate and identifiable  entity.  Congressman Perkins believes that the re hab111tation of handicapped individuals  is,  in part, a shared State/Federal responsibil ity and that the basic grant program must  be maintained within  the Rehab111tation  Act. He feels that the Federal Government  must play a part in aiding handicapped per sons as they strive for a full share of our  American way of life. He has been an in valuable leader in legislative action to pro mote and expand the national rehab111ta tion program.  Mr. Speaker, this is by any standard  an impressive record, and one which I  expect Chairman PERKINS will embel lish as he continues his distinguished  service in this body.

This competition presented a terrific  opportunity  for young people  from  throughout  the United  States  to  become  exposed  to  championship  tennis. I am proud that two of my con stituents were so honored to represent  the mid-Atlantic region. The region in cludes Maryland, New York, New  Jersey, and Delaware.  Donna Fleming, daughter of Horace  and Debbie Fleming, is 12 and is an  eighth grader at the Thomas Pullen  Middle School in Landover. She was  rated the best girl in the 12-and-under  future champions competition.  Travis Gillespie, son of Barbara and  Joseph Gillespie, is also 12 and is in  the eighth grade at Stephen Decatur  Junior High School in Clinton. He was  rated best boy  in  the 12-and-under  future champions competition.  The national competition, sponsored  by tennis great Arthur Ashe and the  Congoleum Co., took place during the  week of the U.S. Tennis Open. This  gave  the  young  participants  the  chance  to  see  championship  tennis  and to meet some of tennis' top stars f or instance, both Travis and Donna  met Bjorn Borg.  These two young people come from  the same neighborhood, Pepper Mill  Village in Landover, Md. They are the  first  ""stars""  to come  from a great  1.  annual budget of $19,000,000 to $956,500,000  in fiscal year 1981. More importantly, the  number of persons rehab111tated each year  has grown from 58,000 in 1949 to 277,000 in  1980. Congressman Perkins  has been  a  major contributor to the growth and im provement of the National Vocational Re hab111tation Program through his legislative  activities and his ardent advocacy for the  goals of the Rehab111tation Program.  The following list contains just a few of  Congressman Perkins' outstanding achieve ments:  In 1967, he was co-sponsor of Public  Law 90-99 which extended the Vocational  Rehab111tation Act and expanded authoriza tion of grants to states for Rehab111tation  Services; authorized assistance in the estab lishment and operation of a National Center  for Deaf Blind Youths and Adults; and pro vided assistance for migrants.  2. In 1968, he was principal sponsor of leg islation which became Public Law 91-61  which provided for a National Center on  Educational Media, and Materials for  the  Handicapped.  3. In 1970, he was principal sponsor of leg islation which became Public Law 91-610, a  bill to extend reauthorization of programs  under the Vocational Rehab111tation Act.  4. In 1971, Congressman Perkins was the  principal sponsor of a bill to amend the Vo cational Rehabilitation Act to extend and  revise the authorization of grants to states  for Vocational Rehabilitation services and  other purposes. The bill which Congress  passed on October 14, 1972, was vetoed by  the President. Congressman Perkins li1tro duced an identical bill in 1973 which was  again vetoed by the President. On May 23,  1973 Congressman Perkins and four mem bers of the Education and Labor Committee  again sponsored a bill similar to the two pre vious bills which was signed into law by the  President.  5. In 1974, Congressman Perkins was one  of four co-sponsors of the bill which led to  Public Law 93-516 which: extended authori zation of appropriations in the Rehab111ta tion Act of 1973 for one year and trans ferred the Rehabllitation Services Adminis tration to  the office of the Secretary of  Health, Education and Welfare; amended  and strengthened the Randolph-Sheppard  Act for the blind; and provided for a White  House Conference of Handicapped Individ uals.  Congressman  Perkins  successfully  managed these amendments on the floor of  the House.  6. Through his efforts as Chairman of the  Education and Labor Committee, the 1978  amendments  to  the Rehabilitation  act  added new programs to expand employment  opportunities and a new and innovative pro gram was established to promote independ ent living of persons with severe disab111ties.  Congressman Perkins has been an active  participant in the struggle for the rights of  disabled individuals since his election from  the Seventh Congressional District of Ken tucky. He has been a leader in expansion  and improvement of services to the handi capped since he became chairman of the  Education and Labor Committee in 1967. He  has proven to be one of the strongest allies  of vocational rehabilitation services during  the 1981 battle to prevent the inclusion of  rehabilitation programs in a proposed block  grant. He was essential  to  the successful  vote to maintain the vocational rehab111ta",1982
417,,97,-0.056,1348,22,Mr. LEVITAS.," Mr. Speaker, regula tory reform is one of the most impor tant issues facing our Nation today.  Many people ask how does regulatory  reform acquire such an important po sition on the agenda of Congress, and  on the President's list of priority items  for  this  post-election  session. The  answer is very simple. The cost of reg ulation to the American people today  exceeds $120 billion annually. Many of  those costs are unnecessary, and every  dollar  that  is spent on unnecessary  regulation  takes  away  from  invest ment in new plant capacity and creat ing new jobs. And there! ore, we see bi partisan support for the enactment of  regulatory reform legislation.  In an op-ed article which appeared  in the Wall Street Journal on Decem ber 6, 1982, John Opel, the head of the  Business Roundtable's task force on  Government regulation discusses  the  overwhelming  costs  of Government  regulation. As he notes, it is time to  give the House an opportunity to vote  on this important legislation. At this  point I place Mr. Opel's article in the  RECORD.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 6,  1982]  THE HOUSE SHOULD VOTE ON REGULATORY  REFORM  <By John R. Opel)  The  post-election  session  of Congress  offers the House leadership another chance  to bring the long overdue regulatory reform  bill to the floor for a vote. While the session  has to deal with pressing budgetary and ap propriations matters, time should be found  to let the House act on regulatory reform.  The president has designated this as one of  the key issues Congress needs to address.  Regulatory reform does not mean doing  away with regulation. It means making the  regulatory process more  rational. If any thing needs a dose of rationality, it's the  way regulations are developed and imple mented, often with little understanding of  the consequences.  Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan have  recognized the need for sweeping improve ments and have done something about it.  Their executive orders have gone a long way  in the right direction. But these orders only  apply  to  agencies within  the  executive  branch and accomplish only part of what  needs  to  be  done. Moreover,  executive  orders tend to be stop-gap substitutes for  legislation and can be reversed at any time.  Regulatory reform deserves greater perma nence and predictability.  The Senate has already  recognized  the  need for comprehensive, intelligent and fair  legislation covering the regulatory process.  Under the sponsorship of Senators Laxalt,  Leahy, Roth and Eagleton, a Senate bill was  approved last March with bipartisan sup port in a 94-0 vote.  One wonders  how many  ill-conceived,  badly implemented and enormously costly  regulations might have had their quality  improved had such legislation existed in the  past. Businessmen in large and small compa nies see scores of examples each week of  regulations whose benefits are obscure or  marginal at best, yet require costly compli ance.  No one seriously questions that the costs  of regulation are staggering. Those costs are  inflating the prices of Just about everything  Americans buy. They also make our exports  less attractive. Some estimates have put the  cost of regulation at over $100 billion a year.  Four years ago, the Business Roundtable's  task force on government regulation spon sored a study that looked at only six federal  agencies and the cost impact of their regula tions on only 48 major companies. The re sults were carefully and independently au dited. They revealed that Just those 48 com panies  incurred  extra direct  compliance  costs of a whopping $2.6 billion in the single  year that was studied, 1977. This was equiv alent to 10.1% of total capital expenditures  of  the 48 companies, 15.5% of  their net  income after taxes, and 43.1% of their total  research and development expenditures.  The primary objective of the pending leg islation is  to ensure that regulations that  will have major economic impact will under go careful economic analysis. The idea is to  make sure there will be a reasonable bal ance between the benefits of a regulation  and the costs to realize them. Proposed reg ulations that have been assessed for ration ality may then be implemented by the rule making agency.  A few critics have argued, incorrectly, that  the new  legislation would  tie agencies  in  knots, relies too much on cost-benefit analy sis, would give the OMB too much power,  and would  impose  too many  steps  that  December 14, 1982  calls  would delay needed rules. Serious study of  the proposed  legislation proves such con cerns groundless.  Some critics say that benefits cannot be  reduced to numbers and that costs cannot  be calculated precisely. No one  insists on  that sort of exercise. Indeed, the bill would  not require agencies to mechanically weigh  benefits and costs.  What the many supporters of regulatory  reform seek is the gathering and analysis of  information needed to make more rational  decisions.  The  legislation  for  the  simple imposition of some economic disci pline in the rulemaking process to ensure  that contemplated rules are Justified and  that the planned approach is efficient.  The legislation also would ensure a more  accessible and rational regulatory process  with improved agency accountability to the  public. In addition, it provides improved re course to the courts when an agency's ac tions are considered unjustified or outside  its Jurisdiction.  During  this  post-election  session,  the  House should be allowed to vote on the con sensus version of the bill offered by Con gressmen Hall  and Kindness. Otherwise  we'll have the spectacle of inaction in the  face of a unanimously favorable Senate vote  and the support of most House members. It  Just doesn't make sense to allow a small mi nority to block action on this legislation.  And it doesn't make sense to have five  years of sincere effort by men and women of  good will in Congress, business, two adminis trations and the general public go on the  legislative shelf. Scarce resources that are  wasted on  inefficient, over-costly  regula tions must be directed  to capital  invest ments that create jobs.  But first the House leadership must bring  the regulatory reform bill to the floor for a  vote. It shouldn't remain bottled up in the  n11es committee. It shouldn't get nitpicked  or amended to death. It is a good bill, fair to  business, public interest groups, regulatory  agencies and the people.e  TRIBUTE TO GEORGE W. SMITH  HON. ALLENE. ERTEL  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 14, 1982  e ",1982
418,,97,0.345,1361,22,Mrs. MARTIN of Illinois.," Mr.  Speaker, I am introducing legislation  to use surplus Government stocks of  agricultural commodities to offset the  unfair trade practices of many of our  trading partners. While I am commit ted to the principle of free trade, I be lieve current trends in the internation al marketplace necessitate a  strong  measure such as this.  Every year I send out a farm report  to my  farm constituency  to  inform  them of Federal  issues  that affect  farming and to solicit their opinions  on farm problems and solutions. In re sponse to my 1982 farm report, many  of my farmers stressed the need  to  expand agricultural exports to relieve  the crop surplus  that  is depressing  farm prices. Most of these comments  referred to the unfair trade practices  of other nations, especially the Euro pean Economic Community  <EEC>,  that were either barring U.S. farm ex ports or competing unfairly through  the use of direct and indirect subsidies.  On November 10 of this year, I was  part of  the U.S.  delegation  the  GA TT ministerial meetings to discuss  trade barriers and practices  in  the  international marketplace. I was espeto  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cially  interested  in  the effect  trade  issues have on the farm economy and  industrial work force of northern Illi nois. I returned from these meetings  convinced that the United States must  take stronger actions  to protest the  trade policies of other nations, espe cially the agricultural export subsidies  used by the European Economic Com munity.  I  find  it totally unacceptable that  while the United States supplies a ma jority of the def ene needs of the Euro peans at great financial cost to us, the  Europeans subsidize their agricultural  exports to undermine our export mar kets. U.S.  farm  exports  receive no  similar subsidies, nor do we wish  to  begin subsidizing our exports. It was  hoped that through the GA TT meet ings compromises could be reached on  the issue of EEC farm subsidies, but  the meeting ended with no such agree ments. The Europeans will continue to  subsidize their farm exports. I believe  this situation necessitates a response.  There is an old rule in the Midwest  that when you cannot get someone's  attention  through  talking,  you hit  them over the head with a 2 by 4. I  propose we provide the administration  with a 2 by 4 to use in bringing the  EEC and other nations to some fruit ful trade negotiations. The 2 by 4 I am  proposing uses what is becoming know  as the Christmas approach or the buy  10 get 1 free method of supporting ag ricultural exports.  The bill I am offering to the House  will grant the Secretary of Agriculture  the authority to make surplus Com modity Credit Corporation <CCC> agri cultural commodities available to U.S.  exporters, U.S. processors, and foreign  customers. The Secretary can make  these stocks available for the purpose  of maintaining, developing,  and ex panding  the markets  for U.S.  farm  products where  competition  exists  from other nation's subsidized exports.  Precautions are taken to insure that  the use of  this authority does not  result in displacement of U.S. commer cial sales in the export market, thus  insuring  that  the  release of  these  stocks will not result in lower domestic  prices for farm products. Other pre cautions are taken so  that the com modities  released are not  resold  to  some other country  and  that U.S.  farm products are not negatively af fected.  This method of offsetting other na tions' farm export subsidies has sever al advantages over other proposals for  direct price subsidies or interest buy downs. First, this act will not result in  any financial outlays by the Federal  Government. Because  the CCC  al ready owns massive amounts of grain,  it will reduce the cost of CCC storage.  Second,  the disposal of CCC  stocks  into the international market will help  improve domestic farm prices and the  agricultural economy by lessening the  30903  huge grain surplus. This surplus  is  causing the worst difficulties in farm  country since  the Great Depression.  Again,  this  is accomplished without  adding to the burden of the Federal  budget deficit.  Time before the adjournment of the  97th Congress is limited, but I believe  this  legislation offers a constructive  addition to the debate that is being  conducted in the Congress on the sub ject of international trade practices. I  off er this legislation for inclusion in  the proposed farm stimulus package  the administration is pushing in the  Senate. If action on this proposal is  not taken in this lameduck session, the  groundwork will be completed for its  reintroduction when  the 98th Con gress  takes office next month. Most  importantly, the introduction and con sideration of  this proposal sends a  strong message to the Europeans and  other exporters that the United States  will use a 2 by 4 if necessary to move  the international marketplace toward  the goal of free trade.  I urge your support and cosponsor ship of this legislation.   A TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE  HENRY REUSS  HON. DOUG BARNARD, JR.

419,,97,-0.028,1361,22,Mr. BARNARD.," Mr. Speaker, when  I came to Congress as a new Member  in 1977, HENRY REUSS was one of the  people from whom I learned the ropes.  He was chairman of the Banking Com mittee, and served as an able leader of  that committee for 6 years. His stew ardship on the Monetary Control Act  was one of the hallmarks of his service  in Congress.  As we worked  together, I came to  value his experience, his insight, and  his concern for our Nation's cities and  housing.  I  remember with gratitude  his strong voice on the workings of our  economy. Our opinions may have dif fered, but one always knew where he  stood, and that trait is all too rare in  politics.  Mr. Speaker,  this is the season in  which we hear a good number of trib utes to our departing colleagues. But I  do not know of many Congressmen  who deserve  the praise and  respect  more than does HENRY REUss.e  ",1982
