0,House,114,-0.428,2,2016-01-07,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  with the odd drama playing out in Oregon where armed thugs have taken  over a Federal wildlife facility, it is  important to reflect on what the wildlife refuge system is all about.  If these people had any argument  with the President, it was with President Roosevelt, who 108 years ago established the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as a response to protect  natural  resources,  especially  the  slaughter of wild birds for feathers to  adorn women’s hats.  It is ironic that the President, who in  his younger days participated in the  slaughter of over 6 million buffalo that  roamed the Midwest plains on a magnificent ecostructure, realized the necessity of protecting these resources.  Today we benefit from the foresight of  this conservation President who provided the cornerstone of environmental  protection that enriches us all.  The notion that somehow this is the  ‘‘wild west,’’ where people can do with  public land what they want, is thoroughly discredited. This mind-set from  the 1800s that there were endless, wide-  open  spaces, where people could do  what they wished, when they wished,  where they wished, is tinged with regret and tragedy. We took away the  land from Native Americans that our  government had given to them in solemn treaty, ratified by Congress.  The mind-set that public lands of the  West were to be exploited as rapidly as  possible is still embodied in the Mining  Act of 1872, which essentially allows  anyone, including foreign mining operations, to exploit our country’s mineral resources at basically no cost and  with no enforceable obligation to repair the damage they  inflicted. The  West is now blighted with thousands of  abandoned mines and oil and gas wells  that will risk being a permanent scar  on the landscape. While private profit  was pursued, the public was left with  the consequences and the cost of cleanup, if it ever occurs.  The longstanding battles over American  rangeland  between  competing  owners and between competing uses,  like cattle and sheep, were not pretty.  There is no doubt that there are still  significant problems dealing with public land management, in part because  the rules of the game are still set by  the Mining Act of 1872 and the Taylor  Grazing Act of 1934.  All but the most reckless individuals  would agree that if these statutes were  written today they would  look  fundamentally different with more protections and clarity. It was into this void  that Teddy Roosevelt stepped, declaring critical national monuments. He  established wildlife refuges to benefit  countless generations to come.  These amazing treasures are not just  scenic wonders. They hold  extraordinarily valuable habitat for wildlife,  waterfowl, helping preserve the  land  and the water and the ecosystem that  goes far beyond what is simply spectacular to look at.  This is America’s heritage. We struggle on an ongoing basis to recover from  the reckless, thoughtless exploitation  of the last two centuries. The vast majority of the American public supports  this effort, even if they never visit the  remote Western regions.  Indeed, the  fact that they are often inaccessible is  the only way that they are preserved.  Imagine tour buses, motorized vehicles,  hordes of tourists, their infrastructure  and their litter, and the destructive effects that would have.  The sideshow with the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge obscures a much  larger and  important public policy:  protecting our heritage, enhancing it,  and avoiding reckless behavior of a few  that will penalize generations to come.  That is why the Harney Basin Wetlands Initiative of people in that region, facilitated by the refuge between  2010 and 2013, was a textbook example  of collaboration, where all the stakeholders created a vision and a 20-year  plan for the refuge and the surrounding  landscape, including the biggest wetland  restoration project ever undertaken.  It would be valuable for us to look  behind the headlines to the facts on the  ground, the history of the resource, the  struggle for protection, the tremendous  benefits for all Americans, and what  the stakeholders in that region accomplished together.  f  REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE  CARE ACT  ",2016
1,House,114,0.307,2,2016-01-07,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.,"  Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I was proud to  vote in favor of the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which repeals the Affordable  Care Act, or the ACA. With yesterday’s  passage of the bill, it marks the first  time repeal of the ACA has been sent  to President Obama’s desk.  In the past year, several significant  problems with this law have become  ever more clear. We have seen a large  number of healthcare co-ops go under.  One  major  healthcare  provider,  UnitedHealthcare, announced it is pulling out of the ACA exchange. This system is just not sustainable.  Late  last year,  the Congressional  Budget Office released a report stating  that the ACA will lead to a reduction  of work-hours equivalent to 2 million  jobs over the next decade. The CBO attributes this reduction to healthcare  subsidies tied to income, raising effective tax rates for Americans, and creating a disincentive for people seeking  promotions or new, higher paying jobs.  It also points to higher taxes and penalties as a reason for the reduction in  work-hours.  In comparison, the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act will reduce the Federal deficit by more than half a trillion dollars  over the next 10 years. It will also  eliminate costly provisions, such as the  individual and employer health insurance coverage mandates, the Cadillac  tax on high-cost plans, and it will enhance the solvency of Medicare. It also  ensures that Federal tax dollars will  not go to providers of abortion.  Mr. Speaker, over the past several  years, dozens of ACA reforms have been  signed into law. However, we have only  scratched the surface when it comes to  addressing problems with this law. It is  time to come together to support a  comprehensive approach that ensures  responsible use of taxpayer dollars and  fixes the issues affecting our Nation’s  healthcare system.  f  HAYMARKET CAFE  ",2016
2,House,114,0.547,9,2016-01-07,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker,  last week The Wall Street  Journal reported that the National Security Agency, the NSA,  is actively  spying on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of our Nation’s  closest allies. This revelation comes  just 2 years after the President’s announcement  that  the United States  would cease spying on our allies.  The Journal wrote:  ‘‘Officials said  Obama insisted that keeping tabs on  Netanyahu  served a  ‘compelling national security purpose.’’’  Specifically, the President sought to  learn about President Netanyahu’s opposition to the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal. In so doing, the NSA also  intercepted personal, direct  communication between Members of Congress,  the Prime Minister, and his staff.  An editorial by The Post and Courier—republished  in  The  Hill  this  week—raised  important  questions  about the legality of the NSA’s sharing  private conversations with the White  House and not discarding or getting judicial permission. Regrettably, this is  another example of the President’s disregard for our Constitution by spying  on Congress, corrupting the NSA.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and may the President, by his actions,  never forget September the 11th in the  global war on terrorism.  Our sympathy to the family of Staff  Sergeant Matthew McClintock,  an  American hero.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  BOST). Members are reminded not to  engage  in  personalities  toward  the  President.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF DOUGLAS  WILSON WALKER  (Ms. DELBENE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

3,House,114,0.714,9,2016-01-07,Mr. WEBER of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise to speak out against the proposed  executive assault—I mean action—on  our Second Amendment  rights. The  President has yet again overstepped,  has fired off another round, and has  taken dead aim at the Second Amendment. It is time Congress takes dead  aim at his lawlessness.  We have three branches of government for a reason, and one branch cannot continue to unilaterally act. It is  tyrannical, and it erodes the foundation of this great Nation: our Constitution.  Mr. Speaker, it is very curious to me  that the President, who doesn’t want  his background checked into—his birth  certificate, his school records, or his  college grades—wants an anti-Second  Amendment  intrusion  into  actual  Americans’ backgrounds.  When is this administration going to  realize that denying Americans their  constitutional right to carry won’t prevent bad people from doing bad things?  It simply ensures criminals a safe path  to crime.  That is how I see it. Lord help us last  over these next 12 months.  ",2016

6,House,114,-0.306,23,2016-01-07,Mr. CONNOLLY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the distinguished ranking member, my  friend  from Maryland  (Mr.  CUMMINGS).  I join the ranking member in opposing the so-called Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act.  Specifically, we take exception to the  inclusion of the so-called All Economic  Regulations are Transparent Act that  would unnecessarily require agencies  to provide monthly status updates on  their plans to propose and finalize rules  when they are already required to report twice a year.  Further, this legislation would prohibit agency rules from taking effect  until  the Office of  Information and  Regulatory Affairs has posted certain  information  online  for  at  least  6  months. So an agency might post, on  its own, information about the cost of  a proposed rule for a year, but if OIRA  doesn’t post  the  information  for at  least 6 months, the agency would be  prohibited from moving forward.  b1330  Chairman,  Ranking Member  and I have an amendment  that will  be  considered  shortly  to  strike the 6-month online posting requirement.  Striking  that  provision  would keep  important agency  rules  protecting public health and  safety  from being needlessly delayed.

8,House,114,-0.313,51,2016-01-07,Mr. GARAMENDI.," Mr. Speaker, before the holiday break, I rose to congratulate  the  East  Nicolaus  High  School Spartans from Sutter County  for advancing to the CIF Division VI–  AA  football championship game. At  that time, they were about to make a  500-mile trip to San Diego to face Coronado, a school four times their size.  Well, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say  that the Spartans may have been the  underdogs in the game, but that didn’t  matter to them. On December 28, they  won the championship game 16–6. Quarterback S.J. Brown threw for a touchdown and rushed for another. Donovan  Switalski had 25 carries for 135 yards.  On defense, quarterback Eddie Herrera  intercepted two passes.  Those are great individual efforts. As  a former lineman for the University of  California Bears, I know it takes a full  team to pull out a win like this and  also a coach.  I congratulate Coach Travis Barker  and the entire East Nicolaus team for  making Sutter County and the entire  Third  Congressional  District  very  proud.  f  BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL  (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2016
9,House,114,0.605,51,2016-01-07,Mr. HARRIS.," Mr. Speaker, when the  House sends the budget reconciliation  bill to the President this evening, he  has  a  chance  to help hardworking  American taxpayers by signing it and  saving taxpayers over $500 billion over  the next 10 years.  It does that in two ways. First, it repeals  most  of  the  unaffordable  ObamaCare program, which has raised  the cost of health insurance and health  care for millions and millions of hardworking Americans. It also removes all  Federal taxpayer funding from Planned  Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the country, which receives  over half a billion taxpayer dollars a  year and does 330,000 abortions a year.  In fact, it is the largest abortion provider in America. Instead of funding  the largest abortion provider in America, we direct those funds to over 10,000  community health centers.  Mr. Speaker, I hope the President  agrees and saves hardworking American taxpayers billions of dollars.  f  DEFENDING THE SECOND  AMENDMENT  (Mr. ROKITA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2016
10,House,114,0.596,51,2016-01-07,Mr. ROKITA.," Mr. Speaker, any constitutional  lawyer should know that  Congress is supposed to write the laws  and the executive branch is supposed to  follow them, as written. Implementing  more gun control through executive  fiat is not what is needed, and it is not  what is legal.  Enforcement of the current  law  is  what is needed by this executive, and it  is what this President should be doing.  Instead, for example, he lets prisoners  out of jail to contribute to the violence.  Mr. Speaker, the right to self-defense  is God-given. It is vital in order to protect people and property against criminals, and it is a hedge against tyrants,  and it shall not be infringed.  To those who would challenge these  rights, Mr. Speaker, I leave you with  these words: ‘‘A well-regulated militia  necessary  to  the  security of a  free  state, the right of the people to keep  and bear arms, shall not be infringed.’’  f  BORN ALIVE SURVIVORS  PROTECTION ACT  (Mr. FRANKS of Arizona asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)  ",2016
11,House,114,0.749,51,2016-01-07,Mr. FRANKS of Arizona.," Mr. Speaker, Thomas Jefferson, whose words  marked the beginning of this Nation,  said: ‘‘The care of human life and its  happiness, and not its destruction, is  the chief and only object of good government.’’  Yet, Mr. Speaker, 43 years ago, our  Supreme Court mandated abortion on  demand in America, and 57 million innocent  little American babies have  since been slaughtered before seeing  the light of day in this, the land of the  free and the home of brave.  Mr. Speaker, this House passed the  Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act months ago to protect helpless children who survive abortion and  are born alive. Yet at this very moment, that bill to protect born-alive  children  languishes  in  the  United  States Senate for lack of six Democrat  votes and a veto threat by Barack  Obama.  It is time for the President of the  United States and each Senator and all  of us, as Americans, to ask ourselves in  our own hearts if this is who we truly  are.

12,House,114,0.69,51,2016-01-07,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is  with a sad heart that I rise today to  speak for those whose lives have been  tragically cut short in the wake of Roe  v. Wade. A staggering 57 million innocent girls and boys have been aborted  in this country since that horrible decision 43 years ago. Roe v. Wade remains one of the most heinous acts of  judicial activism in the history of the  United States.  As a father of five and a grandfather  of three, I know that every child is a  wonderful gift from God. Our country  was founded upon the sacred truth that  all deserve the right to life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness.  The  perverse  belief  that  an  unplanned  child does not possess  the  same value as that of any other child  should have no place in our society.  There may be unplanned children, but  there is no such thing as an unwanted  child.  Later this month, thousands of pro-  life patriots will come to Washington  to peacefully march in support of life  and against the national disgrace that  is abortion. I am pleased to be among  those  fighting against  this greatest  human rights injustice of our time. We  must continue to pray, and we must  continue to speak up for the innocents  who cannot speak for themselves.  f  57 MILLION INNOCENT LIVES LOST  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)

Since Roe v. Wade, we have lost  57 million innocent lives. May God rest  their souls. That is an astounding and  absolutely heart-numbing loss.  Countless lives have been impacted  by abortion. Each one of those 57 million children had a future destroyed by  abortion.  Even Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff  known as Roe, revealed in 1995 that she  had, in fact, become pro-life and is now  a vocal opponent of abortion and the  abortion industry.  Mr. Speaker, the sanctity of human  life must be protected. We have a duty  to protect the lives of all Americans,  especially the most helpless and innocent of all, the unborn.  I stand with the thousands of Americans who will  soon gather on The  Washington Mall to serve as the voice  of 57 million unborn babies whose lives  were tragically taken through abortion.

14,House,114,0.598,58,2016-01-07,Mr. GOHMERT.," I thank my friend,  Mr. SMITH,  for all his work on this  issue.  When I was a young boy unable to  read and my mother would read stories  from the Bible, it was so enlightening.  As  I began  to  read  in  elementary  school and read the Bible for myself, I  was always so perplexed to read that  there were generations thousands of  years ago that devolved and degenerated to the point that they would  sacrifice  their own children on  the  alter to avail other idols.  It appeared clear that there is not  much that is more despicable to God,  and it makes sense for anyone who believes there could be a God that there  could be nothing more despicable than  the taking of innocent life.  That is what you find in the Bible. It  may have been allowed to go on for  generations  for years. But when the  wrath came, it was judgment that was  truly ungodly.  Since 1973, the realization that here  in America we have been sacrificing  the most innocent—before they could  even be capable of saying a lie, stealing, any wrong whatsoever, their lives  are taken away from them.  And then to further realize that you  have some legislators that have fought  to  prevent  children  that were  attempted to be aborted, that were born  alive—they fought to let them die even  after they are born alive. Then you realize one such legislator now has been  voted into the White House. It is a bit  scary, where we are in America.  I know there are some that say: You  are a man. You can’t complain about  the sacrifice of unborn children on the  alter of inconvenience.  I am not a slave, never have been,  but I would hope that, if I were alive  200 years ago, I would have stood with  John Quincy Adams,  I would have  stood with the abolitionists, to say:  How can we expect God to keep blessing America when we are treating our  brothers and sisters with chains and  bondage?  Well, I am alive today. We need to  stop the sacrifice of the most innocent  and the most helpless among us. Our  judgment will be coming one way or  another.  ",2016
15,House,114,0.16,58,2016-01-07,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," I thank  my friend for his eloquent remarks.  I just want to conclude, Mr. Speaker.  Some day  future generations will  look back on America and wonder how  and why such a seemingly enlightened  society so blessed and endowed with  education, advanced science, information, wealth, and opportunity could  have failed to protect the most innocent and the most inconvenient.  History will not look favorably on today’s abortion culture. I do believe we  must replace it and work tirelessly to  replace it with a culture of life.  Modern  medicine  and  scientific  breakthroughs,  especially  the widespread use of ultrasound, has shattered  the pernicious myth that unborn children are mere blobs of tissue and that  abortion is anything but an act of violence.  A few years ago I met with Linda  Shrewsbury, an academic and African  American with a degree from Harvard,  who spoke and said:  ‘‘The lies that brought me to that  day and  its sorrowful aftermath are  crystal clear in my mind—falsehoods  and  deceptions  that  concealed  the  truth about abortion. Lies planted in  my  thinking  by  clever marketing,  media campaigns and endless repetition led to a tragic irreversible decision—the death of my first child.’’  ‘‘At age 20, I had no inkling of the  mental and emotional darkness I was  about to enter.’’  ‘‘After spending many years in denial,  I did  eventually  find healing.  When I understood and rejected distortions  about  fetal  development,  doublespeak  about  choice,  rights,  planned and wanted children, I understood the reality and victimhood of my  aborted child. I understood the absence  of moral bases for choosing to ’dis-entitle’ an innocent human being of life.  When I embraced truth, truth set me  free and I finally gained inner peace.’’  We believe that there are two victims  in every abortion: the unborn baby and  the mother. Linda Shrewsbury found  peace. We need to protect women from  the violence of abortion, as well as babies.  I yield back the balance of my time.  f  CHILD CARE  ",2016

65,,114,-0.428,79,2016-01-07,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, this week,  the House considered H.R. 712, the Sunshine  for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act,  and H.R. 1155, the SCRUB Act, pieces of legislation with  the primary purpose of dismantling and undermining the federal rulemaking  and regulatory process. I voted against both of  these bills.  Throughout my career, as an administrator  and policymaker at the local, state, and federal  levels,  I have often seen  the value of  common-sense regulations  that save  lives.  I  have also seen the challenges associated with  cumbersome  regulations  that are difficult  to  comply with.  There are ways to make some regulations  more efficient and easier to navigate, but we  must do so  in a way  that protects public  health, maintains our environmental protections, and ensures  fair market  interactions.  These bills, however, are far from the mark  They both would implement a ‘ ‘cut-go’ ’ approach that would require every new rule to  come with  the  removal of another, even  in  cases of emergency or imminent harm to public health. This approach  is absurd. Regulations often build on each other, evolving and  sometimes  rapidly  responding  to emerging  challenges, and this type of restriction will only  threaten the process and undermine the ability  of agencies to effectively protect public health,  public safety, the environment and more.  The Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and  Settlements Act,  through  its barriers  to consent decrees, through its imposition of a moratorium on implementation until a rule is available online for six months, and through its requirement that all rules be summarized in 100  words online, regardless of how complex, only  adds additional, unnecessary burdens on the  rulemaking process, without actually improving  it.  The underlying assumption behind  these  bills  is  that  regulations are unwelcome and  burdensome on communities and  the economy. I frequently, however, hear from industry  in my community and around  the country  about  the  importance of many government  regulations, in equalizing the playing field and  setting important guidelines based on science  that allow them be good actors in their communities.  There are  certainly outdated  regulations,  and  there  is always  room  for greater efficiencies, and  the creation of more performance  based,  flexible  regulatory  processes.  These bills however, will not get us closer to  that goal, and are dangerous to public safety,  to health and the environment.  f  IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE  DALLAS THEODORE YATES  HON.

67,Senate,114,-0.374,13,2016-01-20,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the fear and xenophobia  being peddled by some Republican candidates  for President  is now  being  given time on the Senate floor.  Instead of solving the real problems  facing Americans—like  the  student  debt crisis or our need for energy independence—or  responding  to  real  threats to our national security—like  our failure to track visa overstays or  prevent terrorists from buying guns—  today we are debating a strawman inspired  by Donald Trump’s  baseless  rhetoric.  The bill the Republican leader is asking us to consider will not make America safer. In fact, it is a dangerous distraction that plays into the hands of  the ISIS propaganda machine.  Instead of demonizing refugees, who  are  the most  thoroughly  screened  group of people who enter the United  States, we should take up and pass the  Defeat ISIS and Protect and Secure the  United States Act of 2015. That bill offers  a  comprehensive  strategy  to  counter ISIS propaganda and violent  extremism  in the United States and  abroad.  It offers real solutions that  will  keep  us  safe  rather  than  scapegoating refugees who are fleeing  war and torture.  In contrast, the bill we are asked to  consider has put forward fresh fodder  for the false narrative that we are at  war with Islam.  I will oppose this House bill.  ",2016

This remarkable  and  talented woman  has  spent her  life accomplishing  things  ahead of her time, from majoring in  theater during the 1940s to helping desegregate a community, to starting her  own theater group.  As  a  teacher  at Parkland High  School in 1970, Mrs. Anderson directed  a play that starred both African American and Caucasian students, a first in  the history of Forsyth County schools.  As a director, she also helped integrate  the theater department at Wake Forest  University.  She was the first African American  actress to perform with the Little Theatre  of Winston-Salem. From  that  point on, the Little Theatre became  known as a place where the African  American community could be treated  equally.  In recognition of her 34 years as an  educator, Parkland High School  in  Winston-Salem has named their auditorium for Mrs. Anderson. This honor  is well deserved and pays tribute to her  lasting impact in the local community.

74,House,114,-0.472,2,2016-02-02,Ms. ADAMS.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday  marked the anniversary of the Greensboro Four sit-ins.  Fifty-six years ago four North Carolina A&T freshmen decided to peacefully challenge racial segregation  in  my hometown of Greensboro and the  community I’m proud to serve in Congress.  Joseph  McNeil,  Jibreel  Khazan,  Franklin McCain, and David Richmond  sat at a whites-only lunch counter inside a Greensboro Woolworth  store.  These young men sparked a wave of  peaceful  protests  that  spanned  the  State and Nation, helping to put an  end to racial segregation.  I remember traveling through North  Carolina as a young girl and going to  the back door of restaurants because I  couldn’t  sit  inside. Because  of  the  Greensboro Four, my  children, my  grandchildren, and future generations  won’t have to share in my experience.  My bipartisan resolution, H. Res. 128,  honors these four courageous men and  recognizes their impact. It has the support of 62 Members of Congress from  both sides of the aisle.  Today I am calling on my colleagues  to support and pass this resolution in  honor of the Greensboro Four and all of  the students who stood up for equality  by sitting down to end racial segregation.  f  ROADBLOCK HUMAN TRAFFICKING  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

Last month  the House  observed  Human Trafficking Awareness Month  to shine light on this horrific crime.  The  injustice  of human  trafficking  knows  no  political  party  or  geographical boundary. It happens right in  our backyards.  Yesterday the House took important  steps in passing two bills to strengthen  our response to trafficking. I have also  recently introduced H.R. 4406, the Enhancing Detection  of Human Trafficking Act, legislation which ensures  the Department of Labor effectively  trains its employees to recognize and  respond to the illegal trade of people  for exploitation or commercial gain.  It will take close coordination from  stakeholders at every level to eradicate this unthinkable crime. Together,  our voices and actions can help bring  freedom to the oppressed.  f  FIGHT TO CURE CANCER  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2016
76,House,114,0.388,9,2016-02-02,Mr. BUCSHON.," Mr. Speaker, I come  to the floor today in support of the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.  Before I came to Congress, I spent  my career taking care of patients. As a  physician, I want every American to  have access to quality, affordable care.  The legislation before us today marks  the next step toward that goal.  Last month, for the first time, we put  a bill to dismantle ObamaCare on the  President’s desk. It is no surprise that  he vetoed it.  Now, with this veto override vote, we  are exercising our constitutional power  to the fullest extent and bypassing the  President to do what is right for our  country.  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this  bill to show the American people that  the House of Representatives is doing  everything in our power to stop this  disastrous law and replace it with a patient-centered healthcare plan.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), who is  the ranking member of the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives that  Republicans set up to take away reproductive healthcare access from women.  ",2016
77,House,114,-0.606,9,2016-02-02,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr.  Speaker,  how appropriate that the House Republican leadership decided to vote again  on repealing the Affordable Care Act  and defunding Planned Parenthood on  Groundhog Day. In the movie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray’s character relived the same day over and over again,  and we are doing the same thing right  here.  This is the 63rd vote to undermine or  repeal the Affordable Care Act. This is  the 12th Republican attack on women’s  health in this Congress. While House  Republicans have already passed  11  anti-women health measures and are  now voting on their 12th, they have not  passed one single measure that helps  women get the health care that they  need.  So here we are—on only the 12th  business day of the session—facing the  same Republican attacks on women’s  access to health care. Republicans have  said this bill will show the American  people the difference between the political parties in this election year. You  bet it will. The difference is clear. My  Republican colleagues remain willing  to play partisan politics at the expense  of women’s health and access to affordable, quality health care. Women of  America are watching, and they don’t  like what they see.  Never mind the fact that three House  committees have already investigated  Planned Parenthood following the release of the selectively edited videos,  and never mind that a grand jury in  Harris County cleared Planned Parenthood and, instead, indicted the two individuals who made the doctored videos.  Facts matter. The truth matters. Despite my objection to the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, as its  ranking member,  I will continue to  fight to protect women’s health. That  is the promise of all Democrats. We  will, once again, reject this legislation.  This attempt to override is going nowhere, and it shouldn’t.  ",2016
78,House,114,0.78,9,2016-02-02,Mr. PALMER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today in support of the veto override.  James Madison wrote in Federalist  Paper 51: ‘‘It is of great importance in  a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers  but to guard one part of the society  against  the  injustice  of  the  other  part.’’  As expected, President Obama vetoed  a reconciliation bill that would repeal  the misnamed Affordable Care Act.  This was within his constitutional authority. However, our Founders created  a balance of powers within the three  branches to prevent tyranny by one.  With two-thirds, we have the opportunity to override a veto that doesn’t  correlate with the views of the American public. We have the opportunity  to listen to the American people and  put healthcare decisions back in their  hands.  With this override, we have the opportunity to begin the process of real  healthcare  reform  that provides  the  American  people  with  healthcare  choices,  choices  they  can  afford,  choices that allow people to keep their  doctors, choices that provide a safety  net rather than a net that entraps people into a government program, and  choices that allow people to keep their  jobs.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to support this  veto override and put the power to legislate back in the hands of the legislators.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the distinguished  ranking member of the Education and  the Workforce Committee.  ",2016
79,House,114,-0.451,9,2016-02-02,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, since the passage of the  Affordable Care Act in 2010, the House  of Representatives has attempted to  dismantle the law 62 times. Today is  number 63, to repeal a major portion of  the Affordable Care Act.  Mr. Speaker,  since  the Affordable  Care Act  passed,  people with  preexisting conditions can now get health  insurance. The cost of health insurance  has been increasing at the lowest rate  since  they  started keeping  records  about a half a century ago. Those  young people under 26 can stay on their  parents’ policies. Women are no longer  paying more for insurance than men.  We are closing the prescription drug  doughnut hole. While thousands of people were losing their insurance every  day when we passed the bill, more than  17 million people have insurance today.  If we vote ‘‘yes’’ on this motion, we  will cancel all of that progress and at  the same time just add to the deficit.  Mr. Speaker, we should reject this motion, just as we have 62 previous times.  ",2016
80,House,114,0.433,9,2016-02-02,Mr. ROSKAM.," Mr. Speaker, I  just  want to recap quickly how we got here.  ObamaCare was passed on a partisan  basis through the House and the Senate, signed into law, and then it went  forward. It created a false premise, and  the false promise that didn’t come to  fruition was that people were going to  be able to keep their physicians, that  premiums were going to go down, and  it wasn’t going to add to the deficit.  We all know now that was nonsense.  So what did the American public do?  They said, ‘‘We are going to change the  House of Representatives.’’ So  they  elected a Republican majority in the  House to take out ObamaCare. What  did they do next when they found an  obstacle in the United States Senate?  They changed the disposition of the  United States Senate.  Now, there are some people that say  today, ‘‘Oh, this is a complete waste of  time.’’ No, it is not, Mr. Speaker. This  is not a waste of time.  This is a demonstration to the American public that there is now one office  that stands between them and the repeal of ObamaCare. There is one office  that stands between them and the continued  shameful  subsidy of Planned  Parenthood. We have got an opportunity to change that office in November.  Mr. Speaker, I urge us to continue  that momentum and to vote with Mr.  TOMPRICEof Georgia on this bill.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I  would remind my colleagues that the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that if you actually override  this veto, 22 million Americans would  lose access to affordable health care.

But the President refuses to listen. He vetoed Obamacare Reconciliation passed by  both  the House and Senate  to dismantle  Obamacare.  Americans have  lost  their  insurance plans  and  their doctors. Their  insurance premiums  have skyrocketed and some have even  lost  their jobs because of Obamacare. Yet the Administration just sits by and watches while the  American people suffer.  Today, the House continues to stand up for  the people with this veto override. We will continue  to  fight  for our constituents  to defeat  Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood.  I urge a ‘ ‘yes’ ’ vote on this important measure  to show  the President and  the America  people that we will not stop until Obamacare  is defeated.  And that’s just the way it is.  ",2016

",2016
83,House,114,0.602,23,2016-02-02,Mr. WILLIAMS.," I thank the chairman.  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to rise in  support of H.R. 3700, the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act  of 2015.  Introduced by my good friend Chairman LUETKEMEYERand my friend Congressman  this  bipartisan  piece of legislation is the first step in  many to help reform and modernize our  outdated Federal housing system.  Mr. Chairman, for too long, government red tape has made many of these  housing programs inefficient and ineffective, hurting the very people they  aim to support. If signed into law, H.R.  3700 would seek to change that, all the  while saving taxpayer-invested money.  First, as mentioned, the CBO projects  this bill to be a cost saver. With the  Federal  deficit  reaching  almost  $19  trillion, the savings  in discretionary  spending are a direct result of allowing  local housing officials and agencies to  better manage their programs. Like  most Federal programs, inefficient regulations exist that often balloon overall costs.  CLEAVER,  man LUETKEMEYER Additionally,  as  previously mentioned, for the first time in 80 years of  public housing policy, this legislation  restricts the use of already scarce public housing units to those who actually  need them by establishing an earnings  cap. Eliminating Federal subsidies for  over-income families has always been  key to this discussion. While most wait  lists for public housing stretch into the  tens of thousands, families who should  not receive subsidies, in fact, often do.  Plain  and  simple,  public  housing  should be reserved for those who are  most in need.  Finally, H.R. 3700 ensures that our  veterans have fair access to HUD housing and homeless assistance programs.  With nearly 50,000 homeless vets nationwide, we can and need to do more  in this area.  Mr. Chairman, as a member of the  House Committee on Financial Services and of the House Subcommittee on  Housing and Insurance, I thank Chairfor his leadership  on this issue over the last year, as addressing housing reform is something  that is not without controversy.  I urge my colleagues to support this  measure.  ",2016
84,House,114,0.427,23,2016-02-02,Mr. GUINTA.," Mr. Chairman, I am  proud to speak in support of H.R. 3700,  the  Housing  Opportunity  Through  Modernization Act, sponsored by Representatives  and  LUETKEMEYER CLEAVER.  This extremely bipartisan bill makes  a number of critical reforms to our  Federal housing programs. These programs will streamline processes and  create much-needed  efficiencies  for  government  and, most  importantly,  our consumers.  I am happy to see the bill moving so  quickly because it will solve a number  of  problems  low-income Americans  continue to face in acquiring safe and  affordable housing.  This  legislation would make commonsense changes to the Department  of Housing and Urban Development in  order to  lighten administrative burdens for housing agencies and owners  to assist  low-income  individuals and  families to live in greater dignity.  It is very encouraging to see the bipartisan work that has been done on  this bill. I commend both Chairman  and Ranking Member  CLEAVERof the Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee.  I  thank  Chairman  LUETKEMEYERfor allowing me to speak  on this bill.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of H.R. 3700.  ",2016
85,House,114,0.492,37,2016-02-02,Mr. PALAZZO.," Mr. Chair, I want to  thank my  colleague  for  expressing  some good points. This amendment actually continues to allow residents of  housing authorities to have a strong  voice.  It monitors the situation not just in  our housing authorities that we are  trying to exempt under States where  their  constitution  prohibits  board  members  from being able to sit on  boards where they have a monetary or  fiscal interest in that. It is a huge conflict of interest.  We are not going after all 2,700-plus  public housing authorities. We are just  trying to make sure the States that  have  constitutions  prohibiting  such  blatant disregard to common sense and  having that conflict of interest are protected.  Apparently, there is a personal interest in the one jurisdiction.

88,Senate,114,-0.276,65,2016-02-02,Mr. REID.," Madam President, in recent weeks the Nation has become concerned, afraid, and even outraged to  learn that nearly 100,000 people who are  residents of the city of Flint, MI, have  been poisoned. About  9,000 of  those  poisoned are children under the age of  6 years.  Two years ago, in an effort to pinch  pennies, an unelected emergency manager appointed by Governor Rick Snyder switched the water supply from the  city of Flint, MI, water source to the  Flint River. Water  from  the Flint  River is contaminated with lead, bacteria that causes Legionnaires’ disease,  and lots of other bad things. As a result, the residents of Flint, MI, were  forced to drink the water.  There is no trick photography here.  This is a person in Flint, MI. You could  go to any house you wanted to go to.  This is the water that they were drinking and bathing in. It is hard to comprehend that this went on for such a  long time.  Can you imagine taking a bath in  this, brushing your teeth, or drinking  it? How about bathing a new baby?  This is your little bathtub.  Through no fault of their own, the  people of Flint, MI, are being forced to  endure a public health crisis that could  have been avoided. This is a manmade  crisis. We will never know the full extent of the damage to the people who  live  in Flint, MI—especially  to  the  children. They have been harmed because they have been poisoned by the  acts of the leadership in the State of  Michigan, especially the Governor of  the State of Michigan. The reckless decision  to  switch  to unsafe drinking  water was forced upon 100,000 people.  These people in Flint, MI, are now exposed  to water with high  levels of  lead—frighteningly  high  levels  of  lead—among other things. This is not  just lead. There is bacteria, and they  haven’t determined the full extent of  it. It is established.  I can remember when I first came to  this body many, many years ago. I had  the good fortune to chair a number of  hearings  in  the  environment  committee dealing with lead poisoning.  At the time that we studied it, lead  poisoning was  lead that children  ingested—children who lived in developments where there were large amounts  of lead-based paint. The children who  ate this lead—not on purpose—were not  what they could have been. It affected  their brains.  This lead in water, lead anyplace, affects the brain. It affects adults, too,  but especially children. Lead causes serious problems for adults, as I mentioned, but it is especially dangerous  for children, causing lifetime effects.  You can’t get well. They have a program where they try to take the blood  out and run it through a purifier. It  takes a long time, but there are no safe  levels of lead for children.  After the city made this wrong decision to switch its water source, it was  really very quickly that the citizens of  Flint complained that the water was  discolored, and it also smelled. Everyone began to develop rashes.  The response of State government  was appalling. Rick Snyder, the Governor of Michigan, is one of those who  berates  government  all  the  time.  Emails released  from his office  just  last week referred to a resident who  said she was told by a State nurse in  January 2015, a little over a year ago—  she was complaining about her son’s  elevated blood levels. The nurse told  this woman: It is just a few IQ points.  It is not the end of the world.  Can you imagine a health care worker telling someone: It is your baby, but  it is just a few IQ points. No big deal.  It is not the end of the world. This was  a State nurse.  The water was so poisonous that General Motors, the manufacturer of automobile parts there, stopped using the  source for their Flint engine operations  because the parts corroded during the  manufacturing process. They had to  stop using this water. People were still  drinking this water and bathing in this  water.  Despite overwhelming evidence that  a city in his State had lead poisoning,  Governor Snyder failed to act and protect the people of Flint. This went on  for a long time.  As Flint struggles to recover from  this terrible public health problem, an  investigation will determine who exactly is to blame for this reckless decision. We know who caused the problem.  This was a manmade disaster, as I  said earlier, but now we must act to  protect the residents of Flint. This protection should start with repairs to  their water infrastructure. Like many  cities—and there are quite a few in the  Midwest—Flint has lead pipes, but the  highly corrosive nature of the Flint  River damaged them. It ate away at  the insides of those pipes. Now these  lead pipes are leaching into the clean  water supply from Lake Huron. It will  cost over $1 billion to replace Flint’s  corroded water infrastructure.  The people in Flint, MI, are struggling. There has been money  spent  there. Flint had been doing quite well  until this came along. There was a new  vitality. But now people are afraid to  eat in restaurants, and the businesses  have been terribly damaged because  people don’t believe the water is pure.  A lot of these restaurants, for example,  put  in  their own water  supply and  water purification system, but people  don’t believe it. They are afraid.  We need this done now. The State  and Federal Government must cooperate now to end this crisis, which requires that we make investments. I repeat: now.  President Obama has declared a state  of emergency in Flint, MI, and given  FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the authority to provide resources for the people of Flint.  The problem is that right now they are  just getting bottled water. The infrastructure is so bad.  Governor  Snyder  has  finally—finally—declared a state of emergency  and finally apologized for his administration’s slow response. The Governor’s  apology is too late. The residents of  Flint have already been poisoned.  It is too bad the people on that side  of the aisle disparage the government  all the time. It is too intrusive. It is  too involved. It is detrimental to our  society.  The Governor of Michigan is one of  the leading cheerleaders of that theory.  He denigrates government every single  chance he gets. But to whom does he  turn when the State of Michigan is in  trouble? To the Federal Government.  When emergency strikes, the Federal  Government steps in. That is one of the  responsibilities we  have  to  protect  America.  So I hope Senate Republicans will  support our efforts to protect the people of Flint in this time of need. Senator MURKOWSKI—the chair of that important committee that has jurisdiction of the bill that is before this body  today—is working with Senator CANTWELL. They are committed to doing  something to help in this. Let’s make  sure we support them.  Sadly, some of the same Republicans  who have called for relief when their  States faced natural disasters are disparaging government action in Flint.  For example, last year, Texas was devastated with historic flooding. But who  stepped in? It was the Federal Government that stepped in to provide disaster relief for the people of Texas.  That is why I was disappointed to see  the senior Senator  from Texas say:  ‘‘While we  all  have  sympathy  for  what’s happened in Flint, this is primarily  a  local  and  state  responsibility.’’ He didn’t say that when the  flooding was taking place in Texas.  Last year, as Florida was hit with extreme  flooding,  the  junior Senator  from Florida called for Federal disaster  assistance. But when it comes to the  children and families of Flint, the Senator, who finished third last night in  the  Iowa caucuses, cautions against  any action. This is what he said about  Flint:  ‘‘I believe the  federal government’s role in some of these things (is)  largely limited unless it involves a federal jurisdictional issue.’’  Well, the issue was that the State of  Michigan didn’t do what it was supposed to do.  The junior Senator from Florida is  not alone. Republican Senators routinely rush to the floor to demand Federal aid when trouble hits their backyard. That is the right thing to do.  Americans help each other in times of  crisis.

90,Senate,114,-0.406,86,2016-02-02,Mr. SCHATZ.," Mr. President,  this  amendment is based on a very simple  idea: that there should be a level playing field for fossil fuels and for clean  energy. Right now we have subsidies on  both the fossil fuel side and on the  clean  energy  side  through our Tax  Code. Periodically, we need to recalibrate our energy policy based on market conditions,  fiscal circumstances,  and what is happening in the world.  Again, here is the idea: We should  make  sure  to  reevaluate  tax  preferences for fossil fuels and clean energy at the same time. If we are serious  about creating a level playing field, we  should phase out incentives for fossil  fuels as we phased them out for wind  and solar power. Majorities of both  Democrats  and Republicans  support  the repeal of these tax preferences, and  so I hope my colleagues will join me in  a big bipartisan vote for putting our  clean sources of energy on equal footing with their fossil fuel counterparts.  ",2016
91,Senate,114,0.208,86,2016-02-02,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, we  have seen an iteration of this before. It  is Groundhog Day, but there is a difference with  the approach  that has  been taken with regard to targeting oil  and gas production with this basket of  fossil fuel subsidies, where we are talking about the repeal of five very important tax provisions that are vital to  our domestic small and midsize operators.  The sponsor is correct. It does tie the  expiration of these provisions to the  expiration of wind tax credits, which  most of us would agree  should be  phased out.  I am in favor of reforming our Tax  Code to make it more straightforward  and fair. I would welcome that discussion for us to engage in broad-based tax  reform on the Senate floor, but the Energy Policy Modernization Act is not  the place to do it. It is not the appropriate venue for a tax amendment. As  my colleagues know, all revenue-raising measures must originate within the  House. The adoption of this tax-related  amendment would therefore create an  impermissible blue-slip problem.  I urge its rejection.  ",2016
92,Senate,114,0.323,86,2016-02-02,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President, I  urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote because I think an  important part of a Republican pro-  growth policy is support for government-sponsored research. That is how  we got 3–D mapping and horizontal  drilling that led to unconventional gas  and oil. That is how we are going to get  the cost of carbon capture low enough  to make it commercial. That is how we  are going to get solar panels cheap  enough to make them useful.  We should reduce wasteful spending  on subsidies for mature energy technology and double energy research, and  this would do that on a conservative  path. At 5 percent a year, it would take  10 years to double the $5 billion of energy spending we have today.  I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.  ",2016

94,,114,-0.484,149,2016-02-02,Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise to celebrate National Freedom Day 2016,  a holiday established  to  recognize  the day  President Abraham Lincoln signed  the 13th  Amendment freeing enslaved Blacks. On February 1, 1941, Major Richard Robert Wright,  Sr. invited national and local leaders to meet  in Philadelphia to formulate plans to set aside  February 1st each year  to memorialize  the  signing of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution by President Lincoln on February 1,  1865. One year after Major Wright’s death in  1947, a bill passed both U.S. Houses of Congress making February 1st National Freedom  Day.  Major Wright is recognized as a post reconstruction pioneer and trailblazer who dedicated  his  life  to establishing  this national day of  commemoration of freedom. Each year on the  first day of Black History Month, National  Freedom Day Associations in cities and states  across the nation come together for this annual observance to promote goodwill, harmony  and equal opportunity and  to rededicate  the  nation to these ideals.  And, as we look back at the life of Major  Wright, we discover a true American story of  resilience,  foresight and  faith. He was born  into slavery in 1855. And, as a child he encountered retired Union Civil War General Oliver Otis Howard,  in an Atlanta classroom.  Summoning up unbelievable courage he said,  ‘Sir, tell them we are rising,’ ’ as a way to help  northerners understand  the hope of newly  freed Blacks. These words came to be Major  Wright’s lifelong mantra.  His personal ‘ ‘rising’ ’ included: serving as a  major in the Spanish-American War, founding  and leading Savannah State College; attending  the Wharton School of  the University of  Pennsylvania at the age of 67; and, founding  the Citizens and Southern Bank and Trust  Company,  in Philadelphia,  the only northern  Black-owned bank at the time.  Therefore, I am proud to honor the life and  contributions of Major Wright, a great American visionary and trailblazer and the National  Freedom Day Association as it stands as an  historic  reminder of our nation’s promise of  freedom and justice.  f  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  JOANN  GONYEA’S SERVICE TO THE CITY  OF TRENTON  HON.

95,,114,-0.419,149,2016-02-02,Mrs. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Joann Gonyea for her 31 years of  service in the Parks and Recreation Department of Trenton, Michigan.  Joann began her career with  the City of  Trenton Parks and Recreation Department as  a Program Coordinator in 1985. She became  the Assistant Director in 1990 and served in  that role for 20 years before being appointed  Director in 2011.  Many of the events and activities for which  Trenton  has  become  known  started with  Joann. During an internship with Wayne County Parks 31 years ago, she designed  the  ‘Somewhere  in Time ’ ’ event which captures  the spirit of the iconic Elizabeth Park in the  early 1900’s and engages residents with the  history of their city. Joann has also been the  driving force behind the ‘ ‘Community Builds’ ’  program and  the  ‘Healthy Trenton  Initiative’ ’  which both promote healthy and active  lifestyles by emphasizing teamwork.  Joann  is  instrumental  in  the success of  community events  in Trenton and  is well  known for her ability to organize and inspire  volunteers. Many projects, including the recent  addition of a playground to Affholter Park, are  finished in record time due to the groundswell  of community support Joann encourages. It’s  because she practices what she preaches,  and generously dedicates her time to organizations throughout the Downriver community,  such as the International Wildlife Refuge Alliance where she serves as a board member.  Joann is part of the heart and soul of Trenton, Michigan and the Downrivers. Tonight, we  recognize  Joann with  the Duane Brannick  award for outstanding service to the city, an  award which  is annually given  to  leaders  in  the city that go above and beyond. I know that  Joann  is  the perfect  recipient of  this prestigious award and  I am proud  to call her a  friend.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  today to honor Joann Gonyea for her 31 years  of service to the city of Trenton. I thank her for  her leadership, and wish her many years of  success.  f  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  DENNIS  HOLLOWAY’S SELECTION AS THE  RICHMOND COUNTY CHAMBER OF  COMMERCE 2015 CITIZEN OF THE  YEAR  HON.

Mr. Holloway represents the best our area has to offer,  and this selection illustrates the profound impact he has had on our community.  Mr. Holloway decided early in life to dedicate himself to helping others in need, and he  has not stopped that mission since. Mr. Holloway served in the United States Army as a  member of  the 82nd Airborne until he was  honorably discharged in 1967 after serious injuries he sustained during a training exercise  hindered his deployment. After surviving this  harrowing ordeal, Mr. Holloway worked in the  North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission  for 30 years.  The list of charitable acts Mr. Holloway has  carried out and the number of leadership positions within several community service organizations he holds demonstrates  the commitment he has made  to serving  those  in his  community, and beyond. As a recovery team  leader for the North Carolina Baptist Men, a  nondenominational organization dedicated  to  providing relief to those in need, Mr. Holloway  and his team have done everything from traveling down to South Carolina to assist families  recovering from the historic flooding that took  place last year to building wheelchair ramps at  the homes of disabled community residents.  Mr. Holloway is an inspiration to all the Richmond County community and  this award  is  truly a testament to the appreciation he has so  rightfully earned.  Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in congratulating Mr. Dennis Holloway for receiving this  prestigious distinction, and wishing him well as  he continues to serve the people of Richmond  County, North Carolina.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

100,House,114,0.661,12,2016-02-12,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to again  thank Ranking Member ELIOTENGEL  for his leadership on this issue. He is  my coauthor on this bill.  I would just like to concur in his  thoughts about the shocking nature of  this totalitarian regime, not  just  in  terms of the way it has treated its people,  but  also  its hostility  towards  South Korea and towards the United  States and to the West; and to just  share the thought, as he has expressed,  this level of struggle that the people  themselves  in North Korea  live  in  under this totalitarian state.  When I was in North Korea, I had an  opportunity  to  see  something  that  struck me just in terms of the malnutrition. The NGO community tells us  that close to 50 percent of those children are malnourished. What I saw in  terms of the malnourishment, the NGO  community says malnourished to the  point that it affects their ability to  learn.  The malnourishment can be seen everywhere. The actual height differential between  the average person  in  North Korea, it is 4 inches shorter than  in South Korea. That is a really stark  thing to see as you are in North Korea.  But the other observation that Mr.  ENGELmade was the overt hostility  shown to the United States and, of  course, to South Korea and to the rest  of the world.  I remember seeing the Cheonan. This  is a corvette. This was a South Korean  ship on which 46 South Koreans lost  their lives, over 50 were injured. It was  split in half by a torpedo from a North  Korean submarine. And they actually  lifted the two halves out of the water.  Inspecting that and looking at the letters, the last letters that some of those  young South Korean sailors had sent  home before they perished, it is just a  reminder, it is a reminder of how brutal that regime can be on its own people, but also on those against whom it  has ill intent. So the South Koreans  have suffered from this.  And now, to see them move forward  and try to expand this nuclear weapons  program, each new launch brings them  closer. They say they can hit the West  Coast of the United States. They are  claiming that they will be able to hit  the entire U.S. with their ICBM program. These placards that you see and  these posters actually show their missiles  coming  down  on  the United  States.  So, at this point, I think it is critical, and our colleagues in the Senate  feel the same way. I want to thank our  Senate colleagues for building upon the  House bill which ELIOTENGEL and I  have authored. And I also appreciate  the cooperation of the bipartisan House  leadership to ensure this bill’s quick  scheduling. It is just back from the  Senate.  In the wake of North Korea’s fourth  nuclear  test and  its  recent missile  launch, many of our allies also are trying to tighten the screws now on that  regime in order to slow its capability  to deliver this type of weapon. Only  days ago, South Korea shuttered the  Kaesong Industrial Complex because,  as they observed,  it was giving the  North Korean  regime  the hard currency it needed in order to move forward its weapons programs. This will  end a very important revenue for the  North Korean regime. Japan has issued  a new set of sanctions as well, and  China and Russia should take notice  and follow this example.  It is time for the United States to  stand with our partners in northeast  Asia as we press China and Russia to  follow suit, and this bill sends the message to that regime in North Korea  that they must reform and they must  disarm this nuclear weapons program.  By cutting off Kim Jong-un’s access to  the hard currency he needs  for his  army and his weapons, H.R. 757 will return us to the one strategy that has  worked:  financial  pressure  on  the  North Korean regime. So I urge the  passage of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2016
101,House,114,0.673,12,2016-02-12,Mr. SALMON.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  add my strong support to H.R. 757, the North  Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2016, a  critical bill to target the rogue Kim Jong Un regime in North Korea. I want to thank Chairman  EDROYCE for drafting this important piece of  legislation with Ranking Member ELIOTENGEL  and moving swiftly to bring it for a final vote  here in the House before sending it on to the  President. North Korea needs to know that it  cannot pursue a nuclear program without a  tough response  from  the United States and  our allies in the region.  This latest nuclear test and missile launch  test  fly  in  the  face of current  international  sanctions and against years and years of negotiation to end North Korea ’s nuclear ambitions.  By their actions, it is clear that North Korea  has every intention to continue advancing its  nuclear and missile programs, in an effort to  strengthen both domestic and international positions. This must stop here.  This bill before us  today will seize assets  connected with North Korea ’s proliferation program.  It will staunch  the  flow of cash  from  anyone  involved  in arms  trafficking,  luxury  goods, money laundering, and other means of  weapons proliferation in North Korea.  H.R. 757 will also target the regime’s horrendous and appalling human rights abuses,  by requiring  the Administration  to develop a  strategy  that would protect human  rights  in  North Korea and  identify  those  in  the North  Korean regime who violate basic human rights  and dignity.  The time is now to take action and punish  the North Korean regime for its destructive behavior. The time to act is now. We cannot wait  for  another  nuclear  test,  another missile  launch, another  island shelling, another ship  sinking, or another hacking attack. If the Administration will not act to hold the North Korean  regime  to account,  then  the Congress  must.  I am proud to vote in favor of H.R. 757 and  strongly  encourage  all  of my House  colleagues to join me.  ",2016
102,House,114,0.409,19,2016-02-12,Mr. GUTHRIE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Again, let me state what this bill is  not. It is not doing away with the calorie count or the ability for people to  understand what calorie content, or caloric content, is available in each product. I am one who looks at that. I don’t  know of anything that has a calorie  count on anything that I have eaten recently that I haven’t looked at. I have  checked out the serving sizes so that I  know how many chicken wings I want  to order. If I can get the calories per  chicken wing, I can make that determination.  We looked at the menu board that  was offered earlier, and it looked simple, but this is the issue: Even if you  put ranges, how do you get the information in people’s hands? I was just at  a restaurant, when I was traveling in  my district the other day, that had calories for different orders. One was from  400 to 800 on one. So what we want to  do is to make it available in a way that  is efficient, as most people now get  their information not necessarily on a  board where you have  to have big  ranges, but specific. For instance, at  one pizza restaurant alone, we had the  pizza slice plus a  few toppings; but  what if you have five styles of crust,  six different cheeses, five sauces, four  sizes, and 20 different toppings? If you  put all of that together, it comes to  about  34 million different  combinations, and deviations from the standard  that the FDA has put forward could  lead to fines and to criminal penalties.  What we are looking at, as my friend  from California said, are these rules  that are  incredibly complex, burdensome, and  inflexible. What this bill  does not do is create exemptions or diminish the amount of information that  must be provided by restaurants or retailers. All it does is allow for some  flexibility, and it clarifies the unworkable and overly complex regulations  the FDA finalized in November 2014. A  lot of things that happen here are overly cumbersome and unworkable. We go  to delay, to delay, and we delayed an  omnibus, as they said. These are going  to be unworkable 6 months from now  and a year from now.  So let’s fix it so that our businesses  know what to provide without their  having the threat of penalty, because  they will know what to provide, and so  that consumers can make choices. I am  one, as I said, who wants that information because I want to be able to make  that choice for myself and for my family.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2016
103,House,114,0.538,19,2016-02-12,Mr. PITTS.," Mr. Speaker, the bill before us  today takes an important step in protecting our  nation’s small businesses  from unnecessary  costs and regulatory burdens. The Common  Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act provides  for  flexibility for the food service industry to ensure they can comply with the regulatory requirements as issued by the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration (FDA).  Sadly, the rule issued by the FDA was declared to be the third most burdensome regulation proposed in 2010 and could cost American businesses $1 billion  to  comply and  500,000 hours of paperwork. The 400-page  rule establishes one-size-fits-all nutritional disclosure requirements.  H.R. 2017 is necessary to help small business owners,  franchisees, as well as consumers who want easy access to accurate nutrition information in a common sense way.  Without HR. 2017, covered establishments,  including pizza delivery businesses and grocery  stores, would be  subject  to a  cumbersome, rigid and costly regulatory compliance process to avoid violations and possible  criminal prosecution.  H.R. 2017  improves and clarifies  the  final  rule promulgated by the FDA implementing the  menu-labeling requirements of Section 4205 of  the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The concern is  that without the relief and flexibility provided  for in H.R. 2017, the final rule goes well beyond what was intended by the ACA.  The obligations are  imposed not only on  chain  restaurants—including delivery establishments, but also on any other chain retailer  that sells non-packaged food, such as grocery  store  salad bars, and  convenience  stores’  meals to go.  Small businesses  that are not chain  restaurants but are indeed subject to the rule will  face a dramatic increase in regulatory compliance costs. Consumers most assuredly will  see higher  food costs, and perhaps  fewer  choices. Some retailers may find it more advantageous  to  stop  selling  restaurant-type  food altogether. So  instead of purchasing  fresh sandwiches, consumers may have  to  buy pre-packaged sandwiches since those will  not require the retailer to comply with labeling  requirements.  Fixing this burdensome regulation will benefit tens of thousands of restaurants, grocery  stores, convenience stores and small business  owners that otherwise would be burdened with  regulations  that are costly and hurt  job creation.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides clarity,  flexibility, and certainty for these companies,  and also ensures consumers have access to  the  information  they need  to make  informed  nutritional decisions. I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 2017.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. HULTGREN).  All time for general debate has expired.

105,,114,-0.35,47,2016-02-12,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to  honor and  remember  former Representative  Mike Oxley who we  lost  last month. Today  would have been his 72nd birthday, so our  presence here tonight is a wonderful way to  commemorate his life of service. I remember  Mike most for his big smile, which could be  seen from across the Chamber, and his love  for his wife Patricia and his son Chadd.  Mr. Oxley grew up understanding the importance of service to his country, which he carried out to the very end. He started his career  working as a Federal Bureau of Investigations  agent in Boston and New York City. He frequently noted  this experience directed his  Congressional decisions and  that  set him  apart from other Members.  He returned to his hometown of Findlay—  Flag City—in 1972 to begin his career in elected office when he won a seat  in  the Ohio  House. For a decade he  sharpened and  honed his  legislative expertise, serving him  well for the next chapter of his life. In 1981, he  won a special election  to serve  in  the U.S.  House of Representatives.  I remember Mike relished working with his  fellow Ohio delegation, especially  the  late  Representative Paul Gillmor. Mr. Oxley dedicated his years of federal service to reforming  our banking and financial laws. As the Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services,  from 2001 to 2006, Ox demonstrated his leadership of Congress’ response during very troublesome financial times following the tech bubble struggles of the early 2000s, Wall Street  turmoil that followed the 9/11 attacks and corporate scandals  including Enron. While Mr.  Oxley and I were often on opposite sides, I  will always remember him as jovial, collegial,  and someone who had a great passion  for  public service.  I was proud to work with him on the Base  Realignment and Closure Commission as we  stopped a Pentagon  recommendation  to  reduce the size of the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center  in Lima. This effort saved  the  jobs of 750 people who continue to manufacture tanks and sections of armored vehicles,  including the best Army tank in the world, the  Abrams.  I was saddened when  I  learned  that Mr.  Oxley had been diagnosed with lung cancer.  In his fight against cancer, he demonstrated  his  true spirit, and his eternal dedication  to  service by joining the Lung Cancer Alliance in  2010. Always fighting for others even amidst  his own battle, he became the Board Chairman in January of 2014.  It was an honor and privilege to serve with  him and to pay tribute to his life. May his soul  rest in peace and may his family be comforted  by the memories they share of their times together and the joy he brought to living.  f  BORDER TO BORDER BROADBAND:  BETTER TOGETHER  HON.

109,,114,-0.256,54,2016-02-12,Ms. KUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, today we honor  Ms. Linda Horan, of Alstead, New Hampshire,  a ‘ ‘tenacious labor leader’ ’ and an ‘ ‘advocate  for  the people.’ ’  I was deeply saddened  to  hear the tragic news that Ms. Horan lost her  battle  to cancer. My  thoughts and prayers,  along with those of the entire Granite State,  are with Ms. Horan’s family and friends during  this difficult time.  Through her dedicated service as a social  justice activist and advocate, she made her  family, her state, and her nation proud. As her  IBEW 2320 colleagues so eloquently summarized,  ‘Sister Horan will  forever be  in our  hearts and her memory will live on in our spirit  as we continue to fight for the rights of workers and people everywhere in our attempt to  channel her eternal drive for equality.’ ’  The greatest  tribute we can provide  for  Linda Horan is to continue to remember her  passion and drive, and to celebrate her life by  combatting injustices. Her contributions will not  be soon  forgotten, as her beloved union’s  scholarship fund now carries her name. Hopefully, this will inspire future generations to follow  in her  footsteps and continue strengthening civic life in New Hampshire. We owe our  deepest gratitude to Linda Horan for helping to  make the Granite State a better place for us  all to live. In responding to such tragedies, our  community comes together and shows its capacity for resilience and strength.

112,House,114,0.538,8,2016-03-03,Mr. BYRNE.," Mr. Speaker, if I heard  the gentleman correctly, he wants an  open rule. Let me restate: we had no  amendments offered at the committee  of jurisdiction and no amendments offered before the Rules Committee, so  that would fly in the face of our desire  here to have regular order. What he has  proposed  is not regular order. He  is  proposing chaos, and I don’t think the  American people want us to be in chaos  around here.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from the great State of Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS), a great conservative leader.  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2016
113,House,114,0.371,8,2016-03-03,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for the time to speak on  the rule.  Our process for a bill to get to the  floor is it has to go through the Rules  Committee. This was a very, very important bill. It was interesting in the  debate, listening to the sides, because  there is an argument by constituents  of having clean bills: one bill, one  issue, simply understood, vote on it, instead of this horse trading that sometimes gets proposed: you give me this  for my giving you that. I can tell you  one thing, I know in my district they  really don’t like this. They want us to  be accountable for a bill.  I also get frustrated with how easy it  is to throw away  jobs: I only have  blank kilns  in my State. Those are  good-paying jobs for families, and they  are important to the fabric of those  communities. Just to say,  ‘‘Look,  I  have only got two. I don’t really worry  about them. Let’s trade them off’’ is  really troublesome, and I am sorry we  fall into that type of debate.  This is really part of a bigger debate  in that the courts have already done  this with the Clean Power Plan, the  climate change bill. The debate  is,  ‘‘Okay. EPA, you can do the regulation. Do  the  regulation.’’ What  the  EPA likes to do is do the regulation;  and they play this game: ‘‘We know it  is not legal, so we will impose the regulation. We know it is not legal. We are  going to  force  industry to comply,’’  and then when the courts say it is not  legal, they have already gone too far,  and the jobs have been lost.  That is factual. That is what happened in 2003. That is what happened  when the EPA promulgated the MACT  rules in 2003. The rules were vacated by  the Federal court  in 2007—vacated—  which means you can’t do it. But the  industry already was forced to do it, either to spend millions and millions of  dollars, or they had to close.  So fast-forward. Where are we today?  The courts have done this on the  Clean Power Plan,  the big  climate  change rule. What the Court just said  for the first time, the Supreme Court  said: No, we are not going to force the  States to implement the Clean Power  Plan until it is litigated in the courts.  They put a stay on everyone and said:  Don’t do anything. Let’s have the legislative-judicial debate and fight.  That is what this bill does. Let’s just  have the litigation on the legality of  this new rule. If it comes up that it is  legal, then the  industry  is going to  have to comply. But if it comes out  that it is not legal, guess what. We are  going to save jobs. We are going to save  communities, and we are going to save  the family income for two kilns in a  State or maybe more, depending upon  the brick-producing capability of individual States.  So I am down here just to thank the  Rules Committee for bringing this bill  to the floor.  I look forward to the debate. It is  much more  than brick kilns.  It  is  about when can the EPA force a company to do something. We would hope  they could only do it after it has been  ruled legal by the courts if someone  challenges a rule, and that is what this  does.  ",2016
114,House,114,-0.279,8,2016-03-03,Mr. POLIS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  b1000  There  is a way  that our process  works around here. If a rule is illegal,  it will be tossed out by the courts.  George Bush’s attempt to implement  the Clean Air Act, section 112, around  brick kilns was tossed out.  What this bill does is says that, so  long as  there  is a court challenge,  there is some sort of presumption that  the rule be tossed out and, therefore,  an indefinite stay.  Now, there can be challenges all the  time. The minute one  fails, another  one can be launched. No bones about it.  This would  indefinitely prevent this  rule from ever taking effect with regard to brick kilns.  I have to say, Mr. Speaker, I haven’t  heard from a single constituent on this  issue. Like the gentleman from Alabama, my constituents are angry. They  are angry at Congress and worried  about the direction of the country.  They want Congress to replace our  broken immigration system with one  that works and secure our southern  border. They want Congress to return  to fiscal responsibility and balance our  budget. They want to make sure that  college is affordable for the next generation. They want to make sure they  have good jobs here at home.  They want to make sure that we encourage companies to locate and grow  here in America rather than take tax  advantages for relocating overseas or  inverting their headquarters to occur  overseas, as occurs with today’s Tax  Code. Those are some of the many  issues that my constituents want me to  talk about here.  I just had a townhall meeting last  week in Fort Collins, Colorado, the biggest city in my district. About 100 people came. Not a  single person was  angry about brick kilns.  But, yes, there was a lot of anger  there about some of the issues I indicated: people frustrated with why Congress refuses to act on making college  more affordable, why Congress has refused to act in making sure that Medicare and Social Security are there for  the next generation, and why Congress  doesn’t put our country on the course  of fiscal responsibility and reduce our  debt-to-GDP ratio.  But, instead, we are debating a bill  that won’t become law without allowing amendments here on  the  floor.  That is what a closed rule means. If it  was an open rule, I would be able to  offer my amendment to close the small  site exemption with regard to fracking,  but I can’t.  We are debating a bill that won’t become  law, attacking a rule that  is  merely  implementing what Congress  has told not just this President, but  any President,  to do. George Bush  tried. Obama tried.  It  is because Congress, under  the  Clean Air Act, tells the executive: You  have to do this under section 112. And  then, when they do it, there is the issue  that went through the courts.  That  is appropriate. That  is their  role. But when they implement what  Congress has told them to do, we are  saying: No. There is an indefinite stay.  That is what this bill would do.  I know, Mr. Speaker, regardless of  what they think about any of the policies or rules put out by this administration or any administration, it is not  the place of Congress to issue stays on  rules. It is the role of the courts.  The Constitution established  three  branches in our government for a reason under our Constitution. It is the  courts’ job, not Congress’ job, to interfere with the legal process.  It is not Congress’ job to take that  responsibility away from the judicial  branch,  especially with a bill  that  would actually encourage more frivolous litigation by rewarding frivolous  litigation and endless appeals when we  already have too much of that in our  court system.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote ‘‘no’’ to defeat the previous question, which, if we succeed on that vote,  we can immediately get to hold hearings on  the President’s budget proposals.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on  the rule as well, again, a closed rule,  not allowing amendments here on the  floor of the House.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2016
115,House,114,0.303,15,2016-03-03,Mr. WHITFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  I will conclude my remarks over on  this side. I was listening to the debate  on the rule about this bill, and some  people did make the comment that this  was not a particularly important issue.  I might say to the 7,000 people employed in this industry, to the owners  of the companies, this is very important because some of them may very  well lose their business, may very well  lose their jobs.  So we have two goals with this legislation. One is simply to say this regulation coming out of EPA needs to be  considered by the courts before these  companies are required to invest significant sums of money.  In fact, the industry itself has said  that the average plant has two kilns,  and a plant with two kilns would have  to spend roughly $4 million to meet the  requirements of this regulation.  Now, remember, in 2003, EPA came  out with a regulation for this industry  and, by 2006, the industry had to comply. They did comply and they reduced  emissions of the regulated substance  by 96 percent.  We see a pattern developing at EPA.  They know full well that this President  would  veto  any  legislation  that  changes in any way anything coming  out of EPA, so the only avenue left to  the regulated parties is to file a lawsuit.  So just as the brick industry filed a  lawsuit in 2003 on that extreme regulation, they had to comply by 2006; and  then the Court, in 2007, after they had  already complied, ruled that the regulation was illegal, but the money had  already been spent.  Now, the money has already been  spent,  96 percent  reduction has occurred, and now the EPA is coming  back with a new regulation.  So these people involved, they have  no avenue. I mean, they are talking to  EPA, pleading with EPA, and EPA, as  usual, is not responsive.  So all this legislation does is say, we  are not trying to reverse the regulation, change the regulation. We are  simply saying, let the Court decide.  And guess what?  A pattern is also developing over at  EPA because  they are  losing  these  court cases.  Now,  on  the Clean Energy Plan,  which was one of the most extreme regulations ever to come from EPA, 3 days  before Judge Scalia died, the Supreme  Court issued a stay on the Clean Energy Plan, saying that you cannot implement this plan until the  judicial  remedies have been exhausted.  Then, even under Utility MACT, that  also went to the Supreme Court, and  the Court said, well, you didn’t consider certain costs; we are remanding  this. But most of the industries have  already spent the money, met the requirements, and some of them have  closed as well.  So  the question becomes, are we  going to let an EPA adopting extreme  rules under this administration make  all the decisions?  Or will the Congress of the United  States try to stand up and pass some  legislation, not reversing, not changing, but simply saying, since lawsuits  have been filed, let’s give the Court the  opportunity to determine if the regulation is legal or not legal?  So that is all we are doing here.  I want to thank those who introduced  this  legislation, both the Democrats  and Republicans. And I would urge our  colleagues to pass this legislation, to  simply provide some commonsense balance, and let the courts make a decision before we require the companies to  spend all this money and,  in many  cases, lay off employees and, in some  cases, even close the business.  So I would urge the passage of H.R.  4557.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2016
116,House,114,0.339,15,2016-03-03,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker, we have the opportunity today to help many struggling small  businesses and the jobs they support by voting yes on H.R. 4557, the BRICK Act.  How did we get here? Last October,  the  EPA finalized an extremely stringent new rule  for the brick making industry. Most of the companies that find themselves threatened by this  rule are small businesses—many are family-  owned—and the industry is still dealing with  the effects of the recession and the weak recovery that continues to suppress demand for  bricks and other building materials. Few,  if  any, brick makers can easily afford the estimated $4.4 million dollars it will take to bring  a typical facility into compliance and the industry is currently challenging the rule in federal  court.  The BRICK Act simply extends the compliance deadlines for the rule until after judicial  review is complete. This commonsense step  would prevent brick makers from having to initiate costly and potentially irreversible compliance steps—and  in some cases shut  their  doors entirely and lay off workers—over a rule  whose legality is still in question.  This  is  far  from a hypothetical concern.  EPA’s last set of Brick standards in 2003 were  vacated by a federal court in 2007, but by that  time the industry had already been forced to  spend millions on compliance. None of us  want to see that happen again. It’s a matter of  fairness. It’s a matter of commonsense.  For the sake of brick makers and their thousands of employees across  the country,  including nearly 2,000  in Michigan  I urge my  colleagues to vote yes on the BRICK Act.  ",2016
117,Senate,114,-0.351,36,2016-03-03,Mr. SCHUMER.," Almost every poll  shows the majority of Americans favor  action.  Mr. President, just one more point.  It is not right to do what the committee is doing, and I sincerely hope  the chairman will reconsider his position. If Republicans truly respect the  Constitution, they should follow it and  consider a nomination from the sitting  President  rather  than play political  games.  I yield back to my dear friend, our  outstanding  leader on the Judiciary  Committee, Senator LEAHY.  ",2016
118,Senate,114,0.427,36,2016-03-03,Mr. TILLIS.," I thank the Presiding  Officer.  Mr. President, I didn’t have any intention to speak today, but one of the  blessings of being a freshman Member  is you get the opportunity to preside  and hear the arguments that are going  on in the Chamber and the discussion  about the SCOTUS nomination. We are  going to have to agree to disagree with  our friends from across the aisle on the  SCOTUS nomination.  Let’s take a look at what is going on  here.  In North Carolina, over the past 24  hours, some four people have died of a  drug overdose. We had more deaths associated with drug overdoses than we  had with car accidents last year.  So what is going on here? Back in  2008,  there was an opioid epidemic.  There was a supermajority in the U.S.  Senate. There was a Democrat in the  White House and a majority  in the  House of Representatives. No action. In  2010,  the  epidemic was growing.  In  places in New England, in the Midwest,  down in the South, people were dying.  Yet there was no action.  Now this Congress has taken action.  I think it is time to move the CARA  bill. To hold hostage the CARA bill and  shift the discussion to a genuine disagreement we have with the minority  on SCOTUS is literally costing lives.  For those who sit here and want to  hold up the CARA bill for the purposes  of discussing the SCOTUS nomination,  we don’t even have a nominee yet.  There is going to be plenty of time in  committee and plenty of time on the  floor to debate this difference of opinion between the minority and the majority. But in the meantime, for people  who would hold up passing the CARA  bill  over  the SCOTUS  nomination,  what are you going to tell the two people—last week, two  friends of mine,  when they heard my speech on the Senate floor, came to me and said: Thank  you for moving this bill. I lost my son  a year and a half ago.  Two of my  friends have told me:  Thank you for helping us increase the  visibility and get to a point to where  we are saving these lives.  Those who would hold up the CARA  bill, what are you going the tell the  first  responders who,  if  they  had  naloxone, could have potentially saved  the life of somebody who has fallen on  the floor and died? What are you going  to tell them? What are you going to  tell the law enforcement officers who  are trying to help people live who have  succumbed  to  addiction  and  opioid  abuse? What are you going to tell them  by holding up this bill? What are you  going to tell the parents who are struggling, who need help with education,  who need help with their incarcerated  children who may have succumbed to  addiction, who did a wrong thing and  are in prison and now need help? They  need to be rehabilitated. They need to  be saved.  At some point, we need to recognize  that we do need to do things separately. We need to recognize that it is  disgraceful to hold up the CARA bill  over a genuine disagreement we are  going to have for months.

120,,114,-0.478,85,2016-03-03,Mr. RUSH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute  to Morgan Park High School  in Chicago, Illinois as it celebrates its 100th Anniversary.  The centennial celebration is a highly anticipated milestone for most organizations. However, only a select group gets the honor of actually celebrating one hundred years of existence and Morgan Park High School  is now  among them. Since its inception in 1916 when  it opened its doors to less than 300 students,  Morgan Park has been a champion for educational exceptionalism. Morgan Park  is set  apart during  this momentous occasion as a  bearer of academic excellence, a  laboratory  for stellar educators, and the training ground  for  talented and  intellectually-stimulated students.  Mr. Speaker, the Mustang family is also a  clan of notable alumni. Among them is physician, NASA Astronaut, and  the  first African-  American woman  in  space Mae  Jemison;  Singer,  songwriter,  and  record  producer  Jeremih;  Actor  Michael  Colyar;  Chicago  Teachers Union and American Federation of  Teachers leader Jacqueline B. Vaughn; Inventor James C. Bliss; and NFL Player Corbin  Bryant—to name a few. Mr. Speaker, I would  be remiss if, amongst this list of notable alumni, I did not mention my dedicated and diligent  Chief of Staff, Reverend Stanley Watkins.  The list of prestigious accomplishments that  have emerged from the Mustang family is a  testament of why Morgan Park High School is  still standing 100 years strong. Mr. Speaker,  100 is a special number because it marks two  significant  transitions:  the conclusion of one  century and the beginning of a new one. While  this is a time to celebrate the many victories  and cherished moments of the passing century, it is also the moment in which we pause  to reflect upon it critically to identify our shortcomings so that we can learn from them and  better shape our future.  So, Mr. Speaker,  this year we celebrate  both our beginning and our becoming. We celebrate the struggles of the past 100 years and  we embrace  the challenge of  the next 100  years. We commend the triumphant strides of  the many leaders that have been birthed from  this rich Mustang blood. We unleash the unbridled Mustang spirit upon those who are being  groomed now and those who are still to come.  Mr. Speaker,  therefore, we  recognize  this  great  achievement  and  commend Morgan  Park High School for bestowing upon so many  the opportunity of a lifetime; to pass through  its halls, to sit in its classrooms, and to play  on its courts.  Go Mustangs and congratulations on reaching your centennial.  f  RECOGNIZING THE 75TH  ANNIVERSARY OF M&Ms  HON.

121,,114,0.478,85,2016-03-03,Mr. WEBSTER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, it is  my pleasure to recognize Mars, Incorporated  as  they celebrate  the 75th anniversary of  M&Ms today, March 3, 2016.  Forrest Mars Sr.,  son of Mars  founder,  Franklin Mars, got  the  inspiration  for M&Ms  while running the family candy business in the  United Kingdom. Mars encountered soldiers  eating small chocolate candies encased in a  hard shell as part of their rations. These hard  shell chocolate candies resisted melting. Forrest Mars turned the concept into M&Ms and  a world-renowned brand of candy. By the mid-  1950s, M&Ms had become  the number one  candy in the United States.  Mars, Incorporated has five governing principles that deserve our recognition. First, they  establish quality of  their work as  their  first  goal. Second, they require total responsibility  from  every member  of  their  organization.  Third, they seek out how to mutually serve everyone in a business relationship with them.  Fourth, they strive to never waste resources.  Fifth, as one of  the world ’s  largest  family-  owned companies, they embrace the freedom  to do business with high standards.  After visiting M&Ms and Mars  facilities  in  Central Florida and learning about their principle-based business model, I have come to  respect this company. Mars is a quality, family-owned organization, and  I wish M&Ms a  happy 75th anniversary.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. RENEE L.

123,,114,-0.455,85,2016-03-03,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor Lin Schmale, who recently retired from  The Society of American Florists where she  was senior director of government  relations  and an advocate for flower and plant growers  across the nation. Lin is someone known for  tenacity and fearlessness—as well as collaboration and kindness. A walking encyclopedia  of  the  federal bureaucracy, she has a  long  and well-documented history  for promoting  teamwork and partnerships to accomplish the  sometimes seemingly impossible.  For 22 years, Lin fought for the floral industry on Capitol Hill and  throughout countless  federal agencies, bringing  together diverse  people, groups and agencies, and standing  her ground on issues that directly affect the  livelihood of growers, wholesalers,  retailers  and suppliers.  Known for her sharp intellect and her ability  to grasp and then distill complex issues, Lin  has played a lead role in two critically important areas:  first,  through her efforts,  federal  funds are now available to conduct important  research on floral and nursery crops; and second, she has dedicated countless hours to ensure safe and efficient transportation of flowers and plants within  the United States and  across international borders.  When Lin started working at SAF, the Floral  and Nursery Research  Initiative  (FNRI) had  been created and was poised to be a source  of needed  funding  for  research across  the  country. While the structure was in place, and  there was support in Congress and the USDA,  the Initiative needed more visibility. However,  putting her knowledge of the federal and political bureaucracy to work, and calling on a vast  network of colleagues and peers on the Hill,  Lin soon helped take the Initiative to the next  level. What was initially a glimmer in the eyes  of  the  industry soon became a multi-million  dollar annual USDA  research program  that  today funds a wide variety of research benefitting not only the floral and nursery industries  but literally all of agriculture. And the U.S. Department of Agriculture has called the Initiative  a model program for private and public sector  collaboration.  As the international movement of floral products has  increased, Lin ’s role  in addressing  pest and disease issues took on more importance.  When  the pathogen Ralstonia  first  threatened to disrupt the country’s supply of geraniums, Lin made sure the industry maintained  a respectful yet loud voice in often difficult negotiations between the USDA, the Department  of Homeland Security and other agricultural  groups. Leveraging her deep connections  in  Washington, she brought interested parties together to craft a realistic and workable solution  that protected the geranium industry first and  foremost, but also addressed  the needs of  other agricultural groups and the federal government. That was no small feat, and some  people have said, without exaggeration,  that  Lin saved the geranium industry in the United  States.  Over the years, Lin has been a strong industry advocate and negotiator in many other  VerDate Sep 11 2014  04:18 Mar 04, 2016 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K03MR8.004 E03MRPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T Q 7 6 K S D l n o d a n o d c m e         ",2016
124,House,114,0.566,9,2016-03-15,Mr. CARTER of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Senator  Tommie Williams and his retirement  from the Georgia State Senate.  Since first being elected to office in  1998, Senator Williams has spent the  last 18 years representing his South  Georgia constituents in extraordinary  fashion.  Through the years, Senator Williams’  hard work and passion has flourished  as he has moved through the ranks  from majority leader to President pro  tempore, always working to keep Georgia’s economy growing.  As a true conservative from Lyons,  Georgia, a great  friend, and a passionate  lawmaker, Senator Williams’  service to the State of Georgia will be  missed. I wish my friend the best of  luck in his future endeavors.  f  NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY  (Mr. BENISHEK asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2016
125,House,114,0.491,9,2016-03-15,Mr. BENISHEK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in celebration of National Agriculture Day. Today we celebrate the  farmers  and  ranchers who  literally  work to put the food on our dinner tables.  Last week I was in Posen, Michigan,  and met the Styma family. They are  growing hundreds of thousands of potatoes each year that families across the  country will enjoy.  The next time you put a cherry on  your ice cream sundae, think of Glen  and Ben LaCross, who not only work  full time raising cherries in northern  Michigan, but also manage a fruit processing business to make delicious products, like maraschino cherries and pie  fillings,  available  in Michigan  and  around the country.  Farmers, ranchers, and agribusiness  owners and workers don’t just provide  food and fiber for the Nation; they are  an important part of our economy.  In Michigan alone, the agriculture  industry contributes over $100 billion  annually to the economy, accounting  for a quarter of Michigan’s workforce.  As a member of the House Committee  on Agriculture, I want to thank the  farmers, producers, and agribusiness  workers who feed and clothe America’s  families.  f  COMMUNICATION FROM THE  CLERK OF THE HOUSE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  of Minnesota) laid before the  House  the  following  communication  from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:  EMMER OFFICEOFTHECLERK,  HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, DC, March 15, 2016.

RES. 640  Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the  House the bill  (H.R. 4596) to ensure that  small business providers of broadband Internet access service can devote resources to  broadband deployment rather than compliance with cumbersome regulatory requirements.

128,House,114,0.491,23,2016-03-15,Mr. ROTHFUS.," Mr. Chairman,  it  would be great  for Pennsylvania to  come up with a customization on its  own, but that would take a couple of  years for approval from the EPA. In  the meantime,  these plants will be  closed.  Few, if any, conventional coal plant  owners have expressed concerns about  the SENSE Act. Bear in mind, we are  talking about an overall allocation for  SO2 and a reconfiguring within that  overall  allocation. So  there  is not  going to be an increase in SO2; it will  be a mere customization and allocation, and it should have been done and  should have been allowed by the EPA.  While the President may have issued  a veto threat, my hope is, before the  President would  follow  through  on  such a veto threat, that he would come  to  western  Pennsylvania,  that  he  would walk the hills with me, that he  would see the streams that have come  back to life, that he would talk to Tim  and talk to Bill and talk to the men  and women at these plants who are  taking care of their families, so they  can say, ‘‘Mr. President, we need some  help here. Our communities have been  economically distressed. We are sustaining our communities with these  jobs. We are raising our kids with these  jobs. What we don’t like, Mr. President, are these one-size-fits-all edicts  coming out of Washington, D.C., that  give our States and communities the  burden of complying—totally excluding  the benefits that have been happening  on the ground.’’  Again, to see these places that have  been reclaimed is remarkable. It is my  hope that the President would visit  those places before he follows through  on any kind of veto threat.  ",2016

165,Senate,114,-0.473,58,2016-03-15,Mr. MERKLEY.," Mr. President, I wish  to continue sharing some information  about Monsanto and the Deny Americans the Right to Know Act that is on  the Senate floor being debated right  now.  The reason I want to turn to this is  this is such an egregious overreach of  the  Federal  Government,  stripping  States of the right to respond to their  citizens’ desire for clear information,  consumer-friendly  information,  on  GE—genetically  engineered—ingredients and stripping American citizens of  the right to know.  I have already gone through a number of the points that are important in  this debate; that if you are going to  eliminate the ability of States to provide consumer-friendly information on  their label—which can be as simple as  a tiny symbol or a letter such as Brazil  uses—then there has to be a national  standard  that  provides  consumer-  friendly  information. Certainly,  the  hall of mirrors embedded in the DARK  Act, which says consumers have to call  call  centers  somewhere  around  the  world and maybe they will eventually  get an answer to their question about  GE ingredients or they have to own a  smartphone and have a data plan and  take a picture of a computer code and  give up some of their privacy in the  process in order to try to find out this  information or  they have  to guess  where on social media the company has  posted some information about the ingredients they have in their product—  those  three  sets of components are  completely unworkable, 100 percent unworkable.  Ask yourself if that would be a logical remedy to people trying to find out  about the calories in a product. Instead  of finding out in one second, it could  take them 10 minutes or, for that matter, an hour or they may never even  get an answer on the end of that call  center because the call center is too  busy.  The point is that 9 out of 10 Americans believe this information should be  easily available on the label. I went  through  those numbers  before. The  numbers are basically the same for Republicans,  basically  the  same  for  Democrats  and  Independents—slight  variations. Throughout the ideological  spectrum, this is something American  citizens agree on. Along comes  the  Monsanto DARK Act  and  its  proponents to say: We don’t care that the  American people have  finally  found  something to agree on that goes to  their core values about the right to  know. We are going to stomp out their  right to know because we simply don’t  work  for  the American people. We  don’t work  for our constituents. We  work for some powerful special interest.  That is wrong. I hope the American  citizens will let their Senators know it  is wrong. They are certainly letting me  know how they feel, and I thought I  would share some of those with you,  but before I do that, I had some inquiries about this situation of basically all  citizens  throughout  the  ideological  spectrum sharing this same point of  view—9 out of 10. Is it also true for gender and age? Let me share that. Specifically, there was a followup question  which asked: Does a barcode work to  provide information on the label or do  you want a physical label stating that  there  are GE  ingredients? Physical  label versus this barcode—which people  don’t even know where it is on the  package.  It turns out again it is 90 percent. It  is 88 percent of Democrats, 88 percent  of Republicans, and 90 percent of Independents say: No, we want the physical  label, not some mysterious label that  we have to use our smartphone to interpret and give up some of our privacy.  How about men and women—87 percent of men, 97 percent of women.  How about younger and older—those  who are less than 50 years old, 86 percent; those who are over 50 years old, 90  percent. Again, basically 9 out of 10  Americans,  regardless of gender,  regardless of age, regardless of ideology,  say: No, this is a fundamental issue of  American freedom, my freedom to exercise my choices based on basic information that should be on the label.  Let’s turn to some real constituents  and some real letters so we are not just  talking numbers.  Bertha from Springfield writes:  I urge you to vote against SB 2609 concerning labeling of foods that contain GMOs.  Every American has the right to know what  they are putting in their bodies. You were  elected to represent all Oregonians and protect our rights, be assured I will check yours  and  every  other  representatives’  voting  records before I cast my votes in the future.  Let’s turn to Eli from Medford, OR:  I want to hear you come out publicly  against S. 2609. Please lead the fight to get  GMOs clearly labeled without delay.  Well, Eli, that is exactly what I am  doing. I hadn’t read your letter before  I started speaking out strongly because  I fundamentally believe we are here to  represent  our  citizens—not  to  bow  down to special interests—and this is  as clear as it gets. This is as straightforward as it could possibly be.  Let’s turn to Ms. JC in Salem, OR:  Please, I am requesting you NOT to support (S. 2609) (referred by some as the Dark  Act) when it comes up for a vote in the Senate. I know the Senate Agricultural Committee voted 14–6 to pass the Dark Act S.  2609  last week.  I believe the government  should protect OUR RIGHT TO KNOW what’s  in our food. Please DO NOT VOTE to block  GMO labeling.

167,,114,-0.393,86,2016-03-15,Ms. SEWELL of Alabama.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  in honor of Restoration Tuesday and  March being Women’s History month; I rise to  acknowledge  the role of women  in  the continuing battle for protecting our constitutional  right to vote.  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was only  made possible because of the brave men and  women who marched, —and were willing to die  for voting equality as  they crossed  the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday. Moreover,  the narrative of  the battle  for voting  rights  in America  is  incomplete without  the  story of the strong contributions of the women  who helped to advance these efforts. Nearly a  decade has passed since Congress reauthorized  the Voting Rights Act of 1965  in July  2006. This reauthorization not only continued  to guarantee protections against modern day  voting barriers,  it elevated  three mothers of  the civil rights movement  in  its  title: Fannie  Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott  King. Honoring these great women who fought  for equality and  justice,  this  reauthorization  stamped a day  in  time where both parties  were able to come together and show overwhelming support for the most essential right  on which this great democracy was founded,  the right to vote.  However, when  the Supreme Court struck  down Section 4 pre-clearance and federal protection for vulnerable communities in 2013, a  number of states, including Alabama, passed  restrictive laws designed to suppress the vote.  It is imperative that we remain ever vigilant in  upholding the legacy, not only of the historic  women for which the reauthorization of the Act  was named, but of the three women who sat  on the Supreme Court bench and gave dissenting opinions following the tragic Section 4  strike down.  Whether protesting from the streets or the  Supreme Court  bench, women  have  long  played a vital role in the movement for voting  rights  in America’s history. As we celebrate  the  rich history of women  in politics during  Women’s History Month, we honor the conviction and determination of women like Susan B.  Anthony and Amelia Boynton Robinson who  fought relentlessly for equality for the ultimate  benefit of our country as a whole. When  women succeed, America succeeds and Congress should honor the fight and sacrifice by  passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act of  2016.  Fannie Lou Hamer  is  famous  for stating  what so many were feeling then and still feel  now when she said— ‘I am sick and tired of  being sick and tired. ’ ’ Like the brave women of  our past, we all need to be sick and tired of  injustice and  inequality. On  this Restoration  Tuesday, we honor  the women who championed the cause of protection of our sacred  and fundamental right to the polls.  Tuesday, March 15, 2016  ",2016
168,,114,0.371,86,2016-03-15,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, our Nation’s  Vietnam War Commemoration gives us  the  opportunity  for all Americans  to  recognize,  honor, and thank our Vietnam Veterans and  their  families  for  their service and sacrifices  during  the Vietnam War  from November 1,  1955 through May 15, 1975.  Over 9,000 organizations across America  have joined with the Department of Defense  as a Commemorative Partner to honor our Nation ’s Vietnam Veterans,  including Benjamin  Mills Chapter, NSDAR; the Illinois State Organization, NSDAR; and the National Society of  the Daughters of the American Revolution.  This year’s commemoration  includes nine  million Americans, approximately 7.2 million of  them living today, and makes no distinction as  to who served  in-country,  in-theater, or was  stationed elsewhere during those 20 years—  all answered the call of duty.

PETE OLSON  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 15, 2016  ",2016
171,,114,0.54,93,2016-03-15,Mr. OLSON.," Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to  interact with some of the brightest students in  the 22nd Congressional District who serve on  my Congressional Youth Advisory Council.  I  have gained much by  listening  to  the high  school students who are  the  future of  this  great nation. They provide  important  insight  from across the political spectrum that sheds  a light on the concerns of our younger constituents. Giving voice  to  their priorities will  hopefully  instill a better sense of  the  importance of being an active participant in the political process. Many of the students have written short essays on a variety of topics and I  am pleased to share them with my House colleagues.  Arjun Luthra attends Clear Springs High  School in League City, Texas. The essay topic  is: Challenges within the political process.  Within the US political system, there is an  iron triangle which defines the spheres of influence and relationship between the United  States Congress, the bureaucracy and the interest groups. Along with these groups, the  executive  branch  influences  the  appointments of justices and bureaucratic officials.  Concerns regarding public policy are placed  on the shoulders of numerous institutions.  What makes the political process so challenging is to ensure there is reconciliation of  the political interests of these numerous institutions  like Congress, which represents  individual districts and states, and the President, which represents the overall nation.  The President, Office of Management and  Budget,  the Congressional Budget Office,  agencies and interest groups are all involved  in  the budgeting process. The President  bears responsibility of presenting the Budget  to Congress while the Congressional Budget  Office advises Congress of potential consequences of budget decisions. Within the  process, the agencies provide projection of  budgetary needs. The complexity of the process and shared roles among the institution  often require adaptation or reconciliation.  For example, in 1973, President Nixon refused  to disburse appropriated funds of Congress.  This lead to the Budget Impoundment Act  which transferred power of President to Congress. This particular historical example not  only demonstrates a check and balance system, but also exemplifies the challenges in  the political process.  In addition to budget, legislation becomes  difficult to enact either due to political gridlock due to divided government or party polarization. This gridlock has  led to a restricted number of bills that pass through  the congressional committees. Only 4 percent of bills introduced to Congress become  law and only about 6 percent of bills reach  floor debate. Furthermore, discussion of bill  is restricted by the closed rule in the House,  which places time limit for debate and restricts amendments. While  in the Senate,  senators can request for a filibuster, which  extends time of debate. This allows members  of the Senate to push their interests forward  and often prevent discussion of other legislation proposed.  In essence, the political process is challenging especially in creating the political  agenda and reaching specific goals set by the  numerous governmental institutions. Today,  hot topics in the political agenda include  gun  control,  education  and  immigration  policies. Although pushing for funds and legislation that yields long-term benefits for  the constituents is challenging, the political  process requires purposeful rather than reckless action  that  is advantageous  to  the  United States. The political process ensures  recognition of the Constitution as a governing document and also ensures a check on  the abuse of political power.  f  OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL  DEBT  HON.

175,Senate,114,0.529,13,2016-04-05,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President, a  couple of weeks ago was the sixth anniversary of President Obama’s unpopular health care law. Every year at this  time, that birthday is not one people  actually want to celebrate. When we  take a look at the reasons Americans  aren’t celebrating ObamaCare’s sixth  birthday,  it  is pretty obvious. Let’s  read them: unsecured data through the  Web site, fewer provider choices, over  $1 trillion in new taxes on American  families, 2 million jobs’ worth of hours  lost, and skyrocketing premiums and  deductibles. It is no surprise that the  health care law continues to be very  unpopular.  Americans  know  that  under  the  health care law they have less freedom  to keep their doctor, to keep the insurance that was right for them and their  families, because the President says he  gets to decide what somebody needs for  themselves and their families—not the  families getting to decide  for themselves.  We know that—again, it came out  during  the  break—people’s  personal  data is not secure at healthcare.gov, as  they thought it was. We know insurance companies are continuing to give  patients fewer choices by limiting the  networks of doctors that people can  see. The health care law has added over  $1  trillion  in new  taxes onto hardworking American families. Premiums  and deductibles are up, and according  to  the Congressional Budget Office,  ObamaCare is cutting the hours Americans can work by about 2 million jobs  over the next decade. So it seems that  every day there is more news coming  out on how the health care  law  is  unaffordable, unpopular, and unworkable.  Last week there was a new study  that explains one of the reasons why  the President’s health care law is collapsing. There was a study that came  out  from Blue Cross Blue Shield. It  compared people buying new health insurance coverage in the ObamaCare exchanges  to people who already had  health  insurance through their  jobs.  The  study  found  that  the  new  ObamaCare customers went to the doctor 26 percent more often than other  people did, that they were admitted to  the hospital almost twice as often, that  ObamaCare  customers  have  higher  costs, and that the average medical  spending is about $1,200 a year higher  for people on ObamaCare than people  who get their insurance through work.  So why is it that hospital admissions  are up so much for people who are on  ObamaCare, and why is it that doctors’  visits are up 26 percent? Because the  new ObamaCare enrollees are sicker  and costlier. So insurance companies of  course have to raise their premiums.  People are sicker who are signing up.  They go to the doctor more. The insurance company  turns around, and  it  raises premiums on everyone else. That  is why so many people are opposed to  the health care law—because the impact it has had on them personally.  When insurance companies have to  raise their rates on ObamaCare plans, a  lot of money is paid by taxpayers because it is the taxpayers who are paying for the subsidies for all the folks  who have signed up  for ObamaCare.  What we know is that taxpayers are  subsidizing the premiums of 83 percent  of the people who buy ObamaCare insurance. When the premiums go up,  taxes have to be made up to pay for it.  Well,  when  companies  can’t  get  enough extra money, they just stop offering policies. Under ObamaCare that  may happen. Then more people will  lose their insurance coverage. Maybe  some companies will  just go out of  business. We are  familiar with that  process because we have seen it. We  have seen that under the ObamaCare  health care  law, a majority of  the  ObamaCare  health  insurance  co-ops  have  actually  gone  bankrupt. The  health care law created 23 co-ops, and  12 have already gone out of business.  Premiums were already out of control, and it is getting worse. The average premium  for what  is called the  benchmark  silver  plan  in  the  ObamaCare exchange is more than 7  percent higher this year than last year.  For people who can only afford the  cheaper bronze plan, premiums are up  13 percent compared to last year. Over  the next couple of months, insurance  companies are going to start setting  their rates for 2017. They are going to  take into account what has happened  in the previous year. So this new study  by Blue Cross Blue Shield is just laying  the groundwork for even more price increases to come next year. I think this  is one of the things that explains why  so many people dislike ObamaCare.  A new poll came out that found that  47 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the health care law.  The Kaiser Family Foundation report  shows  Americans’  opinion  of  ObamaCare is tilting negative—47 percent marked it unpopular in March of  2016. A year ago this poll said that 42  percent of the people had an unfavorable view. There we were a year ago.  Here we are now. The number keeps  climbing. Now only 41 percent of the  people have a  favorable view of the  health care law. It wasn’t supposed to  be this way.  Mr. President, 6 years ago Democrats  in Washington were  very  confident  that the law would be extremely popular today. As a matter of fact, Senator CHUCKSCHUMERof New York went  on ‘‘Meet the Press’’ back in 2010 and  said: ‘‘It is going to become more popular.’’ He said: ‘‘I predict that by November those who voted for the health  care law will find it an asset.’’  Well, we all  remember what happened in the 2010 elections. We know  that Democrats who  voted  for  the  health care law did not find it an asset.  Democrats lost six seats in the Senate  that year, and they lost control of the  House  of  Representatives.  was out as Speaker of  the  House, and the Republicans took the  majority.  Then  in 2013, Senator HARRYREID  was making this same prediction about  how popular the health care law was  going to be.

On June 3,  1916, Congress passed the National Defense Act,  establishing  the JROTC.  This program teaches students the values of our Armed Forces through training and  classroom  instruction with  military personnel.  This influential program encourages  leadership, fortitude, and personal responsibility. The JROTC has experienced a long history of success, and  millions of high school students have  completed the program since its inception. Not only do these students learn  military history and customs, but participants gain a deeper understanding  of civic engagement, community service, and the importance of character  building.  Out of the many high school students  who participate in JROTC each year, 30  to 50 percent go on to serve in the U.S.  military later in life. The program also  connects high  school  students with  universities that offer the Reserve Officer Training Corps program and helps  many students who may have not otherwise earned a college degree.  I would also like to recognize the 35  schools  in Colorado  that  offer  the  JROTC program. In Colorado, there are  2 Marine Corps JROTC units, 8 Air  Force JROTC units, 4 Navy units, and  21 Army units. I am proud of the accomplishments of the JROTC students,  and I know they have a bright future  ahead of them.

177,Senate,114,0.631,20,2016-04-05,Mr. TOOMEY.," Madam  President,  today I wish to honor the life of Mr.  Gary M. Orlando, Sr. Mr. Gary Orlando  passed away on Sunday, October 25, at  the Erie VA Medical Center. A tireless  and  longtime advocate  for veterans,  Gary sat on the board of directors for  the Paralyzed Veterans of America,  PVA. He was also a member of the Disabled American Veterans, DAV.  Gary was an Erie, PA, native, born  on November 8, 1951. He served with the  U.S. Army during the Vietnam war as  a door gunner on a helicopter. While  serving in Vietnam, he survived being  shot down and was awarded the Army  Commendation Medal, two Good Conduct Medals, and the National Defense  Service Medal.  Following his service with the Army,  Gary worked for the U.S. Postal Service in Erie. In his free time, he enjoyed  hunting,  volunteering,  and  participating in the Wheelchair Games. He  was also an avid fan of the Erie Otters  Hockey Club. Gary was a relentless advocate for our veterans, a friendly face,  and a supporter for countless veterans  in the Erie area.  Gary is survived by two sons, two  grandchildren,  one  great-granddaughter, one brother, one brother-in-  law, and several nieces and nephews.  He was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery, an honor he richly deserved.  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I wish  to express my thanks for Mr. Orlando’s  steadfast service to our Nation and his  commitment to our veterans.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  TRIBUTE TO WALTER EVANS  ∑",2016

Walter’s project alone involved  230 volunteer hours and provided for  the creation of a beautiful new trail  used by mountain bikers, hikers, and  dog walkers.  Walter is an excellent leader and always keeps a great attitude. Doug  Wheeler,  scoutmaster  to Troop  214  stated, ‘‘Walter is a great example of a  Boy Scout in his character attributes.  Of particular note are his compassion,  enthusiasm to serve others, and polite  manner. These attributes, as well as  his other traits, will help him do great  things in his life.’’  Walter, thank you for your service to  Montana at such an early age.

Arkansas Post was established as a trading post by Henri De  Tonti in 1686 and was the first permanent European settlement in the lower  Mississippi River  valley. While  the  exact  location moved several times,  the area remained a vital trade center  for much of the 17th and 18th centuries.  The  land was  eventually  ceded  to  Spain, who controlled the post for over  40 years. While under Spanish control,  Arkansas Post was home to the Battle  of Arkansas Post, a Revolutionary War  battle between Spanish and British  forces fought on April 17, 1783.

186,Senate,114,-0.312,60,2016-04-13,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr. President, I thank  very much my  colleague  Senator  BLUMENTHAL. I want to associate myself with all the remarks of my colleague from Connecticut.  Let me congratulate the riders from  Team 26 for making it through such inclement weather, making  it through  such a challenging ride to bring these  messages to the Halls of Congress and  to the White House.  It strikes me that there are similarities between this ride and the challenges ahead of us. Every tough ride is  a long stretch of both peaks and valleys. The challenge is knowing there is  another hill coming before you and not  giving up, knowing that at the end of  that long ride, there is reward.  When we talk about the scope of our  fight to change the laws of this country to try to put a dent in this epidemic of gun violence, we have to view  our journey the same way. There are  going to be peaks and there are going  to be valleys. There will be moments of  triumph where we change the laws for  the better, where we see progress, as  we have in Connecticut, where a new  State law has resulted in a 40-percent  diminution in the number of gun homicides. Then there are the valleys—moments like we had here in early 2013,  where despite 90 percent of Americans  supporting the  idea that you should  prove you are not a criminal before you  buy a gun, we weren’t able to pass that  law because of a filibuster here. Every  great change  is defined not only by  failures but by peaks and valleys, as  was  their  ride.  I  join  Senator  BLUMENTHAL in thanking them for focusing on this particular issue of guns  on campuses.  It  is up to every  individual as to  whether they choose to buy a firearm,  but they should make that decision imbued by the facts. And the facts are  pretty clear that if you have a firearm  in your home, it is much more likely to  be used to kill you or to kill a family  member than it is to kill an intruder,  to kill someone trying to do harm to  you.  Nancy Lanza had guns in the home  for a variety of reasons, but one of the  reasons, apparently, was that as a single parent, she wanted firearms for protection. Of course, her guns were used  to kill her and then 20 small first graders and their teachers. Similarly, on  campuses, the data tells us that  in  areas that have more guns, you are  more likely to have higher rates of gun  homicides. This fiction that if you just  arm all the good guys, they will kill all  the bad guys is not actually how it  plays out in real life.  So I thank them for bringing these  petitions here to shed  focus on this  movement to make sure we don’t have  students  walking  around  campuses  with concealed weapons. That doesn’t  make for a safer campus environment.  Lastly because I know others want to  speak, I want to talk about two things  that struck me from our meeting at  the White House at the end of the day  yesterday. The first was when all the  riders on Team 26 got to tell their stories about why they decided to join  this ride. Many of them, frankly, were  doing it for deep love and affection for  Monte Frank, but they all shared a  common cause with him. Around that  table were individuals who had suffered  gun violence in their immediate family.

187,Senate,114,0.469,74,2016-04-13,Mrs. FISCHER.," Mr. President,  serving the right to object.  I have heard many times from my  friends on the other side of the aisle  that my  proposal  doesn’t  go  far  enough. Respectfully, I believe some of  the provisions of the Paycheck Fairness Act go too far. I take issue with  the accusation from those who wrongly  assert that my bill will make it harder  for women to discuss wage discrimination. I understand that my nonretaliation  language  is different  from  the  Paycheck Fairness Act, but the intent  and the effect are the same. My bill  will protect women and men from retaliation when  they  learn about or  seek out information about how their  compensation compares with other employees.  It is clear there is common ground to  make progress on equal pay when it  comes  to wage  transparency. Every  Senate Republican  is on board with  this proposal. It is a needed update to  our equal pay laws. In 2014, every Senate Democrat welcomed a more limited  but similar Executive order that was  issued by President Obama that pertained only to Federal workers.  My Workplace Advancement Act goes  further.  It  protects  all Americans.  Moreover, it is bipartisan. Five Senate  Democrats are already on the record in  support of this plan. So why do my  friends from the other side of the aisle  not now support my bill?  Colleagues, this is an issue we can  agree on. It is clear my legislation enjoys bipartisan  support, and  it can  make meaningful progress for Amerreican women. While I am disappointed  in today’s objection to my bill, I hope  we can move beyond sound bites because this issue is too important to politicize year after year.  The Paycheck Fairness Act that my  colleague speaks of will  inhibit employers’  ability  to  establish merit-  based pay systems, and it will inhibit  employees’ ability to negotiate flexible  work arrangements.  The Independent Women’s Forum recently conducted a study on what matters to women when they choose a job.  They found that flexibility was a common theme. Whether providing flexible  scheduling or offering alternatives like  telecommuting, women  value  flexibility, and they value it at about the  same level as receiving 10 paid vacation and sick days or receiving $5,000 to  $10,000 in extra income. This is important to women. We should be doing it.  The survey showed what many of us  already know. Every situation is different, and by providing more options,  workers can negotiate work arrangements that can suit their own particular needs.  With these concerns in mind, I object.  ",2016

Her passion stems from the support she has  received from her mentors throughout her life.  Her willingness to serve others and give back  to her community is one of the main reasons  she was given this award. Nola volunteers her  time as a board member of Children and Families of  Iowa where she works  tirelessly  to  show those who have lost all hope that there  are people out there who will work with you to  get you back on your feet and on a path to  success.

This outstanding accomplishment was made  possible by the tireless work of countless advocates.  Their  commitment  to  engaging  friends,  colleagues,  local  residents,  businesses, stakeholders across the country, and  policymakers in a coordinated effort to achieve  permanent protection was critical to the establishment of the Monument.  Now, the Berryessa Snow Mountain Monument may be counted among the hundreds of  ‘pristine parks across  the country  that  represent America ’s most  treasured public  resources. The region ’s unique geological  formations will play host for the world’s scientists  for years to come. Centuries-old archeological  sites will draw curious historians and researchers as they piece together the stories of generations past. And avid bikers, hikers, campers, horsemen, and sportsmen will be able to  enjoy this landmark that is now forever open  and accessible  to outdoor enthusiasts  from  Northern California and beyond.  The Berryessa Snow Mountain Monument  serves as proof of the value of the Antiquities  Act and the power of the Executive to protect  these  lands  in  the  face of  inaction by Congress. After extensive  input  from  interested  parties and substantial evidence of  this  region’s value, the Obama Administration honored  the support of stakeholders, and  the  gravity of conservation.  The  legacy of public  lands  is one of  the  most important we can leave for future generations.  The  Berryessa  Snow Mountain  Monument is a critical piece of a preservation  system  that stretches  from  the Hawaiian  Islands to the Maine Coast. It has been a privilege working with Director Kornze  to  further  our mutual goal of preserving our nation’s  great open spaces, and we  look  forward  to  collaborating in the future.  f  CELEBRATING THE CITY OF SAN  BUENAVENTURA’S  150TH  ANNIVERSARY  HON.

194,,114,-0.285,130,2016-04-13,Ms. BROWNLEY of California.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  rise  to  recognize  the City of San  Buenaventura as it celebrates 150 years of incorporation.  Nestled  between  the  Pacific  Ocean and  the Los Padres National Forest,  the City of San Buenaventura is known for its  breathtaking ocean views and expansive rolling hills and truly lives up to its namesake as  the ‘ ‘City of Good Fortune.’ ’  The City of San Buenaventura has a long  history and archaeological discoveries in the  area suggest that humans have populated the  region  for  at  least  10,000 –12,000  years.  Founded in 1782, the San Buenaventura Mission served as the heart of this small coastal  community and the city was incorporated on  April 2, 1866. From  the beginning, Ventura  has been a place of commerce, starting with  the indigenous Chumash, who were fine artisans and adept travelers by canoes, naming it  Shisholop or ‘ ‘port on the coast ’ ’ for their lucrative  trade  activities.  While  living  in  Shisholop Village, which  is now downtown  Ventura, the local indigenous Chumash people  thrived  through  their  trade  of  shell  bead  money and chert.  In 1873, the community’s visionary leaders  boldly stepped up to establish Ventura County,  carved from Santa Barbara, with the City of  San Buenaventura as the county helm. As development boomed  in  the 1900s,  the region  flourished with agricultural operations and oil  production.  According to local lore, the city’s name was  abbreviated  to Ventura  to accommodate  the  dimensions of a sign at the local railroad station. Today, Ventura has continued its steady  growth and boasts over 100,000  residents.  Throughout history, Ventura has remained an  ideal locale for residents, businesses, and visitors as a quintessential California coastal community often cited as one of the most desirable places to live in the United States.  With the historic Two Trees overlooking the  city, Ventura has miles of pristine beaches,  making it one of the most renowned destinations for surfing. Ventura is home to the iconic  Ventura Pier and the Ventura Harbor, a commercial harbor gateway to the Channel Islands  National Park. With a thriving downtown cultural district, many musicians come through to  play at the Majestic Ventura Theater and festivals regularly occur at Plaza Park. Ventura is  also known as the host of the annual Ventura  County Fair, ‘ ‘a county fair with ocean air.’ ’  As we commemorate the city’s 150th anniversary, I would like to commend the City of  San Buenaventura and its residents, past and  present, on their success of reaching this milestone. I offer my sincerest congratulations during this sesquicentennial celebration and look  forward  to many more years of growth and  prosperity.  f  HONORING BARBARA J. POWERS  OF PENNSYLVANIA  HON.

Commonweal’s efforts have touched countless lives within three broad areas of focus.  Their health and healing programing includes  week-long retreats for people with cancer and  yoga therapy classes. Their efforts to support  the arts and education  include classes  for  teachers and students to better integrate creative  thinking  into school curriculum. Finally,  their advocacy for the environment and justice  incorporates work on health effects of environmental factors and research on juvenile justice  laws. Their work is multifaceted and extensive,  and has left a lasting, positive impact that can  be felt throughout our community.  For four decades, Commonweal has been a  beloved, wide-reaching organization, and they  have contributed significantly to West Marin ’s  culture and character.  It  is  therefore appropriate that we honor them today for their ongoing work and congratulate them on their anniversary celebration.

198,,114,0.718,137,2016-04-13,Mr. BABIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the achievements of the Mendoza Debate Society at Lee College,  in Baytown,  Texas. On April 4, 2016,  the Debate Team  won  their  third consecutive Community College National Championship  in  the  International Public Debate Association (IPDA) National Championship Tournament.  Led by Director of Forensics, Joe Ganakos,  the Mendoza Debate Society has become the  top-ranked IPDA debate program in Texas for  2015–2016. The debaters achieved  this  incredible  success  through  their  unmatched  work ethic and countless hours of practice.

199,,114,0.602,137,2016-04-13,Mr. MARCHANT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to congratulate Andrew Jones of Irving, Texas,  on being named to the 2016 McDonald ’s All  American basketball roster. This is a tremendous honor from the basketball community as  it pits the best high school players in the country against one another in an exhibition game.  Mr. Jones also participated in the three-point  competition and Legends and Stars Shootout  as  the players display  their shooting ability  and point guard play.  The requirements to become a McDonald’s  All American are extensive as you must consistently be a consensus Top 20 player in the  national rankings, and earn enough votes from  the selection committee. Andrew was one of  24 high school senior basketball players selected to join this elite group of young men as  the best  in  the country  from over 100,000  players nationwide. Andrew has been consistently rated as one of the best guards in the  2016 class with his ability to create plays and  soft touch around the rim. Mr. Jones’ following  has only grown as his tremendous improvement has been highlighted over the past year  in his spring and summer performances in the  Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). He brings great  pride to the basketball community of Texas.  Andrew has a natural gift for the game of  basketball as his court vision and slashing capabilities  creates  scoring opportunities and  proves to be a nightmare for opposing teams.  Andrew will only improve at the collegiate level  as his basketball gift continues to attract admirers and people who look up to him including young fans that need positive role models  in their lives.  While Andrew continues  to receive praise  from scouts and people close to him, he has  kept his roots in mind as he has committed to  playing college basketball at home for the University of Texas (UT). At UT he will continue  to display his exemplary skills and pride  for  the great state of Texas.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 24th Congressional District of Texas,  I ask all my distinguished colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating Andrew Jones on his hard work and athletic accomplishments.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

209,,114,-0.53,97,2016-04-26,Ms. MOORE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in tribute  to Dorothy E. Johnson who passed away on  April 16, 2016. Mrs. Johnson was born Dorothy Earl Haralson on April 19, 1929 in Lena,  Mississippi. She was the fifth of fourteen children born to Dovie and Ollie Haralson. Mrs.  Johnson  received both her early and high  school education in Lena, Mississippi.  She married  I.W. Johnson  in 1946. They  moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1948 following the great migration of the north after  Mr. Johnson secured employment at the Patrick Cudahy Packing House. Mrs. Johnson  worked for the next three decades for varied  employers;  she  was  a  salad  maker  extraordinaire for some of Milwaukee ’s finest  hotels and culinary establishments such as the  Knickerbocker Hotel, Fleur de Lis formerly located in the Cudahy Tower and Angie’s Restaurant  formerly on Water Street. She also  worked for Globe Union. Mrs. Johnson ’s last  employer was Milwaukee County from which  she retired in 1990 after 15 years of service  as a Food Service Worker.  Dorothy and  I.W. Johnson raised 11 children  in Milwaukee: Erma, Margie, Donna,  Wayne, Barbara  (deceased), Sharon, Kirk,  Lynn, Vincent, David and Deon. She was a  great support system  for all of her children  and their families. She leaves behind a wonderful legacy which includes: 30 grandchildren,  27 great-grandchildren, and 7 great, great-  grandchildren. Mrs. Johnson will also be sorely missed by numerous beloved extended family members and friends.  Dorothy Johnson was an avid reader. She  also  loved  traveling,  the  theater and music.  She was able to combine her love of family,  travel, theater and music on her last big trip.  She traveled to Toronto in 2012 to watch one  of her granddaughters perform as a musician  with Cirque du Soleil.  She also enjoyed watching political programing on television with C–SPAN being one  of her  favorites. She kept current with  local  and national politics and believed  in making  sure her vote counted. Even when encountering an illness before her passing Mrs. Johnson was adamant about exercising her franchise. She utilized curbside voting on April 5,  2016 for the Presidential Primary and General  local and statewide elections.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Mrs.  Dorothy Earl Johnson. She has been a  tremendous asset  to  the Fourth Congressional  District.  f  JOSHUA RAMIREZ  HON. ED PERLMUTTER  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 26, 2016  ",2016
210,,114,-0.565,104,2016-04-26,Mr. HASTINGS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  highlight an issue that is of growing concern:  cancer that is specific to men.  Cancer is a deadly disease that does not  discriminate. It impacts all demographics and  every segment of our population. However,  what I find extremely alarming is that one in  two men will be diagnosed with cancer over  the course of their lifetimes. Men face a 43.31  percent lifetime risk of being diagnosed with  some form of cancer. Statistics show that men  have a 22.83 percent chance of dying  from  cancer versus 19.26 percent of women.  The Centers for Disease Control estimates  that nearly 300,000 men die annually as a result of cancer. Various cancers are claiming  the lives of males of all races and ages at an  alarming rate. I will add, though, those African  American men have the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates according the CDC.  It is time for the Members of Congress to do  our part to shine the light on this deadly disease that is plaguing the men of our communities. These men are our  fathers, grandfathers, uncles, children, and nephews. No  one should ever be put in a position to have  to bury their child.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Resolution to Recognize June as National Men ’s Cancer Awareness Month. From  prostate and colon cancer  to  lung and skin  cancer, our nation needs to be more aware of  what we can do to prevent, detect, and treat  these  fatal  illnesses.  Bringing  about  this  awareness on an annual basis will aid in slowing the rate of cancer related fatalities.  f  HONORING EDWARD G. NELSON  HON.

211,,114,-0.161,104,2016-04-26,Mr. COOPER.," Mr. Speaker,  the  city of  Nashville and the state of Tennessee lost a  civic giant earlier this month, banker and philanthropist Edward G. Nelson.  Ed Nelson was not only a pillar of the community, he was our  foundation. He  financed  much of the growth of Nashville and imagined  the ‘It’ city before we became one.  Ed’s expertise and skill in banking, finance  and  international  relations shaped  the economic development of Middle Tennessee, and  his philanthropic efforts have touched countless lives. Serving on dozens of local, national  and  international boards, Ed had  the vision  and will to make things happen. His success  and leadership were notably recognized when  the Bank of China invited him for a formal visit  shortly after diplomatic relations were established in the 1970s.  Ed’s service as a U.S. military intelligence  officer in Japan led to his insatiable desire to  foster U.S.-Japan  relations. Because of his  tireless work, Nashville is now home to a Japanese Consul General and many Japanese  businesses.  In 2008,  the Japanese government awarded him one of its most prestigious  awards—the Order of  the Rising Sun, Gold  Rays with Neck Ribbon.  Mr. Speaker, the city of Nashville is forever  grateful to Ed Nelson for his service. Ed was  a kind and wonderful gentleman and the best  of the South.

The 21st Poet Laureate Consultant Juan  Felipe Herrera celebrated  the conclusion of  the first year of his laureateship by honoring  young poet Elena Izcalli Medina at the Library  of Congress. Elena Izcalli is a 7th grader attending High Tech Middle School  in Chula  Vista, California. She has been writing poetry  for four years. She first received praise from  Herrera in 2012 for her poem ‘ ‘Where I am  from’ ’ which Herrera said ‘ ‘contained a philosophical reflection about how all of us are impermanent.  It was  just a solid poem where  she really touched base with wisdom.’ ’  Herrera made an unprecedented gesture by  arranging for Elena Izcalli and her family to attend the last lecture of his first term. Herrera  presented Elena  Izcalli  to guests and dignitaries at the Library of Congress where she  read her poem ‘ ‘One Day’ ’ on April 13, 2016.  I would like to submit her poem.  ONEDAY  (by Elena Izcalli Medina)  One day the border will come down  And all the colors will flow and  We will grant ALL a crown.  One day police brutality will be no more  And ALL will have equality no matter who  you  Are fighting for.  One day we will ALL love each other  No matter what skin what religion  because we are from the same mother.  One day we will treat the environment like  a human being  And ALL of nature  Can go back to being free.  One day when someone is shot  Black and brown Lives will matter  And ALL will stand up to the cops.  One day we will have peace between countries  and instead of starting war  we will grant each other awards  One day we will find each other the same  and realize we ALL go through  sunshine and rain.  One day we will look at women  so they are not objectified  But we’ll pay attention to who they are inside  and instead of calling them bossy  We will take away the y.  ’Cause I wonder why,  why this belief is still alive.  My hair flies freely in the wind  Me being proud of the color of my skin  I inhale clean air and exhale my worries  But one worry that stays inside me  is the idea  that this one day might not come  One day.

I would also like to recognize the nine volunteers  traveling on  this  trip who have also  served our country: Eden R. Brown, Army Air  Forces; Clement K. Hyer, Army; James E.  Morley, Army; Theodore J. Riehl, Army; Marc  R. Snook, Army; Michael Allegre, Army Air  Forces; George W. Hyes, Marine Corps; and  William M. Lawrence, Navy. These brave men  and women put their lives on the line for our  freedom, and they continue their dedication to  service by contributing to this great cause and  honoring those that came before them.  Mr. Speaker, each of us is humbled by the  courage of  these brave Americans who put  themselves in harm’s way for our country and  way of life.

215,House,114,0.646,13,2016-05-12,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.,"  Madam  Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 5046,  the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act.  The misuse  of  and  addiction  to  opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and  other prescription pain medications,  has had a devastating hold on this  country.  It affects every State and  every district. Prescription painkillers  and heroin are  the primary driving  forces behind this epidemic. According  to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2014, 45 percent  of the people who used heroin reported  that they were also addicted to prescription painkillers.  Additionally,  drug  overdoses  now  surpass automobile accidents as the  leading cause of injury-related death  for Americans between the ages of 25  and 64. Nearly a half million Americans  lost their lives to drug overdoses in  2015. More than 800 of those deaths occurred in my home State of Wisconsin,  double  the number  of  deaths  from  overdoses in 2004, just 11 years earlier.  Yet, despite these staggering numbers,  the crisis is getting worse. Drug overdose deaths have increased 137 percent  since 2010, with opioid-related overdose  deaths increasing by 200 percent.  The moment to reverse our current  course and make a genuine and lasting  impact in the fight against addiction is  here. All over the country, people are  calling on Congress to find solutions.  In townhall meetings, on the campaign  trail, and through social media, lawmakers are hearing heartbreaking stories from families and friends of addicted individuals and leaders of impacted communities.  There is no single solution to this  epidemic. The most effective way to  approach addiction is to pursue a comprehensive response, which must  include a strict focus on prevention, law  enforcement  strategies  to  stop drug  dealers and traffickers, a plan to address  overdosing,  and  a  plan  to  strengthen opioid abuse treatment and  recovery options for those struggling  with their addiction.  The Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act is an important piece of  this puzzle. While State and local officials  and  community  organizations  must be at the forefront of confronting  this  challenge,  the Federal Government should help support these efforts.  My legislation authorizes the Attorney  General to make grants available to  States and localities for a number of  services related to opioid and heroin  abuse.  The grant program contains eight allowable uses of the grant funds, which  are broadly construed to give States  flexibility  in responding to the epidemic within their borders, meaning  not a one-size-fits-all program. These  include alternatives to the  incarceration programs; collaboration between  criminal  justice  agencies  and  substance abuse systems; training for first  responders  in  carrying  and  administering opioid overdose reversal drugs,  including naloxone; and prescription  drug monitoring programs.  It is imperative that we pursue aggressive measures to stint opioids’ dangerous  progression,  for  a  stronger,  more prosperous America. The Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act  is a commonsense and bipartisan approach that addresses the issue head-on  and will make a positive impact on our  fight against addiction. H.R. 5046  is  fully offset and contains strong accountability provisions to ensure funding is spent wisely.  I want  to  thank Chairman GOODLATTEand my colleagues in the Senate  for their tremendous work while addressing the opioid epidemic. I am optimistic that, with passage of this bill  and the additional opioid measures the  House of Representatives is considering  this week, we can go quickly to conference and send meaningful  legislation to the President for his signature.  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R.  5046.  ",2016

220,House,114,0.223,41,2016-05-12,Mr. REICHERT.," Mr. Speaker,  tonight, my colleagues and I come to the  floor of the United States House of  Representatives to spotlight and highlight a very special week, a week that  brings families and police officers together here in Washington, D.C. It is a  week that  is called National Police  Week where these families and police  officers from around the country come  and gather to remember those police  officers whose  lives were  tragically  taken in the line of duty during the  past year, and this happens every year.  In that process, we not only remember  those lives who were lost in the past  year, but we also remember those lives  who were lost in all of the years prior  to that. Later on, I will talk about a  couple of close friends of mine whose  lives were taken early in their careers  in the King County Sheriff’s Office.  I should say that, prior to coming to  Congress, I spent 33 years in the King  County  Sheriff’s Office  in  Seattle,  starting in a patrol car, then as a detective, then as a SWAT commander, a  hostage negotiator, a precinct commander, and, finally, as a sheriff, then  coming here to Congress.  To begin tonight, I honor Chehalis  Police Officer Rick Silva and Washington State Trooper Brent Hanger,  who both tragically died in the State of  Washington in the line of duty.  I  begin  with Washington  Trooper Brent Hanger.  Trooper Hanger died on August 6,  2015, while investigating a marijuana  grow in a small town called Yakima,  Washington. He was 47 years old. He  had a wife, Lisa, and  six children:  Emily, Erin, Kailey, Erik, Kyle, and  Kevin. Trooper Hanger served with the  State Patrol for 17 years, all of which  were spent in the State Patrol’s District  7, which  includes Washington  State’s  Snohomish,  Skagit,  and  Whatcom Counties. Early in his career,  in 2000, Trooper Hanger received the  Award of Merit from the State Patrol  for assisting and saving the life of a suicidal person.  It  is one of the things we  forget  about with regard to police officers. We  are really peace officers, and we are  there to protect people and keep the  peace. The vast majority of us who go  into law enforcement enter into law  enforcement to protect people and to  save lives, and that is what Trooper  Hanger did in 2000 on just one occasion  that he was recognized for.  I also recognize Chehalis Police Officer Rick Silva.  Rick was 60. He died in Chehalis on  June 18, 2015, in Centralia, Washington.  He had a wife named Cindy and a  daughter named Shannon. From 1986 to  1988, he was a Lewis County corrections officer. From 1988 to 2002, he was  an officer with the Lewis County Sheriff’s Office; and he was employed, when  he passed away, with the Chehalis Police Department. He was a self-taught  master  fabricator,  race  car  driver,  automotive restorer, and carpenter.

222,Senate,114,0.855,76,2016-05-12,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. President,  in the  fall of 2014, an outbreak had the world  on edge in West Africa. The Ebola virus  had come about, and three countries  were being decimated. It was at this  time that the director of the National  Institutes of Health gave an interview  where he argued that a vaccine would  likely be available if the Congress had  enough  funding  for  the agency. He  added that the Ebola virus had forced  NIH to divert money from other critical research.  These are striking charges, especially  for an agency that has a budget of $30  billion. So it stands to reason that if  underfunding NIH was allowing a crisis  such as this, we ought to be appropriating more money to the agency.  We cannot ignore the fact, obviously,  that at that time the Nation was $18  trillion in debt and running nearly a  half-trillion-dollar deficit.

223,Senate,114,0.585,83,2016-05-12,Mr. RUBIO.," Mr. President, tomorrow  I will be visiting the Eureka Garden  Apartments in Jacksonville, FL, which  is a Section 8 apartment complex that  is supposed to provide affordable and  safe living conditions for low-income  members of the Jacksonville community, but it doesn’t. Instead, its tenants  have  been  subjected  to  dangerous,  often downright disgusting living conditions  for years. They raised their  concerns repeatedly with the managers  of the facility and local officials, only  to be met for the most part with bureaucratic indifference.  My staff and I have been working on  this since it first came to light last  fall, but there has been a frustrating,  disturbing lack of progress from the  Department of Housing and Urban Development  and, more  importantly,  from the owner of the complex.  Frankly, I have had enough. I am  heading down there tomorrow to see  what we have to do and whom we need  to put pressure on to get things moving. I will be touring the facility and  meeting with Tracy Grant, who is the  president of the tenants association. I  will be joined by Councilman Garrett  Dennis, Jacksonville Mayor Len Curry,  and Pastor Mark Griffin of Wayman  Ministries, who will be meeting with  residents.  I  intend to commend the  residents tomorrow for how united and  resilient they have been throughout  this ordeal, even while  the Federal  Government failed them.  For years the Department of Housing  and Urban Development has certified  this facility and as a result has put  hundreds of  families at  risk. When  HUD inspected the property last summer, they passed the complex with a  score of 85 out of 100. Less than a  month  later,  residents  were  complaining about how bad their  living  conditions were.  When my staff visited the complex, it  was nearly unlivable. They saw crumbling stairs, black mold, and exposed  electrical wiring that had been covered  up by a trash bag. They smelled the  natural gas that would soon hospitalize  residents days later. This was and is  unacceptable.  For months, my office, along with  Mayor Curry, the city council, and the  tenants association, pushed to have improvements and repairs done to this  complex. In February, HUD finally had  a date by which all repairs must be  completed. When the time came to reinspect Eureka Gardens, it passed inspection, and they eventually renewed  their  contract with  the  property’s  owner, but the residents continued to  say what  they had  said all along:  HUD’s inspections aren’t working.  Just recently, HUD revealed that Eureka Gardens passed with a score of 62.  The passing score is a 60. However, a  senior HUD official admitted that HUD  officials do not believe the property  would currently pass another inspection. HUD essentially admitted that it  had certified a failing facility. Something is clearly wrong with the inspection process, and Floridians are being  hurt because of it.  I will be down there tomorrow to find  out how we can put an end to this problem once and for all. The residents of  Eureka Gardens cannot be  forced to  suffer under mismanagement and apathy any longer. Children cannot continue to be put at risk due to gas leaks  and other hazardous conditions. HUD  cannot  be  allowed  to  continue  to  rubberstamp approval of failing housing complexes, only to further slum-  like conditions for the most vulnerable  tenants.  I will continue to look for solutions  to help make sure the conditions in Eureka Gardens are fixed and aren’t repeated anywhere else. If we determine  that congressional action is necessary,  then I am prepared to take it. The residents of Eureka Gardens deserve safe  living conditions, and we will make  sure that is exactly what they get.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2016

I am proud to recognize Jim’s  service  in  the Granite  State and dedication to his fellow New  Hampshire residents.  Jim has lived his entire life in Peterborough and  is proud of his  roots,  which are represented on his vanity license  plate  with  the  phrase  ‘‘LUVPBRO.’’  In  addition  to  being  well-known and beloved by his neighbors, Jim epitomizes the spirit of generosity  in New Hampshire. Spanning  decades,  Jim’s  dedication  to  volunteerism is outstanding, and he has  served as a volunteer firefighter for 53  years. His record of service also  includes volunteering for the Salvation  Army, founding the Monadnock Workspace—an organization  that employs  and  empowers  those with  developmental  challenges—and  co-founding  the  Peterborough  Sunshine  Fund,  which assists  individuals with emergency and travel needs.  It is only fitting that Jim’s own profession would be as a teacher who educated and inspired generations of students. His passion for teaching compelled him to found the organization  where he works today, Staff Development for Educators. By ensuring and  enriching the professional development  needs of educators, Jim is helping to  spread education across the globe.  Jim has contributed greatly to the  Greater Monadnock region,  injecting  positivity into the lives of people he  may never know. It  is an honor to  highlight Jim’s life of service and commitment to a cause greater than himself. His selflessness and generosity is a  testament to all that is great in New  Hampshire.  I extend my sincerest thanks to Jim  for all that he has done and continues  to do for the people of New Hampshire.  I am extraordinarily proud to join his  friends and neighbors in commending  Jim for a life well lived and his lifetime of giving.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO DELANEY BIEL  ∑",2016

This  accolade is truly prestigious, attained  by only the most  influential of Nevada’s educators. Without a doubt, Mr.  Tierney’s work at Adobe High School  in the Elko County School District  warrants recognition with this incredible award.  Mr. Tierney  started his career  in  teaching three decades ago at the Fremont Unified School District. In 1989,  he moved to Nevada and began teaching English and social studies at Adobe  Middle School and has remained a valued member of the Red-Tailed Hawks’  faculty department ever since. In addition to time spent in the classroom,  Mr. Tierney leads the social studies department and serves on the School Improvement  Team  at  Adobe  High  School. He is also a national facilitator  for PBS TeacherLine, which provides  online  professional  development  courses for Pre-K through 12th grade  teachers. Mr. Tierney’s  unwavering  dedication to his students at Adobe  High School over the last 25 years goes  without question. He is truly a role  model, providing an  innovative and  interactive teaching style for those in  his classroom, and he encourages students with open discourse and debate.  His commitment to his students is invaluable to the Elko community.  As the father of four children and as  the husband of a teacher, I understand  the important role educators play in  enriching the lives of Nevadans. Ensuring  students  throughout  the Silver  State are prepared to compete in the  21st century is critical for the future of  our country. The State of Nevada is  fortunate to be home to educators like  Mr. Tierney.  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans  to join me in thanking Mr. Tierney for  his dedication to enriching the lives of  Nevada’s students and congratulating  him on receiving this award.

This year will mark 15 years since the horrific September 11 attacks that struck at the  heart of our nation, and shook us to our core.  The United States suffered an immeasurable  tragedy that day, but for the victims and their  families, their loss is beyond words. They lost  sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, husbands,  wives, sisters and brothers. These  families’  lives were forever changed, and their road to  healing is made all the more difficult by the  questions that remain unanswered.  These classified pages in the 9/11 joint congressional  inquiry  contain  vital  information  about  the circumstances surrounding  the attacks, and can provide crucial guidance  for  our  future counterterrorism policies.  I have  personally read these pages and am confident  that  they can be  released without compromising  intelligence-gathering  sources  and  methods. The Obama Administration  is currently undertaking a review and is expected to  announce its decision in the coming weeks. I  strongly urge it to complete its review as soon  as possible and declassify the 28 pages.  I am pleased to be part of this bipartisan effort to give the families the answers they deserve. Together with my colleagues Congressman WALTERJONESand Congressman THOMASMASSIE, we introduced H. Res. 14 urging  the President to release the pages. I want to  thank Congresswoman GWENGRAHAM for organizing these speeches that are bringing renewed attention to this matter. I also want to  acknowledge and  thank  former Senator Bob  Graham for his hard work as Chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence when the Joint  Congressional  Inquiry was written, and his  steadfast advocacy  for making  these pages  public.  Mr. Speaker,  the victims’  families and our  nation experienced a profound personal loss  and after 15 years they deserve to have their  questions answered. The declassification of  the 28 pages will be an important step in that  direction.  f  CELEBRATING  THE  RETIREMENT  OF COL. TANYA S. BAKER FROM  THE UNITED STATES ARMY  HON. ROBERT J.

229,,114,0.422,146,2016-05-12,Mr. WITTMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  Colonel  Tanya  S.  Baker  of  Woodbridge, VA on the occasion of her retirement from the United States Army. Throughout her 30 year career, Col. Baker has selflessly  served our  country and  community;  namely, during the time she spent as North  American Aerospace Command and United  States  Northern  Command  (NORAD  and  USNORTHCOM) Coordination Officer  to  the  Department of Health and Human Services  (DHHS),  at  the  Pentagon.  NORAD  USNORTHCOM  is a  tremendous  institution  and  its Washington Office  is charged with  building trusted relationships with mission essential  partners,  such  as DHHS. NORAD  USNORTHCOM provides command and control of Department of Defense (DOD) homeland defense efforts and coordinates Defense  Support of Civil Authorities. In performing both  of these critical missions, USNORTHCOM defends America’s homeland and protects our  people, national power, and strategic freedom  of action.  Col. Baker was commissioned via Georgetown ROTC in May of 1986, after matriculating  from George Mason University. She received  her commission as a Medical Service Corps  Lieutenant and served  in many notable assignments of increasing responsibility, including Federal Coordinating Center Coordinator  at Tripler Army Medical Center, in Honolulu,  Hawaii and Battalion Commander for the Army  Reserve Careers Division, 13th Battalion,  in  Aurora, CO. Such  roles have enabled Col.  Baker to positively and significantly influence  her colleagues, fellow Soldiers, as well as the  future strategic leaders of our military.  Col. Baker holds a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from George Mason University and Master of Strategic Studies  from  the Army War  College. Col. Baker also completed a second  Senior Service College —the Air War College.  In addition  to her academic success, Col.  Baker has received an extensive number of  awards and decorations. These  include  the  Defense Superior Service Medal, Army Meritorious Service Medal with  three Oak Leaf  Clusters, Army Commendation Medal with  three Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Achievement  Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal with  three Bronze Stars, Global War on Terrorism  Medal, Army Superior Unit Award, Meritorious  Unit Commendation Award and Army Staff  Identification Badge. Such accolades are  indicative of the high caliber of her unfailing and  dedicated service to our nation.  On June 6th, 2014, Col. Baker assumed duties as the NORAD and USNORTHCOM Coordination Officer to the Department of Health  and Human Services, at the Pentagon. As a  Coordination Officer, Col. Baker has directly  and significantly contributed  to NORAD and  USNORTHCOM’s mission  success  in  response  to  the Unaccompanied Children Humanitarian Crisis and the international and domestic responses to the Ebola Virus Disease  outbreak. The  trusted partnerships  that Col.  Baker meticulously built among diverse stakeholders will remain as her key national-level  contribution and legacy. Even though she will  no  longer  be  present  at  NORAD  and  USNORTHCOM on a day-to-day basis, her  legacy will inevitably carry on.  Col. Baker is supported in her retirement by  her parents: Thermus R. Baker, Sr. and Ruth  B. Baker; her brothers: Thermus R. Baker, Jr.,  Everett S. Baker, Gary B Baker, and Reginald  M. Baker; her sister Monica R. Frazier; and  her faithful companion and dog Zoe Simone.  Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to congratulate  Col. Baker on  the culmination of a distinguished 30 year career in the United States  Army. I wish her all the best in this next chapter of her life.  f  HONORING MR. BRAD ONORATO  HON.

230,House,114,0.453,6,2016-05-19,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Chair, this is a simple  amendment.  I get to chair a subcommittee called  Transportation and Public Assets. We  get to oversee, in the public assets portion,  all  of  the  various  properties  around the United States that are public assets that are sitting idle. For example, in some States we have many  VA properties that are medical—some  hospitals,  some nursing homes—that  are sitting idle. Some of them are vacant, and some of them are closed.  In order to put them into productive  use for our veterans, I have tried to  craft an amendment that, of course,  doesn’t apply to all of the facilities. I  would like to do that, but this is fairly  limited. It says that we have a nursing  home that has been vacated or a nursing home that is not being used, and  some of them, for several years, have  sat vacant. This allows the Secretary  discretion, and  it also  sets aside a  small number of funds to help bring  that property into a condition so that  it can be transferred to the State. You  have these in Pennsylvania, Mr. Chair.  You have these across the Rust Belt.  We have them even in Florida. What we  don’t have is the authority for the VA  to move forward with these properties  in their transferring and get the properties into condition and make the little bits of changes in the properties to  transfer them to the States.  This will apply to 49 States. There  are 49 States that have State VAs.  Many of them run nursing homes. In  my State, for example, we run seven  nursing homes now. We do  it more  cost-effectively. We can do it faster.  We can take those idle assets and put  them into use. In some places in the  Rust Belt, you need  to consolidate  some of the  facilities, and this will  allow us to do that, too, and to run  them cheaper and give better services  to our veterans, not spread out the limited number of even staffers whom we  have  and  administrators. Think  of  what you can save just on that.  This is an amendment to try to move  that process forward. We are not trying  to get ahead of anybody who is in line  for any kind of a VA facility. What we  are trying to do is, again, tell the VA  Secretary that he can move forward  to  the  to object  and put a little bit of money aside that  will make a big, big difference with  these facilities that are sitting vacant  or half empty across the country, and  it does apply to 49 States.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2016

I don’t  think anybody has worked harder on it  or understands it better.  I wish there were more we could do  for veterans and will work with him to  see that that happens, but this amendment isn’t the right place to do it. This  amendment proposes that we increase  overspending by $7.7 billion for a continuation of the Veterans Choice Program. It doesn’t offer badly needed reforms to the program, it simply provides more funding.  Unfortunately,  the  accountability  measures currently in place at the VA  do not go far enough in ensuring that  the health care needs of our veterans  are  the priority. By  extending  the  Choice Program, we would be extending problematic waiting periods, we  would be extending a backlog of health  care claims, and we would be giving little or no authority to the VA to manage its employees.  We have  been  getting  complaints  about many of these things, and another veterans proposal in the Senate  improves both health care access for  veterans  and  expanded  disciplinary  VerDate Sep 11 2014  02:09 May 20, 2016 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G19MY6.010 S19MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2016
236,Senate,114,-0.328,55,2016-05-19,Mr. CARDIN.,"  Madam  President,  today I wish to join Americans across  the country in recognizing the immeasurable sacrifices made every day by the  men and women of law enforcement.  Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers put their lives on the line  to help uphold the rule of law in America. Their professionalism and commitment to justice underpin so much of  what  has  allowed  this  country  to  thrive for generations.  In May 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week containing May  15  as National Police  Week. In that proclamation, President  Kennedy stated, ‘‘. . . from the beginning of this Nation, law enforcement  officers have played an important role  in safeguarding the rights and  freedoms which are guaranteed by the Constitution and in protecting the lives  and property of our citizens. . . .’’  It is that twofold role of protecting  both the constitutional and physical  well-being of all Americans that earns  law enforcement officers such a revered  place in American society. In the 53  years since President Kennedy established this national celebration of law  enforcement, much has changed in regards to the tactics and procedure for  protecting essential rights and  freedoms, as well as the nature of threats  against personal property and the citizenry. What has not changed in the unwavering commitment  to addressing  these challenges by  law enforcement  agencies nationwide.  My home State of Maryland is home  to a close-knit, well-trained, and dedicated  network  of  law  enforcement  agencies. Maryland  is  often  called  America  in Miniature, and as such,  Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers across Maryland are expected to be able to respond to an incredibly diverse set of situations.  Being on the front lines of upholding  the rule of law and protecting Americans  from harm  is not easy work.  There is hardly a law enforcement officer in the United States who will not  face the threat of bodily harm during  their career. Unfortunately, due to the  dangerous nature of police work, law  enforcement officers across the country are killed on the job every year.  Thus far in 2016, 35 law enforcement  officers have been killed in the line of  duty. Every one of  those men and  women left a family and grieving law  enforcement agency. California, Colorado, and Maryland share the painful  distinction of leading the Nation in law  enforcement deaths in the line of duty.  Three officers  from each one of the  aforementioned States were killed in  the line of duty; in Maryland, all three  were killed by gunfire.  Senior Deputies Patrick Dailey and  Mark Logsdon of the Harford County  Sheriff’s office and Officer Jacai Colson  of the Prince George’s County Police  Department were all model officers  who were tragically killed while protecting colleagues and civilians. All  three of these men served communities  in Maryland with distinction and contributed greatly  to not only public  safety but also to helping build strong  and  lasting relationships among  law  enforcement and the people they protect.  Senior Deputies Dailey and Logsdon  were both  fathers and military veterans. Both served honorably with the  Harford County Sheriff’s Office.  On  Christmas  Eve  2002,  Deputy  Dailey saved the  life of a teenager  traveling in an SUV that collided head-  on with a cement mixing truck. Deputy  Dailey, a number of fellow sheriffs, and  two civilians emptied six  fire extinguishers in an attempt to quell a fire  that threatened to engulf the vehicle  and  the unresponsive  driver. Using  only their bare hands and batons, the  group managed to free the driver seconds before the fire consumed the passenger compartment. The teen was able  to thank his rescuers 3 months later at  the Harford County Sheriff’s Office  Awards Banquet.  Exactly 11 years before his death,  Deputy Logsdon confronted a suicidal  man who was armed with a  loaded  shotgun. In a display of great bravery  and at great risk to himself, Deputy  Logsdon managed to talk the man into  surrendering his weapon. After  the  man was disarmed, Deputy Logsdon  continued to help the man by transporting him to the hospital, where he  received medical care.  Officer Colson was  an undercover  narcotics agent. He had a dangerous  job with zero margin for error. Officer  Colson did not make errors. He was a 4-  year veteran of the Prince George’s Police Department. The commander of  the Prince George’s County Police Department’s Narcotic Enforcement Division said of Colson,  ‘‘Not only is he  good at his job, he’s that guy that you  wanted on your team.’’  The President of the Fraternal Order  of Police, Lodge 89 described Officer  Colson as ‘‘. . . always the first person  here in the morning, ready to work and  put in a full day’s work.’’  All three of these men could have  done anything with their  lives, and  they chose to uphold the law. I am  thankful  that,  for  the many people  they interacted with on a daily basis,  these men  embodied  justice.  I  join  Marylanders in mourning their loss.  It is my hope that this National Police Week serves as a catalyst to communities and governments across the  country  to evaluate ways  to better  serve those who are sworn to protect  and serve.

Sunday was Peace Officers Memorial  Day, a day set aside by President Kennedy in 1962 to honor those law enforcement officers who we have lost in  the line of duty, a day that unfortunately has touched me personally, both  in the past while serving as attorney  general  for North Dakota and tragically again earlier this year when the  city of Fargo, ND, lost one of its finest  in the line of duty.  On the evening of Wednesday, February  10,  2016, Fargo Police Officer  Jason Moszer answered  the  call  to  serve and protect for what would turn  out to be the last time. He knew when  he answered that call that he would  confront an active-shooter situation,  and he never hesitated in taking up a  position to put himself between the  shooter and the community he so very  much loved.

The Congress of Future Medical Leaders is  an honors-only program  that  is designed  to  motivate and direct  the  top students  in  the  United States. Specifically,  it’s designed  for  students aspiring  to become physicians or  medical researchers, and provides a path and  mentorship  for students  to accomplish  their  goals.  To be considered for acceptance as a delegate, applicants are either recommended by a  teacher or member of the Academy based on  a proven track record of academic excellence.  Delegates represent all 50 states plus Puerto  Rico, and must have a minimum 3.5 GPA.  Students like Thuerauf who qualify for this incredibly selective honor exemplify top-tier diligence and academic talent.  Mr. Speaker, Starr Thuerauf will undoubtedly represent Missouri with distinction during  her time as a delegate to this Congress. She  has not only shown a strong academic capability during her time at school, but is also a  well-rounded individual with a deep interest in  the medical  field.  I would  like  to extend my  personal congratulations for her achievement,  and on behalf of the 7th District of Missouri,  wish Starr the best of luck in all her future endeavors.  f  RECOGNIZING  THE  IMPORTANCE  OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS  AND DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER  2016 AS  ‘‘NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION RECOGNITION MONTH’’  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 19, 2016  ",2016

242,House,114,0.57,10,2016-05-25,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker,  the Founders  recognized that, within the District of Columbia, this was a unique entity. But  Congress, in its benevolence, granted  the District of Columbia limited autonomy in the Home Rule Act of 1973. That  autonomy did not extend as far as what  the current Mayor and city council envisioned it to.  The Home Rule Act maintained the  role of the Federal Government in the  District’s budget process; and, indeed,  the Federal Government has had to  step in as late as the 1990s because the  District had  so mismanaged  its  finances.  MEADOWS),  Then, the District of Columbia Financial Control Board had to be instituted in order to correct the many financial disasters that the District of  Columbia government had created for  itself. Congress gave  the board  the  power to override the D.C. government  where it saw fit.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr.  from  the Oversight  and  Government Reform Committee, where  this bill originated.  ",2016
243,House,114,0.627,10,2016-05-25,Mr. MEADOWS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Texas for his eloquent words.  As we look at this particular bill,  there is a lot that has been said about  what home rule is and what it is not.  There is a lot that has been said about  what the law is and what it is not, and  yet it is undeniable that the Constitution  actually  reserved  for  this  esteemed body  the power  to  legislate  over all affairs within  the District,  going back to Article I, section 8 of our  Constitution.  And yet in 1973, Mr. Speaker, this  body took on a law, debated it in both  the House and the Senate, to actually  take some of those authorities granted  by the Constitution and allow the District to actually put forth laws with regard to local issues.  Now,  specifically  reserved  in  that  1973 law was the whole issue of the  budget and appropriations. As we started to look at this particular function—  my good friend, the Delegate from the  District, obviously has talked very seriously about the law.  Well, the law was very clear in 1973  on what we passed. Actually, Charles  Diggs—Chairman  Diggs—had  what  they called the Diggs Compromise that  specifically was spelled out in a dear  colleague letter on the fact that budgetary control would remain with this  body and, indeed, with the appropriators. Yet somehow we see a decision  by a superior court as having the effect  of law?  Well, we know from our civics class  that  it  is this body that  is putting  forth Federal law. It cannot be a local  jurisdiction that comes in and usurps  the power of the Federal law with its  local mandates.  So, Mr. Speaker, while my  good  friend and I will disagree perhaps on a  number of issues, what we should agree  on is the fact that the Constitution reserved  this  right  for Congress. The  Constitution and,  indeed,  those  relegated and delegated powers  in 1973  were specific in keeping the appropriations and budgetary process within this  body. To ignore that would be, honestly,  ignoring the debate that happened then, debate that happens now,  and sworn testimony in hearings that,  indeed,  those who crafted  this particular law are all in agreement that  this was the intent of Congress.  So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask  my colleagues to not only support this,  but reaffirm the role that Congress has  and make sure that we keep it within  this body.

Mr. Speaker, for all your work on  this legislation to make much-needed  reforms  to modernize energy policy  into something that better promotes  affordability, reliability, and ensures  we have the energy we need to continue growing jobs in our communities,  I say thank you.  Among the many strong provisions in  this bill, several are particularly important to the West and our rural communities across central, eastern, and  southern Oregon.  For  farmers  and  ranchers  in  the  Klamath Basin, this bill ensures that  they will actually get a formal seat at  the table when there is consultation  with Federal  agencies  on  decisions  under the ESA. Irrigators in this area  have long been impacted by these decisions, and it is only fair they should  have an equal seat at the table with  other entities during these discussions.  Perhaps one of the timeliest provisions, Mr. Speaker, as we head into forest fire season in the West, are the provisions that provide  for streamlined  planning and would reduce  frivolous  lawsuits and speed up the pace of forest  management across our public lands.

The Department of Energy’s energy  conservation program issues efficiency  regulations  for  everyday  appliances  like  dishwashers  and  vending machines. The rules are based on a cost-  benefit analysis, but the analysis  is  vague and skewed to the desired outcome. Rather than improving the lives  of consumers, these mandates drive up  the cost of appliances.  To address the rising costs and the  crackdown on consumer choice, this  amendment prohibits energy mandates  on residential dishwashers, ceiling fan  light kits, and vending machines. Individuals should have a choice of whether  or not to buy these appliances.  As consumer demand for efficiency  increases, the market will find a way  to produce appliances that save more  energy.

Neptune  Hose Company No. 1 continues to live up to  its motto ‘ ‘Semper Paratus’ ’ (‘ ‘Always Ready’ ’)  to ensure the safety of Long Branch residents  and  its dedication  is  truly deserving of  this  body’s recognition.  The  first organized  fire company  in Monmouth County, Neptune Hose Company No. 1,  originally known as  the Neptune Hook and  Ladder Company No. 1, was founded by Dr.  James O. Green  in 1866. The name was  changed  in September 1877  to reflect Long  Branch’s new public water system and fire hydrants. Initially maintained by share and stock  holders,  the company chartered as Neptune  Hose Company No. 1 on November 10, 1877.  Over the years, the company was housed at  different locations, finally settling at its current  property  in January 1906.  It underwent renovations from 1974 until 1975 to update and  expand the structure and again in 2007 to repair and restore the second floor.  Neptune Hose Company No. 1 was one of  the three fire companies, along with Oceanic  Fire Engine Company No. 1 and the Atlantic  Fire Engine and Hook and Ladder Company  No. 2, to organize the Long Branch Fire Department on November 2, 1878. Since the inception of the department, sixteen members of  Neptune Hose Company No. 1 have served  as Chief.

254,,114,0.593,283,2016-05-25,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  it happened  right  under  the  entire  community’s  nose. Eight year old Jen Spry was raped and  tortured on a daily basis.  She was not kidnapped by a stranger in a  dark alley. She was trafficked just a few doors  down from her mother’s house.  It was not just Jen who was trafficked. Her  younger sister, a male cousin, and a whole  group of kids  from her hometown of Norristown Pennsylvania were victims as well.  No one ever went looking for the children,  simply  because  they  never went missing.  From 3–6 p.m. every day she was forced to  have sex with strangers, because, as she describes it, it was her job.  The children were coerced into participating  and threatened into keeping it a secret. The  trafficking finally ended when she was about  10 when the neighbor suddenly moved away.  Jen went to great lengths to hide the abuse  from her single mother, who never found out  about the tragedies that Jen experienced. In  fact, Jen did not speak out about what happened until after her mother passed away.  Stories like Jen’s drove us to write JVTA. As  did stories  like Tina Frundt’s, who  joins us  today.  She is a huge part of the solution with her  organization Courtney’s House and her membership on  the U.S. Advisory Council on  Human Trafficking created by JVTA as well as  the persistence of many of the groups present  today.  The United States views itself as a leader in  the fight against human trafficking. Even going  as far as to grade other countries on their efforts to combat trafficking in persons.  Yet, before the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA) became law, I heard about  common  issues  from survivors and anti-trafficking organizations on  the national, state,  and local levels, as well as law enforcement  and local leaders. Some of the common concerns included:  The federal government barely funds efforts  to combat trafficking in the United States. Trafficking victims are often arrested and treated  as criminals, but buyers are often not.  Many Americans including those that interact with trafficking victims—law enforcement,  educators, medical professionals, and others  —do not know about human trafficking or understand how to identify victims. Hearing this  message  loud and  clear, a bipartisan, bicameral group of Members of Congress set  out to write a bill using the survivor experience  to  guide  us  and  learning  from  programs  around  the country  that are working  to  fight  trafficking and serve victims.  CAROLYNMALONEY, a Democrat from New  York and  I  lead  the effort on JVTA  in  the  House. Congresswoman MALONEYand I hardly speak the same language.  Being from New York she thinks I talk funny  and as a Texan I can hardly understand her  either the effort was led by another unusual  pair in the Senate.  A Texas Republican, Senator JOHNCORNYN  and  an Oregon Democrat,  Senator RON  WYDEN. 11 anti-trafficking bills passed through  the House, including those led by some of the  wonderful women here today.  The bills were combined  in  the Senate,  came back to the House, passed overwhelmingly and were signed into law. The law addresses the common problems we heard from  the field. We created a Domestic Trafficking  Victims Fund that makes those who harm vulnerable people pay for the damage they have  caused.  A $5,000 special assessment  is collected  from those convicted of human trafficking and  other related charges, and goes into a Fund to  provide resources to victims and those fighting  trafficking.  A fundamental goal of JVTA is for victims of  human trafficking to be treated as victims and  not criminals. This is addressed in a number  of provisions in the law, including a newly created community-based block grant.  We also  focus on  the demand—buyers,  those that exploit women and children. While  many call  these people  ‘johns, ’ ’  I call  them  child molesters.  John is a name from the Bible, a good guy,  not someone who pays money to abuse a fellow person.  JVTA clarifies that those who buy sex from  trafficking victims are human  traffickers, can  and should be punished under  federal  law,  and are subject to the same penalties as sellers.  JVTA has done a lot to change the mindset  of people in this country. But we need the law  to be  fully  implemented by all  the agencies  charged with executing the law including DOJ,  HHS, and DHS.  In order to truly be the leader in the fight  against modern day slavery. We anxiously  await the response to our letter. A society will  be judged by how it treats the most vulnerable.  And that’s just the way it is.  TRIBUTE TO BABE AND FRANK  MAINS  HON. DAVID YOUNG  OFIOWA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 25, 2016  ",2016

In a matter of hours, more than 20  people were killed, hundreds of homes  destroyed, and thousands of residents’  lives were turned upside-down.  Through the heartbreak, stories of  heroism have emerged. Neighbors have  offered a helping hand to strangers.  Our churches and schools have opened  their doors to people in need and those  who have lost their homes are still volunteering at our command centers and  food lines.  This  is what makes West Virginia  special. When things get tough, we get  working. We band together and we are  stronger together.  I have traveled throughout our flood-  ravaged communities doing what I can  to  support our  recovery. Along  the  way, I have met brave people, selfless  people, and some of the kindest people  you would ever get a chance to know.  In the basement of the Summersville  Baptist Church, thousands of  family  photographs from just one family lay  on tables curled and soaked in floodwater. Church youth group members  worked to take each picture out of its  frame or album and spread them out to  dry. This parishioner may have lost her  home, but this spirit of community is  helping preserve her memories.  In Rainelle, I met an 18-year-old who  had just joined the volunteer fire department. His job after the floodwaters  receded was to recover and retrieve  bodies and then stand guard over them  in the fire department. He has seen and  done things that no one should have  had to experience, but he kept doing  his job as a volunteer for his community, serving his community.  I met a lady sheltered the first night  in Ansted who was rescued after hours  in her one-story home that had filled  with 4 feet of water. She survived the  horrific event by relying on her deep  faith, knowing she was in God’s hands.  The road ahead will be tough. We  have a very long way to go. We will always remember and honor those whom  we lost, and we will offer our love and  support to those rebuilding their lives.  I know we will rebuild. We will repair  our  schools,  restock  our  library  shelves, repave our roads, and reconstruct our bridges. We will be there for  each other.  We are West Virginians, and it is our  home.  f  b1015  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE  HAD ENOUGH  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JENKINSof West Virginia).

256,House,114,-0.395,2,2016-07-06,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  because  the  American  people  have  had  enough.  They have had enough with the epidemic of gun violence in our country.  They have had enough with House Republicans’ obstruction of bipartisan,  pro-Second Amendment legislation to  help keep guns away from those who  shouldn’t have them—terrorists, criminals, domestic abusers, and the dangerously mentally ill—because whether  it is in a movie theater, on a college  campus, at an elementary school, in a  church,  in  a nightclub,  or  on  the  streets of our cities, we have lost far  too many innocent lives to gun violence.

257,House,114,0.219,9,2016-07-06,Ms. STEFANIK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to support our military families.  Beside our Nation’s brave  servicemembers are strong families that remain resilient through countless relocations  and  deployments. Military  spouses wear their own patches of service and share a true sense of duty to  our country. They sacrifice a great  deal throughout the constant moves  and the unknown, all while supporting  their husband or wife in uniform.  These spouses are often employed in  professions that require new licensing  for each new location, such as teachers  and  nurses—vital  occupations  in  a  military community. These dedicated  spouses must be allowed to maintain  their hard-earned professional licenses  and certifications as they relocate.  That is why this week I am introducing the Lift the Relocation Burden  for Military Spouses Act. Military  spouses serve, too, and my bill will  help maintain employment continuity  and greater predictability for them and  their families.  I urge my colleagues to support this  important bill.  f  VOTE ON NO FLY, NO BUY AND  BACKGROUND CHECKS  ",2016
258,House,114,-0.4,9,2016-07-06,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, as we started what is commonly referred to as ‘‘our 5 minutes,’’  the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr.  JOLLY) talked about a proposal that he  would  like to bring  forward to this  body. We wish him well in that. He also  wondered aloud why it would be that  Democrats are so interested in bringing two commonsense proposals that  he feels might fail—because it is our  constitutional  responsibility  to  the  citizens that we are sworn to serve and  represent.  Speaker RYANhas said: ‘‘We will not  duck the tough issues. We will take  them head on . . . we should not hide  our disagreements. We should embrace  them. We have nothing to fear from  honest disagreements honestly stated.’’  The Speaker is right. He is an honorable man.  He met with JOHNLEWISand myself  last evening. JOHNLEWIS is the conscience of the House of Representatives  and, I dare say, the soul of this Nation.  The Speaker and JOHNLEWISengaged  in a conversation that was reverent in  its tone and respectful. We stated, as  no one better than JOHNLEWIS can,  with great clarity about what is happening all across the Nation—the catastrophic loss of life due to gun violence  and the utter frustration on the part of  people on this side of the aisle and,  frankly, families and people all across  this great Nation, simply asking for  the dignity of a vote—our constitutional responsibility.  The Speaker did say to us and asked  aloud in a quandary, not as a deal or  not as any rationale, but today there is  an important bill, the Helping Families  in Mental Health Crisis Act, authored  by TIMMURPHY, a Republican, supported by Democrats who worked together. Democrats would have done  more and felt the bill could have been  more comprehensive and better funded.  The important thing is that the Nation  wants to see us move forward.  We said to the Speaker we would  take this message back to our caucus.  And I say, appealing as Lincoln would,  to the better angels of your side, as we  embrace this issue today and support  this effort bipartisanly, think long and  hard about joining us. There has to be  more than five of you on the other side  who will come with us and support  commonsense legislation. Background  checks that are fundamental that law  enforcement knows are what we absolutely need to assist in this goal of  making sure that we keep this country  safer are what is required.  I hope, Mr. Speaker,  that  in  the  midst  of  our  disagreement,  in  the  midst of our dissent and continued  presence on this floor, to articulate our  deep feelings and commitment to the  citizens we are sworn to serve, you will  permit that the majority will allow a  vote to take place on this floor which  will demonstrate to this great country  that this United States Congress can  work. It will start today. It will happen  when that bill comes to the floor. This  side of the aisle joins with you to get  an  important  piece  of  legislation  passed and adopted as it relates to the  mental health crisis in this country.  As DIANADEGETTEsaid, it should not  be considered a substitute, but what it  should be considered is a step that we  can work together in a common cause.  It is what the American people expect  from us. We should give them no less.  Minimally, we deserve a vote, a vote on  no fly, no buy and a vote on background checks.  f  VOTE ON NO FLY, NO BUY AND  BACKGROUND CHECKS  ",2016
259,House,114,-0.529,9,2016-07-06,Mr. HONDA.," Mr.  Speaker, Omar  Mateen should not have had access to a  gun, yet he walked  into  the Pulse  nightclub and murdered 49 people and  injured many more.  Syed Farooq  and Tashfeen Malik  should not have had access to guns, but  were  able  to  buy  several weapons,  which they used to kill 14 people in San  Bernardino.  Gerald Villabrille should not have  had access to a gun, yet he shot two police officers  in Fremont, California,  early last month. That is in my district.  These aren’t isolated incidents. Rather, they represent an epidemic in this  country. With most epidemics, we immediately set about trying to find a  cure, or at least a treatment. But with  gun violence, we have settled for moments of silence. Well, enough of that.  A couple of weeks ago, Democrats  got  together  and  said, Enough  is  enough. We took to the House floor to  demand House Speaker RYANand Republican  leadership bring bills  that  would counter this epidemic to a vote.  In response, Speaker RYAN called our  efforts to get a vote a stunt.

I believe it builds on  earlier legislation we enacted in this  Congress, like the Clay Hunt suicide  awareness and prevention bill, improving the mental health for our veterans.  And it fills a void that has existed for  decades now since we de-institutionalized in the 1970s, a decision I support,  but we never put Federal policy in behind it until today, Mr. Speaker, resources for the local level for inpatient  care  for Americans and  families  in  mental health crisis.  b1430  It improves coordination across the  agencies  to  deliver  better  suicide  awareness and prevention  in mental  health.

264,House,114,0.518,51,2016-07-06,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in support of H.R. 1270, the Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2016,  led and authored by Congresswoman  LYNNJENKINS.  House Republicans recognize the Affordable Care Act is really making life  harder for so many families and job  creators. That is why we have released  a detailed plan  to  repeal  this controversial law and have put in place  healthcare solutions that are focused  on what the American people need, not  what Washington needs. This bill by  Congresswoman JENKINS helps  build  upon and advance that important effort. The legislation is a testament to  regular  legislative order. It contains  three policies that have been approved  in advance by the Ways and Means  Committee.  First, H.R. 1270 eliminates a nonsensical ObamaCare regulation that puts  Washington between patients and the  medications they need.  Under ObamaCare, Americans  are  limited. They can only use their personal medical savings accounts to buy  prescription drugs only. It doesn’t matter if there is an over-the-counter alternative that works just as well and  costs half as much. No. ObamaCare  says you cannot use your own health  savings to pay for it without an expensive prescription. This bill cuts this  Federal red tape so Americans, in a  commonsense way, have the freedom to  use their own health savings or flexible  spending accounts to buy the medication that best suits them regardless of  what side of the counter it comes from.  Second, the bill makes commonsense  improvements to how you contribute  to and spend from your health savings  accounts.  These improvements, first introduced  by Representative PAULSEN and Dr.  allow Americans  to  save  more, to coordinate their savings with  their spouses, and to have better access  to their savings.  Finally, the measure acts to protect  taxpayer dollars by making sure that  those who aren’t eligible to get subsidies pay them back. It makes common sense. If you are not eligible, you  should pay them back. Some patients  do under the current law.  Twice, Republicans and Democrats  have  come  together  to make  the  ObamaCare subsidy repayment fairer. I  am hopeful that we can continue that  sense of bipartisan cooperation today. I  congratulate Congresswoman JENKINS.  Her bill will help people in America  save. I urge its support.  b1515  ",2016
265,House,114,0.332,79,2016-07-06,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Madam  Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  This bill is a bill that we all can support. It provides $21.7 billion for financial services and Treasury programs,  the Federal judiciary, and small businesses. This total is $1.5 billion below  current  levels and $2.7 billion below  what was requested by the President.  Within  this  allocation,  the  bill  prioritizes funding where it will be best  used and makes policy reforms that  improve efficiency and accountability.  To start with, the bill takes steps to  address issues at the IRS, both cutting  overall funding and including funding  limitations to prevent the IRS from  continuing their recent history of bad  behavior. In total, the IRS is provided  with $10.9 billion. That is $236 million  below current  levels. This holds the  agency’s budget below fiscal 2008 levels,  forcing the agency to streamline and  focus on its core duties.

As the gentleman from Oregon mentioned, the draft ended in 1973. Conscription  ended. Then  the Selective  Service System was put on the shelf,  inactivated, and was only activated  when, in a show of resolve, President  Jimmy Carter, in the aftermath of the  December 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,  reinstituted  conscription.  He reinstituted signing up for the Selective Service System. I think he suspended wheat sales to the Soviet Union  as well as our participation  in  the  Olympic Games, which were scheduled  to be in Moscow.  It has never been used. During the  height of Iraq and Afghanistan, there  has never even been a discussion within  the Department of Defense, even with  personnel shortages, about using the  draft.  In a recent study by the Army Recruiting Command, it determined that  something like 75 percent of young people—military-aged  people—are  ineligible to serve  in the United States  Army.

273,Senate,114,0.342,205,2016-07-06,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Madam President,  almost 1 year ago to the day, a young  woman was walking arm in arm with  her father along a pier in San Francisco. She had hopes and dreams and a  bright future ahead, but her life was  cut short when she was tragically shot,  dying in her father’s arms. Her name  was Kate Steinle.  The suspected killer, who was illegally in the country and deported five  times prior to that day, was released  into the community by a sanctuary jurisdiction that did not honor a detainer  issued by  Immigration and Customs  Enforcement. The  suspect  in Kate’s  death admitted that he chose to be in  San Francisco because of its sanctuary  policies.  Unfortunately, nothing has changed  in the last year. Sanctuary cities, including San Francisco,  continue  to  harbor people in the country illegally.  Since Kate was killed, there has been  a long list of tragedies, tragedies that  could have been avoided—some that  could have been avoided if sanctuary  policies were not in place, some that  could have been avoided if we had a  more secure border and beefed-up penalties for those who enter the country  illegally time and again.

One of  them was reported at the same time as  Judge Martinotti and has also been  awaiting a vote for over 8 months. We  still do not have an agreement to vote  on the nomination of Edward Stanton  to the Western District of Tennessee.  In 2010, the Senate voted unanimously  to confirm Mr. Stanton as the U.S. attorney  for that district. His current  nomination is supported by his two Republican home State Senators, and he  was unanimously voice voted out of the  Judiciary Committee. I hope the Republican Senators from Tennessee will  be able to persuade the majority leader  to schedule a vote for Mr. Stanton’s  nomination before we leave for the 7-  week recess he has scheduled.  It is the Senate’s duty to ensure that  our independent judiciary can function.  Senate Republicans must be responsible and act on Chief Judge Garland’s  nomination, as well as the 24 judicial  nominations that are languishing on  the Senate floor.

Whether it’s a five-person start-up or a global giant, the companies that are most productive are the ones whose employees operate with a shared sense of purpose and a  clear set of policies for responding to changing conditions and new opportunities.  That’s why I’m so appalled by what’s happening  in the Senate this year, and how  starkly it illustrates the differences between  Silicon Valley and Washington, DC.

The vacancy created by Justice Scalia’s passing,  McConnell  insisted,  ‘‘should not be  filled  until we have a new president.’’  Since then, Leader McConnell’s position  has  remained  unchanged—he won’t  even  meet with any nominee until January 2017.  Effectively, he and his allies are in the midst  of a year-long strike.  Imagine if entire departments at Fortune  500 companies announced they were going to  stop performing key functions of their job  for a year or more, with no possibility of  moving forward until a new CEO took over.  Investors would start dumping their stock.  Customers would seek out alternatives. Competitors would make these companies pay for  such dysfunctional gridlock. Eventually executives and employees would be fired.  In Silicon Valley, such behavior would be  corporate suicide. In Washington, DC, it’s  business as usual.  So Mitch McConnell’s strike goes on and  on—he refuses to even meet with any nominee until a new president takes office. Other  senators  like Richard Burr  (R–NC), Sen.  Chuck Grassley (R–IA), and Rob Portman (R–  OH) have followed McConnell’s lead, either  refusing to even informally meet with Judge  Garland, or meeting but still reflexively insisting that a formal Senate hearing is not  an option.  But the Constitution does not give the job  of  nominating  and  appointing  Supreme  Court Justices  to  the next President—it  gives it to the current one.  Respecting  the Constitution’s authority  and the obligations of his  job, President  Obama nominated a potential replacement  for Justice Scalia, Judge Merrick Garland,  on March 16. To date, only two Republican  senators—Senator Mark Kirk  (R–IL)  and  Susan Collins  (R–ME)—have  resisted peer  pressure and publicly stated that Judge Garland should be given a formal hearing. The  rest are joining McConnell in his strike.  In a 2013 op-ed, New York Times columnist  Thomas L. Friedman explored the difference  between Silicon Valley’s conception of collaboration and Washington, DC’s. In the nation’s capital, Friedman observed, collaboration ‘‘is an act of treason—something you do  when you cross over and vote with the other  party.’’ In Silicon Valley, companies that  are ‘‘trying to kill each other in one market  [are] working together in another—to better  serve customers.’’  As Friedman went on to explain, Silicon  Valley’s  version  of  collaboration  doesn’t  mean  groupthink  or  lockstep  consensus.  Vital organizations and industries cultivate  diverse and competitive viewpoints, because  it’s this very ‘‘clash of ideas’’ that tends to  produce innovation and adaptation.  But Silicon Valley situates  its clash of  ideas within a larger framework of cooperation and compromise, under the premise that  what’s good for the ecosystem as a whole  will also benefit individual players, even if  they sometimes have competing interests.  What’s striking about McConnell’s stance  is how vividly it illustrates DC’s preference  for reflexive obstruction over the kind of collaboration and consensus-building that characterizes healthy and productive organizations.  It’s not as if the Constitution doesn’t give  senators  like McConnell  broad  room  in  which to operate in dissenting fashion. Specifically, Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution  invests  the President with  the  power to make appointments ‘‘by and with  the advice and consent of the Senate.’’  This language clearly gives the Senate a  confirming but open-ended role. It doesn’t  instruct the Senate to hold hearing within a  specific number of days,  for example.  It  doesn’t even explicitly mandate that the  Senate must hold formal hearings or meet  with a nominee.  The Constitution simply directs the Senate  to advise the President in his effort to nominate and appoint nominees. But how can the  Senate credibly and effectively fulfill this  obligation without making any effort  to  gather information about nominees and deliberate on their qualifications?  In keeping the language so broad in this  instance, the Constitution effectively places  the Senate in far more than a rubber-stamping role. As Barack Obama himself suggested  in 2006, when he was still a senator, the Senate arguably has the authority to examine a  nominee’s  ‘‘philosophy,  ideology,  and  record,’’ not just his general character.  What Article II, Section 2 ultimately does,  in other words, is set the stage for clashes of  ideas, albeit within a larger framework of  collaboration and consensus.  Importantly,  the Constitution advises the Senate to work  ‘‘with’’ the President, not ‘‘against’’ him or  in opposition to him.  And it presumes that the Senate will indeed be working.  Still, instead of holding hearings in which  to assess Judge Garland’s suitability for the  Court, McConnell and his colleagues are  doing nothing.  If their obstructionism goes unchecked, it  will continue harming American citizens in  very tangible ways. Having only eight Justices on the bench increases the possibility  of a deadlock.  When cases end in deadlock, nothing gets  decided. Resources are expended, and the  American public is left hanging until the  Court can hear the case again or consider another case with similar issues.  This  has  happened  twice  already—last  week when the Court deadlocked on an immigration reform case, and in March, in a  case regarding whether individuals should be  required to guarantee their spouses’ loans.  Traditionally, laws regarding this practice  have differed in various parts of the country,  creating confusion for small business owners  and their spouses about what their obligations are. Unfortunately, this confusion and  lack of clarity will persist indefinitely because of the Court’s deadlock.  What would happen  if President Obama  told Congress not to bother passing any  more bills this year, because he had decided  he would automatically veto any of them  that made it to his desk? How many private  sector  organizations would  tolerate  personnel who refuse to perform key job responsibilities until the current boss is replaced  by someone new?

275,Senate,114,0.259,219,2016-07-06,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. President, I rise  today to emphasize the importance of  the MILCON-VA and Zika conference  bill. As a member of the conference  committee that crafted this report and  a member of the subcommittee that  drafted the Military Construction and  Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, I  cannot overstate  the  significance of  this legislation.  Sadly, we have watched the Senate  Democrats play politics with critical  funding for our military, our veterans,  and  funding to combat Zika. In my  view, this stunt—and I call it a stunt  because that is what it is—is both dangerous and disheartening. It is an insult to the men and women who sacrifice so much to keep us safe. It is a  reckless game to play with our veterans and public health across  this  country.  The  conference  report  includes  record-level funding for America’s veterans. It fully funds the VA’s request  for veterans’ medical services and provides an overall increase of nearly 9  percent for our veterans programs. It  includes measures for the Department  of Veterans Affairs to improve access  and efficiency for military services. We  certainly know we have a long way to  go before we get satisfaction there. We  have a long way to go to reduce the  backlogs  in  claims  processing,  strengthen our whistleblower protections, and improve information technology in medical research.  The drug epidemic plaguing our Nation has unfortunately hit our veterans  community  particularly  hard,  especially in my home State of West Virginia. The overdose rate in my State is  more than twice the national average.  With almost 40 percent of our State’s  veterans using the VA health care system, it is vital that we strengthen the  VA’s ability to help treat opioid addiction.  Whether our veterans are recovering  from  injuries obtained during  their  service or tending to their daily health  needs, this bill provides funding to give  veterans a new lease on life. This includes supporting the VA’s Opioid Safety Initiative—something I have been  very  involved with—which  improves  pain care for those who have a higher  risk of opioid-related overdoses. It also  encourages the VA to continually expand  treatment  services and better  monitor our at-risk veterans.  Another thing we can do for our veterans is ensure they have ample employment opportunities as they transition into civilian life—another problem  we have identified. In West Virginia,  where the majority of our veterans live  in rural areas—and as many of you  know,  almost  the whole  State  is  VerDate Sep 11 2014  03:29 Jul 07, 2016 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G06JY6.041 S06JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 2 8 0 Q L G 3 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2016

278,,114,0.596,254,2016-07-06,Mr. ROKITA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor a personal  friend, Sigma Chi brother,  and prominent Hoosier, Mr. James E. Dora,  who passed away on June 27, 2016.  Jim was born  in Vincennes,  Indiana and  graduated  from Purdue University where he  was a member of the Delta Delta Chapter of  Sigma Chi Fraternity. He gave back  to his  alma mater serving as Chairman to the President’s Council, Vice Chairman of the Vision 21  Capital Campaign, as an Old Master and on  the Advisory Board for the RHIT Hotel School.  Purdue honored him in kind with the Purdue  Order of the Griffin and an Honorary Doctorate  Degree, and honor he also received from Vincennes University.  Jim’s commitment to Sigma Chi, its Purdue  Chapter, and his brothers are reflected in his  actions. He was co-chair of a complete renovation of the chapter house, including a $7.4  million fundraising campaign to achieve it. Jim  was recognized by Sigma Chi earning the Significant Sig of Sigma Chi, Sigma Chi Hall of  Fame, and the Order of the Constantine honors. He also received the Purdue Chapter Ben  Taylor Award.  As a businessman, Jim founded and chaired  General Hotels Corporation, a developer and  operator of award winning hotels  throughout  Central Indiana, including the upscale Crowne  Plaza Holiday Inn at Union Station in Downtown Indianapolis. He served as Chairman of  the  International Association of Holiday  Inn  Owners and on  the Board of Directors  for  American United Life  Insurance Company,  First Chicago, NBD, Bank One  and  the  Mayflower Corporation.  Jim was also a selfless advocate  for  the  City of Indianapolis. He was a member of numerous boards and committees, including the  Capital Improvement Board of Managers from  1971–1993 and  served as President  from  1985–1993. His service coincided with and  was instrumental in the growth and development of Downtown Indianapolis and the Colts  relocation to our city in 1984. Jim also served  on the Educational CHOICE Charitable Trust,  Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, Downtown  Indy,  Inc. and more. Jim was  twice  named a Sagamore of the Wabash, the state ’s  highest honor for a citizen.  Jim and  I shared a  love  for aviation, our  home state of Indiana and public service. His  whole-hearted support of my public service efforts and the efforts of those like me has been  invaluable as I served Hoosiers for the past 13  years. Jim leaves behind his beloved wife of  57 years, Shirley, four children, and 11 grandchildren. I believe this world is a better place  because of his compassionate service to our  community, state and nation. In this sign you  will conquer (In hoc signo vinces) Jim, you will  not be forgotten.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE DUBLIN  COFFMAN HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS  TRACK AND FIELD TEAM  HON. PATRICK J.

For over a century, the Ohio High School  Athletic Association has provided Ohio’s finest  student athletes with the opportunity to earn a  state championship. Each year young men  and women spend countless hours practicing  and training in an effort to join the ranks of  Ohio’s elite athletes. Although many strive to  earn the title of state champion, only a select  few will achieve this honor.  Dublin Coffman’s victory caps a tremendous  season. This sort of achievement stands as a  testament to their hard work. Shaunqueza Stevens, Shannon Downie, Wambui Watene, and  Abby Steiner have set a new standard for future athletes  to  reach. Everyone at Dublin  Coffman High School can be extremely proud  of their performance.  On behalf of  the citizens of Ohio ’s 12th  Congressional District,  I congratulate Dublin  Coffman High School’s Girls Track and Field  on their state championship. I wish their team  continued success in their future athletic endeavors.  IN RECOGNITION OF THE  LEHIGHTON 150TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.

281,,114,-0.279,261,2016-07-06,Mr. POLIS.," Mr. Speaker, as a member of  the Colorado Delegation of the U.S. House of  Representatives, I am highlighting an issue of  importance to Colorado and its community of  senior citizens. Earlier  this year, Congress  passed the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 and sent it to the President  for his signature. This reauthorization ensures  that a wide  range of social and nutritional  services directed  to assist senior citizens  is  not disrupted. While  the  reauthorization  improves the status quo for the state of Colorado, I still have concerns about the continuing  inequity in funding going to our state in comparison to the rest of the country.  In an attempt to protect certain states with  shrinking senior populations,  in 2006 Congress changed the Older Americans Act funding formula to ensure states received a guaranteed  funding  level. This  is known as  the  ‘Hold Harmless Funding Formula.’ ’ Due  to  Colorado’s growing senior population and this  provision from 2006, Colorado (among other  states) saw massive cuts during sequestration  when other states did not.  Instead of allowing  the  funding  to go  to  states with growing senior populations,  the  hold harmless funding formula in the current  reauthorization continues the disproportionate  trend by preventing  funding  in states with  lower senior populations from going to states  with growing levels of senior citizens. While I  am supportive of the services provided by the  Older Americans Act, Congress’ priority should  be ensuring the stability of the programs upon  which millions of seniors around the country  depend.  I believe that moving forward, it is imperative that steps are taken in future reauthorizations to safeguard services for all seniors regardless of their state of residence. It is my  hope that as Congress continues to address  issues that are important to all senior citizens  we find a path forward to address the issue  I’ve raised today.  f  OLDER AMERICANS ACT  HON.

283,House,114,-0.487,2,2016-07-13,Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts.,"  Madam Speaker, 3 weeks ago today,  House Democrats conducted a sit-in to  demand a  commonsense debate and  votes on gun violence. Americans gathered  around  their  televisions,  computers, and phones and rooted for this  Congress to do the right thing.  Across  the  country,  families  demanded that this body take up two  commonsense measures to reduce our  country’s  epidemic of gun violence.  Phones in our offices throughout Capitol Hill were ringing off the hook.  Thousands  of  Americans—students,  teachers, grieving parents, strangers to  the political process—saw something  that  inspired and excited them, and  they picked up the phone because they  had hope. Their message: Thank you  for fighting for us. Make sure something is done.  What did this Congress do with that  hope? Well, instead of allowing a vote  to expand background checks to keep  Americans safe, instead of allowing a  vote to close the terrorist gun loophole, instead of even having a debate  on gun safety, the Speaker turned his  back on the American people and sent  the House home early.  Since Orlando, hundreds have died  from gun violence. Just in the streets  of Chicago, more than 300 people have  been hurt or killed by guns in the last  month. An average of 91 Americans are  killed every day by guns.  There was a time when unthinkable  violence and mass shootings shook our  Nation to  its core, and our elected  leaders would find a way to bring us together  like  the bipartisan  calls we  heard  for unity  in Dallas yesterday.  They would struggle to get it right, but  ultimately they would and save lives.  It happened 82 years ago with the  New Deal  for Crime. It happened 48  years ago with major gun violence reforms. And it happened 23 years ago  when Americans stood up to the powerful gun  lobby and passed the Brady  Handgun Violence Program. Each time,  a frustrated, grieving, but determined  Nation took a stand together to say  enough is enough.  It has been 23 years since our country  passed any meaningful gun violence  legislation.  Since  then,  gun-related  crimes have claimed more American  lives than AIDS, war, and illegal drug  overdoses combined. Since Newtown,  tens of thousands of lives have been  lost to this deadly crisis. The number  of bills that have been debated and  passed by  this Congress  to prevent  these deaths remains at zero.  This Republican Congress may find  comfort in remaining silent, in doing  the bidding of the NRA, in turning its  back on our people. But our inaction  disservices our constituents and the  tens of thousands of families who have  lost loved ones to gun violence. Millions more worry that they and their  families are not safe. And if mothers  can’t sleep at night knowing their children  are  safe  from  harm,  neither  should this Congress.  I challenge my colleagues who have  been silent on gun violence to engage  their communities when they go home,  to try and find a way to reject the gun  lobby’s heavy hand and bring the will  of the American people to this body  and to help us reduce gun fatalities.  The number of Americans who are resolved to taking steps to reduce gun violence is growing. I ask my colleagues  to take stock of their solemn duty to  keep families safe from harm. I ask  them to take stock of history. Do not  bet against the American people. Stand  with us to end Congress’ deadly silence.  f  INEQUITABLE BUSINESS PRACTICE  IN AUSTRALIA  ",2016
284,House,114,0.568,2,2016-07-13,Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia.,"  Madam Speaker, last year, I spoke on  the House floor about my serious concerns about the Export-Import Bank’s  interference of energy companies and  the country of Australia.  In 2013, the Export-Import Bank approved a loan of $640 million in financing for U.S. equipment to develop an  open-pit  iron ore mine  in Australia.  The mine is owned by the wealthiest  woman in Australia. This is not an appropriate use of U.S. taxpayer dollars.  According to unions, public officials,  and the Iron Mining Association, these  subsidies threaten to displace nearly  $600 million worth of U.S. iron ore exports and cause a reduction of $1.2 billion in domestic sales.  Today, injustice toward U.S. companies in Australia has been continued  regarding a Florida company, APR.  APR constructed an $80 million power  plant in western Australia to help the  people and businesses of western Australia.  Once  the power-generation  facility  was almost built, an Australian bank,  ANZ Bank,  seized  the power plant,  even though it had no legal title or  ownership  interest  in  the plant.  It  claimed an ownership interest in the  plant based on an unfair law in Australia which is unique to that country.  This incredibly unfair Australian legislation allows U.S. companies and U.S.  banks to lose their title or lien interest  to their own assets, even though the  Australian companies and banks are  expressly barred from doing so by contracts they signed with U.S. companies.  APR lost its $80 million power plant,  lost the use of equipment and ability to  generate electricity for western Australians, and lost the revenue associated with the plant. That power plant  and revenue was wrongfully taken by  the bank.  Australia legislates that U.S. companies that lease assets in Australia are  at peril of losing their assets based on  this unfair and inequitable law. This  law is called the Personal Property Securities Act and  is contrary to the  basic right to own and possess private  property guaranteed under  the U.S.  Constitution  and  the  fundamental  right to due process and equal protection, also guaranteed under the U.S.  VerDate Sep 11 2014  02:25 Jul 14, 2016 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K13JY7.002 H13JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 2 8 0 Q L G 3 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2016
285,House,114,-0.385,9,2016-07-13,Ms. SPEIER.," Madam Speaker, ever  since the Sandy Hook shooting, Republicans have told us that the silver bullet solution to a bad guy with a gun is  a good guy with a gun.  After the Pulse nightclub massacre,  Donald Trump said it would have been  a beautiful sight if people had fired  back. Though Trump’s endorsement of  combining alcohol with firearms was  too extreme even for the NRA, they  still encourage people to carry guns to  campuses, public parks, and everyplace  else.  Let’s talk about the good guys with  guns. Twelve good guys, Dallas law enforcement officers, men and women,  trained to shoot, were stopped by one  bad guy. Five officers were killed and  seven were wounded.  Whether it is a security guard or an  entire police force, there is no stopping  a single bad guy with a military-style  assault rifle. If our best trained officers  can be thwarted, how could the average  shooter stop another shooter?  It is time for Congress to focus on  the needs of our constituents over gun  manufacturers’  profits.  Instead  of  flooding the streets with more guns,  let’s vote on commonsense gun laws.  f  HONORING TOM ALLGEIER’S SERVICE TO THE KUHL HOSE COMPANY  (Mr. THOMPSON  of Pennsylvania  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

286,House,114,-0.434,16,2016-07-13,Ms. MATSUI.," Madam Speaker, I rise  to urge my colleagues to vote against  the Conscience Protection Act. This is  just another attempt by the Republican majority to create barriers for  women as they make personal decisions about their reproductive health  care. This legislation would expand and  make permanent existing refusal policies, which would erode important patient protections.  If this law were enacted, employers  and companies could refuse to provide  information  to women  about  their  health care. That is unacceptable.  Women have a right to receive all of  the  information  they need as  they  make important decisions that are personal to them. Women’s access to care,  our ability to make choices about our  health, and our right to be informed  should always be protected.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on  this damaging legislation for women’s  health.  ",2016
287,House,114,0.319,16,2016-07-13,Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania.," Madam  Speaker, if laws already enacted in the  religious liberty protections enshrined  in our Constitution were actually being  protected, we wouldn’t be here. We  wouldn’t be needing to vote on the  Conscience  Protection  Act  in  the  House of Representatives today.  Is it an attempt to prevent something? Yes. It is an attempt to protect  all Americans’ rights under our First  Amendment. It is just that simple. Unfortunately, the right to exercise one’s  own conscience is under attack in the  United States at the Federal and State  level.  Let’s be very clear on  this. Conscience, as defined, is the ‘‘inner sense  of what is right or wrong in one’s conduct or motives, impelling one towards  right action.’’ It is the feeling that one  has done something morally right or  wrong. You cannot deny people rights  that were enshrined in our Constitution and in our Bill of Rights just because it doesn’t happen to fit a popular  narrative right now.  If we cannot come together as the  people’s House and protect what we  have been given by our forefathers and  has been enshrined in our Bill of Rights  and try to make it into something different, then we have totally missed the  mark, and America should be greatly  disappointed in whom they have sent  to represent them.  None of us can turn our back on the  Constitution. None of us can say that  somehow this  is something different  than what it is. It is the protection of  one’s freedoms and liberties under our  Bill of Rights and in our First Amendment. It is that simple.  Conscience—conscience—why  should  somebody have to sacrifice their religious  conscience  because  somebody  says let’s redefine it into something  else? It is nothing more than doing the  right thing because it is the right thing  to do, and I am talking about religious  conscience.  Why would we limit our schools and  our hospitals of  religious  founding?  Why would we say to them, no, you  don’t have the right to do this; we are  going to supersede that?

290,House,114,0.556,30,2016-07-13,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Madam  Speaker, I think we can all agree that  in this country no one should be forced  to perform an abortion.  Look, I know we disagree about when  life begins; I know we disagree about  what government should do about it;  and, however strongly I hold my beliefs, I also know my friends on the  other side of the  issue  feel  just as  strongly.  I  respect  those  disagreements. But whoever you are, whatever  you believe, I think this is one thing  that we all should agree on: no one  should be forced to violate their conscience, least of all by the Federal Government. That is all this bill says.  The Federal Government, or anyone  who receives taxpayer dollars, cannot  discriminate against healthcare providers who do not perform abortions;  and if they do discriminate, this bill  says that the victims will have two  avenues of relief: either  file a complaint with the Department of Health  and Human Services, or file a civil suit  in court. That is it. That is what this  bill does.  Now, opponents say that this kind of  thing just doesn’t ever happen, nobody  in their right mind would force someone against their will to help with an  abortion. Well,  tell  that  to Cathy  DeCarlo. She was a nurse at Mount  Sinai Hospital in New York City. A few  years ago, she was forced to help with  an abortion.  Madam Speaker, this is not an isolated incident. There have been cases  of nurses being suspended or threatened with firing solely for the offense  of following their conscience.  And now the State of California requires all health  insurance plans to  cover abortion. So if you are a church  or  if you are a religious school,  it  doesn’t matter, you must cover this  procedure; and if it violates your conscience, too bad. This is a disturbing  trend.  What is more disturbing is that the  Federal Government has not been proBLACK tecting people’s rights. There are already laws on the books to protect people’s conscience rights. But after Cathy  DeCarlo filed a complaint to HHS, she  waited 3 years for a resolution; and  when she filed a lawsuit, an appeals  court said she didn’t even have standing and threw out her case.  That is why this bill makes it perfectly clear. People of faith have standing, and they deserve relief.  This bill does not ban or restrict  abortion in any way. This bill does not  change any medical standards or contracts. It does not change any laws regarding emergency treatment. All  it  does is protect a person’s conscience.  Allowing this trend to continue, if we  keep going down this path in this country, we will  only  erode  our First  Amendment rights further. It will continue to push people of faith into the  sidelines of society. That is not the  kind of country we want to live in, not  any of us.  There is nothing more fulfilling than  living out your faith, and we want all  people of all faiths to live freely in our  country. But we can live out our faith  only  if our government respects our  faith. That is why we need to pass this  bill.  I want to thank Congressman JOHN  FLEMINGand I want to thank Congresswoman DIANE for  their outstanding work on this. JOHNand DIANE  have done the Lord’s work on defending people’s conscience rights. It is the  First Amendment of the Constitution,  and it is under assault. This is something that keeps us free. This is something that makes us uniquely American. This is something that says men  and women of conscience have rights  that must be protected. And when our  own government  tramples upon and  throws under the bus those rights, we  have to act. That is why we are here  today. They have been out front on this  issue constantly leading this charge,  and I am thankful for these warriors.  I have got to say to my colleagues,  this is something that everyone should  be in favor of, because if you believe in  free speech, if you believe in freedom of  religion, then you believe in freedom of  conscience, then you believe in all of  the First Amendment. That is why I  ask each and every one of my colleagues to support this bill.  b1500  ",2016

There was no objection.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 823  Whereas, on June 28, 2016, suicide bombers  attacked the Ataturk International Airport  in Istanbul Turkey, opened fire and detonated explosives, resulting in the loss of at  least 44 innocent lives and severely wounding  over 200, including an American citizen;  Whereas Turkish first responders and law  enforcement reacted swiftly and heroically,  caring for the wounded and taking immediate actions to prevent subsequent attacks  and further loss of innocent life;  Whereas the White House issued a statement condemning the attack ‘‘in the strongest possible terms’’ and states that ‘‘We remain steadfast in our support for Turkey,  our NATO Ally and partner, along with all of  our friends and allies around the world, as  we continue to confront the threat of terrorism’’;  Whereas the Government of Turkey has  stated militants from the Islamic State of  Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are responsible for the  attack, and this attack resembles those carried out by ISIS in other parts of the world;  Whereas  the  loss of  innocent  lives  in  Istanbul strengthens our shared resolve to  defeat ISIS and its terrorist affiliates, which  pose a growing threat to international peace  and stability;  Whereas Turkey is a longstanding member  of NATO and has played a crucial role in  transatlantic security since joining the alliance more than half a century ago; and  Whereas we stand in solidarity with the  people of Turkey in their time of national  mourning, ready to provide assistance  in  bringing to justice all those involved with  the planning and execution of these attacks,  as well as  identifying and disrupting any  plans to undertake similar assaults in the future: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) condemns in the strongest terms the  terrorist attacks  in  Istanbul, Turkey, on  June 28, 2016, that resulted in the loss of at  least 44 lives;  (2) expresses its condolences to the families and friends of those individuals who were  killed in the attacks and expresses its sympathies to those individuals who have been  injured;  (3)  supports efforts  to bring  to  justice  those involved with the planning and execution of these terrorist attacks; and  (4) declares that the Islamic State of Iraq  and Syria (ISIS) poses a fundamental security threat to the United States and our allies.

298,House,114,-0.398,79,2016-07-13,Ms. TSONGAS.," Mr. Chairman, since  Theodore Roosevelt’s  designation  of  our first national monument, Devil’s  Tower in Wyoming, 16 Presidents from  both parties have used the Antiquities  Act to protect more than 160 of America’s best known and loved landscapes.  Only three Presidents have not.  Many national monuments created  through the Antiquities Act have since  become some of our greatest national  parks, like Zion, Bryce Canyon, Death  Valley, Joshua Tree, and Glacier Bay  to name a few. All of these parks were  first national monuments  that Congress decided warranted national park  status.  The Antiquities Act has also been  used on a bipartisan basis to preserve  Federal marine areas as marine national monuments, with both President  George W. Bush and President Obama  using the Antiquities Act to protect  some of the most unique and vulnerable areas of the Pacific Ocean.  To be clear, the Antiquities Act may  only be used on existing Federal lands  and waters, areas which belong to all  Americans and are typically designated  only after an extensive locally driven  stakeholder outreach process. Instead  of honoring this long bipartisan history of the Antiquities Act that has  saved so much for our country, this  amendment would foreclose any opportunity for local communities to seek to  protect their regions’ most valued marine  resources  located  in  Federal  waters.  We have  a  generational  responsibility to ensure that historic and cultural  resources  and  important  conservation areas found on our Nation’s  public lands and waters are available  to future generations. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and  to help  protect  our Nation’s most  treasured public resources through the  Antiquities Act.  ",2016

301,Senate,114,0.43,128,2016-07-13,Mr. BLUNT.," Mr. President, I was interested to hear my good friend talk  about the uncertainty of the appropriations process. Frankly,  I  think we  could  debate  no  issue  that would  change the Congress more totally than  the issue of getting back to the certainty of the appropriations process.  For 200 years, the principal work of  the Congress—the House and the Senate—was to set our national priorities  based on how we spend our national  trust of the money given to this government by the people who pay taxes,  the  revenue of  the government. We  have gotten out of the habit of doing  that. Frankly, one of the reasons we  have an authorizing process—and have  always had that—and an appropriating  process is because that gave the Congress the annual ability to  look at  those programs,  see how  they were  working, see if they were still working,  and gave the Congress the ability to  reach out to a program and have that  program answer every question because  there was an annual review of how we  spent the money. If there is an incredible indictment over the last 7 years, it  is that the Senate has stopped doing  that work.  The Republican-led Appropriations  Committees over the last 2 years have  had all the bills ready for the first time  in a long time—ready to do the work  and ready to talk about the priorities  of the country and, maybe more importantly, ready  for the 30 people who  serve on the Appropriations Committee  to not be the only people who get to  offer amendments, to not be the only  people who ask and answer questions,  and to not be the only people who get  a say in this process. That is why these  bills need to be on the floor.  What a tragedy this week and last  week that the Defense appropriations  bill—the primary responsibility of the  Federal Government  to  defend  the  country—that bill isn’t even allowed to  be debated by the minority because  they say: We want to see what the final  bill will say before we are ready to debate the Senate version. There is no  government—bicameral,  two  legislative body  chart  in  the world—that  shows how one group decides what the  final bill looks like before the other  body of the Congress is allowed to pass  a bill. That is just not the way this  works. There is a Senate bill, there is  a House bill, and those two bills come  together.  The country, for good reasons, has  forgotten the basic civics of how our  democracy works because the Senate  particularly has been such an obstacle  to that democracy working for 7 years  now. For 5 years, we were not able to  amend the bills, and that was a reason  not to go forward, and by the way it  was a good reason not to go forward.  Then, for 2 years, we didn’t want to debate the bills because apparently we  didn’t know what they were going to  say before they got to the President’s  desk. That is not how this process is  supposed to work.  Last month, for the first time in 7  years, the Senate Appropriations Committee on Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education passed a bipartisan bill. It came out of the full committee 29 to 1. That is a good vote, but  that still means 70 of the Senators  haven’t gotten to weigh  in on what  that bill should look like. If that was  the case, it could be that other Senators who are concerned about opioid  abuse—which I want to talk about in a  minute—the Senators who are  concerned about whether that is going to  be funded would be less concerned if  they knew we were back to the constitutional way of running the government.  As chairman of the Labor and Health  and Human Services Committee, I was  pleased we were able to write that bipartisan bill. Certainly, Senator MURRAY, the leading Democrat, didn’t get  everything she wanted in this bill, and  I didn’t get everything I wanted in this  bill, but we were willing to set priorities. One of the priorities I want to  talk about for a few minutes, before we  all go home and have a chance to talk  about the good things that could happen in the country if we will just do  our job—one of those priorities will be  returning to year-round Pell grants.  Pell grants are the grants available  to people who, because of their family  income or their personal income, qualify for not a student loan but actually  a student grant. Until 2008, we had several years where you  could  go  to  school, and you could go to school  year-round, and still have access to  those Pell grant funds.  Recently,  I was  at Harris-Stowe  State University in St. Louis. I was at  Mineral Area College, I was at Ozarks  Technical College, Missouri State University  in Springfield, and I was at  Three Rivers Community College  in  Poplar Bluff talking about what happens if people are able to stay in school  once they get in school.

303,Senate,114,0.657,149,2016-07-13,Mr. SCOTT.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to give my second speech this  week discussing the issues we are facing as a nation following last week’s  tragedies  in Dallas, Minnesota, and  Baton Rouge. This speech is perhaps  the most difficult because  it  is the  most personal.  On Monday, I talked about how the  vast majority of our law enforcement  officers have only two things in mind:  protect and serve. But, as I noted then,  we do have serious issues that must be  resolved.  In many cities and towns across the  Nation, there is a deep divide between  the Black community and law enforcement. There is a trust gap, a tension  that has been growing for decades. And  as a family, one American family, we  cannot  ignore  these  issues  because  while so many officers do good—and as  I said on Monday, we should be very  thankful and supportive of all of those  officers who do good—some simply do  not. I have experienced it myself.  So today I want to speak about some  of those  issues—not with anger, although I have been angry. I tell my  story not out of frustration, although  at times I have been frustrated. I stand  here before you today because I am  seeking for all of us, the entire American family, to work together so we all  experience the lyrics of a song that we  can hear but not see: peace, love, and  understanding. Because  I  shuddered  when I heard Eric Garner say, ‘‘I can’t  breathe.’’ I wept when I watched Walter Scott turn and run away and get  shot  in the back and killed. And  I  broke when  I heard  the  4-year-old  daughter  of  Philando  Castile’s  girlfriend tell her mother, ‘‘It’s OK, I’m  right here with you.’’ These are people.  Lost forever. Fathers, brothers, sons.  Some will  say  and maybe  even  scream:  But  they  have  criminal  records. They were criminals. They had  spent time in jail.  And while having a record should not  sentence you to death, I say, OK, then,  I will share with you some of my own  experiences or the experiences of good  friends and other professionals.  I can certainly remember the very  first time I was pulled over by a police  officer as just a youngster. I was driving a car that had an improper headlight. It didn’t work right. And the cop  came up to my car, hand on his gun,  and said: Boy, don’t you know your  headlights are not working properly? I  felt  embarrassed,  ashamed,  and  scared—very scared.  But  instead of  sharing  experience  after experience, I want to go to a time  in my  life as an elected official to  share just a couple of stories as an  elected official. But please remember  that in the course of 1 year, I have been  stopped seven times by  law enforcement officers—not four, not five, not  six, but seven times in 1 year as an  elected official. Was I speeding sometimes? Sure. But the vast majority of  the time I was pulled over for nothing  more than driving a new car in the  wrong neighborhood or some other reason just as trivial.  One of the times I remember I was  leaving the mall. I took a left out of  the mall, and as soon as I took a left,  a police officer pulled in right behind  me. That was my first time. I got to  another traffic light, and I took another left into a neighborhood. The police followed behind me. I took a third  left onto the street that at the time led  to my apartment complex and then finally I took a fourth left coming into  my apartment complex, and then the  blue  lights went on. The officer approached the car and said that I did not  use my turn signal on the fourth turn.  Keep in mind, as my colleagues might  imagine, I was paying very close attention to the law enforcement officer who  followed me on four turns. Do you really think that somehow I forgot to use  my turn signal on the  fourth turn?  Well, according to him, I did.  Another  time,  I was  following  a  friend of mine. We had just left working out and we were heading out to  grab a bite to eat at about 4 o’clock in  the afternoon. He pulls out, and I pull  out right behind him. We are driving  down the road, and the blue  lights  come on. The officer pulls me into the  median, and he starts telling me that  he thinks perhaps the car is stolen.  Well, I started asking myself—because  I was smart enough not to ask him but  was asking myself—is the license plate  coming in as stolen? Does the license  plate match the car? I was looking for  some rational reason that may have  prompted him to stop me on the side of  the road.  I also think about the experiences of  my brother, who became a command  sergeant major in the U.S. Army, the  highest rank for an enlisted soldier. He  was driving from Texas to Charleston  and was pulled over by a law enforcement officer who wanted to know if he  had stolen the car he was driving because it was a Volvo.

304,Senate,114,-0.53,156,2016-07-13,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. President, Congress is taking a critical first step to  combat our country’s opioid crisis and  a major step in providing safer, more  effective, and higher quality care for  America’s veterans.  I want to speak about my bipartisan  Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid  Safety Act, which is included in the  final version of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, known as  CARA. This bipartisan legislation reforms opioid prescribing and pain care  at the VA.  These bipartisan reforms to veterans  health care that I authored, along with  my colleague Senator SHELLEYMOORE  CAPITO, should unite us all. They represent our responsibility to honor and  care for those who have served and sacrificed for our Nation, and their families—and all our families.  This bipartisan legislation is named  in honor of Wisconsin Marine Veteran  Jason Simcakoski. On August 30, 2014,  Jason tragically died. He died in Wisconsin’s Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center of mixed-drug toxicity. At  the time of his death, Jason was on 14  different prescription drugs, including  opioids.  Jason’s heartbreaking story is just  one example of the overprescribing and  pain care problem within the VA in  Wisconsin and across the country. I believe the VA’s overreliance on opioids  has resulted  in getting our veterans  hooked rather than getting them the  help they need, and it is our job to act  now to address this epidemic.

Garry was born in Walker County,  AL. He earned a bachelor of science in  civil engineering from the University  of Alabama in 1961. After graduation,  he  joined Drummond Company, Inc.,  and became the first engineer hired by  the company.  Garry’s  father,  H.E.

Over the  past 75 years, The Roanoker Restaurant has  operated in five locations. But despite changes  in address, The Roanoker ’s tradition of good  food at good prices has remained steadfast.  Part of the restaurant’s success is owed to the  loyal staff, including many who have worked  there for over 10, 20, even 30 years.  The Roanoker  is  locally owned and operated, making  this  restaurant a  true cornerstone of the Roanoke community. Church and  civic groups,  family  reunions, and business  meetings all find a spot at the table. It is a  meeting place  for generations  to come  together. The Roanoker Restaurant also has a  rich history of supporting various groups in the  community, including its longtime sponsorship  of The Roanokers, a Major League Division  team in Cave Spring National Little League.  It is an honor to represent the Sixth Congressional District of Virginia, and businesses  like The Roanoker Restaurant. Thank you for  your continued presence  in our community,  and for bringing good food at good prices to  generations of Roanokers.  I wish you many  more years of success. Congratulations to The  Roanoker Restaurant on this 75th anniversary.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. PETER WELCH  OFVERMONT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 13, 2016  ",2016

309,House,114,0.633,18,2016-09-12,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5936) to amend title 38,  United States Code, to authorize the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter  into agreements with certain health  care providers to furnish health care to  veterans, to authorize the Secretary to  enter into certain leases at the Department of Veterans Affairs West Los Angeles Campus  in Los Angeles, California, to make certain improvements  to the enhanced-use lease authority of  the Department, and  for other purposes, as amended.

313,House,114,-0.48,67,2016-09-12,Mr. JEFFRIES.," Thank you for those  very thoughtful observations.  Perhaps I will end by talking for a  moment or so about the progress that  we have made under a former member  of the Congressional Black Caucus who  was a Senator from Illinois and here in  the Capitol for a few years before he  was elected to be the 44th President of  the United States of America. We are  proud that he came through the CBC  on his way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Upon his election, there was the view  that perhaps we were entering into a  phase of a post-racial society. I think  we understand that that was probably  irrationally optimistic of those who  made that observation because of the  long history that we detailed here of  what the African American journey has  been in America.  But I find it interesting that so many  people, to this day, refuse to give this  President credit for the progress that  has been made under his watch over  the last 8 years. There have been more  than 75 or so consecutive months of  private sector job creation under this  President. More than 14 million private  sector  jobs have been created under  this President.  Parenthetically, I make the observation that, under the 8 years of George  Bush, the country lost 650,000 jobs. But  we are going to talk about a sluggish  recovery. We  lost 650,000  jobs under  supply-side economic policies of George  W. Bush. We have gained more than 14  million jobs under progressive policies  of Barack Obama.  The deficit has been reduced by over  $500 million. When the President came  in, the stock market was at 6,000; now  it is over 18,000. Of course, more than 20  million previously uninsured Americans now have health coverage under  the Presidency of Barack Obama.  So he came in with a lot of promises,  and I am proud that there has been tremendous progress that has been made  for the United States of America as a  whole, and certainly for African American communities.  As the President himself observed,  the problems that we have to confront  in America won’t be resolved by one  President during one term or even during an entire tenure, because we are on  this  long,  necessary,  and majestic  march toward a more perfect Union.  The hope is that, each time a President  steps up and Congress is there to represent the will of the people, working  on behalf of our constituents, we can  make meaningful progress on dealing  with the economic and social justice  issues of the day.  Fundamentally,  that  is what  the  Congressional  Black  Caucus  is  all  about. That was the vision that was  put forth by those 13 Founders: speaking truth to power, representing the interests of the African American communities they were elected to serve—  and everyone else—regardless of race,  who is entitled to the fiercest possible  representation in this democracy.  b2115  So it is with great pride that Representative BEATTY and I stand here  today, as members of the Congressional  Black Caucus, standing on the shoulders of  those  13  founding members,  under the current leadership of Representative G.K. BUTTERFIELD from  North Carolina, representing this continuum of the African American journey, both here in Congress and in this  great country; confident that, despite  the obstacles that will consistently be  erected that, as we have demonstrated  over  time during  45 years, we will  make progress, we will translate promise into action, and we will continue  the journey of perfecting a more perfect union  in  the United States of  America.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2016
314,,114,-0.317,186,2016-09-12,Mr. QUIGLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Anthony A. Nichols,  the President  and CEO of Central Federal Savings and  Loan Association of Chicago. For over one  hundred years, Central Federal Savings has  provided financial services to communities in  Chicago and  the surrounding suburbs. Mr.  Nichols has served as President of Central  Federal Savings of Chicago  for  the past 48  years and has led the bank through economic  downturns and other challenges  to become  one of the strongest in the nation.  During Mr. Nichols’ tenure as President of  Central Federal Savings, he has wisely guided  the bank through difficult economic conditions  that has led to the failure or consolidation of  many other community banks. As of  today,  Central Federal Savings holds a 5-star rating  from Bauer Financial and in every regulatory  examination that the bank has undergone during the past fourteen years, it has been rated  ‘outstanding ’ ’ for its Community Reinvestment  Act lending.  Outside of his professional life, Mr. Nichols  has devoted a substantial part of his personal  time to giving back to his community. He has  served on  the boards of most of  the  local  chambers of commerce in his area and was  one of  the  founders of  the Lincoln-Belmont  Businessmen ’s Association; now the Lakeview  Chamber of Commerce. He also serves as a  Director of  the Chicagoland Association of  Savings Institutions, as a Director of the Illinois Savings and Loan League, and as a  leader  in many other  financial and business  organizations in Chicago.  In addition to those organizations, Mr. Nichols serves on multiple committees  for Saint  Joseph Hospital,  including as President of  their Associates Board and Vice President of  the Hospital Foundation. In addition, he serves  as the President and a Trustee of St. Andrew  Greek Orthodox Church, a Trustee of  the  Greek Orthodox Diocese of Chicago, a Director for Greek Star Newspaper, a Director and  the Treasurer  for  the Hellenic Foundation,  among many other positions.  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to  join me in recognizing all of the great work Anthony Nichols has done for his community. Mr.  Nichols has proudly served Chicagoland  in  both his professional and personal life in order  to make his community a better place for everyone. I wish to thank him for his many years  of service.  f  HONORING MARIAN LUPU  HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 12, 2016  ",2016

316,House,114,0.628,11,2016-09-21,Mr. NEUGEBAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to recognize the 2016 Texas  Tech Red Raider baseball team. The  Red Raiders, led by Big 12 coach of  year, Tim Tadlock, capped off a tremendous season in which they won the  Big 12 title and advanced to the College  World Series for the second time in the  past 3 years. This trip, they earned the  program’s  first-ever win  in Omaha.  This team’s hard work was evident as I  watched their impressive run.  I want to highlight the contributions  of the senior class, a group who led  Tech to 149 wins since 2013. Several of  these players have moved on to professional baseball careers, and we wish all  of them the best in their future endeavors. This team ended the year ranked  number 4 nationally, Tech’s highest  ranking in school history. I am especially proud of the way these young  men carried themselves in victory and  defeat.  Under the guidance of Coach Tadlock  and his staff, next year’s team should  be well positioned to carry on Tech’s  recent baseball success.  Red Raider nation and I thank you  for the way you represented the university.  f  b1230  VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION  MONTH  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

Mr. Speaker, how many more Americans must suffer before the House Republicans realize that the health of our  families matters more than politics?  How many more pregnant women must  receive the devastating news they have  contracted the virus before the GOP  leadership stops playing games with  American lives?  Instead of heeding the pleas of the  CDC, public health experts, and the  medical  community,  House  Republicans  revealed  their  true priorities  when they decided to hold Zika funding  hostage over women’s health care and  the Confederate flag.  That  is  just wrong, Mr. Speaker.  Let’s protect pregnant women. Let’s  save vulnerable infants.

He, Chairman  ROYCE, as well as their staff members  have been terrific partners in moving  this bill forward.  I also want to say a big thank you to  my fellow Texan, Representative MIKE  MCCAUL, for being the lead Republican  cosponsor of  this  legislation, which  aims to make our foreign aid efforts  more impactful and cost-efficient.  Created in 2014 through the streamlining  and merging  of  two  offices,  USAID’S Global Development Lab  is  spearheading a new approach that supports the invention, testing, and utilization of more cost-efficient solutions  to development challenges.  The Lab  collaborates with  entrepreneurs, corporations, NGOs, universities, and science and research institutions to solve some of the world’s most  difficult development challenges faster,  more cheaply, and more sustainably.  Essentially,  the Lab  democratizes  problem  solving  by  crowdsourcing  ideas and applications to find the best  solutions from around the world. For  example, the Lab has used what it calls  Grand Challenges for Development to  incentivize problem solvers to develop  solutions for specific problems.  The Saving Lives at Birth Grand  Challenge led to the creation of the  Pratt Pouch, a small ketchup packet-  like pouch filled with medication that  women can use in rural areas to prevent  birth-related  HIV  infections.  Other Grand Challenges have led to the  development of breakthrough products  that keep healthcare workers treating  Ebola patients safe, desalinate water in  an environmentally sustainable manner, and bring electricity to folks living off the electrical grid in Africa.  The Lab also partners with outside  entities, such as universities, to cultivate  solutions  to  specific development challenges ranging from health  and food insecurity to chronic conflict.  Participating  institutions  equally  match USAID’s funding and leverage  additional resources from private foundations.

330,Senate,114,0.875,109,2016-09-21,Mr. PAUL.," Madam President, there  is probably no greater issue before Congress at any time in our lives or any  time in our service than whether we  should go to war. I think it is a mistake to slide into war. I think it is a  mistake to allow the power to declare  war  to default  to one person. Our  Founding Fathers were  very  clear  throughout the Federalist Papers, explicitly in the Constitution, that the  power to declare war shouldn’t go to  one person; that the power to declare  war should be determined by a vote of  Congress. We have abdicated that role,  and  the vote  today  is a vote over  whether we should try to reclaim that  power.  Some will say: Well, it is just arms,  and if we don’t sell them, somebody  else will.  Well, you know, I don’t think of national security as a jobs program. I  don’t think of whether we create jobs  here at home. I think about the young  man who lives down the road from me  who lost both legs and an arm, OK? I  think about the human toll of war. I  think about whether there  is a national security  interest, but I think  nothing at all about whether any jobs  are created.  If we make weapons and we have a  weapons industry, that is good for our  country when we make them for ourselves, but when we are selling weapons  around  the  world,  by  golly,  we  shouldn’t sell weapons to people who  are not putting them to good purpose.  What we have found is that Saudi Arabia is an irresponsible ally.  One of the great ironies that nobody  here can quite explain is that this body  has voted unanimously to let the people of 9/11 sue Saudi Arabia. So we are  going to let the person who we think  might have had something to do with  Saudi Arabia  have more weapons?  What kind of signal is that to Saudi  Arabia?  Would Saudi Arabia  be  bereft  of  weapons if we held $1 billion out? No.  We have already sold them $99 billion  worth. They have enough to blow up  the Middle East 10 times over. I think  it might send them a message.  Do you know what. Stop the sale,  send them a message. Do you know  what the message might be? Quit funding madrasas that teach hate in our  country. Don’t tell us you are going to  stop doing it.  Saudi Arabia, tomorrow, stop funding madrasas in America that teach  hatred, that teach  intolerance. Stop  putting Christians to death. Stop putting people who convert to Christianity  to death. Stop beheading protesters.  The  one  young man who  is  a  protestor in Saudi Arabia is scheduled  to be beheaded and crucified. Does that  sound like somebody who is a great  ally with a great human rights record?  The young woman who was raped by  seven men—she was put in prison. She  was told  it was her  fault  for being  alone with the man. She was publicly  whipped.  Poets have been picked up around the  world and brought back to Saudi Arabia to be whipped for what they write.  Do you trust Saudi Arabia to do the  right things with your weapons? These  weapons are owned by the American  taxpayer. We built them. We did the research into them. Private companies  make money off of them, but it isn’t  about them making money.  It  isn’t  about them getting to sell the weapons  instead of Russia selling the weapons.  It is about our national security.  Saudi Arabia’s indiscriminate placement of weapons into the Syrian civil  war has led to the rise of ISIS. ISIS  grew stronger as Saudi Arabia was flying weapons to al-Nusra, Al Qaeda, and  likely some of them to ISIS.  We now have a war in Yemen. Yes,  we are directly involved in the war.  Yes, this is a vote not just about weapons, this is a vote about whether we  should be at war in Yemen. We are refueling the Saudi bombers in midair.  Our military planes are, in a sophisticated fashion, refueling their planes.  Do you think the Yemenis think: Oh,  no big deal. You know, 3,000 citizens  have died. When you go to a wedding in  Yemen and you get a bomb dropped on  you from Saudi Arabia, do you think  you have warm, fuzzy feelings for our  great ally, Saudi Arabia?  Absolutely, we  should  be  telling  Saudi Arabia what to do. These are our  weapons. Do you know when they are  willing to listen? It is when we argue  from a position of strength.  Do you know what is the ultimate  weakness? Give them what they want.  Giving the arms industry what they  want  is  the ultimate weakness. We  look weak, and we look bowed before  and cowed before the Saudi Arabians.  As they sit back in their long robes  sipping  tea,  refugees bob about  the  Mediterranean. People are starving and  displaced in Yemen. Not one of them  will come to Saudi Arabia, not one of  them will be allowed in the country.  Yes, this is a debate about war, and  this  is a debate about whether you  want to be at war in Yemen. It is not  just a debate about sending and selling  another $1 billion of weapons,  it  is  about should we be at war in Yemen. It  is about should we be at war anywhere  without the permission of Congress.  This is not a small occurrence. This  is not a small happening. This is a big  deal. This is the most important vote  that any  legislator will  ever have.  Should we be at war or shouldn’t we be  at war?  Those who want to make this about a  jobs program, about we are going to  get some sales of tanks—no, it is not a  jobs program. It is about young men  and women dying in a war. It is about  whether it is in our national interests.  It is about whether we are going to be  safer. Shouldn’t we have a debate over  whether the war in Yemen is making  us safer?

I appreciate Senator ISAKSON’s work  with us—Senators SANDERS, WARREN,  and ALEXANDER.  I think we agree on two things, believe it or not. No. 1, both sides of the  aisle here want to make progress as it  relates to curing rare pediatric diseases. That is No. 1. I think there is  agreement on  that. No.  2,  there  is  agreement to extend the existing program, which has already helped enormously to advance that first cause. We  are in agreement to extend that until  the end of the year. That is a bipartisan agreement. We will work out the  details for that, and we will keep working on these issues when we get back.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",2016

333,Senate,114,0.414,130,2016-09-21,Mr. MORAN.," Mr. President, today I  wish to honor the 100th birthday of  Ewing Marion Kauffman, an exceptionally successful Kansas City businessman who also cared deeply about the  community he lived in.  Mr. Kauffman was an entrepreneur  working out of the basement of his  modest Kansas City home when he  founded Marion Laboratories in June  of 1950. By 1965, he had grown his small  pharmaceutical business  into a publicly traded company and introduced  an innovative profit-sharing model so  that all of his associates would reap  the financial benefits of his company’s  accomplishments. His lifelong focus on  enabling others to succeed has benefitted generations of Kansans and all in  the Kansas City community.  By 1989, Marion Laboratories merged  with Merrell Dow  to  form Marion  Merrell Dow, which provided jobs for  3,400 associates. Marion Merrell Dow  became the fifth largest drug company  in the United States in terms of sales.  Leading Mr. Kauffman to this success  were  two  guiding  philosophic  principles: No. 1, share the rewards with  those who produce and No. 2, treat others as you wish to be treated. His principles continue to serve as a model of  professional culture to new businesses  across a wide variety of industries, and  oftentimes, these new businesses are  started by  former associates of Mr.  Kauffman’s company and its affiliates.  Following Mr. Kauffman’s success in  business, he used his considerable resources to do good, establishing the  Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in  1966. The foundation sought to address  systemic  issues within  underserved  communities around Kansas City—notably focused on improving the quality  of education in the area and promoting  and  fostering entrepreneurship as a  means  of  empowerment  and  opportunity for individuals.  Mr. Kauffman’s  legacy  fundamental challenges  in  addressing  the  local  community through a research-based  approach continues today through the  innovative work of the Ewing Marion  Kauffman Foundation. The foundation  continues to focus on advancing education and entrepreneurship opportunities through strategic partnerships and  inclusive dialogue among all pertinent  private and public parties. In June, the  foundation announced its 100 Acts of  Generosity campaign to encourage the  public  to participate  in  community  service efforts to honor Mr. Kauffman’s  legacy, while awarding a $1 million  grant to the Kansas City Royals’ Urban  Youth Academy to serve 800 to 1,000  young people with  free baseball and  softball clinics and instruction.  Mr. Kauffman also brought Major  League Baseball back to his hometown,  founding the Kansas City Royals  in  1968. Under Kauffman’s leadership, the  organization sold more than 2 million  tickets per season during 11 different  seasons and won six division titles, two  American League pennants, and the  1985 World Series Championship. Mr.  Kauffman  also  developed  innovative  measures to ensure the Royals would  remain in Kansas City long after his  death in 1993.  In reflection of Mr. Kauffman’s philanthropic mission, I conclude my remarks  with  a  statement  by Mr.  Kauffman himself: ‘‘All of the money  in the world cannot solve problems unless we work together. And, if we work  together, there is no problem in the  world that can stop us, as we seek to  develop people to their highest and  best potential.’’∑  f  REMEMBERING DR. MOLLY  MACAULEY  ∑",2016

As the House will not be in session that  day,  I would  like  to  take  this opportunity  to  offer my early best wishes  to  the people of  Taiwan.  Over the past 50 years, Taiwan has undergone dramatic political, social, and economic  changes and is now the only democracy in the  Chinese speaking world. This year, the people  of Taiwan witnessed the third peaceful transition of power with  the election of  the  first  woman to the Presidency, Dr. Tsai Ing-wen.  There are  important common values and  principles that link the United States and Taiwan, including respect for human rights, freedom, and democracy and I commend President Tsai  Ing-wen  for  reiterating Taiwan’s  commitment to these values.  Taiwan has been and will continue to be a  reliable and vital trading partner in East Asia.  According  to  the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S.  trade  in  goods with Taiwan  reached U.S. $66 billion last year, making Taiwan our 9th largest trading partner in 2015.  Taiwan  is a prosperous society, a major  contributor to the global economy, and plays  an important role in the peace and security of  the Asia-Pacific region. As such, it is troubling  to know that Taiwan continues to be barred  from a number of international organizations,  many of which, like the International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO), serve  to promote  safety and strengthen diplomacy among  the  global community. For the sake of passenger  safety and  international security,  the country  must be brought into the ICAO fold. Taiwan  should be invited to attend the ICAO Assembly on a regular basis, enabling it to keep up-  to-date with important matters and assist the  Assembly  in ensuring  the safe, secure, and  sustainable development of  international civil  aviation.  In closing, I applaud the nation of Taiwan  for its strong commitment to democratic values  and I wish them all the best at their celebrations in Taiwan and at the Twin Oaks Estate.  f  HONORING DEAN VICTOR WHITE  HON.

335,,114,0.633,137,2016-09-21,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to  recognize Colonel Robert M. Kirila, US  Army, upon  the occasion of his  retirement.  Colonel Kirila dedicated more than 25 years in  the United States Army, with 19 years in Special Forces, most  recently as Deputy Commander of the 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne), in Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. It is  my privilege  to pay  tribute  to his honorable  service to Northwest Florida and our great Nation.  A native of Norfolk, Virginia, Colonel Kirila  graduated Simsbury High School, in Simsbury,  Connecticut in 1987 and immediately returned  home  to attend  the University of Richmond.  After graduating with a degree in Spanish, he  was commissioned in the United States Army  and served as a Platoon Leader in the 7th Infantry Division.  In 1997, Colonel Kirila graduated from the  Special Forces Qualification Course, earning  his Green Beret, and was assigned  to 2nd  Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne).  He served as Detachment Commander, Assistant Operations Officer, and Headquarters  Company Commander during his tenure. He  was then selected for duty in the Army Compartmented Element at the United States Army  Special Operations Command.  Upon graduating the Command and General  Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Colonel  Kirila returned to the 1st Special Forces Group  (Airborne) and served as Operations Officer  and Executive Officer.  In  late 2005 he deployed  to  Iraq  in support of Operation  Iraqi  Freedom where he served as the Director of  Forward Operating Base North (FOB–13), Taji,  in  the heart of  Iraq. Here he earned  the  Bronze Star Medal where he is credited with  synchronizing the operations of three diverse  centers responsible for supporting combat operations spanning over half of Iraq.  Colonel Kirila’s success  in  Iraq was  rewarded with an assignment  to  the United  States Army John F.

336,,114,0.739,144,2016-09-21,Mr. BUCK.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  mourn the passing of Karla Louise Grieser on  August 26th, 2016. A longtime resident of Colorado, Karla was well known  in her church  and community.  Karla was born in Wauseon, Ohio on April  18th, 1944. In 1965 she married her sweetheart Merle Grieser, and they moved to Colorado together in 1969. Karla worked as an accountant for KLZ Radio and Television for several years, but her family always remained her  number one priority.  From a young age Karla devoted herself to  helping others. She went  to school  to be a  nurse, an education  focused on healing  the  sick, caring for others, and ministering those in  need. I have seen the passion in Karla’s heart  for nurturing, supporting, and protecting those  who couldn’t defend themselves.  Karla was a leader in the pro-life movement.  She started the life chain in Greeley, where  hundreds of volunteers  lined  the streets  to  pray and support the sanctity of human life. I  have seen firsthand how Karla’s fight for the  pro-life movement was not only God’s calling,  but her way of protecting the most vulnerable  in our society.  The  life chain was  just  the beginning  for  Karla’s commitment to protecting the unborn.  She led the monumental task of founding The  Genesis Project of Northern Colorado, a faith  based non-profit in the Greeley area. This organization provides shelter, support, and spiritual guidance for numerous women and children to this day.  It was clear Karla cared about more  than  providing basic necessities; it was about helping  those women and children become an  asset in their community. I sat in many Genesis board meetings, and it was clear Karla  was giving  these single mothers a second  chance at life.  Karla held many other prominent positions  in her community, all of which helped improve  the lives of those around her. She was President of Weld County Right to Life, actively involved with the Weld County Republicans, and  helped at several children’s ministries. Due to  her continued work to better the community,  Karla was  invited  to help  revise  the Comprehensive Plan  for Weld County. Karla devoted her life to improving Colorado, and she  left a positive influence on everybody she met.  It is the values Karla embodied throughout  her life that makes Colorado the best place to  live in the country. I extend my deepest condolences to Karla’s friends and family for their  loss.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is an honor  to  recognize  Karla Louise Grieser  for her commitment  to  Jesus Christ, family, and Colorado. She will be  sorely missed.  f  HONORING BYRON KENT  MAXFIELD  HON.

337,,114,-0.225,151,2016-09-21,Mr. CUELLAR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Linda Kazen Garza on her new  position as President of the Advocates for the  American Osteopathic Association; a national  organization  that supports and promotes  the  osteopathic profession through education, advocacy, and collaboration.  Linda Kazen Garza was born on December  1, 1963 to Antonio and Josie Kazen in Laredo,  Texas. While growing up in Laredo she was a  member of  the Blessed Sacrament Church  youth choir and a participant  in  the Junior  Miss Laredo Pageant. Interestingly enough, it  was during her time in choir that she met a  fellow guitarist named David Garza, who later  became her husband. After graduating  from  Nixon High School she went on to the University of Texas at Austin where she received her  Bachelor of Science Degree  in Communications.  Mrs. Garza ’s involvement with advocacy efforts within the osteopathic medical profession  began during her husband ’s education at the  Texas  College  of  Osteopathic  Medicine  (TCOM) in Fort Worth. She would even go on  to serve as  the Vice President  for TCOM’s  chapter of the Student Advocates Association.  Eventually, she would go on to serve in her  husband’s medical practice as an office administrator. She has been serving alongside  her husband for over two decades.  Linda’s passion for the osteopathic medical  field led her to become an active member of  multiple advocacy groups. Her involvement includes: Treasurer and former President of the  Advocates of the Texas Osteopathic Medical  Association (ATOMA), Director at Large on the  Board of Trustees and delegate to the Advocates for the American Osteopathic Association (AAOA), and she has been a member of  several AAOA committees.  Linda Kazen Garza currently resides in Laredo, Texas where she is married to Dr. David  Garza and has two sons named Joseph and  Nicholas. In addition to her exemplary career  and advocacy efforts; she’s been an active  member of her  local community where she  was a trustee for the Laredo Center for the  Arts and former President of the Laredo Business and Professional Women’s Association.  In her free time she enjoys hunting, fishing,  traveling, and going to the beach.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the opportunity to recognize Mrs. Linda Kazen Garza  on her recent appointment and for her many  years of service to the osteopathic community.  It  is pleasing  to see  this ninth generation  Texan and Laredoan and niece of former Congressman Abraham Kazen doing great work  for the community.

338,House,114,0.217,2,2016-09-28,Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  6094, the Regulatory Relief for Some  Businesses, Schools,  and Nonprofits  Act.  This bipartisan  legislation offers a  responsible solution to the U.S. Department of Labor’s overtime rule that  would jeopardize the ability for small  businesses, nonprofits, and colleges to  maintain current operations and good-  paying career jobs.  H.R. 6094, which I have cosponsored,  would require a 6-month delay in the  effective date of  the DOL overtime  rule. No, this isn’t the outright repeal  of the overtime rule that I, along with  many others, have called for, but it is  a practical step towards helping those  organizations take steps to mitigate  the impact of this regulation.  Without passage of H.R.  6094,  the  overtime  rule will  take effect  in  2  months. This  is  simply not enough  time to allow affected employers and  employees an opportunity  to adjust  and prepare for the adverse economic  consequences.  Over 10 million workers,  including  many in my home State of Pennsylvania, will be  impacted. Companies  will be forced to shift employees from  salary to hourly pay, nonprofits will  have to cut back on critical services,  employees may lose the opportunity to  work remotely, while seeing fewer opportunities for career development.  Our employers need fewer administrative costs and compliance burdens,  not more. Employees  deserve  flexibility and autonomy and the opportunity to build successful careers. However, these regulations, no matter how  well intended, would drain our economy and hurt the very people they are  attempting to help.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  6094.

Before I ask the chairman my question, I want to recognize his efforts for  reaching an agreement on a package to  fund the government through December 9 and include interim aid to the August 2016 flood victims in south Louisiana.  Early last month, the people of south  Louisiana  experienced  an  extraordinary flood event, about a 1,000-year  rain event. To put it in perspective, 7  trillion gallons of water fell in about 48  hours.  That  is  roughly  the  same  amount of water discharged by the entire Mississippi River system into the  Gulf of Mexico over the course of about  80 days.  If you  live up North, that  equates to somewhere in the vicinity of  about 25 feet of snow in 36 hours. If you  live in Arizona, in some areas, that is  up to 10 years of cumulative rainfall.  As many as 110,000 homes and more  than 100,000 vehicles were damaged. All  told, more than 20,000 people were rescued, 10,000 sheltered, and 13 lost their  lives. Early estimates predict that this  disaster will cost upward of $15 billion  in economic damages, and FEMA estimates this will be the  fourth most  costly flood disaster in U.S. history.  Over the past several weeks, the gentleman from Kentucky and I have discussed the flood and the extraordinary  impact on our State  several  times.  During those meetings, we discussed  the devastating impact I just spoke of  and the need for both immediate unmet  needs assistance as well as a comprehensive  strategy and  solution  to  provide the people of south Louisiana  certainty that Congress will address  their long-term needs when we return  after the election.  During  those  discussions, we  discussed—and  you  acknowledged—that  dire situation so many are facing and  will face in the coming weeks in south  Louisiana—that of handing over their  keys and walking away or sticking it  out knowing that Congress may provide them with a hand up.  Mr. Chairman,  families are  facing  foreclosure, businesses are facing bankruptcy,  and  local  communities  are  struggling  to provide basic  services  such as policing, fire protection, and  schooling, among others. The disaster  funding provided through this legislation, though helpful, will not address  all of the financial challenges our community is facing.  That is why I want to engage the  chairman tonight.  Mr. Chairman, thousands are facing  bankruptcy,  foreclosure, elevation of  homes, need for flood protection, and  other financial challenges as a result of  the August flood event in south Louisiana.  Is it your intent, as we discussed, to  deliver a package to address the needs  of our  local  communities who desperately need it when we return?  ",2016

We in the Senate have done the right  thing and moved forward on a WRDA  bill that has an important package for  Flint and other communities that have  lead-in-water issues.  At the beginning of this week, there  was a House bill that did not include  anything for Flint or anything around  that contamination. We now have a  OFFICER.  The  commitment. There  is going  to be  something in the House WRDA bill and  a commitment that the final bill will  include the work that we did in the  Senate.  So I wish to thank again Senator  INHOFE, Senator BOXER, and all of our  colleagues. This is a very positive step  forward.  I will just remind people that folks in  Flint are literally bathing with bottled  water every single day, and the sense  of urgency only grows. So I am anxious  to work with our leadership to get this  done.  Thank you.  ",2016
346,Senate,114,-0.45,114,2016-09-28,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, I wish to  thank my leader very much. Yesterday, Senator INHOFEand I were on the  floor and I stated that if I felt there  was an ironclad commitment to take  care of the Flint, MI, problem and the  lead  in water across this Nation,  I  would support the CR. I interpret the  strong  language  from my  leader,  HARRYREID, and the Republican majority leader, Senator MCCONNELL, as  an ironclad commitment. They spoke  to the powers that be in the House.  I know that Senator INHOFEand I are  bound and determined to fix this, and  believe me, I want to send a message to  the people of Flint and to their Senators, who have worked their hearts  out: This will happen. If it doesn’t happen, I have some ideas of how I am  going to protest it, but it will happen.  I take it as an ironclad commitment.  I yield the  floor back to my colleague, Senator REID.  ",2016
347,Senate,114,0.597,114,2016-09-28,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I rise  today to ask my colleagues to honor  the life of Trickett Wendler, pictured  here, who was a young mother of three  who fought and lost her battle with  ALS disease, and the lives of so many  others who want the right to try to  save their lives by passing the Trickett  Wendler Right to Try Act of 2016.  Now, like so many of my colleagues,  we are often visited by our constituents, people who are battling their own  diseases,  whether  it  is  ALS  or  Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or different forms of cancer.  This is a very simple bill. What it is  trying to do is very simple. It is trying  to restore freedom. It is trying to give  patients and their families hope—the  freedom and hope that is being denied  them right now by our Federal bureaucracy.

348,Senate,114,0.641,128,2016-09-28,Mr. PERDUE.," I say thank you to  Senator LANKFORD.  I think my colleagues can see the  passion and history he has had here  and a lot of great thoughts.  I note  that  the chairman of our  Budget Committee in the Senate, Senator MIKEENZI from Wyoming, is here  on the floor. I am going to turn it over  to him and ask him to give us his comments. He has been fighting this for  years. As chairman of the Budget Committee last year, he managed to get a  budget out of our committee that actually took over $7 trillion out of the  President’s budget at  that point  in  time.  I say to Senator ENZI, thank you so  much for joining us.  ",2016
349,Senate,114,-0.173,135,2016-09-28,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. President, as some  of my colleagues know, nearly every  month for more than 1 year now, I have  come to the Senate floor regularly to  highlight the diverse and difficult work  performed by the men and women at  the Department of Homeland Security.  I have been privileged to be at times in  recent years the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs and today  serve as the senior Democrat, the ranking member of that committee.  The Department of Homeland Security is part of the government that we  have direct jurisdiction over, and it is  one that I have had a great privilege to  work with and have had an opportunity  to oversee the operation of that Department. The Department of Homeland Security has more than 230,000  employees stationed around our country at our ports of entry, major transit  hubs, and  in major cities and small  communities alike. Each day the Department of Homeland Security performs some of the most challenging  jobs in the Federal Government. From  securing radiological material to protecting our cyber networks to responding to natural disasters such as floods,  fires, and tornadoes, the Department of  Homeland Security  employees work  around-the-clock  to  stay  ahead  of  threats  to  our  communities,  our  homes, and our families.  I commend Secretary Jeh Johnson,  Deputy Secretary Mayorkas, and their  entire leadership team for their continued efforts to bring the entire department together and make the Department of Homeland Security more than  just the sum of its parts.  Last week,  the  2016 Federal Employee Viewpoint survey was released  with some good news. The annual survey is provided to hundreds of thousands of Federal employees every year  to gauge their satisfaction with their  jobs and their engagement with their  agency as a whole. After 6 years of declining morale numbers, the tide has  begun to turn at the Department of  Homeland Security. That  is a good  thing. Since last year, morale has increased throughout the Department by  some 3 percent. I think that is probably more than any other Department  in the Federal Government—over the  last year, a significant one-year improvement and a better result than the  Federal Government average over the  same period.  Like turning an aircraft carrier, improving morale over a  large Federal  agency takes time. You can turn an  aircraft carrier’s course, but it takes a  little while, and so does changing and  improving the morale of a department  with a quarter of a million people  spread out all over the world. I believe  this latest survey shows that the hard  work done by Secretary Johnson and  Deputy Secretary Mayorkas and their  team has begun to put this ship on a  better course for the future.  While more work needs to be done to  improve morale at the Department of  Homeland Security, this effort does not  fall on Secretary Johnson alone. Each  Member of Congress and every American can help support the Department  and its employees by simply acknowledging the good work that the employees do there every day. Whether we  simply say thank you to a TSA agent  or TSO officer the next time we pass  through an airport or give an occasional speech on the Senate floor as I  am doing tonight and have done on  other occasions, our support makes a  difference.  Mr. President, each September, the  Federal Emergency Management Agency, which we affectionately call FEMA,  marks National Preparedness Month.  Throughout the month, FEMA encourages all Americans to prepare for natural disasters and emergencies. To continue highlighting National Preparedness Month and to continue to highlight  the  important work  done  by  FEMA and its people, I want to take a  moment tonight to thank just a few of  the employees of FEMA, one of the 22  component agencies all told that make  up the Department of Homeland Security.  As my colleagues may know,  just  last month, historic flooding inundated  much of the State of Louisiana. What  some may not know is that even before  the floodwaters had peaked, FEMA employees and personnel were on  the  ground there. They were setting up Incident Support Bases to provide supplies, coordinating with State and local  officials, and supporting first responders in rescue efforts. FEMA also set up  Disaster Recovery Centers  to assist  residents seeking Federal aid to get  back on their feet in the aftermath of  the storms.  One of the first FEMA employees on  the ground there more than a month  ago was Justo Hernandez, and Justo’s  picture is right here. Justo goes by the  nickname Tito and is a Team Leader of  the East II National Incident Management Assistance Team. With 28 years’  experience with FEMA, Tito leads his  team in immediate response efforts to  natural and manmade disasters whenever and wherever they occur.  Ready at a moment’s notice, Tito  and his team are experts in disaster response, specializing in operations, logistics, planning, and recovery. They  put their experience to use by supporting State and  local officials as  they work through the most trying of  situations.  Members of Tito’s team say that he  is by far the best manager and supervisor they have ever worked for. As a  leader, Tito  leads by  example, not  afraid to get his hands dirty and never  turning down a task, large or small.  With their team expected to be deployed nearly 9 months out of the year,  Tito has a deep respect for his team  members’ personal time.  When Tito does get some time back  at home, I know he enjoys spending  every moment with his wife and three  children. His family is incredibly generous, and we are grateful to them for  lending our Nation their husband and  father so he may undertake this important work in many parts of America on  behalf of all Americans.  As a FEMA employee, Tito embodies  the  spirit of dedication and caring,  shaking hands with each individual he  comes into contact with, asking them,  ‘‘How are you doing?’’ As with most of  the men and women at FEMA, Tito  doesn’t stop there. He does all he can  do to help people.  Last month, I visited FEMA headquarters here in Washington, DC. I met  a number of the thousands of dedicated  employees who work there. This is a  picture from FEMA. These are some of  the exceptional people who help us in  some of our darkest hours. While many  of these men and women were not directly involved in the response effort in  Louisiana, they felt obligated to do all  they could  for their colleagues who  were on the ground in Louisiana or coordinating from around the country. In  fact, FEMA headquarters established a  backup call center in their offices, and  dozens  of FEMA  employees  volunteered—during or after their regular  working hours—to man the phones and  talk to people through some of the  toughest situations imaginable.  One FEMA employee who asked how  she could help is Melissa Forbes. Melissa has a Ph.D. in public policy and  serves as Director of Enterprise Resource Planning in FEMA’s Office of  Policy and Program Analysis. Melissa’s  day job is to ensure that FEMA has the  VerDate Sep 11 2014  09:35 Sep 29, 2016 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28SE6.064 S28SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 2 4 C T 6 F 9 K S D l n o d a n o d c m e         ",2016
350,,114,0.447,198,2016-09-28,Mrs. WALORSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to recognize the active duty military and civilian employees at the Naval Surface Warfare  Center Crane Division as they celebrate their  75th anniversary and the 241st birthday of the  United States Navy.  Located at Naval Support Activity Crane in  Indiana,  the Naval Surface Warfare Center  Crane Division supports the shore command  of  the U.S. Navy and provides engineering  services for electronic systems and electronic,  strategic, and special warfare weapons. These  systems and weapons have proven to be critical to the success and high performance of  the Navy over NSWC Crane’s 75 years of  service.  American Naval  supremacy  and military  readiness depends on  the ability  to harness  the power of  the cutting-edge  technologies  that NSWC Crane supports. Because of these  hardworking  employees  and military  personnel,  the exceptional men and women of  our Armed Forces are well-equipped to defend  our nation and support our allies across the  globe.  NSWC Crane, which is located on the third  largest naval installation in the world, is an important contributor  to  the  Indiana economy.  The base employs over 5,000 civilian personnel and is an engine of the Indiana economy  that provides secure  jobs  to Hoosiers  who work every day knowing  the vital  role  they play in the defense of the nation. Moreover,  it  is one of  Indiana’s  largest high-tech  employers, with over 2,000 scientists, engineers, and technicians.  This organization is committed to excellence  and continues  to promote patriotism, honor,  and strong national security. Their continued  devotion  to our service members and our  country should serve as an honorable example for all Hoosiers.  On behalf of all Hoosiers, I am honored to  celebrate  the Naval Surface Warfare Center  Crane Division’s 75th anniversary and  the  U.S. Navy’s 241st birthday. Lastly, I would like  to recognize  the  important work of  the men  and women at NSWC Crane, and wish them  continued success and growth  in  the years  ahead.  f  TAIWAN’S NATIONAL DAY  HON.

351,,114,0.56,198,2016-09-28,Mr. MESSER.," Mr. Speaker, October 10,  2016  is Taiwan’s National Day, marking  the  founding of the Republic of China 105 years  ago. I rise today to congratulate the people of  Taiwan on this important occasion.  I’ve had the opportunity to visit Taiwan in  the past. The country’s evolution into a free  society that espouses the values of free elections, human rights, free markets, and the rule  of law is a significant one in which the United  States has played an important role. Taiwan  remains a great friend and strategic ally to the  United States.  Beginning with passage of the Taiwan Relations Act, Congress has been at the forefront  of bilateral  relations with  the  island nation,  playing a key part in ensuring Taiwan’s military needs are addressed and assisting Taiwan with its democratic and economic development.  That cooperation continues today. Congress  has played a critical role in assisting Taiwan’s  participation  in  the World Health Assembly  and facilitating its entrance into the Visa Waiver Program. Most recently, through the assistance of the United States, Taiwan was granted observer status in Interpol.  As a member of the Asia Pacific Economic  Forum and World Trade Organization, Taiwan  is an  important  trading partner and export  market for the United States in almost every  major sector.  It  is our ninth  largest  trading  partner overall, and  the sixth  largest  international market for U.S. agricultural products.  Taiwan has been a full participant in trade negotiations and  initiatives, devoting a great  amount of effort to multilateral trade and investment activities, working to ensure that any  trade agreements are both free and fair.  Given its economic strength and dedication  to global trade and investment, Taiwan should  be given fair and equal treatment when considering  future U.S. partnerships and  trade  deals. As we continue to discuss the merits of  a Trans-Pacific Partnership, we must carefully  examine  the  implications of excluding countries that are not only robust trading partners,  but critical geopolitical allies as well. It is my  hope  that  the U.S. Government  thoughtfully  consider all these relevant factors and allow  them to inform our path forward in an evolving  landscape of international trade.  I look forward to the continued collaboration  with Taiwan in the months and years ahead  as we continue to enhance our bilateral security, economic, and trade relations.  f  HONORING LEVI LEIPHEIMER’S  GRANFONDO  HON.

352,House,114,0.448,19,2016-11-14,Mr. YOUNG of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank my friend from Texas.  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in  support of the Improving Rural Call  Quality and Reliability Act I  introduced in a bipartisan manner with my  colleague from Vermont, Representative PETERWELCH.  Each month as I meet with Iowans in  each of the 16 counties making up the  great Third District of Iowa, I hear  how rural America is struggling. The  recent economic downturn has led to  people leaving rural areas to seek opportunities elsewhere.  In my home State of Iowa, rural communities are working to reverse these  trends by attracting new businesses  and amenities and opportunities  for  their residents. Now, communication is  key to any business’ success in reaching customers; yet in our rural communities across America, calls are not  getting through or the connection and  the quality are poor.  Telephone companies often rely on  intermediate providers to route calls  from large networks to local service  providers, sometimes to mixed results.  But dropped, looped, poor-quality calls  do not just hurt small businesses and  consumers; they also hurt our families  in need of emergency assistance and  public services.  Mr. Speaker,  a  family  facing  an  emergency must be able to trust they  will be able to reach assistance no matter where they live. Improving rural  call completion rates and quality is essential to ensuring  families  in rural  America have access to the services  and amenities offered in large urban  areas. These services are important to  ensuring the survival of small towns  PALLONE,  and granting Americans the choice to  live and thrive in whatever community  is best for them and their family—rural  or urban.  H.R. 2566, the Improving Rural Call  Quality and Reliability Act, would help  fix  this  significant  problem  facing  rural America from dropped, poor-quality calls. The bill requires providers to  register with  the FCC,  the Federal  Communications Commission, in order  to meet quality standards that ensure  reliable phone service in rural areas. It  also  prohibits  providers  from using  intermediary routing services not registered with the Federal Communications Commission.  By addressing these problems, Congress can help provide Iowans and others and all Americans in rural communities with reliable phone service to  conduct  business,  respond  to  emergencies, and live their lives.  I thank Chairman UPTON, Ranking  Member  and  the  Subcommittee  on Communications  and  Technology  Chairman WALDEN and  Ranking Member ESHOO for their attention  to  this  important matter.  Again, I want to thank my colleague  from Vermont, Representative PETER  WELCH, for his bipartisan leadership on  this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to  support this bill to help our citizens  living in rural America.  ",2016

Mr. Speaker, I  rise tonight in recognition of Mitchell  Kaplan, a gentleman who has contributed so much to our south Florida  community.  Born in Miami, Mitch began his career as a high school English teacher.  He went on to open Books & Books, an  extraordinary bookstore located in my  congressional district that has now expanded throughout south Florida and  even the Cayman Islands.  As  time  passed, Mitch  organized  many  community  events  and  local  book fairs, growing larger and larger  by the year.  Miami  Dade  College  President  Eduardo Padron worked with Mitch to  create  the Miami Book Fair  International, a world-renowned book fair  that is taking place right now in my  congressional  district  in  downtown  Miami.  Mr. Speaker, Mitch Kaplan is an inspiration to Floridians and for people  across the Nation.

On Veterans Day, we expressed our  enduring gratitude to those men and  women—Latinos and Muslims, Christians and Jews, African Americans and  all others—who put on the uniform to  defend that idea. But our words are not  enough. We must honor their service  by protecting the rights and freedoms  of every American, and we must keep  our pledge to promote liberty and justice for all.

The Northwest  Indiana Federation of Labor, American Federation of Labor—Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL –CIO), recognized several individuals and organizations for their dedication  and service during the Northern Indiana Area  Labor Federation Community Labor Awards  Reception, which was held at Wicker Park in  Highland, Indiana, on Thursday, October 20,  2016. These  individuals,  in addition  to all  Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor members who have served Northwest Indiana so  diligently for such a long period of time, are  the epitome of  the  ideal American worker:  loyal, dedicated, and hardworking.  At this year’s event, several individuals and  organizations will receive special recognition.  Jeff Chidester, Ironworkers 395, is the recipient of  the Service  to Labor Award  for his  many years of service to the labor movement  and his outstanding dedication  to his  fellow  union members.  The Union Labor Award was presented to  the Women of Steel, United Steelworkers, District 7, for their unselfish devotion to the labor  movement through its promotion in all areas:  social, civic, educational, and political.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg, South Bend, Indiana,  was honored with  the Community Services  Award for his exemplary service to his community and to the enhancement of the quality  of life for the people of Indiana.  State Senator Earline Rogers was honored  with the Lifetime Achievement Award for her  many years of labor activism and her commitment  to her community. For  the exceptional  service she has provided  to  the people of  Northwest Indiana, she is worthy of our admiration and respect.  Ray  Kasmark,  IBEW,  and  David  Blankenship, Sheet Metal Workers Local 73,  were presented with the George Meany Award  for their significant contributions to the youth  of their communities through their involvement  with the Boy Scouts of America. Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence  in  its  craftsmanship and  loyalty by  its  tradesmen.  These honorees are all outstanding examples  of  these qualities. They have demonstrated  their loyalty to their unions and the Northwest  Indiana community  through  their hard work  and tireless service.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating  these dedicated, honorable, and exemplary  citizens, as well as all of  the hardworking  union men and women  throughout America.

357,,114,-0.263,75,2016-11-14,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the University of Wisconsin-Platteville on  150  years  of  academic  excellence. UW-  Platteville  celebrated  its  sesquicentennial  throughout the 2015–2016 academic year. As  this university enters  its 150th year of providing quality and affordable education, it is fitting we highlight the academic achievements  of the faculty, staff, graduates, and students.  Their continued dedication to higher learning  has been a great source of pride for me as  the university excels year after year. U.S.  News and World Report  ranked  the online  learning courses as one of the top in the nation and it is the fastest growing UW System  school.  Founded in 1866, the university is located in  Platteville, Wisconsin, near Wisconsin’s southwest border.  It began  its storied history as  Wisconsin ’s first state teacher preparation institution as the Platteville Normal School. Its  proud engineering heritage has roots with the  Wisconsin Mining Trade School  founded  in  1907 and in 1917 became the first school in  the United States to offer a three-year course  in mining engineering. The mining school became the Wisconsin Institute of Technology in  1939, which would merge with the Platteville  State Teachers College in 1959 to become the  Wisconsin State College and Institute of Technology at Platteville. In 1966, the name was  changed again to the Wisconsin State University-Platteville. After  joining  the UW System  governed by the board of regents, the school  reached its current namesake in 1971 as the  University of Wisconsin-Platteville.  I have always been proud of the strong and  continuous emphasis placed on education by  those I represent in western and central Wisconsin. The University of Wisconsin-Platteville  is a leading example of this; expanding on its  original academic disciplines of engineering  and education, it now provides over 42 majors  for over 8,000 students. Courses are even offered through an innovative distance education  program enabling over 3,000 students  the  world over  to pursue higher degrees. This  thriving body of students have banded  together under  the symbol of a Pioneer. The  Pioneers have long established traditions such  as  the  lighting of  the  ‘M’ ’. Laid  in 1936 by  mining students attempting to build the largest  M in the world, the community now holds a  twice-annual ceremony where  they  light  the  whitewashed stones in a brilliant blaze. When  a  tornado caused significant damage  to  the  campus in June of 2014, the Pioneers rallied  around their strong sense of community to ensure classes were able to continue for the fall  semester.

Tobler  of the United States Air Force who has been  named one of the twelve Outstanding Airmen  of the Year for 2016.  Aaron enlisted in the Air Force Reserve in  2011 and received honors at both basic training and  technical school. He  is currently a  Geospatial Intelligence Analyst assigned to the  50th  Intelligence  Squadron  at  Distributed  Ground Station-Two at Beale Air Force Base,  California where his job is to exploit high-value  targets and satisfy intelligence requirements in  support of Combatant Commanders around  the World. As a direct result of Staff Sergeant  Tobler’s work, weapon manufacturing compounds were  identified and destroyed, crippling an entire terrorist network. He also facilitated successful over watch of Joint Task  Force troop convoys, ensuring over two thousand miles of roads were clear of threats.  When he’s not working  for  the Air Force,  Aaron is an active member in his community.  He is a manager with the California Department of Social Services in Sacramento, and  serves on the Board of Directors for Rocklin  Residents Unite for Fido community group, an  organization that offers scholarships to wounded veterans to receive training for their service  dogs. He  is  involved  in several community  fundraising events, offering strategic support  and is a regular blood donor.  Staff Sergeant Aaron Tobler  exemplifies  what it means to be an Outstanding Airman.  His has accumulated many accolades and  medals in his Air Force career, and now he  can add being the first Reservist in the Intelligence Career Field to ever be selected as an  Outstanding Airman of the Year as one of his  many accomplishments.  Mr. Speaker,  I am honored  that Sergeant  Tobler and his family are assigned to Beale  Air Force Base  in my district. And  it  is my  privilege  to  recognize him here  for his outstanding contributions to California and to the  United States.  RECOGNIZING SUE WATSON  HON. THEODORE E.

Mr. Hoy passed away the week of October  31st and will be remembered as a committed  volunteer and invaluable worker at the state,  local and national level.  Mr. Hoy became active  in Denton County  politics in the late 1980s, first serving as Precinct Chairman. He went on to be an elections  judge, campaign manager  for Commissioner  Ron Marchant and most recently campaigned  for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz in Iowa during the  2016 presidential election.  From 2002 through 2010, Mr. Hoy served  on the State Republican Executive Committee  and received an award for his achievements  at the close of nearly eight years spent as an  unwavering  public  servant. He was  also  named  the Denton County Republican Party  Volunteer of  the Year  in 1998 and Precinct  Chair of the Year in 2001.  Mr. Hoy is revered as a keen political mind  and hard worker who was always  ready  to  fiercely support the candidates and ideals he  believed  in. He  is remembered as gracious,  kind and a friend to all, no matter an election’s  outcome.  I join several of my fellow Texas elected officials in offering my sincerest condolences to  the members of  the Denton County Republican Party and all who were  inspired and  touched by Mr. Hoy. His commitment to furthering conservative ideals and his service to  Denton, the state of Texas and our nation will  not soon be forgotten.  f  KATY ATHLETES WIN AT THE AAU  JUNIOR OLYMPICS  HON.

361,,114,0.492,103,2016-11-14,Mr. PALAZZO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Major General Allen E. Brewer, the  Assistant Adjutant General of Mississippi, for  his service in the National Guard. He will retire  his time in uniform after 37 years of loyal service to Mississippi and the United States. Major  General Brewer was appointed Assistant Adjutant General—Army, in October 2015. As the  Assistant Adjutant General, he has guided the  formulation, development and implementation  of all programs and policies affecting the Mississippi Army National Guard and  its nearly  10,000 Citizen Soldiers.  Beginning his service in July of 1979, Major  General Brewer distinguished himself through  exceptional meritorious  service while  performing in many positions of responsibility, culminating as The Assistant Adjutant General for  the State of Mississippi. Major General Brewer  demonstrated his professionalism, and a God-  given gift for leadership while serving the Mississippi National Guard. He was selected as  the Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations/G3 for  the Mississippi National Guard. Due to his exceptional performance in readiness and planning, he was selected as Commander, Special  Operations Detachment South where he was  responsible for all aspects of a Special Operations  Headquarters  functions  and  commanded the unit during combat operations in  Afghanistan in 2012.  During his  command  in Special Forces,  Major General Brewer was requested by name  to serve as the Land Component Commander  for the 3RD Air Force—Blue Flag 10 –1 exercise at Hurlburt Field, FL. His vast experience  of producing results led to his election as national chairman for the Special Operations Advisory Committee.  Major General Brewer ’s exemplary service  in positions of increasing responsibility led to  his selection as the Director of the Joint Staff,  Mississippi National Guard in July 2012 and a  subsequent promotion  to Brigadier General.  Major General Brewer supervised and directed  the Mississippi Army National Guard’s accomplishment and management of budgets and  resources  for many of  the major Army National Guard Programs. His service to the Adjutant General as an advisor and counsel for  the development of Joint Strategic Plans and  Programs for Joint Training and Exercises was  above  reproach due  to his extensive background during his career.  Receiving over 25 awards and honors in his  time  in  the military, Major General Brewer’s  service  in a myriad of positions was  instrumental to the successes enjoyed by the Mississippi National Guard units during numerous  combat deployments and domestic responses.  He passionately displayed hard work and  dedication  focusing on providing  ready Soldiers and units to the defense of the nation.  Major General Brewer’s service and accomplishments have had a positive and lasting impact on the Mississippi National Guard as well  as the United States Army.  I would  like  to extend my best wishes  to  Major General Allen E. Brewer upon his retirement from the Mississippi National Guard and  future endeavors and a heartfelt thank you to  him and his family for their service to this nation, and our state.  f  A TRIBUTE TO JULIE WALTERS IN  THE SECOND SESSION OF THE  114TH CONGRESS  HON.

366,House,114,0.521,4,2016-11-29,Mr. STEWART.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Nebraska for the  opportunity to speak on behalf of my  the Veterans TRICARE Choice  bill,  Act.  Mr. Speaker,  it was my honor to  serve for 14 years as a pilot in the Air  Force, and for my family—my wife, my  children, and me—those were some of  the best years of our lives. I continue  to be amazed at the quality of those  who serve in our military. It shouldn’t  become cliche to say this: These are  some of  the  finest young men and  women that our country has ever produced;  they  are  strong,  intelligent,  dedicated, courageous individuals who  choose to use their talents to serve the  rest of us.  It makes me uncomfortable sometimes when I hear those of us who  serve in Congress being called public  servants when we know that the true  public servants are the airmen, the seamen,  the  soldiers,  the marines—and  their  families;  let’s not  forget their  families and their sacrifice as well—  those who spend their careers either  fighting abroad or preparing for that  eventuality. As Americans, we should  make it a habit to always thank these  servicemembers whenever we see them.  As Members of Congress, it is our job  to be wise in our foreign policy, to give  our warfighters  the  resources  they  need to win and then to ensure that  veterans receive the benefits that we  have promised them. In fact, that third  responsibility  is the genesis  for this  bill, fixing a glitch that was brought to  my attention.  As the gentleman has said already, it  is just a glitch, just a loophole in the  current law that was brought to my attention by a group of airline pilots.  These pilots, many of whom are veterans, realized that, as veterans, they  were unable to take advantage of all  the healthcare benefits offered by their  civilian  employers. Many  of  them  wanted to use HSAs but, because of the  TRICARE eligibility, were legally unable to do that.  Mr. Speaker, HSAs are an innovative  healthcare option that House Republicans have advanced as an important  part  of  a market-driven,  affordable  healthcare system. In fact, HSAs are a  critical component to the Speaker’s  Better Way  agenda, which  I  think  many of us are excited to see signed  into law in the coming months. With  that in mind, it makes no sense to lock  veterans out of this benefit based on  eligibility for TRICARE.  These pilots came to my office and  had a simple request: Give us an on-off  switch for TRICARE so the veterans  who wish to use an HSA while retaining their right to return to TRICARE  in  the  future  can do  that  if  they  choose. It made sense, so that is what  we did with this bill. The Veterans  TRICARE Choice Act allows a veteran  to suspend his or her TRICARE benefits for the purpose of enrolling in a  health savings plan. If, for whatever  reason, the veteran wishes to return to  TRICARE, he or she can do so. It is a  simple, commonsense fix with broad,  bipartisan support.

368,House,114,0.703,25,2016-11-29,Mr. YOHO.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  Chairman MILLER, a fellow Floridian,  for his support of this measure. Without his help and the help of his team—  Maria and Cecilia  in particular—we  would not be here today.  This is a monumental bill for our  veterans. This comes down to customer  service for our veterans. I feel we are in  the customer service business. They  are not constituents. These are people  who have paid the price to defend this  country, and it is time that we give  them the service that they need.  What this does is it gives us read-  only access to a veteran’s claim. We  have already got a privacy form. We  are on a secure system, and this just  moves the claim through the process  that much quicker so that we can find  out why it is hung up. So many times,  as the chairman said, the average time  it takes for an office to receive the  records they request from the VA is 6  months, and at times even over a year.  What this will do is, we can look into  there, we can read only that particular  case, and we can say, You forgot to  sign it, you forgot to date it, you forgot to check this box; and we can report immediately back to the veteran.  It should free up the VA system.  No single man or woman who has  served  and  protected  our  freedoms  should have to wait to receive the care  and benefits that they have more than  earned. Unfortunately, they have become  statistics, nothing more  than  numbers on the page, so many times  with the VA system.

375,,114,0.29,12,2016-12-12,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Mr. Speaker, every  year, more high school seniors from the 11th  Congressional District trade in varsity jackets  for navy pea coats, Air Force flight suits, and  Army brass buckles than most other districts  in  the country. But  this  is nothing new—our  area has repeatedly sent an above average  portion of its sons and daughters to the nation’s military academies for decades.  This  fact should not come as a surprise.  The educational excellence of area schools is  well known and has long been a magnet for  families  looking  for  the best environment  in  which  to raise  their children. Our graduates  are skilled not only in mathematics, science,  and social studies, but also have solid backgrounds  in sports, debate  teams, and other  extracurricular activities. This diverse upbringing makes military academy recruiters sit up  and take note—indeed, many recruiters know  our towns and schools by name.  Since  the 1830’s, Members of Congress  have enjoyed meeting, talking with, and nominating superb young people  to our military  academies. But how did this process evolve?  In 1843, when West Point was the sole academy, Congress ratified the nominating process  and became directly involved in the makeup of  our military’s leadership. This was not an act  of an  imperial Congress bent on controlling  every aspect of Government. Rather, the procedure still used today was, and is, a further  check and balance in our democracy. It was  originally designed to weaken and divide political coloration  in  the officer corps, provide  geographical balance to our armed services,  and to make the officer corps more resilient to  unfettered nepotism and handicapped European armies.  In 1854, Representative Gerritt Smith of  New York added a new component  to  the  academy nomination process—the academy  review board. This was the first time a Member of Congress appointed prominent citizens  from his district to screen applicants and assist with the serious duty of nominating candidates for academy admission. Today, I am  honored to continue this wise tradition in my  service to the 11th Congressional District.  My Academy Review Board is composed of  local  citizens who have  shown exemplary  service to New Jersey, to their communities,  and to the continued excellence of education  in our area; many are veterans. Though from  diverse backgrounds and professions, they all  share a common dedication  that  the best  qualified and motivated graduates attend our  academies. And, as  true  for most volunteer  panels, their service goes largely unnoticed.  I would like to take a moment to recognize  and thank them publicly for participating in this  important panel. Being on the board requires  hard work and an objective mind. Members  have the responsibility of interviewing upwards  of 50 outstanding young men and women  every year in the academy review process.  The nomination process  follows a general  timetable. High school seniors mail personal  information directly  to  the Military Academy,  the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy,  and the Merchant Marine Academy once they  become interested in attending. Information includes academic achievement, college entry  test scores, and other activities. At this time,  they also inform my office of their desire to be  nominated.  The academies then assess the applicants,  rank them based on the data supplied, and return the files to my office with their notations.  In late November, our Academy Review Board  interviews all of the applicants over the course  of 2 days. They assess a student’s qualifications and analyze character, desire to serve,  and other  talents  that may be hidden on  paper.  This year the board interviewed over 40 applicants. The Board ’s recommendations were  then forwarded to the academies, where recruiters reviewed files and notified applicants  and my office of their final decision on admission.  As  these  highly motivated  and  talented  young men and women go through the academy nominating process, never let us forget  the sacrifice  they are preparing  to make:  to  defend our country and protect our citizens.  This holds especially true at a time when our  nation  is  fighting  the war against  terrorism.  Whether  it  is  in  the Middle East, Africa or  other  troubled spots around  the world, no  doubt we are constantly reminded that wars  are fought by the young.
