",2003
6,House,108,-0.262,24,2003-01-07,Ms. HARMAN.," Mr. Speaker, this past  weekend I lost a dear friend and law  school classmate and Californians lost  a true champion of public interest and  civil liberties. Joe Remcho died tragically in a helicopter accident. He will  be sorely missed. I met Joe  in  law  school 37 years ago. We became quick  and close friends. After law school we  took different paths, but both reveled  in politics, public interest, and public  policy. Joe became an acknowledged  expert  in  first amendment, election  law, and civil  liberties. As a rookie  lawyer, he represented soldiers in Saigon during the Vietnam War and later  worked as a staff attorney and lobbyist  for the ACLU  in San Francisco and  Sacramento.  He became an advisor to many public  officials, including California Governor  Gray Davis, Senator DIANNEFEINSTEIN,  and me and was sought after for his  skill, his decency, and his common  sense. His advocacy greatly influenced  the redistricting process in California,  and he brought numerous cases involving voter initiatives, term limits, and  campaign finance.  Legal titan that he was, I will remember Joe as quiet and self-effacing,  a truly decent individual who eschewed  headlines and publicity. He always had  time to give advice to his friends, often  pro bono. Recently, he helped me with  a small, but important, family issue.  People like Joe are rare, but their  impact great. Joe Remcho’s legacy will  inspire young  lawyers  for years  to  come. To his family, friends, clients,  and other classmates, my family extends our deepest condolences.  f  HONORING FORMER  CONGRESSMAN WAYNE OWENS  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to honor the dedication and  the life of a dear friend of this great  Chamber, former Congressman Wayne  Owens. Wayne Owens was an energetic  Member who served the American people faithfully for four terms. As a member  of  the  International Relations  Committee on which I serve, Wayne  Owens  reached  across  the  political  aisle, committing himself to the peace  process in the Middle East.  As the founder of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, Wayne Owens brought together  different leaders from the Middle East  in his tireless pursuit of a just, lasting,  and comprehensive peace.  Mr. Speaker, many were touched by  Congressman Wayne Owens. I want to  extend my deepest condolences to his  wife, Marlene, their two children, their  grandchildren, and to all of his family  and  friends. Wayne will  surely  be  missed.  f  CELEBRATING JOHN COLLINS’S  BIRTHDAY  (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2003
7,House,108,-0.401,24,2003-01-07,Ms. LOFGREN.," Mr. Speaker, today is  a historic day. It is a day that for the  first time an Italian American, a Californian, a woman, was nominated for  Speaker; but it is historic for me for  another reason. Today my son, John  Collins, has turned 18 years old, and  this is the first time I have ever been  away from him on his birthday. He insisted  that  I  come  to Washington  today. He said I would be letting the  country down if I did not come to vote  for NANCYPELOSI. And so I took his advice.  I wanted to celebrate my son’s birthday because he is well known to many  Members of Congress. He has  spent  many hours on  this  floor  teaching  Members how to use the computers, arguing politics, policy, and philosophy.  He is a wonderful young man. I am immensely proud of him, and I am so glad  that he has reached this milestone, his  18th birthday and adulthood.

9,House,108,0.596,31,2003-01-07,Mr. CANNON.," Madam Speaker,  I  thank the gentlewoman for her kind  words. It dawned on me during her discussion that Congressman Owens has  been away from this body for 8 years;  and yet many, many people have taken  time at an awkward hour, on an important day, to express their appreciation  for him and his work, and I hope that  this is the kind of thing that his family  will appreciate and understand and understand the depth of the value he  brought to this institution.  Madam Speaker, I would yield to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR).  ",2003
10,House,108,-0.35,31,2003-01-07,Ms. KAPTUR.," Madam  speaker,  I  want  to  thank  the gentleman  from  Utah (Mr. CANNON) very much for his  leadership in assembling this tribute  this evening on behalf of our beloved  colleague Wayne Owens who passed, as  others have said, in Tel Aviv, as a witness for peace, and I would like to encourage my friend, the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. CANNON), to consider perhaps  in Congressman Owens’ memory that  we, on a bipartisan basis, might create,  as the gentlewoman  from California  (Mrs. CAPPS) has very wisely suggested,  a Middle Eastern study group oriented  toward peace in that region and to do  so on a bipartisan basis, naming  it  after Congressman Owens who showed  us the way in that troubled and wartorn region of the world.  He was walking the path to peace and  peace requires heroes and it requires  heroics; and Wayne Owens, for our Nation, is such a hero. My heart goes out  to his wife, Marlene, his five children,  two sisters, a brother, 14 grandchildren  who truly have a hero to admire.  At age 65 he did not have to go on  that painstaking journey, 7 days of intensive work, trying to find those keyholes to peace, and yet he did that. He  could have been living a comfortable  life in some condo on some ski slope  enjoying himself, but his whole  life  showed  that Wayne Owens was not  afraid of hard work.  In 1989, he cofounded the Center for  Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation here in our Nation’s capital  and established working relationships  with  leaders  from  Jordan,  Egypt,  Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia and was  making a difference for all of us as the  world and our own country is perched  on the verge of war in that region. He  was trying to show us a different path.  He was not afraid of hard work in his  own  life. I mean,  from the time he  washed dishes to work his way through  school, to walking across his own State  in the entire second congressional district and winning election here, this  was a man who endured and who rose  above common effort to heroic level to  try to help the world, to remove from  the television every evening those terrible  images of death  in the Middle  East that infect every child in every  nation on Earth, certainly our own.  To his family, may I please extend  the deepest sympathy of the people of  our community. I had the great honor  of being able to work with Wayne in  our efforts here to find a peaceful road  in the Middle East. I am forever indebted to him, to the organization that  he founded and to the friendships that  he made on both sides of the aisle that  helped us find a better way forward.  As mission president for the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in  Montreal, Canada, for 3 years, Wayne  Owens took his own peace quest to a  much higher  level  and  took  it  to  ground zero in the battle for peace in  the Middle East. b1730  Madam Speaker, I will place in the  RECORDan article that was in Roll Call  this week in his honor and also thank  the gentleman from Utah very much  for yielding to me this evening. FORMERREPRESENTATIVEOWENSDIES  (By Bree Hocking)  Wayne Owens, a relentless advocate  for  Arab-Israeli peace and  former Democratic  Representative from Utah, died Dec. 18 while  walking on a beach in Tel Aviv.  Owens, who was 65, succumbed to a massive heart attack while traveling with a Congressional delegation to the region.  The four-term Congressman served in the  House from 1973 to 1975 and from 1987 to 1993,  representing the Salt Lake city area.  During his Congressional career, he made  two unsuccessful bids for the Senate. In 1974,  he lost to Republican Jake Garn and in 1992  he was defeated by Sen. Bob Bennett (R– Utah). He also ran unsuccessfully for governor of the Beehive State in 1984.  A devout Mormon, Owens served as president of the Montreal mission for the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the  mid- to late 1970s.  Despite his liberal credentials—he was the  Western states coordinator  for the presidential bids of both Robert Kennedy and  now-Sen. Edward Kennedy  (D–Mass.), and  also was a staffer to the later Kennedy— Owens was admired by Members from both  sides of the aisle for his tireless work for  peace in the Middle East. In 1989, he cofounded the Center for Middle East Peace  and Economic cooperation and served as its  president.  Owens attended the University of Utah,  latter earning a law degree from that institution.  He is survived by his wife, Marlene, five  children, two sisters, a brother and 14 grandchildren. ",2003
11,House,108,-0.45,31,2003-01-07,Mr. OBEY.," Madam Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding to me. I was  horrified  to  learn of Wayne Owens’  death last week when I was at C–SPAN,  just about to go on their morning program, and saw the news come across  the bottom of the screen that Wayne  had died the day before.  Wayne and I were neighbors when I  was first elected to Congress. He and  his wife lived right next door to my  wife  and  I  in Arlington  in  rented  homes. He was then chief staff assistant to Senator KENNEDY. I got to know  Wayne first as a friend and then I got  to know him as an even stronger friend  when he became a colleague of so many  of us in the House. And after he left  this House, as has been mentioned, he  devoted a good deal of his time to the  cause of peace, especially in the Middle  East.  He was a strongly religious man. He  prided himself on being a Christian and  he took the responsibilities that come  with that very seriously. One of those  responsibilities, in his view, was the  obligation that all of us have as the  more  comfortable members  of  the  human race on this planet to reach out  to try to help those who are not in such  comfortable circumstances. He would  have been appalled to see the lack of a  sense of shared sacrifice that so often  permeates what political  leaders do  these days.  But he never forgot his obligations to  himself, to his maker, and to his fellow  man to take into account always the  needs of others. He was one of the least  VerDate Dec 13 2002  03:59 Jan 08, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07JA7.062 H07PT1 ",2003
12,House,108,-0.402,38,2003-01-07,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. KAPTUR)  for her remarks. Two  things or maybe three things that I  really appreciate. One, I think  it  is  very important to bring up the crises  or I should say the increase costs of oil  and how that has steadily gone up in  the last 2 years or so and is a major  factor also impacting the economy and  that this administration has not done  anything in the first 2 years to make  us more energy independent. They have  fiddled around and talked about a lot  of  things, but nothing has actually  been accomplished.  The other thing is, in listening to the  gentlewoman, it is almost as if President Bush is just going back to the old  sort  of  trickle-down  economics;  in  other words, we give all the money to  the rich. Now we give this huge tax  break with dividends primarily to the  wealthy and somehow that is going to  trickle down. But as the gentlewoman  pointed out, that is not what happens  because  the money  is  just  invested  overseas, and one of the things that I  mentioned before and that is an important part of the Democrat stimulus  package is relief for small businesses,  which is specifically targeted so that it  has to be used to reinvest in new jobs,  new means of production, and the majority of the jobs that are created in  the United  States  these  days  are  through small business.  So we are doing the opposite. They  are saying we will give a big boost to  the big corporate  interests and  the  wealthy and they are somehow going  to spend it to create jobs; but there are  no strings attached, whereas the Democrats have a proposal that specifically  targets  small businesses and  insists  that whatever tax savings or credits  are specifically for new jobs and new  production here, which I think is crucial because otherwise it is a waste,  and the gentlewoman has pointed that  out very effectively.  ",2003
13,House,108,-0.429,38,2003-01-07,Mr. DEFAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, the gentleman raised the unemployment numbers. It is interesting that recently a  survey has come out of rural areas in  my State, particularly areas that were  previously  timber-dependent  areas,  about unemployment; and the numbers  that we record today in unemployment  do not reflect the real suffering or the  true degree of unemployment. As high  as unemployment  is  in  the United  States, and it is at some of the highest  numbers it has been in a decade under  this administration without an extension of unemployment benefits, which  hopefully will be rectified here this  week, but the numbers are actually  much worse because  the definitions  have been cleverly changed  to  say,  well, if they are unemployed and their  unemployment benefits have run out,  they are not considered unemployed  anymore in the United States.  So if we follow that illogic through,  if everybody in America lost their job  today and all their benefits an out a  year from today and nobody got their  job back, no one would be working and  we would have zero unemployment. It  is an absolute absurdity. So the true  measure of unemployment is actually  VerDate Dec 13 2002  03:59 Jan 08, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A07JA7.043 H07PT1 ",2003

The  issue  is, unemployment benefits not  only help these individuals who have  lost their jobs through no fault of their  own—whether  it  is the Boeing Company in a downturn or other people impacted by 9/11 who have lost their jobs  and need these unemployment benefits—but more importantly, unemployment benefits are also an economic  stimulus. Economists have said every  $1 spent on unemployment insurance  generates $2.15 of economic stimulus.  I can think of no better package for  us to support in a bipartisan fashion  than putting more dollars  into our  local economies  that are hurting.  I  know our State, with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, has an economic forecast that says  the next 6 months will not get any better. So if not today, I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  when will we realize this is an economic stimulus package that we must  support. Several  Chair.  ",2003
16,Senate,108,0.338,59,2003-01-07,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President, my  understanding  is  this unemployment  extension mirrors the unemployment  extension we did in the last session of  Congress. We extended benefits for 13  weeks.  There are  some  for which  the  26  weeks plus the 13 weeks have expired. I  assume the million people we are talking about are those people in places  where there is not high unemployment,  who do not qualify for an additional 13  weeks above the 13 weeks that have already been extended.  As you know, under  this bill, as  under the prior bill, in States where  there are high rates of unemployment,  people do get 26 weeks, the 13 plus 13.  So what you are talking about is a million people, in places where there are  lower rates of unemployment, not getting an additional 13 weeks on top of  the 13 weeks they now get on top of the  26 weeks which the original unemployment act provided.  So when we talk about people being  left out, what we are talking about is a  change in what the original extension  is. I am not too sure that is being left  out.  Those  are  people  who  went  through their 26 weeks, went through  their 13 weeks, and have still not been  able to find a job but are not in States  with high unemployment.  So what we are doing is extending  last year’s unemployment benefits to  this year. I think that is a fair way to  start. It is a way to get things done. If  you want to change unemployment exthe  tension and turn it into 26 weeks, we  can have that debate. But to suggest  we are leaving people out, I am not too  sure that is really what is factually  happening in this situation.  Several  Senators  addressed  Chair.  ",2003
17,Senate,108,0.366,59,2003-01-07,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President,  in  response to the question by the Senator  from Rhode Island, it is clear we are  not solving the problem today. Because  of the reality of scheduling, and in part  because of what happened in the last  Congress, we are faced with the reality  that if we do not act today, there are  going to be as many as 750,000 people  who will have a disruption in benefits  as of Thursday. I believe the House is  going out tomorrow.  We have a compromise on both sides  of the aisle we have been working on  that was agreed to—worked on by Senators CLINTON, FITZGERALD, NICKLES,  SPECTER, CANTWELL, and a range of  people.  I  understand what we  are  doing  today, if this is accepted by unanimous  consent, is taking care of the 750,000  people who will be able to continue to  receive their benefits. I know there is a  lot more to do.  I am not sure it is necessary to go  over everything that is in the bill. Basically, what the compromise does is  extend unemployment benefits  from  December 28—which was while we were  all out on vacation—up until June 1,  2003, which is an additional 5 months of  coverage. That is what we would be  agreeing  to  today, well  recognizing  there are other issues in addition to  this that we are going to have to do as  we go forward on this issue.  The compromise, I should also add,  since some of the details were brought  up, also provides  coverage allowing  benefits to be phased out rather than  just shut off  immediately when the  program ends.  President Bush has made  it very  clear that the extension of unemployment benefits is a top priority. On both  sides of the aisle, we have tried to  come  together.  Given  the  circumstances of having been on our recent holiday, I would like to see us respond  in a timely manner, meaning  now, through the unanimous consent  request,  recognizing  there  is more  work to do as we go forward.  The President, as we speak, or in the  last hours, has addressed other parts of  reemployment. At the end of the day,  people want the checks, but what they  really want are the  jobs. There are  other ways we will continue to address  that in the future.  I urge my colleagues, very soon, to  take the regular order—I will not call  for it at this point—so we can take this  first important step very significant to  the American people, many of whom  are not going to see their checks unless  we act, and act today. ",2003
18,Senate,108,0.342,59,2003-01-07,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  today in support of extending the temporary extended unemployment compensation program.  In March of last year, Congress enacted the  ‘‘Job Creation and Worker  Assistance Act of 2002.’’ This Act created a temporary program to provide  additional unemployment benefits to  workers in every State.  Specifically, this program provided  up to 13 weeks of federally funded employment benefits for workers who become unemployed and exhaust their  regular State unemployment benefits.  In addition, the program provided up to  13 weeks of additional benefits in high  unemployment States—that’s a maximum of 26 weeks.  When this extended benefit program  was originally enacted last year, it was  scheduled to expire at the end of 2002.  Unfortunately, the economy has not  performed as well as we all hoped and  the unemployment rate in many States  continued to rise throughout last year.  As my colleagues may recall, the  Senate agreed to a unanimous consent  request last year to extend the deadline. Unfortunately, the 107th Congress  adjourned  before  reaching  a  final  agreement on the extension.  So, we are here again today seeking  unanimous consent to extend the temporary extended unemployment compensation program.  This agreement which has been cosponsored  by  Senators FITZGERALD,  SPECTER, COLLINS, GREGG, NICKLES, and  CLINTONwould provide a 5-month extension of the program through the end  of May. This  agreement  has  been  reached in consultation with the House  Leadership.  I believe a 5-month extension is an  appropriate timeframe to see how the  economy will perform this year, as well  as give Congress the opportunity to  consider  further  economic  stimulus  legislation.  Our goal should be make sure that  everyone who wants a job gets a paycheck,  instead of  just an unemployment check.  I also believe it is important to point  out that although the program expired  last week, if we can get this measure  through the House and onto the President’s desk by Thursday, no one will  miss a check.  Unemployment  benefits  are  the  bridges that help people get from one  job to another. These benefits are not  huge, but they’re certainly better than  nothing for those who are out of work  and desperately looking for jobs. People have to put food on the table. They  have to heat their homes. They have to  buy  their  kids  clothes,  shoes  and  school supplies. Their needs are immediate, and they need immediate relief.  While Congress is approving unemployment benefits, we need to do everything in our power to create jobs. I  don’t mean just any jobs, but quality  opportunities that pay enough income  to sustain families and build careers. I  look forward to working with my colleagues and the President on creating  jobs. Americans are the world’s greatest workforce.

23,Senate,108,-0.303,87,2003-01-07,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, officially, the Congress that ended in December was the 107th Congress. But  history will almost surely record it as  the September 11th Congress. From the  moment the first plane hit the first  tower until the last moments of the  lameduck session, helping America recover from that horrific day, bringing  its  plotters  to  justice  and making  changes to protect America from future terrorist attacks dominated the  Senate’s agenda.  We continued that work—even as we  confronted unprecedented challenges in  the Senate: anthrax, the rise of new  threats to our Nation, and the loss of  our  friend  and  colleague,  Paul  Wellstone.  Through tragic and historic events,  the  107th Senate under Democratic  control produced a number of important legislative accomplishments: aviation security and counterterrorism legislation;  the  toughest corporate accountability  law since the SEC was  created in 1934; the most far-reaching  campaign finance reforms since Watergate; the most significant overhaul of  Federal education policies since 1965;  and a new  farm bill to replace the  failed Freedom to Farm Act.  However, other important legislation  fell  victim  to  special-interest  armtwisting, and the other party’s unwillingness to compromise on their proposals, or even consider ours. We saw  that on proposals to dedicate greater  resources  to  homeland  security,  a  Medicare prescription drug benefit, and  a  real, enforceable patients’ bill of  rights.  The proposals we are  introducing  today recognize that the American people have real concerns about their security, and that Republicans and the  Bush administration have not done  enough to address those concerns.  But they also recognize that security  means more  than national  security,  and homeland security. It means economic  security,  retirement  security,  and the security of knowing that our  children are getting a good education,  and that, if you get sick, health care is  available and affordable. It means giving people who work fulltime the security of knowing they can earn a decent  wage—whether they work on a farm, in  a factory, or at a fast-food restaurant.  It is the security of knowing that our  air is safe to breathe and our water is  safe to drink, that America is living up  to its commitment to civil rights, and  that we are keeping our promises to  our veterans.  Democrats are committed to tackling terrorism abroad, and making our  country more secure.  One of our first priorities will be to  make Americans safer by enhancing  protections for our ports, borders, food  and water supplies, and chemical and  nuclear plants.  We are introducing a bill to commit  real resources to doing all of those  things, and to hiring more police and  first responders and providing them the  tools and training to do the difficult  jobs we are now asking them to do.  We  also  recognize  that  national  strength  also  depends  on  economic  strength, and in the last 2 years, America’s economy has weakened. In the  coming weeks, we will put forward our  ideas  for how best to stimulate the  economy in the short term.  But,  in the  long term, one of the  most important things we can do is  give people greater  confidence  that  their private pensions will be there for  them. That is why another of our leadership bills is one to strengthen pension protections, expand pension coverage, and crack down on rogue corporations.  It has been said that almost every  problem  any  society  faces  can  be  solved with two things: good health,  and a good education—and we have  bills in each of those areas.  The Right Start  for Children Act  makes Head Start fully available for 4-  and 5-year-olds, and  increases availability for infants and toddlers. It will  help improve childcare quality, make  childcare more affordable for 1 million  additional  children,  and  strengthen  child nutrition  programs  to  reduce  child hunger.  The Educational Excellence for All  Learners Act builds on that foundation  by improving education every step of  the way—from kindergarten, to college, to lifelong learning. It makes sure  that we match the real reforms we  passed last year with the real resources  they demand. It will help us recruit,  hire, and train qualified teachers, build  new schools, and make college and job  training more  affordable  and more  available.  President Bush pledged to leave no  child behind, and then proposed more  than a billion dollars of education cuts.  We are proposing to put our money  where the Republicans’ mouths are— and help secure a good start, a good  education, and good prospects for all  Americans.  When it comes to health care, it was  an outrage that 40 million Americans  were uninsured 2 years ago. In the past  year, over 1 million more Americans  have lost health insurance. And those  who are lucky enough to have health  insurance are seeing their premiums  skyrocket.  With the Health Care Coverage Expansion and Quality Improvement Act,  we hope to reduce the number of uninsured by making health care coverage  more available  to  small businesses,  parents  of  children  eligible  for  VerDate Dec 13 2002  06:46 Jan 08, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A07JA6.051 S07PT1 ",2003
24,Senate,108,-0.308,94,2003-01-07,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I am  pleased  to  re-introduce  the Quality  Cheese Act of 2003. This legislation will  protect the consumer, save taxpayer  dollars and provide support to America’s dairy farmers, who have taken a  beating in the marketplace in recent  years.  When Wisconsin consumers have the  choice, they will choose natural Wisconsin cheese. But the Food and Drug  Administration, FDA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, may  change  current  law, and  consumers  won’t know whether cheese is really all  natural or not.  If the Federal Government creates a  loophole for imitation cheese ingredients to be used in U.S. cheese vats,  some cheese labels saying ‘‘domestic’’  and ‘‘natural’’ will no longer be truly  accurate.  If USDA and FDA allow a change in  Federal rules, imitation milk proteins  known as milk protein concentrate, casein, or dry ultra filtered milk could be  used to make cheese in place of the  wholesome natural milk produced by  cows in Wisconsin or other part of the  U.S.  I am deeply concerned by recent efforts  to  change America’s  natural  cheese standard. This effort to allow  milk protein concentrate and casein  into natural cheese products flies in  the face of logic and could create a  loophole that could allow unlimited  amounts of substandard imported milk  proteins to enter U.S. cheese vats.  My legislation would close this loophole and ensure that consumers could  be confident that they were buying  natural cheese when they saw the natural label.  Over the past decade, cheese consumption has risen at a strong pace  due in part to promotional and marketing  efforts  and  investments  by  dairy farmers across the country. Year  after year, per capita cheese consumption has risen at a steady rate.  Recent proposals to change to our  natural  cheese  standards,  however,  could decrease consumption of natural  cheese. These  declines  could  result  from concerns about the origin of casein and milk protein concentrate.  The addition of this kind of milk  could significantly tarnish the wholesome reputation of natural cheese in  the eyes of the consumer.  This  change  could  seriously  compromise decades of work by America’s  dairy  farmers  to build up domestic  cheese consumption levels. It is simply  not fair to America’s farmers!  Consumers have a right to know if  the cheese that they buy is unnatural.  And by allowing milk protein concentrate milk into cheese, we are denying consumers the entire picture.  This legislation will require that labels paint the entire picture for the  consumer, and allow them enough information to select cheese made from  truly natural ingredients.  Allowing MPCs or dry ultra-filtered  milk into natural cheeses would also  harm dairy producers throughout the  United States. Some estimate that the  annual effect of the change on the  dairy farm sector of the economy could  be more than $100 million.  The proposed change to our natural  cheese standard would also harm the  American taxpayer. If we allow MPCs  to be used in cheese, we will effectively  permit  unrestricted  importation  of  these  ingredients  into  the  United  States. Because there are no tariffs and  quotas  on  these  ingredients,  these  heavily-subsidized products would displace natural domestic dairy ingredients.  These unnatural domestic dairy products would enter our domestic cheese  market  and might  further  depress  dairy prices paid to American dairy  producers. Low dairy prices result in  increased costs to the dairy price support program. So, at the same time  that U.S. dairy farmers would receive  lower prices, the U.S. taxpayer would  pay more for the dairy price support  program.  This change does not benefit  the  dairy  farmer, consumer or taxpayer.  Who then is it good for?  It would benefit only unscrupulous  foreign MPC producers out to make a  fast buck at the expense of Americans.  This  legislation addresses the concerns of farmers, consumers and taxpayers by prohibiting dry ultra-filtered  milk from being included in America’s  natural cheese standard.  Congress must shut the door on any  backdoor efforts  to  stack  the deck  against America’s dairy farmers. And  we must pass my legislation that prevents  a  loophole  that would  allow  changes that hurt the consumer, taxpayer, and dairy farmer. By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself  and Mr. DASCHLE)  S. 41. A bill to strike certain provisions of the Homeland Security Act of  2002 (Public Law 107–296), and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.  ",2003
25,Senate,108,-0.205,94,2003-01-07,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, I  rise today to introduce a bill on behalf  of myself and Senator DASCHLEto remedy some problems in landmark legislation passed at the end of the last  Congress, and signed into law by President Bush, to establish a Department  of Homeland Security. The legislation  we are offering  today would  strike  seven extraneous special interest provisions inserted into the Homeland Security Act by Republican leadership in  the bill’s waning hours, provisions that  are contrary to the bipartisan spirit in  which the Homeland Security Act was  conceived.  Since the days following September  11, 2001, when terrorists viciously took  the lives of 3,000 of our friends, family  and fellow Americans, I have advocated  establishing a Department of Homeland Security  to beat  the  terrorist  threat. Senator ARLENSPECTER, and I  initially proposed creating a new department in October 2001. Our measure  was not just bipartisan. It was in fact  intended to be nonpartisan.  Unfortunately, some partisan battles  did ensue, primarily regarding  longstanding civil service protections for  homeland security workers, and I remain very concerned about the potential impact of these provisions. Nevertheless, the final bill was, for the most  part, a critical, well-constructed piece  of  legislation  that  incorporated  the  majority of the provisions approved by  the Governmental Affairs Committee,  and which an overwhelming majority  of the Senate embraced.  In some very specific ways, however,  the bill was flawed. In the final stages  of passing  the bill,  the Republican  leadership hastily inserted several special  interest provisions that had no  place in this measure. Most of these  provisions  had  never  been  in  any  version of the  legislation before the  Senate before they were presented in a  take-it-or-leave-it package by Republicans, and several had not been considered by either chamber. The method  and spirit  in which these provisions  found their way into what should have  been a consensus piece of legislation  was utterly objectionable and Senator  and I made an effort to remove them at the time. That effort  narrowly failed, but not before news of  these special  interest provisions had  created great consternation for Democrats and the public, and even for some  Republicans. Indeed, according to numerous published reports, the Republican leadership was able to muster the  votes to preserve the provisions only  after promising to revisit at least some  of the most egregious additions during  this session of Congress.  I believe that the seven extraneous  provisions my legislation targets hurt  the Homeland Security Act as it was finally  passed  by  the Congress  and  signed by the President. And I believe  that, by attaching these measures to  what could have and should have been  a common cause, the Republican leadership all but admitted that the provisions  cannot withstand  independent  scrutiny. Following are the provisions  my bill would strike.  First, perhaps  the most egregious  add-on to the Homeland Security Act  DASCHLE VerDate Dec 13 2002  05:45 Jan 08, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G07JA6.073 S07PT1 ",2003
26,Senate,108,-0.319,108,2003-01-07,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing a private relief bill on  behalf of Donald C. Pence of Stanford,  NC, for compensation for the failure of  the Department of Veterans Affairs to  pay dependency and  indemnity compensation to Kathryn E. Box, the nowdeceased mother of Donald C. Pence. It  is rare that a Federal agency admits a  mistake. In this case, the Department  of Veterans Affairs has admitted that a  mistake was made and explored ways  to permit payment under the law, including equitable relief, but has found  no provisions authorizing the Department to release the remaining benefits  that were unpaid to Mrs. Box at the  time of her death. My bill would correct this injustice, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of my bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows: S. 57 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. RELIEF OF DONALD C. PENCE.  (a) RELIEF.—The Secretary of the Treasury  shall pay, out of any moneys in the Treasury  not otherwise appropriated, to Donald C.

Box, the now-deceased mother of  Donald C. Pence, for the period beginning on  July 1, 1990, and ending on March 31, 1993.

27,Senate,108,0.494,3,2003-01-14,Mr. CRAIG.," What the editorial in the  Wall Street Journal said was apparently the former majority leader had  not learned a lesson, that in the obstructionist character by which he operated the Senate for the last 18 to 20  months—that lost him the majority in  the Senate, that denied us a budget and  11 appropriations bills, that denied us  Medicare and prescription drugs, that  denied the American people a great  many things that not only was the  President promising but  the Senate  and the House were working under—he  should have learned a lesson; that he  should be here helping facilitate the  process of helping this Senate to move  forward.  That has not happened. Why? I guess  they don’t realize they lost the majority; that somehow they are now in the  minority, and it is the responsibility of  them, in this Democratic process, to  work with us to make our Government  function appropriately. It has always  happened that way in the past, but it  isn’t happening that way today.  Over the last week, the negotiations,  which I have not been a part of but certainly which have been reported to me,  largely say: We want everything we  had last year. But they were in the majority last year. Are they entitled to  everything  they had  last year? No.  There is a clear historic precedent that  said  the majority  always got  two-  thirds of the funding to operate the  committees and to cause this system of  the Senate to function, and the minority got one-third.  It changed during the 107th because  of the 50–50 relationship. And certainly,  when I was asked, I would say that in  a relationship like we have today, 51–  49, with 1  independent, we could be  more flexible than just 66 or one-third,  two-thirds. But to suggest that they  have everything they had last year, in  helping set the agenda of the Senate, if  that is what their position is, then the  tactics they used in the last Senate,  that gave them the minority in the  new Senate, are being employed once  again.  I know why they are doing it and  why they think they can get away with  it in this business, because it is inside  ball, it is inside politics. The American  public does not register with them.  When we  start  talking about  committee funding and staffing, that is of  little interest to an American who is  out of work, to a senior who is paying  $400 or $500 a month for his or her prescription drugs. They want those problems solved and they want them solved  now. And while, in many instances, we  cannot move that quickly, it certainly  is our responsibility to move.  The Presiding Officer at this moment  is the new chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He and his staff have  been working for weeks to move the 11  appropriations bills that fund Government through this system, and it has  not happened. Why? Because he has not  been given the authority, even though  he is in the majority, to do it. Why?  Because the  former majority  leader,  now the minority leader, has simply  blocked it.  The editorial I put  in the RECORD  from  the Wall  Street  Journal,  I  thought, said  it well  in the closing  paragraph:  No doubt the Senate will organize—  and we will. And we may see that debate  over  a  final  resolution  begin  today—  but the shenanigans—  some that I have just referred to—  portend a nasty two years. Democrats are  understandably sore about losing their majority,  but  rather  than undertake  some  introspection they’re jumping right back to  the barricades. They apparently figure they  can obstruct Mr. Bush’s agenda and voters  will blame Republicans who are supposed to  be in control.  Maybe, but we seem to recall that’s similar  to the argument they made last year.  And then they go on to talk about  certain Senators who lost their election. Maybe that message was not as  obstructed from the American people  as some of us might have believed it  was.  The Senate  is not working today.  And the reason the Senate isn’t working is because the minority leader, the  Democrat leader, is doing everything  he can to block it from working. It is  simple. It is straightforward. And I believe my comments are very honest.  ",2003

I do not quite  know why this has happened, although  I understand there are some on the  other side who want to really do a very  radical shift  from the allocations  in  the previous Congress when the margins were so close. Of course, that has  created a lot of concern and apprehension about the ability then of the minority to meet and carry out its responsibilities.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand why we cannot in short order  reach an agreement that would be encompassed  in this organizing resolution that the allocation of resources to  what is now the minority would parallel the allocation that was made by  this side of the aisle when it was a majority to the Republican minority in  the last Congress.  I do not understand what the difficulty is with that position. Of course,  the fact that there seems to be some  difficulty only increases the degree of  concern in terms of what lies in wait.

36,Senate,108,0.192,38,2003-01-14,Mr. SMITH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to speak about the need for hate  crimes legislation. In the last Congress  Senator KENNEDYand I introduced the  Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that  would add new categories to current  hate crimes law, sending a signal that  violence of any kind is unacceptable in  our society.  I would like to describe a terrible  crime that occurred March 6, 2001 in  Middleburg, PA. A gay man was severely beaten by two neighbors. Michael Aucker, 41, and two brothers,  Todd Justin Clinger, 20, and Troy Lee  Clinger, 18, were drinking beer  in a  trailer when  the  brothers  thought  Aucker made a sexual advance towards  them. Police said the brothers took  Aucker out on the deck and stomped  on him with heavy work boots. Aucker  was discovered a day and a half later  by another neighbor and co-worker. He  was in a coma and every bone in his  face and nose were broken. I believe  that government’s first duty is to defend  its  citizens,  to  defend  them  against the harms that come out of  hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can  become substance. I believe that by  passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and  minds as well.  f  SITUATION IN THE DEMOCRATIC  REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO  ",2003
37,Senate,108,-0.256,45,2003-01-14,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today in support of S. 152, the DNA  Sexual Justice Act of 2003. Building on  the success of the Kohl-DeWine DNA  Analysis Backlog Elimination Act enacted during the 106th Congress, this  legislation will provide  law enforcement  and  prosecutors with  critical  physical evidence that will help put  more criminals behind bars. Currently,  DNA evidence is languishing untested  at laboratories nationwide, simply for  lack of funding. The DNA Sexual Justice Act will assess the extent of the  backlog and provide  funding  for  its  elimination. Further, this  legislation  will ensure that DNA evidence  from  cases involving sexual assault is handled properly by providing training for  emergency personnel, medical examiners, law enforcement, forensic analysts and prosecutors.  Currently, all 50 States and the Federal Government require DNA samples  to be obtained from certain convicted  offenders, and these samples increasingly can be shared through a national  DNA database established by Federal  law. This national database, part of the  Combined  Database  Index  System,  CODIS, enables law enforcement officials to link DNA evidence found at a  crime scene with any suspect whose  DNA is already on file. By identifying  repeat offenders, this DNA sharing can  and does make a difference.  Before passage of the Kohl-DeWine  Backlog Elimination Act in 2000, law  enforcement was in large part unable  to take advantage of DNA analysis as a  crime-fighting  technology. This was  primarily due to the fact that DNA  sample collection was not required of  all Federal offenders, forensic labs did  not have enough resources or equipment to analyze collected samples, and  State databases were not interoperable  with Federal databases. This bill will  further address these issues by directing the Attorney General to survey forensic laboratories across the country  to determine the scope of the backlog  and authorizes the funding necessary  to eliminate the backlog over the next  four years.  However this  legislation goes even  further, focusing new, targeted grant  programs  toward DNA evidence collected from crimes of sexual assault or  violence. By authorizing  funding  for  the training of emergency personnel  and medical examiners, this legislation  ensures  that DNA  evidence will be  properly collected. With funding for forensic equipment and the training of  forensic  examiners,  it  ensures  that  DNA evidence will be accurately analyzed. And by providing funding for the  training of prosecutors, this legislation  ensures that the evidence will be used  to its greatest possible effect in the  courtroom.  This measure will ensure that women  who have been victims of sexual assault or violence will have the most reliable tools to bring their assailants to  justice. Most importantly, this legislation will help police use modern technology to solve crimes and prevent repeat offenders  from committing new  ones.  By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself,  Mr. KYL, Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr.  SESSIONS, and Mr. CRAIG):  S.  153. A bill  to amend  title  18,  United States Code, to establish penalties  for aggravated  identity  theft,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  ",2003
38,Senate,108,-0.266,45,2003-01-14,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise to reintroduce the Identity Theft  Penalty Enhancement Act along with  Senator KYL, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator SESSIONS, and Senator CRAIG.  I first introduced this bipartisan legislation last June with the full support  of the Justice Department. The bill  will make it easier for prosecutors to  target those identity thieves who, as is  so often the case, steal an identity for  the purpose of committing one or more  other crimes.  I am hopeful that we can build on the  momentum generated by this legislation in the 107th Congress. The Senate  Judiciary  Subcommittee  on  Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information conducted a hearing on the  bill on July 9, 2002.  The  Judiciary  Committee  subsequently passed the legislation out of  Committee on November 14, shortly before the Senate went out of session.  As we enter the 108th congress, there  remains a compelling need to stiffen  the penalties for identity thieves.  A little more than a month ago, the  largest single  identity theft case  in  U.S. history was uncovered. Federal  authorities arrested Philip Cummings  who, along with two accomplices, allegedly  sold  the  credit  reports and  other personal  information of  30,000  victims for as little as $30 each. Investigators have confirmed $2.7 million in  losses so far, and the totals are expected to be much greater. This case is  an example of the tremendous damage  that an identity thief can cause.  Moreover, many serious crimes, even  including terrorism, are aided by stolen identifies.  Lofti Raissi, a 27-year old Algerian  pilot from London who is believed to  have trained four of the 9/11 hijackers,  was identified in British court papers  as having used  the Social Security  number of Dorothy Hansen, a retired  factory worker from Jersey City, NJ,  who died in 1991.  Last year, the Department of Justice  filed charges against an Algerian national who stole the  identifies of 21  members of a health club  in Cambridge, MA. He then transferred those  stolen identities to one of the individuals convicted  in the  failed plot to  bomb Los Angeles International Airport in 1999.  Joseph  Kalady  of  Chicago  was  charged with trying to fake his own  death using the  identity of another.  Kalady, who was awaiting  trial on  charges of counterfeiting birth certificates, Social Security cards and driver’s  licenses, allegedly  suffocated a  homeless man and sought to have him  cremated under Mr. Kalady’s identity  in order to  fake his own death and  avoid prosecution.  The stories go on and on, and it is  those stories that make the legislation  we introduce today so vital. Identity  theft has become the major escalating  crime of the new millennium, and Congress needs to give  law enforcement  the tools to prosecute these crimes.  Let me just outline what this bill  would do.  First, the bill would create a separate  crime  of  ‘‘aggravated  identity  theft’’  for any person who uses the  identity of another person to commit  certain serious, Federal crimes.  Specifically,  the  legislation would  provide for an additional two-year penalty  for any  individual convicted of  committing one of the following serious Federal crimes while using  the  identity of another person: Stealing  another’s identity in order to illegally  obtain citizenship in the United States;  stealing another’s identity to obtain a  passport or visa; using another’s identity to remain in the United States illegally after a visa has expired or an  individual has been ordered to depart  this country; stealing an individual’s  identity to commit bank, wire or mail  fraud, or to steal from employee pension funds; and other serious Federal  crimes, all of them felonies.  Furthermore, the  legislation would  provide for an additional five-year penalty for any individual who uses the  stolen  identity of another person to  commit any one of the enumerated  Federal terrorism crimes found in 18  U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B). These crimes include: The destruction of aircraft; the  assassination or kidnapping of high  level Federal officials; bombings; hostage taking; providing material support to terrorism organizations; and  other terrorist crimes.  Under  the  legislation,  aggravated  identity theft is a separate crime, not  just a sentencing enhancement. And  the two-year and five-year penalties for  aggravated  identity  theft must  be  served consecutively to the sentence  for the underlying crime.  This bill also strengthens the ability  of law enforcement to go after identity  thieves and to provide their case.

39,Senate,108,-0.291,3,2003-01-21,Mr. EDWARDS.," Mr. President, this  morning I will be offering an amendment, together with Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator CLINTON, and Senator REID, all of whom  have worked very hard on this amendment.  This amendment  is about doing a  very simple thing: it is about keeping  our air clean so that kids won’t have  asthma attacks and so seniors won’t  have heart attacks and so Americans  won’t lose their lives before their time.  For months  the administration has  talked about massive changes in clean  air protections and  for months Senators on both sides of the aisle have  said to the administration: Before you  go through with these changes, would  you please tell us in detail how these  changes are going to affect our families? In other words, would you please  look before you leap?  We have been asking that question  for months, and for months the administration has refused to answer. On November 22, they went ahead with their  massive  changes without  telling us  how it was going to affect the health of  the American people.  I believe the administration does not  want to share these facts because they  are afraid of what the facts will show.  They are afraid people will see what  their rule changes will do. When you  study these rules, when you listen to  the experts, you will see that they will  make our air dirtier. These rules will  add more soot to our cities and more  smog to our national parks. At the end  of the day, these rules will allow more  kids to get asthma attacks, more seniors to have heart problems which land  them in the emergency room, and more  people  will  lose  their  lives  prematurely.  This amendment is a very modest response to these proposed changes. It  does not block the rules forever. It does  not put them off for years. It just says  let’s put these rules off for about 6  months and use that time to determine  how these changes will affect human  health, how they will affect kids with  asthma,  senior citizens with cardiorespiratory problems. It seems to be a  perfectly reasonable thing to do. I hope  my colleagues will support the amendment.  We are saying let’s get a study from  the nonpartisan, completely respected  National Academy of Sciences. That is  all we are talking about: 6-month delay  to look at these changes to see, before  they go into effect, what effect they  will have on the health of the American people.  The  science  of  pollution  is  completely clear. Pollution causes heart  and lung problems. It aggravates asthma. It causes the smog that ruins the  view in our Nation’s parks. It causes  premature deaths.  According to Abt Associates, a nonpartisan research group, just 51 powerplants are responsible for more than  5,500 deaths every year, for over 106,000  asthma attacks, and for costs to our  economy of between $31 billion and $49  billion. That is only 51 powerplants. If  you did the same study of other industries, the numbers would go up dramatically.  North Carolina has some of the worst  pollution in the country. According to  Dr. Clay Ballantine, a physician  in  Asheville in western North Carolina,  just living and breathing in western  North Carolina costs 1 to 3 years off  the average life of a person. The UNC  School of Public Health, found that in  many of our counties 3 in 10 kids have  asthma, which is three times the national average.  Just walking  in the Great Smoky  Mountains is as bad for your lungs as  breathing in many big cities. When the  head of the EPA, Christie Todd Whitman, visited the Great Smokies last  Fourth of July, she could barely see 15  miles at a place where you used to be  able to see 75 to 100 miles. So clean air  is a huge priority. It is important for  our kids, for seniors, and for our parks.  This administration has made radical  changes in the regulations under the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:45 Jan 14, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:€3SENATE\S21JA3.REC S21JA3 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2003

42,Senate,108,0.552,45,2003-01-21,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, I very  much look forward to seeing the fruits  of the Clinton and Bush administrations’ labors on this issue.  From my tenure as chairman of the  Senate’s Clean Air Subcommittee,  I  knew that New Source Review was a  major issue for the energy sector. In  fact, I held the very first congressional  hearings on New Source Review in February of 2000 in Ohio. I could not believe my own ears. We heard from companies that were trying to make environmentally friendly modifications to  their facilities being stopped dead in  their tracks by, ironically, the Clean  Air Act.  I was also shocked to hear that it  took 4,000 pages of guidance documents  to explain 20 pages of regulations. That  is 4,000 pages of guidance documents  just to explain 20 pages of regulations.  Since then, my shock at the absurdity of the NSR Program has not worn  off. We, as a nation, need to rethink  the manner in which we approach regulations. We all need to keep an open  mind during the debates on various  regulatory  reform  initiatives.  I  am  sick of continually hearing that these  are  ‘‘sneak attacks on the environment.’’ In  fact,  just the opposite  is  true. If we rethink regulation, we could  find ourselves in a place where we can  have far greater environmental protection and more reliable and diverse energy sources.  Congress and the executive branch  must also do a better job of understanding how the various layers of regulations impact sectors of our economy. I normally have a chart which  shows all of the different regulations  that are going to be hitting the various  regulated sectors—a chart that shows  the refiners that are currently working  at  almost  100–percent  capacity  are  going to be simultaneously hit with a  number of regulations in the next few  years. NSR will make it close to impossible for refiners to make these environmental upgrades. Now is the time  to work together on these and other  regulations to not only achieve the environmental goals but also ensure no  disruption in fuel supply which would  cause the price spikes that we know  are inevitable.  Higher energy prices affect everyone.  However, when  the price of energy  rises, that means the less fortunate in  our society must make a decision between heating their home and keeping  the lights on or paying for other essential needs.  During  a  recent EPW Committee  hearing last year, Senator VOINOVICH’s  constituent, Tom Mullen, articulated  this concern. Mr. Mullen stated that in  a recent study—which is well known  and  very well  expected—on Public  Opinion on Poverty,  it was reported  that 23 percent of the people in America have difficulty paying  for  their  utilities. That is one out of every four  Americans.  I will not support policies, such as  NSR, that will hurt the poor in Oklahoma and around the Nation. Additionally, the lower environmental performance resulting from the current NSR  Program impacts Americans in every  tax bracket. NSR reforms enjoy the  support of a wide range of interests—  from the State attorneys general to  labor unions to business groups.  I ask unanimous consent  to have  printed in the RECORD letters from the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the  International Brotherhood of Boilermakers in support of NSR reform.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  CHAMBEROFCOMMERCE  OFTHEUNITEDSTATESOFAMERICA,  Washington, DC, July 15, 2002.  Hon. JAMESINHOFE,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEARSENATORINHOFE: I am writing on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (U.S.  Chamber), the world’s largest business federation, representing more than three million businesses and organizations of every  size, sector, and region, to express our support for reform of the new source review  (NSR) program. NSR, in its current form has  impeded environmental progress and energy  production  for decades. The  revisions recently announced by the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) are a good beginning to reforming a deeply flawed program.  The NSR program concerns the Clear Air  Act (CAA) emissions standards applicable to  significant  new  and modified  stationary  sources. In 1980, EPA established a regulatory exclusion for ‘‘routine maintenance.’’  The scope of this term, however, remains  subject to debate. A clear administrative interpretation  of  ‘‘routine  maintenance’’  would be an improvement over the present  situation, which is mired in complexity and  confusion.  Reducing the problems with the NSR program is vital. Governments should not unnecessary impede the work of the private  sector. The NSR program is a classic example of bureaucratic complexity. More than 20  years after the initial regulation, a plant  manager cannot determine with any certainty whether planned maintenance activities will subject the facility to millions of  dollars of extra costs.

I have no doubt and I do not disagree  with anything the Senator has said  overall, but I am just suggesting that I  wonder how any Members will explain  at home, if, God forbid, one of our nuclear powerplants is blown up; if, God  forbid, sarin gas is released in the tunnels under New York City; if, God forbid, any number of other things I could  mention, which I won’t because they  will frighten people, happen, I wonder  how any Member will explain how we  justified, in the name of not growing  government, reducing the number of  what I call domestic defense officials,  the number of FBI agents, the law enforcement agents, the number of people  who, in fact, have as their primary responsibility, the security of our people.  A government’s first and foremost responsibility is security. It is not tax  equity, it is security. Security. I am  here to say we are skating perilously  close to a disaster line here for failing  to step up to the plate.  My last comment is I made a speech  on September 10 to the National Press  Club making the same argument I am  making now.  It was  at  that  time  thought to be somehow a little bit of—  we can’t afford  it. The argument  I  made on September 10 at the National  Press Club was we were ignoring domestic security and international terror at our peril and I laid out what we  were not doing.  Let me say to you, I will be back on  the floor again and again because I do  not want my children or my grandchildren saying to me: Where were you  during the war, daddy? Put it another  way: Where were you when we were  fighting terrorism, or supposed to be  fighting terrorism? Why were you cutting law enforcement, cutting the FBI?  Why were you cutting the very agencies that were designed to protect our  security, that mom in her living room,  her child in her school, her husband on  the subway? Where were you?

45,Senate,108,0.382,66,2003-01-21,Mr. HATCH.," Madam President, I rise  in strong support of S. 121, the National AMBER Alert Network Act of  2003. Specifically, I congratulate and  thank my colleagues who have worked  so hard toward the passage of this  needed legislation: Senators KAYBAILEYHUTCHISONand DIANNEFEINSTEIN.  Both of them are deserving of the credit for this bill. I am very proud to align  myself with both of them.  Senator HUTCHISONhas been a great  leader in this area, and I am very much  appreciative  of  her. Also,  Senator  LEAHYand others have worked hard on  this bill.  The horrific kidnapping of Elizabeth  Smart in my home State of Utah is illustrative of a terrifying wave of recent child abductions that has swept  our Nation. Clearly, there is a tremendous need for legislation to help communities fight these terrible crimes.  Without question, when it comes to  child abductions, time  is of the essence. We are all too aware that child  abductors prey on the youngest, most  innocent and vulnerable members of  our society—often for the purpose of  committing  other  serious  violent  crimes against them.  Too often,  it  is only a matter of  hours before a kidnapper abuses, assaults or kills the child victim.  According to figures released by the  Bureau of Justice Statistics, almost 75  percent of the murders that occur following child abductions happen within  the first 3 hours.  AMBER Alert systems are critical to  successful search and recovery efforts  because they enable law enforcement  authorities to galvanize entire communities to assist in the safe recovery of  child victims.  We recently witnessed the success of  the AMBER Alert system in California  where the system was used to broadcast  the  disappearance  of Nichole  Timmons. After she was recognized,  Nichole was safely recovered  in the  neighboring State of Nevada.  In another recent California case, the  AMBER Alert  system was used  to  broadcast  the  disappearances  of  Tamera Brooks and Jaqueline Marris.  Just hours after their abduction, and  minutes before their possible murder,  the two young women were found.  My home State of Utah  recently  adopted  a  statewide  alert  program  aimed at preventing child abduction  called the Rachel Alert. The program  was named after young Rachel Runyan  who was kidnapped  from behind her  home in Sunset, UT, and later found  murdered.  I know that law enforcement agencies are working closely with broadcasters  and  the  public  to  develop  AMBER Alert systems across our country. Despite these efforts, however, I  believe a National AMBER Alert Coordinator in the Department of Justice is  needed to assist States in developing  effective alert plans that can be coordinated nationwide.  Fortunately, we already have  the  technology in place to do just that—  the Emergency Broadcast System. For  years, broadcasters have been cooperating with Government officials and  reaching Americans across our country  by  issuing emergency alerts on our  televisions and radios. We have all experienced an  interruption  in regular  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:45 Jan 14, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:€3SENATE\S21JA3.REC S21JA3 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2003
46,Senate,108,-0.374,73,2003-01-21,Mr. LEAHY.," My  friend  from Kentucky and I agreed to include this section in the report, but we regret that it  was not included before the report hit  the printing presses. It is our hope and  expectation that it be considered as if  included in the fiscal year 2003 Foreign  Operations report, as originally printed  in the RECORDlast week.  EXHIBIT1  DEMOCRACYOVERSIGHTANDCOORDINATION  The Committee  strongly  supports  programs and activities that advance democracy and freedom abroad, and has included  funding in this Act for specific democracy  programs it believes are important to United  States security interests. The Committee believes that democracy promotion abroad can  be an effective bulwark against terrorism, if  properly established and implemented.  However,  the Committee  remains  concerned with the inconsistent application of  democracy programs by State and USAID,  and the apparent  lack of coordination of  these programs within, and between,  the  agencies. For example, while the Committee  applauds State’s comprehensive review of  Middle East democracy programs, it is perplexed by its lack of leadership and support  for the advancement of democracy in Burma.  In order to address these concerns, the  Committee  recommends  that  State  and  USAID jointly conduct a comprehensive review of democracy programs, and consider  centralizing  oversight  and  coordination  within the Bureau of Democracy, Human  Rights, and Labor. The Committee will review the progress made in this endeavor as it  considers action on the fiscal year 2004 foreign operations appropriations bill.  f  NOMINATION OF GOVERNOR RIDGE  ",2003
47,Senate,108,-0.173,73,2003-01-21,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. President, apparently within the next 24 hours we will  have the opportunity to vote on the  President’s nominee to head our new  Department of Homeland Security. The  President  has made  an  excellent  choice. It is hard for me to imagine a  better choice to undertake this responsibility than Governor Ridge.  Twenty years ago this month, Governor Ridge and I stood with about 80  other  freshmen  Congressmen  and  women at the other end of this building  and raised our right hand and took an  oath of office to defend our Constitution and country. He and I then served  together in the House for the next 10  years and actually helped to lead one  of the Banking Committee subcommittees as ranking Democrat and Republican.  Later we served as Governors in the  neighboring States  of Pennsylvania  and Delaware. Even before we came to  Washington, we served in the Armed  Forces of our country where he served  with real distinction in the U.S. Army  during the Vietnam war.  I will always be especially grateful  for a breakfast Governor Ridge came to  almost 20 years ago. I had just been  elected the at large Congressman from  Delaware and ended the campaign with  a little bit of debt. We decided to have  a fundraising breakfast to help take  care of the debt, and Senator BIDEN,  then the junior Senator from Delaware,  was good enough to come and speak at  our breakfast. We had a whole host of  Democratic colleagues from the House,  new  freshmen who wanted  to  show  their support for their new colleague.  One Republican stopped by that breakfast, and it was the freshman Congressman from Erie, PA.  I will always be grateful for that appearance and for the friendship that  has spanned some 20 years. I will be  pleased to vote with my colleagues and  join, I suspect all of them, in making  him a unanimous choice for Secretary  of the Department of Homeland Security.  While  I believe Governor Ridge  is  more than qualified for the job, the  task he faces is daunting. Congress has  given him a Department that at least  on paper should be able to prevent and  respond to terrorist attacks more effectively than Federal Government and  State governments can today. We have  authorized  the  transfers of  literally  dozens of agencies and tens of thousands of workers. We have outlined a  skeleton organization that should be  able to pull together under one roof information  on  threats  and  vulnerabilities and to use that information to improve security and better  prepare our first responders.  Very little of what we have outlined,  though, will be in place on day 1, and  day 1 is tomorrow for all intents and  purposes. A number  of  outstanding  questions remain. Both  in the Committee on Governmental Affairs where  I serve and on the Senate floor, we  have had a healthy debate over the details of how the transition to a new Department of Homeland Security should  work. I know some of my colleagues  are uncomfortable with what we have.  I have a few concerns of my own.  That being said, I think it is important now that we put aside our disagreements and do what we need to do  to enable this Department to do what  it needs to do, to protect American  lives.  Let me take a few minutes to discuss  a couple of the issues I hope Governor  Ridge will address early on during his  tenure as Secretary of this Department.  First, let me touch on the subject of  rail security. Now that the Transportation Security Administration has for  the most part achieved the goals we set  for them, it is time for them and for  the Department of Homeland Security  to focus on other modes that have received less attention, especially rail.  As I said before, our failure more than  a year after September 11 to act to improve the security of our rail infrastructure is an Achilles’ heel in our Nation’s effort to secure our total transportation system.  In New York City today, hundreds of  thousands of people on their way to  work pass through tunnels that are  badly lit, poorly ventilated, and from  which escape is very difficult. In fact,  there is even a rail tunnel that goes  under the Supreme Court and congressional offices just a couple of hundred  yards from where we are gathered this  evening. Every day thousands of people  pass through that tunnel under this  Capitol on their way to work or to  home.  Passenger safety demands a real investment, but to ask Amtrak to do  more with respect to security without  providing more  resources  is,  in my  view, an unfunded mandate, not a solution. I thank Governor Ridge for understanding the importance of improving  rail security, not just for passenger rail  but for freight rail as well.  I also thank Governor Ridge for acknowledging at our hearing last week  that Amtrak is likely to need some additional financial assistance, if it is expected to make the security enhancements that need to be made.  Let me also touch on the matter of  first responders. States and localities  are in desperate need of additional new  resources to help prepare their police,  their fire, and emergency personnel for  any  future terrorist attacks. At the  same time, most State and local governments  are  suffering  through  extraordinary fiscal crises that are forcing some to raise taxes or cut services.  We see that in Delaware, in Tennessee,  and a host of other States as well.  I am disappointed that the omnibus  appropriations bill on the  floor this  evening and today and again tomorrow  probably does not provide State and localities with  the  level of  first  responder aid that they need. In the future, I hope Governor Ridge, soon to be  Secretary Ridge, and our colleagues in  Congress and the President will heed  the calls from back home for more first  responder aid.  I also hope Governor Ridge works  quickly in the coming weeks to set up  a communications  link between  the  new Department and first responders  so their needs can be heard and information on what they need to do to protect their communities makes its way  down to them.  When  the Committee  on Governmental Affairs  first marked up  the  Homeland Security Act and again when  a modified version of the bill reached  the floor, Senators COLLINSand FEINGOLD and I offered an amendment to  create an office of State and local coordination within the new Department.  That would place a homeland security  liaison office within each State. Our  language, unfortunately, was not  included in the final bill, but I do hope  Governor Ridge will consider setting  up  something  like  what  we  recommended once this new Department  is in place and he and his employees  have gotten their sea legs.

Res. 31) congratulating  the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for winning  Super Bowl XXXVII.  The Clerk read as follows: H. RES. 31 Whereas, on Sunday, January 26, 2003, the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers dominated Super  Bowl XXXVII, defeating the Oakland Raiders  by a score of 48–21;  Whereas the 27-year-old Buccaneers franchise won the National Football League’s  World Championship in their first-ever Super  Bowl appearance;  Whereas coach Jon Gruden,  in his  first  year as head coach of the Buccaneers, led the  team to the pinnacle of success;  Whereas the Buccaneers overcame adversity and defeated the Oakland Raiders, a  team credited with possessing the numberone ranked offense in the National Football  League;  Whereas throughout the season the Buccaneers were led by a number of players,  most notably veterans Warren Sapp, Derrick  Brooks and John Lynch, who banded together to form the number-one ranked defense in the National Football League;  Whereas owner Malcolm Glazer’s unwavering dedication to bringing together the most  talented coaches and players has resulted in  the achievement of the most sought-after  honor  in professional  football:  the Vince  Lombardi trophy;  Whereas the Buccaneers are an  part of the Tampa Bay community;  Whereas the entire Tampa Bay community  is proud of the Buccaneers and their extraordinary season and tremendous accomplishment;  Whereas this championship  is especially  satisfying to the dedicated Buccaneers fans  who have loyally supported the team since  their inception in 1976; a very long journey  that has culminated in a Super Bowl victory  and the recognition that the Buccaneers are  the best football team in the world: Now,  therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives  congratulates  the World Champion  Tampa Bay Buccaneers for their victory in  Super Bowl XXXVII. integral  ",2003
49,House,108,-0.487,2,2003-01-29,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am pleased to join with the gentleman from Florida in consideration  of this resolution, Mr. Speaker. Since  the first professional football game in  the United States took place in 1895 in  the  town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania,  football has become one of America’s  favorite pastimes. As a matter of fact,  it is so popular and so etched in the  minds and hearts of Americans, until  many people stop whatever they are  doing when it comes time for the Super  Bowl.  The  Buccaneers’ magical  season  began at the Magic Kingdom, as the  bucks held training camp at the Disney  Wide World  of Sports Complex.  It  ended on Sunday with the Bucs defeating the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl  XXXVII for the franchise’s first world  championship.  Buccaneers head coach Jon Gruden’s,  masterful coaching throughout the 2002  playoffs paid off in the Super Bowl as  the Bucs always seemed to make the  right call at the right time.  Facing the league’s most potent offense  in  the  first-ever Super Bowl  match-up of the league’s top-rated offense and defense, the Bucs surrendered  just 269 yards, only 78 by the time  Tampa Bay had built a 34–3 lead. The  Bucs controlled the clock for over 37 of  the 60 game minutes.  Joining the 1985 Bears as the only  team in National Football League history  to  lead  the National Football  League  in yards allowed, points allowed and interceptions in the same  season, the Bucs racked up five interceptions and five sacks in stifling the  Raiders’ quarterback Rich Gannon.  The Buccaneers more than deserved  the warm welcome when they returned  home to a packed Raymond James Stadium on Monday night and victory parade through the town on Tuesday.  During the parade, thousands of fans  lined the street and screamed their approval  as  the  players  drove  by  in  convertibles and pickup trucks.  The Bucs were equally grateful. Manager Rich McKay said, ‘‘We have heard  a lot about the Eagles fans and we have  heard a lot about the Raiders fans. We  have heard a lot about all these fans,  but I think we all know who the best  fans in the United States of America  are, and they are the Buccaneers fans.’’ The Bucs and their fans were simply  happy that the Bucs have become the  world champs by a margin of 48 to 21,  no less for the first time in the franchise’s 27-year history.  I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution  introduced  by  the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. DAVIS) honoring the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2003

55,Senate,108,-0.293,37,2003-01-29,Mr. HOLLINGS.," There you are. We  are in a heck of a fix and somewhat  similar, if you please, to the situation  we had with President Clinton.  I will never forget because I was active member and a former chairman of  the Budget Committee. We had a $403.6  billion deficit in 1992. That is the big  reason our distinguished President lost  reelection and lost to that little Governor down  there  in Arkansas. The  President was  running  $403.6 billion  deficits. And they said: Yes, you did  wonderfully well in the gulf war. But  heavens above, you have to get someone to get ahold of it.  We brought the Governor up who balanced budgets. And what did the Governor do? Right after his nomination,  in Little Rock, he invited a group of  the best financial minds down to Little  Rock, sat them all down,  including  Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, and said: I have won now,  but what is for the good of the country,  what are we going to do?  Greenspan told him: Mr. President,  you not only are going to have to cut  spending, you are going to have to increase taxes.  President Clinton went around the  room and asked: Do you all agree with  that, we have to increase taxes? They  said, to a man: That is what we need to  do. We need to cut down these deficits,  cut down this debt, and keep up the  long-term interest rates because we are  not investing in the stock market with  these horrendous interest costs, almost  $1 billion a day—and it is still almost  $1 billion a day.  The first thing the Government does  at 8 o’clock in the morning is go down  to the bank and borrow $1 billion and  add  it  to  the debt—every Saturday  morning, every Sunday morning, and  every Christmas morning. We have got  the debt going up, up, and away. But  the President says: Don’t worry about  debt. It is a time of war.  I cannot agree with him on that.  What happens, in time of war, is we believe  in sacrifice, not  just  for those  who are facing battle. I went back to  the Civil War. I remember they chastised my friend Senator LOTT, and they  all hail the party of Lincoln. I have  heard that now, that chat on the weekend shows—the party of Lincoln. Where  is Abraham when we need him now?  President Lincoln taxed dividends to  pay for the war. Go back and look at  the record. He taxed dividends.  President Bush, instead of inviting  Alan  Greenspan,  invited  Charles  Schwab. He said: Eliminate the tax on  dividends. And we call it a stimulus.  Come on, who is kidding whom around  here? When are we going to sober up  and understand the American people?  If you are in the war, we want to sacrifice and we want to at least pay for  the war.  In World War I, we went up to 77 percent of personal  income tax  for the  highest tax bracket; World War II, up  to 94 percent; the Korean war, 91 percent; Vietnam, 77 percent. We are at  38.6 percent right now.  Instead, in the Afghan, Iraq, and terrorism wars we say: Let’s cut taxes. We  are not going to pay for it.  When we are running a $6.3 trillion  debt and, according to the morning  paper—you can interpret what Mitch  Daniels says—we will be running a $500  billion deficit this year, who wants to  bet? Tell them HOLLINGS is here. September 30 will come around, and we  will add it up, and I will bet your boots  if we get all these things for homeland  security, for AIDS, for health care, prescription drugs, and everything else of  that kind, and put in this tax cut, we  will have a $500 billion deficit. And  they say: Don’t worry about it.  Worse, they try to sell the dividend  tax cut. It is wrong. You tax the income of the corporation, and you tax  the individual when he gets his dividends.  I remember my distinguished friend  from Texas, Phil Gramm. He stood over  there when we were increasing taxes  under President Clinton  in 1993 and  could not get a single Republican vote.  And Senator Gramm looked at me and  said: You are increasing taxes on Social Security; they will be hunting you  Democrats  down  like  dogs  in  the  street.  You ought to look at the record. Now  we pay taxes in order to get the Social  Security trust fund, and then when I  receive the Social Security benefit, I  pay taxes—double tax on Social Security. Nobody mentions the Social Security tax. They all mention dividends  and all the other things for the rich.  And they are trying to say the economy is recovering when the economy is  declining. You can’t go along with this  kind of tax cut here. We tried our best  to stop it, and we will do our best here  when we show that you have taxed like  this before.  I have introduced a value-added tax  of 1 percent. I would like to have 2 percent, but I didn’t want to argue about  the amount. I want to start a value-  added tax to pay for the war. It takes  the IRS one year to really administer  and set it into collection. During that  year’s time,  it could have no effect  whatsoever on the economy. They say  by the next year we will have recovered. That is what they are telling us.  So they can’t give me that argument  that the value added tax will weaken  economy this year if it is passed.  But I have a 1-percent VAT for the  payment for the war—not for increased  spending, not for tax cuts or anything  else, but a tax to pay for the war.  They say their economic initiative is  going to be stimulative. Let me get  right to the point. You are not going to  stimulate anything with  the Democratic or  the Republican  initiative.  President Bush wants a $674 billion tax  cut, plus the interest costs of $300 billion, plus extending and making permanent the tax cut they passed in 2001.  All of this adds up to $4 trillion. I am  looking at  it  the way my market  friends look at it. They say: Heavens  above, this fellow is going to take $5  trillion out of the economy in the next  several years; I am not going to invest.  And we are going to war, and we are  not paying for the war. We are looking  at $500 billion deficits, or more.  I don’t know any better way to stultify this economy and make sure it  doesn’t recover. I never heard of such  things. This is the worst I have ever  seen.  Why do I say it is not going to be a  stimulus? If you just run $426 billion,  that is $35 billion a month. That is the  deficit for just last year. And then October, November, December, January—  you are already up to $167 billion in  deficits. That is $40 billion a month. We  are spending $40 billion a month, and  the President’s stimulus plan of $110  billion is, let’s say, $10 billion a month.  The Democrats’, Senator DASCHLE’s  stimulus plan, is $143 billion, or $12 billion a month. I don’t think $10 billion  or $12 billion a month more is going to  stimulate  this  economy. You know  that, and I know that. But it is buying  the vote and making the mistakes—the  Democrats are—even calling either one  a stimulus.  There is not going to be any stimulus. It is just throwing away fiscal responsibility, running up the debt, and  running up the interest costs. I have  many quotes right here with respect to  where we are as a result of it.  Let me show just exactly where we  are now. For a stimulus, we are going  to have one, whether we like it or not.  If you listen to the President and you  listen to us Democrats, we will agree  with him on homeland security, we will  agree with him on defense, we will  agree with him on health care. It is  just a matter of whatever it is. If you  pay for defense, $20 billion; if you pay  for health care, another $40 billion; if  you pay for the first responders, if you  pay for port security, if you pay for  rail security, if you pay for homeland  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:06 Jan 14, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€3SENATE\S29JA3.REC S29JA3 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2003

59,Senate,108,0.257,86,2003-01-29,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to be joined by Senator BINGAMAN in introducing legislation that declares the United States holds certain  public domain lands in trust for the  Pueblos of San  Ildefonso and Santa  Clara in New Mexico. This body, in the  107th Congress, passed this legislation  by unanimous consent. The House did  not act on it’s companion and so we are  here today to reintroduce the legislation.  In 1988 the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, pursuant to the Federal  Lands Policy and Management Act, declared approximately  4,484 acres  located in the eastern foothills of the  Jemez Mountains in north central New  Mexico,  including portions of Garcia  and Chupadero Canyons, to be  ‘‘disposal property.’’ The Garcia Canyon  surplus lands qualify for disposal partially because the track is an isolated  tract of land almost inaccessible to the  general public. It is bordered on three  sides  by  the  reservations  of Santa  Clara Pueblo and the Pueblo of San  Ildefonso, and by U.S. Forest Service  land on the remaining side. The only  road  access  consists  of unimproved  roads through the two Pueblo’s reservations. These factors have resulted  in minimal or no public usage of the  Garcia Canyon surplus lands in recent  decades.  I understand that currently there are  no resource permits, leases, patents or  claims affecting these lands; nor is it  likely that any significant minerals  exist with the Garcia Canyon transfer  lands. The Garcia Canyon  transfer  lands contain a limited amount of lesser quality forage for livestock and have  not been actively grazed for over a decade. However, the Garcia Canyon surplus  lands  constitute  an  important  part of the ancestral homelands of the  Pueblos  of  Santa  Clara  and  San  Ildefonso.  Santa Clara and San Ildefonso are  two of the Tewa-speaking  federally-  recognized Indian Pueblos of New Mexico. Both Pueblos have occupied and  controlled the areas where they are  presently located many centuries before the arrival of the first Europeans  in the area in the late 16th century.  Their homelands are defined by geographical  landmarks,  cultural  sites,  and other distinct places whose traditional Tewa names and locations have  been known and passed down in each  Pueblo through the generations. Based  upon  these  boundaries,  about  2,000  acres of  the Garcia Canyon  surplus  lands is within the aboriginal domain  of the Pueblo of San Ildefonso. The remaining approximately 2,484 acres are  in Santa Clara’s aboriginal lands.  The Bureau of Land Management  currently seeks to dispose of the Garcia Canyon surplus lands and the Pueblos of Santa Clara and San Ildefonso  seek to obtain these lands. In addition,  the BLM and Interior Department for  years have supported the transfer of  the land to the two Pueblos, provided  the Pueblos agree upon a division of  the Garcia Canyon surplus lands. In response, the two Pueblos signed a formal agreement affirming the boundary  between the respective parcels on December 20, 2000.  The Pueblos of Santa Clara and San  Ildefonso have worked diligently in arriving at this agreement. They have  also worked collaboratively in seeking  community support and garnering supporting resolutions from Los Alamos,  Rio Arriba and Santa Fe Counties, the  National Congress of American Indians  and supporting  letters  from the National Audubon Society’s New Mexico  State Office, the Quivira Coalition and  the Santa Fe Group of the Sierra Club.  This unique situation presents a win-  win opportunity to support more efficient management of public resources  while restoring to tribal control isolated tracts of federal disposal property. Upon  transfer,  the Pueblos of  Santa Clara and San Ildefonso intend  to maintain these lands in their natural state and use them for sustainable  traditional purposes including cultural  resource gathering, hunting and possible livestock grazing. Where appropriate, both tribes are  interested  in  performing work to restore and  improve ecosystem health, particularly to  support habitat for culturally significant animal and plant species. Both  Pueblos have experience Natural Resource  Management  and  Environmental Protection programs and are  capable of managing these  lands  for  both ecologic health and community  benefits.  We want to secure Congressional authorization to transfer control of these  lands to the two Pueblos, with legal  title being held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior for each of the  Pueblos for their respective portions of  the property. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation as they did last  term. I ask unanimous consent that  the text of the bill be printed in the  RECORD.

The Honorable Judge Byron Kinder  retired from his position as Cole County’s circuit court judge on January 1, 2003.  A graduate of the University of Missouri and  Georgetown Law School, Judge Kinder has  been a highly respected judge in Cole County  for thirty years.  Judge Kinder is well known for his sense of  humor, his directness, and his ability to quickly  get at the heart of the problem. Through his  time in office, he has treated all before him  with the same sense of justice and respect.  In 1962, he entered private practice in Cole  County and served as an assistant prosecutor.  In 1965, Judge Kinder was appointed prosecutor by Governor Warren Hearnes, serving  until 1972, when he was elected circuit court  judge.  Mr. Speaker,  I wish Judge Kinder all  the  best as he moves on to the next step in his  life. I know the members of the House will join  me in wishing him well. f  RECOGNIZING  PARTNERSHIP  OF  IDAHO  STATE  UNIVERSITY  ENGLISH  AND  PROFESSIONAL  DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAM  AND  TAIWAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN  AFFAIRS  HON.

This unique program,  the only program of  its kind  in  the United  States, provides a language and cultural education program for junior diplomatic officers in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Over 40 students have completed the program since its  inception  in  the early 1990’s, and many of  these graduates now serve  their country  in  diplomatic postings throughout the world.  The program enables these junior officials to  increase their knowledge of the American political system, enhance  their  language skills,  and gain a greater understanding of U.S. culture. Instead of just learning about America in  textbooks they have the unique opportunity to  experience and participate  in  the American  system by way of local internships and interactions with elected officials. Additionally, they  can experience  Idaho’s natural beauty and  participate in numerous outdoor activities. Not  only does this program benefit these officials,  but it also benefits the students of Idaho State  University who are exposed to a different culture and perspective, broadening  their world  view and understanding.  Recently, I had the opportunity to meet the  current group of junior diplomats studying at  Idaho State University. They are an intelligent,  energetic group who are eager to serve their  country. We had a healthy exchange of ideas  and a good discussion regarding the American  political system and current events in Taiwan.  They are very interested in gaining as much  knowledge and insight as possible during their  stay  in America and  look  forward  to using  what they have learned as they progress in  their diplomatic careers.  I congratulate the 2002– 2003 participants of  this very worthwhile program. Chen Sy-yun,  Fu Yu-min, Huang Chien-tsai, Chin Tsung-kai,  and Hsiao Kuang-wei are very able representatives of their country and I am sure that like  their predecessors they will serve their country  with honor and distinction. I wish them success in all their future endeavors.  This exchange of ideas serves both countries well and reinforces the democratic bond  between the United States and Taiwan. Positive associations such as this strengthen the  tie between our two countries and further reinforce the importance of Taiwan as a trusted  ally.  I am honored to have this program in my  congressional district and  look  forward  to a  continued successful relationship with Taiwan.  I would  like  to  thank  the Honorable C. J.  Chen, Taiwan’s chief  representative  in  the  United States, for his contribution to the close  and  friendly  relationship  between  our  two  countries. I would also like to thank Mr. Anthony Chung Yi Ho, Senior Assistant  to  the  Honorable C. J. Chen, for his expertise and  leadership  in working with my  staff,  and  Michelle Lewis, Director of  the  Idaho State  University English and Professional Development Program, for her dedication and commitment to this unique program.

Fran Wagstaff  joined  the Mid-Peninsula  Housing Coalition in 1983 and since that time  she has become known as the premier person  and leader in affordable housing in the 14th  Congressional  District  of  California  and  throughout our region. With Fran Wagstaff’s  leadership, Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition is  considered  the  ‘gold standard’ for providing  affordable housing  for  the people of San  Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Alameda,  Monterey, Solano, and Contra Costa Counties  in California. Today, thousands of families who  work locally but would otherwise be priced out  of the local housing market have safe, attractive, affordable housing.  Fran Wagstaff has been responsible for the  development of over 80 affordable housing  projects, creating more than 2,500 new affordable housing units. Beyond  the creation of  new housing, under her leadership MPHC has  been able to acquire and rehabilitate another  2,500 units  for  low-income  individuals and  families. Fran Wagstaff and her  team have  also created six  facilities  for homeless  families, ensuring  that everyone has a place  to  live. Her work and her vision helped to create  Shelter Network of San Mateo County, a highly respected nonprofit organization which operates local homeless shelters and programs to  help people end the cycle of homelessness.  She’s also been a leader in the effort to develop a housing  trust  fund  for San Mateo  County.  Before joining MPHC, Fran served as executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, CHIP, a private nonprofit  housing agency  that provides a variety of  housing services to low-income households in  predominantly rural areas. Through her leadership, CHIP was able to help thousands of people find a place to live, whether it was through  the conversion of vacant buildings, the development of cooperatives for low-income families or the rehabilitation of existing homes.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in honoring this great and good woman. Fran  Wagstaff is one of the most exceptional, effective and respected leaders in our community  and  through  her  commitment  and  professionalism, she has made our communities and  our country a better place for all. f  SUPPORTING  EFFORTS  TO  PROMOTE GREATER AWARENESS OF  NEED FOR YOUTH MENTORS AND  INCREASED INVOLVEMENT WITH  YOUTH THROUGH MENTORING  SPEECHOF  HON.

On behalf of the people of Texas’ Congressional District Seven,  I want  to congratulate  and honor Interfaith CarePartners for their incredible accomplishment and for their remarkable service to our community.  Interfaith CarePartners,  founded  in 1985,  has evolved into a national movement of faithbased volunteerism that promotes, sponsors,  and conducts volunteer caregiving and associated activities  in partnership with churches  and synagogues. They are  ‘Houston’s caregiver,’  sponsoring  the nation’s original and  largest  faith-based caregiving program with  1,600  volunteers  in 83  congregations who  serve approximately 1,000 families per year,  and providing 60,000 hours of volunteer service  for  frail adults and children. Volunteers  also  provide  in-home  care  and  caregiver  respites to more than 3,600 Alzheimer’s and  dementia-affected  families,  frail elderly, and  other chronically or  terminally  ill adults, severely  impaired  children,  and  people with  AIDS. Partner congregations span  the  theological spectrum within Protestantism, Roman  Catholicism, and Judaism.  Interfaith CarePartners has earned the gratitude of all the families they have helped and  the admiration of everyone who knows  their  work and the depth of their selfless devotion  to improve the lives of their neighbors. Today,  we honor and thank Interfaith CarePartners for  their extraordinary achievement  in  reaching  one million hours of volunteer community service.  I would  like also  to congratulate Nancy  Reagan, Dr. John McGovern, and Chip Carlisle and Wells Fargo  for receiving  the Sustaining Presence Award, an annual award presented to distinguished individuals and organizations whose  commitments  and  activities  constitute an exemplary contribution  to  the  creation of caring communities. All of you exemplify the best of America. f  INTRODUCTION OF THE  TIONAL  MATERIALS  BILITY ACT  INSTRUCACCESSIHON. THOMAS E. PETRI  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 29, 2003 ",2003
70,,108,0.379,114,2003-01-29,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Instructional Materials Accessibility  Act, which will ensure that, for the first time,  blind students will be able  to  fully enjoy an  equal opportunity to a quality education. This  same bill attracted 88 bipartisan cosponsors in  the 107th Congress, most notably my friend  GEORGEMILLER, the Ranking Member of the  House Committee on Education and the Workforce, who has worked closely with me on  crafting this legislation.  Unfortunately, it is the exception rather than  the rule  that blind students have access  to  textbooks for a given class at the beginning of  the school year. Because of the cumbersome  process needed  to  translate a  textbook  into  Braille or other specialized format, it can take  up to six months for the blind student to have  the same materials as his or her sighted  peers. Only a heroic effort can save this student from being hopelessly behind in class.  This was not much of an issue before the  1960’s. Before that time, most blind children  attended centralized schools for the blind, and  there was (and is) existing infrastructure, such  as the American Printing House for the Blind  in Kentucky, to provide support services such  as production of Braille textbooks. Beginning  in the 1960’s, though, blind children began attending schools  in  their home communities,  and now the vast majority do so. As a result,  every  local school district which has one or  more blind students must obtain or create the  necessary specialized textbooks for these students. However, again this is a laborious process  that  is beyond  the capability of most  school districts to carry out quickly or easily.  Although states already have the obligation  under  the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and other federal statutes to  provide equivalent educational opportunities to  disabled and non-disabled students, it has become  apparent  that  specific  and  practical  standards need to be put in place to anticipate  and meet accessibility needs in this area. The  Instructional Materials Accessibility Act (IMAA)  takes several approaches that, taken together,  will greatly reduce the waiting time for blind  students to receive their textbooks.  This bill establishes a standardized electronic  file  format  for  instructional materials.  Conversion into an electronic format is a necessary step in the process of creating a Braille  version of a textbook. Twenty-six states currently require publishers to provide electronic  copies of textbooks but have no agreed-upon  file format. This drives up costs for publishers  and often results in unusable electronic files  provided. And it does nothing to reduce the  months-long period needed for production of  the specialized textbook. Our bill requires statewide plans to ensure  that students who are blind or visually  impaired have access to instructional materials  in formats they can use at the same time the  materials are provided  to all other students.  Our bill will establish a national clearinghouse  to  provide  ‘one-stop  shopping’ for  local  school districts to acquire the needed materials. In the future, publishers will be able to  submit an electronic copy of a textbook to this  clearinghouse, rather than having to deal with  inconsistent state  requirements. Finally, our  bill authorizes a small capacity-building grant  program to assist state and local educators in  using electronic files supplied by publishers.  This issue has been a bone of contention  between  textbook publishers and  the blind  community for quite a while. However, working  together over a period of many months, both  communities  finally  arrived  at  a mutually  agreeable and practical solution to this problem and  the publishers and  the blind advocates strongly support the IMAA as introduced  in both Houses.  In  the 107th Congress,  the support and  great need  for  this  legislation prompted  the  Department of Education to fund the development of a voluntary standardized electronic  format  for specialized  instructional materials.  Once completed, this standardized file format  would  implement a significant piece of  the  IMAA. However, a standardized file format by  itself will not solve all  the problems which  cause delays in the delivery of textbooks to  visually  impaired students. That  is why  this  legislation is still needed. Once implemented,  the IMAA will make life easier for states, publishers and most of all blind students, at a very  modest cost.

Michael has been very active with his troop,  participating in Scout activities like Camp Geiger. Over the 9 years he has been involved in  Scouting, he has held numerous  leadership  positions, serving as Librarian, Den Chief, Patrol Leader and Junior Assistant Scoutmaster.  Michael also has been honored for his numerous Scouting achievements with the award of  the Warrior in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say Award.  For his Eagle Scout project, Michael constructed picnic tables for the Missouri Department of Conservation for use by the public at  the Poosey Conservation Area  near Chillicothe, Missouri.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  commending Michael Wayne Marriott  for his  accomplishments with  the Boy Scouts  of  America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout. f  INDIA  EXPELS  MISSIONARY  AFTER HE IS SEVERELY BEATEN  BY HINDU RADICALS  HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 7, 2003 ",2003
72,,108,-0.519,5,2003-02-07,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker, I was outraged  to  learn  that a Christian missionary, Joseph  Cooper, an American, was recently expelled  from India. You see, Mr. Cooper came to the  Indian government’s attention after its radical,  violent Hindu nationalist allies beat him so  badly that he spent a week in an Indian hospital. He was expelled  from  the country on  leaving the hospital.  Mr. Cooper was expelled simply for preaching, in another demonstration of the religious  intolerance that characterizes India’s ‘ ‘secular  democracy.’ ’ India has also demonstrated its  secularism and tolerance when states ruled by  the  ruling BJP, such as Gujarat and Tamil  Nadu, enacted  laws prohibiting anyone  from  changing his or her religion, unless the person  is changing to Hinduism. A Cabinet minister  said that everyone who lives in India must either be Hindu or be subservient to Hindus.  The expulsion of Mr. Cooper brings to mind  the disturbing case of Graham Staines, an  Australian missionary who was  burned  to  death along with his  two young sons while  they slept in their jeep. After this murder, Mr.  Staines’s widow was also expelled from India.  A mob set fire to the jeep and chanted ‘ ‘Victory to Hannuman,’ ’ a Hindu god. Since Christmas 1998, nuns have been  raped, priests  have been murdered, churches have been  burned, schools and prayer halls have been  attacked, and other acts of violence against  Christians  have  been  committed.  Over  200,000 Christians in predominantly Christian  Nagaland have been murdered by the Indian  government.  It would be bad enough if Christians were  the only victims of this violent radicalism, Mr.  Speaker, but  they are not. Sikhs, Muslims,  and other minorities are also being victimized  and terrorized. More than 250,000 Sikhs have  been murdered by  the  Indian government  since 1984. Two reports have confirmed that  Indian forces killed 35 Sikhs in the village of  Chithisinghpora in March 2000. Indian forces  were caught red-handed trying to burn down a  Gurdwara (a Sikh place of worship) and some  Sikh homes  in a village  in Kashmir. 52,268  Sikhs are being held as political prisoners, according to a report by the Movement Against  State Repression  (MASR.) Some of  them  have been in this illegal detention since 1984!  I am proud to have been a signer and sponsor  of a letter to President Bush last year asking  him  to help  free  these political prisoners.  In  addition  to over 52,000 Sikhs,  tens of  thousands of other minorities are also being held  as political prisoners, according  to Amnesty  International.  Between 2,000 and 5,000 Muslims were  murdered in Gujarat last spring. According to  Indian newspapers, the police were ordered to  stand aside and do nothing to stop the massacre, in an eerie parallel to the 1984 Delhi  massacre of Sikhs. The Indian press also reported that the Indian government planned the  Gujarat massacre  in advance. Over 85,000  Muslims have been murdered in Kashmir. In  addition,  tens of  thousands of Assamese,  Bodos, Dalits, Manipuris, Tamils, and other  minorities have been killed by the Indian government.  Mr. Speaker, all of these acts have either  been carried out by government forces or by  radical Hindu nationalists who are part of the  umbrella organization  known as  the RSS,  which was formed in support of the Fascists.  The ruling BJP is the political arm of the RSS.  This  is unacceptable. America must  take a  stand. We must work to stop these killings and  attacks and to get all political prisoners freed.  It is time to cut off our aid and trade with India  and we should pass a resolution in support of  self-determination  for  the Sikh homeland of  Punjab, Khalistan, for Kashmir, Nagaland, and  everyone else seeking  freedom  from radical  Hindu repression. The essence of democracy  is the right to self-determination. As the leader  of the democratic world, we must hold India to  these standards of true democracy. Only then  will everyone  in South Asia  live  in  freedom,  dignity, prosperity, and peace.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to place an article  from The Hindu on Mr. Cooper  into  the  RECORDat this time. U.S. MISSIONARYATTACKED  THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, Jan. 14.—A 60-yearold American national and Protestant missionary, Joseph Cooper, was grievously injured when he was attacked by a 10-member  armed gang of suspected RSS activists near  a gospel convention venue at the Koppam  Harijan colony in the Kilimanoor police station limits near here late on Monday night.  Police said that seven other persons, including a preacher and his family accompanying Mr. Cooper, were also injured in the  attack. Mr. Cooper, hailing from New Castle  in the U.S., sustained a deep cut on his right  palm. He is under treatment at a private  hospital here.  Mr. Cooper had come to Kilimanoor to  speak at the Koppam Protestant Convention  organised by  the Puliyam Friends Bible  Church. He and his fellow church members  were waylaid by the armed gang while they  were being escorted back to their vehicles  from the convention venue at around 9:45  p.m., police said.  The assailants first exploded a cracker to  create panic. They detained the missionary  and other preachers for a few minutes before  attacking them with short sticks, swords  and crowbars.  Among those injured are the preacher Benson (37), his wife, Sali Benson, children Joy  and  Judith,  Jayakumar  and  Mercy  Christudas. Police said the attackers  fled  when other church members rushed to the  rescue of Mr. Cooper. The  injured were  rushed to the Medical College Hospital.  In a statement to police, Mr. Benson alleged that the attack was carried out by  local RSS workers led by an autorickshaw  driver. Police have arrested Raju  (34), a  former Kilimanoor RSS functionary.  The  Circle-Inspector  (Kilimanoor),  D.  Rajagopal, said there was no history of communal discord at the Koppam Harijan colony  where about 60 families lived. Some of the  families practised both the Christian and  Hindu faith.  When  contacted,  the SP  (Rural), T.K.  Vinod Kumar, said that police raids were on  to arrest the rest of the accused. RSS and  BJP workers, meanwhile, took out a march  to the Kilimanoor police station demanding  the release of those arrested. When contacted, the RSS Jilla saha karyavah, R.  Santhosh, said that his organisation had  nothing to do with the attack. He alleged  that the speeches made by the U.S. missionary and other preachers at the convention were ‘‘communally inflammatory’’ and  ‘‘insulting  to practitioners of  the Hindu  faith’’ f  EXPRESSING  CONDOLENCES  OF  THE HOUSE TO THE FAMILIES  OF THE CREW OF THE SPACE  SHUTTLE ‘‘COLUMBIA’’ SPEECHOF  HON.

74,Senate,108,0.496,12,2003-02-24,Mr. CORNYN.," The first instance of a  double standard being applied to Mr.  Estrada by those who oppose an up-ordown vote is that, as opponents charge,  Mr. Estrada cannot serve on the D.C.  Circuit Court because he has no judicial experience. Yet the fact is that a  majority of the judges who currently  serve on that court had no prior judicial  experience. That’s  right,  they  never served as a judge before the Senate voted to confirm them to serve in  that important position.  Let’s take one case as an example.  Judge Merrick Garland was nominated  by President Clinton and confirmed by  a Republican-controlled Senate. Like  Mr. Estrada, Judge Garland graduated  from Harvard Law School magna cum  laude, clerked for a prominent judge on  the Second Circuit, and  then  later  clerked for a Supreme Court Justice.  Both Mr. Estrada and Mr. Garland  served  as  assistant U.S.  attorneys.  Both worked at the Department of Justice  in Washington, D.C. Both practiced law in the private sector. Both  enjoyed bipartisan support, and neither  had prior judicial experience. It took  the Senate just a few months to confirm Judge Garland.  Meanwhile, Mr. Estrada has waited 21  months, and still the Democratic leadership will not allow a vote on his confirmation.  But why stop there? If prior judicial  experience were really so important to  serving on a Federal court of appeals,  why did the Senate vote to confirm  Thurgood Marshall to the Second Circuit? Why did the Senate vote to confirm Stephen Breyer to the First Circuit? Why did the Senate vote to confirm Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the DC  Circuit? And why did the Senate confirm John Paul Stevens to the Seventh  Circuit? Indeed, why did the Senate  confirm Anthony Kennedy to the Ninth  Circuit? None of these individuals, all  of whom have subsequently served on  the U.S. Supreme Court, had any prior  judicial service before they were nominated to the circuit courts and confirmed.  Moreover, since the beginning of the  Carter administration in 1977, the Senate has approved 38 nominees to the  Federal courts of appeals who have previously worked at the Justice Department but never held judicial office, exactly like Miguel Estrada.  There is also a double standard being  applied when opponents to calling an  up-or-down vote, advocates and proponents of this obstructionism, claim  that Mr. Estrada cannot be confirmed  until  the Justice Department hands  over  all  confidential  documents he  wrote as an Assistant to the Solicitor  General.  This request would be too laughable  if it was not so transparent and so cynical. First, Mr. Estrada does not even  have control of these memos, and he  has said he does not object if the Justice Department  decides  to  release  them. Second, Senator DASCHLE and  Senator LEAHYknow, were Mr. Estrada  to somehow provide it, that it would  violate ethical rules which benefit the  American people and the entire U.S.  Government,  including  Congress,  whose acts the Department of Justice  is charged with defending and enforcing in court.  Of course, this fishing expedition is  unprecedented  evidence, again, of a  double standard being applied to Mr.  Estrada. Since the beginning of the  Carter administration in 1977, the Senate has confirmed 67 nominees to the  Federal courts of appeals who have previously worked for the Justice Department, including seven who worked as  Deputy Solicitors General, or Assistants to the Solicitor General. Yet in  none of these cases was the nominee required to produce such materials protected by the attorney-client privilege.  In fact, the Justice Department has determined that the Senate did not even  request such materials for a single one  of those 67 nominees.  Again, Mr. Estrada served in the Solicitor General’s Office during the entire first term of the Clinton Administration, from 1993 to 1997.

75,Senate,108,0.239,54,2003-02-24,Mr. VOINOVICH.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to introduce legislation that  will allow States to finally obtain relief from the seemingly endless stream  of  solid waste  that  is  flowing  into  States like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan, Virginia and many others.  My bill, ‘‘the Municipal Solid Waste  Interstate Transportation and Local  Authority Act,’’ gives State and local  governments the tools they need to  limit  garbage  imports  from  other  States and manage their own waste  within their own States.  Ohio receives more than 1.5 million  tons of municipal solid waste annually  from other States and this number has  been increasing regularly. In fact, estimates for 2001 indicate that Ohio imported almost 2 million tons of municipal solid waste, which is almost 600,000  more tons of waste than Ohio imported  in 1997. While I am pleased that these  shipments have been reduced since our  record high of 3.7 million tons in 1989,  I believe it is still entirely too high.  Because it is cheap and because it is  expedient, communities in other States  have  simply  put  their  garbage  on  trains or on trucks and shipped it to be  landfilled in States like Ohio, Indiana,  Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  This is wrong and it has to stop.  Many State and local governments in  importing States have worked hard to  develop strategies to reduce waste and  plan for future disposal needs. As Governor of Ohio, I worked aggressively to  limit shipments of out-of-state waste  into Ohio through voluntary cooperation of Ohio  landfill operators and  agreements with other States. We saw  limited relief. Ohio has no assurance  that our out-of-state waste numbers  won’t rise significantly, particularly in  light of the closure of the Fresh Kills  landfill on Staten Island in 2001. Unfortunately, the Federal courts have prevented States from enacting laws to  protect  our natural  resources  from  being utilized as landfill space. What  has emerged is an unnatural pattern  where Ohio and other States—both importing and exporting—have tried to  take  reasonable  steps  to  encourage  conservation and local disposal, only to  be undermined by a barrage of court  decisions at every turn.  Quite frankly, State and local governments’ hands are tied. Lacking a  specific delegation of authority from  Congress, States that have acted responsibly  to  implement  environmentally sound waste disposal plans  and recycling programs are still being  subjected  to a  flood of out-of-state  waste. In Ohio, this has undermined  our recycling efforts because Ohioans  continue to ask why they should recycle to conserve landfill space when it is  being used for other States’ trash. Our  citizens already have to live with the  consequences of large amounts of outof-state waste—increased noise, traffic,  wear and tear on our roads and litter  that  is  blown  onto  private homes,  schools and businesses.  Ohio and many other States have  taken comprehensive steps to protect  our resources and address a significant  environmental threat. However, excessive, uncontrolled waste disposal from  other States has limited the ability of  Ohioans to protect their environment,  health and safety. I do not believe the  Commerce Clause requires us to service  other States at the expense of our own  citizens’ efforts.  A national solution is long overdue.  When I became Governor of Ohio in  1991, I joined a coalition with other  Midwest Governors—Governor Bayh,  now Senator BAYH, of Indiana, Governor Engler of Michigan and Governor  Casey, and later Governors Ridge and  O’Bannon, of Pennsylvania—to try to  pass effective interstate waste and flow  control legislation.  In  1996, Midwest Governors were  asked by Congress to reach an agreement with Governors Whitman and  Pataki on interstate waste provisions.  Our States quickly came to an agreement with New Jersey—the  second  largest exporting State—on interstate  waste provisions. We began discussions  with New York, but these were put on  hold indefinitely in the wake of their  May, 1996 announcement to close the  Fresh Kills landfill.  The bill that I am introducing today  reflects the agreement that my State,  along with  Indiana, Michigan  and  Pennsylvania, reached with then-Governor Whitman.  For Ohio, the most important aspect  of this bill is the ability for States to  limit future waste flows. For instance,  they would have the option to set a  ‘‘permit cap,’’ which would allow a  State to impose a percentage limit on  the amount of out-of-state waste that a  new facility or expansion of an existing  facility could receive annually. Or, a  State could choose a provision giving  them the authority to deny a permit  for a new facility if it is determined  that there is not a local or in-state regional need for that facility.  These provisions provide assurances  to Ohio and other States that new facilities will not be built primarily for  the purpose of receiving out-of-state  waste. For instance, in 1996, Ohio EPA  had to issue a permit for a landfill that  was bidding to take 5,000 tons of garbage a day—approximately 1.5 million  tons a year—from Canada alone, which  would have doubled the amount of outof-state waste entering Ohio. Thankfully this  landfill  lost the Canadian  bid. Ironically though, the waste company put their plans on hold to build  the facility because there is not enough  need for the facility in the State and  they need to ensure a steady out-ofstate waste flow to make the plan feasible.  In addition, this bill would ensure  that  landfills and  incinerators could  not receive trash  from other States  until local governments approve its receipt. States could also  freeze their  out-of-state waste at 1993 levels, while  some States would be able to reduce  these levels to 65 percent by the year  2008. This bill also allows States to reduce the amount of construction and  demolition debris they receive by 50  percent in 2014 at the earliest.  States also could impose up to a $3per-ton cost recovery surcharge on outof-state waste. This fee would help provide States with the funding necessary  to implement solid waste management  programs.  Unfortunately, efforts to place reasonable  restrictions  on  out-of-state  waste shipments have been perceived  by some as an attempt to ban all outof-state trash. On the contrary, I am  not asking for outright authority for  States  to  prohibit  all  out-of-state  waste, nor am I seeking to prohibit  VerDate Jan 31 2003  02:52 Feb 25, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24FE6.074 S24PT1 ",2003
76,Senate,108,0.508,61,2003-02-24,Mr. ENSIGN.," If enacted,  this  legislation would authorize  the  Forest Products Laboratory of the US  Forest Service to study the effectiveness of silver-based biocides as a wood  preservative treatment. This  legislation was also introduced in the 107th  Congress.  According to silver experts and academics, silver biocides could serve as a  viable, safe and cost effective alternative wood preservative. Given  silver’s long-standing role as an effective  biocide, testing should be undertaken  to determine silver’s suitability as a  wood preservative. Thus, I feel it is important to study and fully explore the  potential of silver as a wood preservative.  Mining has been an important part of  Idaho’s history since the late 1800s. It  became Idaho’s first industry and remains a critical part of Idaho and the  nation’s economy. Mining in Idaho has  supplied the nation with minerals necessary  for  today’s modern  lifestyle  which many of us take for granted. In  1985,  the mines  of  Idaho’s  Coeur  d’Alene mining district produced their  one billionth ounce of silver. The Sunshine Mine was America’s richest silver  mine,  producing  over  300 million  ounces of silver, more than the entire  output of Nevada’s famous Comstock  Lode. Silver contributes to our quality  of life in many ways, and its use as a  biocide in wood products is an important application that must be explored.  I look forward to working with my  colleagues  to  pass  legislation  that  would create a comprehensive research  program to test the viability of silverbased biocides  for  the  treatment of  wood products.

79,Senate,108,-0.277,12,2003-03-07,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Cities in Alaska are  having to cope with mosquitoes where  they once did not exist. Hunters are  being  trapped  on  break-away  ice.  Houses are sinking due to slouching  and buckling permafrost.  Mean temperatures in Alaska have  risen by five degrees since the 1970s.  That  is an extremely rapid rate of  change, and  I am afraid Alaska  is  somewhat of a testing ground for what  is yet to come around the globe.  These are just some of the environmental and economic consequences of  global warming that may affect our  country and our people. My colleagues  can imagine the potential harm that  less developed economies will face.  I have spoken now  in some detail  about the ways in which our serious air  pollution and global warming problems  threaten  public  and  environmental  health, as well as economic prosperity.  I have shown how millions of people  suffer the ill effects of particulate pollution and mercury contamination. I  have explained how acid rain continues  to strip our beautiful forests of vegetation, leach nutrients out of our oncerich soils, and suffocates many of our  lakes and streams.  It is time now to take a look at what  our administration is doing to relieve  Americans from these costly burdens.  Over the  last  few months,  I have  joined my colleagues from both sides of  the aisle to speak out in defense of a  vital Clean Air Act program called New  Source Review, or NSR. NSR plays a  crucial role in ridding our air of some  of industry’s most harmful air emissions, and it results in hundreds of millions of dollars in health-related benefits.  However, the administration has chosen to ignore public health concerns  and side with industry. These new NSR  rules will make it much easier for polluters to send even more poison into  our air.  The administration tells us not to  worry about these so-called NSR ‘‘reforms’’—that any holes left in clean air  protections will be patched up by another proposal that was reintroduced  in Congress  last week, called Clear  Skies. I am afraid Clear Skies will not  provide such a safety net.  In fact, a look at the fine print shows  that Clear Skies actually provides less  protection—less  protection—than  existing law. More importantly, it will  not do enough to address this country’s  already significant air pollution problem.  Unlike the new NSR changes, which  affect all major sources of air pollution, Clear Skies only addresses some  of the air pollution coming from one  source—powerplants. So purging broad  NSR protections while promoting a  narrower proposal doesn’t make any  sense.  Plus, Clear Skies will eliminate important Clean Air Act programs that  protect local air quality, not supplement them. For utilities, Clear Skies  will strip the Clean Air Act of the Mercury Air Toxics Rule and the Regional  Haze Rule.  And, while the administration’s new  NSR rule could allow 50 percent of all  sources to avoid environmental review,  Clear Skies will give powerplants even  greater exemptions.  Clear Skies will also degrade  the  ability of States to pursue interstate  air pollution problems, and will prevent evolution of tougher New Source  Performance Standards.  As you can see from this chart beside  me, the true result of Clear Skies will  be less protection and more pollution  than business as usual.  In the chart, blue, gray, and red bars  represent the so-called Clear Skies reduction plan for sulfur, nitrogen, and  mercury emissions, respectively. But  take a look at the yellow bars. These  yellow bars represent where we would  already be headed with full and faithful  implementation of the present, existing Clean Air Act. We are not even  doing that under this administration.  In other words, the administration’s  plan allows more pollution. It is a serious weakening of current programs. In  fact, Clear Skies will result in hundreds of thousands of tons more emissions than full implementation of these  and other Clean Air Act programs.  According to EPA’s own estimates,  by the year 2010—Clear Skies would  allow 125 percent more sulfur dioxide,  60 percent more nitrogen oxides, and  420  percent—420  percent—more mercury pollution  than  enforcement of  current law. Total carbon dioxide emissions would continue to grow by leaps  and bounds, despite  the administration’s goal of reduced emission intensity.  I ask my colleagues to be wary of the  administration’s proclamations about  the benefits of Clear Skies. While they  tout reductions of 70 percent for sulfur,  nitrogen, and mercury emissions, they  are actually using outdated information to arrive at these numbers. Real  reductions in 2010 from the year 2000  would be only 60 percent for SOXand  NOX, and 46 percent for mercury.  Clear Skies will also push compliance  deadlines out further into the future  VerDate Jan 31 2003  02:16 Mar 08, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A07MR6.008 S07PT1 ",2003
80,,108,-0.658,40,2003-03-07,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to introduce the Medical Malpractice Insurance  and Litigation Reform Act of 2003. This legislation  responds  to  the  real problems  in  the  medical malpractice insurance market—namely, higher prices driven by lack of competition  and investment losses by insurers leading to a  boom bust cycle. To respond to these problems, Title I of the bill insures that the antitrust  laws apply  to medical malpractice  insurers,  price comparisons can be easily obtained, and  procedural checks are in place to insure that  premium increases are warranted and can be  challenged by health care providers.  Above and beyond these requirements, the  bill  responds  to concerns  that medical malpractice is not available in parts of the country.  As a result, Title  II would create a Federal  medical malpractice  insurance  association,  housed within the Department of Health and  Human Services,  to provide medical malpractice insurance where it is not available at  reasonable terms.  In addition,  the bill responds  to  the complaint that medical malpractice insurance premiums are being driven higher as a result of  frivolous complaints. Title  III of  the bill provides for a series of measures designed to insure that the lawsuit itself is not frivolous and  that the pleadings filed in connection with the  suit are accurate and meritorious. Title III also  provides for alternative dispute resolution designed  to encourage  resolution of medical  malpractice actions outside of court. The following  is a more detailed description of  the  legislation.  SECTION-BY-SECTIONANALYSISMEDICALMALPRACTICE INSURANCE ANDLITIGATIONREFORMACT  TITLEI—MEDICALMALPRACTICEINSURANCE  REFORM  This Title constitutes an effort to respond  to some of the flaws apparent in the medical  malpractice insurance marketplace and the  regulation of  that market. Among other  things, the title insures that the antitrust  laws apply to medical malpractice insurers,  price comparisons can be easily obtained,  and procedural checks are in place to insure  that premium increases are warranted.  Section 101. Prohibition on Anticompetitive Activities by Medical Malpractice Insurers. Repeals McCarran-Ferguson to ensure  that insurers don’t engage in price fixing.  The Act, enacted in 1945, exempts from the  Federal antitrust laws all anticompetitive  insurance  industry  practices  except  boycotts. Over the years, uneven oversight of  the insurance industry by the States, coupled with no possibility of Federal antitrust  enforcement, has created an environment  that fosters a wide range of anticompetitive  practices.  Section 102. Medical Malpractice Insurance  Price Comparison. Creates an Internet site  at which health care providers could obtain  the price charged for the type of coverage  the provider seeks from any malpractice insurer licensed in the doctor’s state. This section specifies the availability of online forms  and that all information will remain confidential.  Section 103. Procedural Requirements for  Medical Malpractice Insurers’ Proposed Rate  Increases. Gives doctors  standing  in any  state administrative proceeding to challenge  proposed rate increases and requires insurance companies to provide justification for  any rate increase prior to implementing such  increase. Only a handful of states (Alabama,  Arizona, Illinois, New York, Oklahoma, and  possibly a few others) require that rates be  filed and approved by the state insurance department before they can be used.  TITLEII—FEDERALMEDICALMALPRACTICE  INSURANCEASSOCIATION  There have been isolated reports that physicians are unable to obtain medical malpractice insurance at any rate and this title  is designed to deal with that problem by providing a federal backstop. The title also provides for disclosure of information by private  insurers so that more information can be obtained on the reasons for any problems in  the malpractice insurance marketplace.  Section 201. Establishment; Purpose. Establishes an Association within the Department of Health and Human Services to provide medical malpractice insurance where it  is not available at reasonable terms.  Section 202. Board of Directors. Creates a  board of directors for the Association. The  board has authority to run the Association  and to act like a governing body of a private  insurance carrier. This section sets out specifics as to the number of appointments, eligibility, and vacancies.  Section 203. Administration. An administrator is appointed to act as the Association’s chief executive officer, in charge of  day-to-day operations and management of  the Association. The Association shall be  fully operational no later than 180 days after  the date of enactment of the Act.  Section 204. Rates. Gives the board authority to establish rates to be charged by the  Association. The board will use an actuary  to recommend rates, and rates shall be set at  amounts sufficient, when invested, to carry  all claims to maturity, meet reasonable expenses of conducting the business of the Association and maintain reasonable surplus.  The insurance program shall be neither more  nor less than self-supporting. The Association is authorized to purchase reinsurance.  Section 205. Investment Policy. Provides  that the board of directors shall formulate  and adopt an investment policy and supervise  investment activities of the Association. Gives the Association the ability to retain independent investment counsel and requires the board to periodically review and  appraise the investment strategy.  Section  206. Medical Malpractice Risk  Management Program. Requires the administrator to develop a risk management program  for all policyholders and to solicit  input from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  in developing  the  program. Insurance may be refused or terminated if any insured disregards the plan and  the administrator may consider compliance  with the plan in determining premiums of  the insured.  Section 207. Seed Money to be Funded by  Treasury Department Loan. Provides for the  funding of the Association by the Secretary  of Treasury through one or more 5 year term  loans in an amount not to exceed $100,000,000  for start-up funding.  Section 208. Disclosure of Data by Medical  Malpractice Insurers. This section requires  each insurance provider to file a copy of its  annual statement with the Chairperson of  the Association. The insurer shall also provide information regarding (1) closed claims;  (2) verdicts, payment, and severity of injury  in connection with verdicts; (3) rate changes;  (4) premiums and  losses by medical speciality; (5) premiums and losses by experience of the insured; (6) performance of the  investments of the insurer.  Section 209. Annual Report by Chairperson.  Requires the Chairperson to file an annual  report with the President and Congress that  includes: (1) a statement of the Association’s  accounts, funds, and securities; (2) copies of  reports required by the National Association  of Insurance Carriers; (3) any requests for additional loans; (4) an assessment of the medical malpractice insurance marketplace; (5)  an assessment as to why health care providers have been unable to obtain insurance  at reasonable prices; and (6) a report summarizing the information disclosed pursuant to  Section 208 and attaching the disclosed information.  Section 210. Financial Matters. Requires  the administrator to submit to the board an  estimated budget of the expenses of administering the Association. If assets exceed liabilities, necessary reserves and reasonable  surplus, the Association shall declare a cash  dividend or allow a credit to any health care  provider that has complied with the risk  management program.

Over the past year, Sonja has received wide  acclaim  and  numerous  awards  from Poetry.com, which  first published her work, as  well as the International Society of Poetry and  Symposiums. Sonja was one of only  thirty  poets in the world invited to present her work  to the ISPS spring convention in 2002. Now,  Sonja’s work has earned one of  thirty-five  nominations for the society’s grand prize, presented by Pulitzer Prize winning poet W.D.  Snodgrass.  Sonja, a promising writer as a  teenager,  gave up opportunities  in creative writing  to  stay close  to home and eventually  raise a  family. She found her voice again at the age  of thirty-one when she began writing poetry on  a bet with her nine-year-old son. After years of  apprehension and reservations about her writing, Sonja has decided to become a poet.  Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to recognize Sonja Maria Montano before this body of  Congress and this nation for her courage and  creativity in pursuing her dreams. I wish her  every success in her new career. f  DARIEN’S 2003 CITIZEN OF THE  YEAR  HON. JUDY BIGGERT  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 6, 2003 ",2003

The City of Darien lies within Illinois’ 13th  Congressional District. Because of  residents  like Father Quinn, Darien easily lives up to its  motto— ‘a nice place to live.’ ’  If you happen  to  find yourself  in Darien,  there is a good chance that you will hear Father Quinn ’s name mentioned, not only by  members of his church community, but also  among the many other residents of Darien. He  seeks out anyone who can use a helping hand  or a  friend. He  is especially valued  for his  work with  teenagers, single parents and  the  sick and dying. Regularly visiting hospitals, he  works to lift the human spirit or offer a willing  ear.  Father Gavin is best described by one of his  fellow citizens, who said: ‘ ‘He is an extraordinary man who knows how to identify people  in need and find a way of ministering to them.  Father Gavin  is a very compassionate man  who reaches out to people of all faiths and in  all walks of life. In short, I can think of no one  who has made Darien a better place to live  than Father Gavin Quinn.’ ’  I could not agree more. Father Quinn is the  kind of person who  transforms a city  into a  community. Congratulations  to Father Gavin  Quinn, Darien’s 2003 Citizen of the Year. f  RECOGNIZING NATIONAL PEACE  CORPS DAY  HON.

84,,108,-0.353,47,2003-03-07,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, last  Friday, February 28th, we celebrated National  Peace Corps Day,  honoring  the  168,000  Americans who have served as volunteers  since the creation of the Peace Corps in 1961.  These amazing men and women have served  our nation in 136 countries. Peace Corps volunteers have made enormous contributions in  the areas of agriculture, business development, education, health, and the environment,  and in so doing have improved the lives of individuals and communities around the world.  The Peace Corps has become an enduring  symbol of out nation’s commitment to encourage progress and create opportunity in the developing world.  My own background as an educator and director at Outward Bound  for  twenty years  taught me about  the  importance of national  and community service. But I also have strong  connections to the Peace Corps through my  great state of Colorado and through my family.  Colorado has one of the highest levels of recruitment of Peace Corps volunteers nationwide, and returned Peace Corps Volunteers in  the 2nd Congressional District alone number  over  500. Of  course,  the most  important  Peace Corps connection for me is my mother,  who served as a volunteer in Nepal decades  ago.  Because of these connections I have a special  interest  in advancing  the ability of  the  Peace Corps to play an important role in these  new times. I believe we must work to continue  to promote world peace and friendship through  the people-to-people approach of  the Peace  Corps. That ’s why I worked with my colleague  Rep. SAMFARR in the last Congress to introduce  legislation known as  the Peace Corps  Charter for the 21st Century Act. We have reintroduced the bill again in this Congress as  H.R. 250.  The ‘ ‘Peace Corps Charter ’ ’ strengthens the  Peace Corps in a number of ways. It restates  and  further promotes  its goals—to provide  technical assistance to those in need around  the world, to promote better understanding of  Americans on the part of the peoples served,  and to bring the world home to America. It authorizes funding to allow for a Peace Corps  expansion to 15,000 volunteers in five years.  It  reaffirms  the  independence of  the Peace  Corps. It authorizes a number of reports, such  as one on host country security. It spells out  a commitment  to  recruit and place Peace  Corps  volunteers  in  countries where  they  could help promote mutual understanding, particularly in areas with substantial Muslim populations.  It establishes  training programs  for  Peace Corps volunteers in the areas of education, prevention, and treatment of infectious  diseases, such as HIV/AIDS.  It streamlines  and empowers  the Peace Corps Advisory  Council, with an added focus of making use of  the expertise of Returned Peace Corps Volunteers. Finally, the bill creates a grant program  to enable Returned Peace Corps Volunteers  to use their experience and expertise to continue  to carry out  the goals of  the Peace  Corps through specific projects.  The Peace Corps  is one of  the most admired and successful  initiatives ever put  in  place. I ’m proud that the following young people  from  the 2nd Congressional District are  presently serving  in countries all over  the  world: Vanessa Adams, Ben Armitage, Shaun  Cosgrove, Amy Ellerman, Thomas Fleming,  Megan Haldy, Rebecca Knerl, Lydia Labelle,  Lynell Lacey, Benjamin Liu, Erica Manteuffel,  Kelly  Oberg,  Stephanie  Ogden,  Kelly  O’Rourke,  Johanna Patrick, Matthew Rice,  Kathleen Shannon, Mary Simonson, and Robert Sweetman.  A pebble tossed into a still pond creates ripples that begin small and grow larger. Peace  Corps volunteers have had this same effect on  the people  they have  touched. The Peace  Corps experience exemplifies how individuals  can make a tremendous difference in the lives  and perceptions of people in developing countries as well as people right here at home.

85,,108,-0.25,54,2003-03-07,Mr. SANDLIN.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  today to introduce legislation that actually addresses the skyrocketing medical malpractice  insurance premiums of such concern to physicians and other health  care providers all  across our Nation.  The ‘ ‘Medical Liability Insurance Crisis Response Act of 2003’ ’ takes significant steps directly to address the insurance premium crisis  that plagues what  is otherwise  the  finest  health care system in the world.  First, the bill proposes a partial repeal of the  McCarran-Ferguson Act  to  limit  the antitrust  exemption currently covering the medical malpractice insurance industry.  Second, the bill addresses the current economic strain faced by many health care providers by requiring the prompt payment of undisputed claims by health  insurance carriers  and penalizing those carriers who fail to comply.  Third, the bill authorizes the creation of a  National Nurse Service Corps Scholarship  Program to address our health care system’s  dire nursing shortage.  It  takes steps  to  improve recruitment, retention and education of  our Nation’s nurses.  Fourth,  the  bill  proposes medical malpractice liability reform by requiring mandatory  mediation of all malpractice claims before trial,  by taking steps to prevent the filing of frivolous  medical malpractice claims through the imposition of sanctions and other measures, and  by  requiring  that plaintiffs  in medical malpractice  litigation  to  file an affidavit of merit  prior to the commencement of any litigation.  Fifth, the bill directly addresses the medical  malpractice  insurance problems  confronting  our Nation’s health care providers. It creates  an Advisory Commission on Medical Malpractice to conduct an examination of current  problems and, within one year, to provide to  the Congress specific  legislative and  regulatory recommendations to solve the problem.  It  further  freezes medical malpractice  insurance rates during the period of the Commission’s study. The bill provides significant disincentives  to medical malpractice  insurance  carriers to address the current problems of industry exodus and renewability of coverage. It  requires medical malpractice  insurance carriers to offer coverage to any physician with  no medical malpractice claims during the previous three years and imposes significant disclosure obligations on carriers to allow more  informed monitoring of  the  industry with  the  goal of averting similar crises in the future. In  addition, it limits the ability of carriers to raise  malpractice  insurance  premiums without  a  clear demonstration of business necessity.  Sixth, the bill expresses the sense of Congress  that states should consider additional  and alternative methods  to address medical  malpractice insurance rates.  Finally,  the bill provides  tax  incentives  to  physicians who practice in high-risk specialties  or medically underserved areas to encourage  them  to maintain  their current practices and  provide  improved  access  to  our Nation’s  health care system. THE  COMMERCIAL TRUCK HIGHWAY  SAFETY DEMONSTRATION  PROGRAM ACT OF 2003 HON. MICHAEL H. MICHAUD  OFMAINE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 6, 2003 ",2003
86,,108,-0.283,54,2003-03-07,Mr. MICHAUD.," Mr. Speaker,  today, along  with my good friend TOMALLEN, I am introducing the Commercial Truck Highway Safety  Demonstration Program Act of 2003. This bill  would allow Maine to increase the weight limits for trucks on interstate highways, by granting a  three-year waiver of  federal  rules.  It  mandates a study process that will help demonstrate  the positive safety effects of  these  changes, and permit  the waiver  to be extended pending these safety determinations.  This bill is important both for public safety  and economic reasons. The administration of  the current 80,000 pound federal weight limit  law in Maine has forced heavy tractor-trailer  and  tractor-semitrailer combination vehicles,  traveling  into Maine  from neighboring States  and Canada,  to divert onto small State and  local roads where higher vehicle weight limits  apply under Maine law.  The diversion of those vehicles onto such  roads causes significant economic hardships  and safety challenges for small communities  located along  those roads. Permitting heavy  commercial vehicles  to  travel on  Interstate  System highways  in Maine would enhance  public safety by reducing the number of heavy  vehicles that use town and city streets, and as  a result, the number of dangerous interactions  between those heavy vehicles and other vehicles such as school buses and private cars.  It would also reduce the net highway maintenance costs in Maine because the Interstate  System highways, unlike the secondary roads  of Maine, are built to accommodate heavy vehicles and are, therefore, more durable.  Finally, this bill would ensure that Maine can  remain competitive  in  the  transportation and  manufacturing sectors, and that our neighbors  do not pass us by  in development. This  change is fair, and will promote parity in transportation throughout New England.  I urge my colleagues  to support  this bill,  which will enhance safety, lower maintenance  costs, and promote economic development. f  HONORING RIDGEWOOD BAPTIST  CHURCH IN JOLIET, ILLINOIS  HON.

The Ridgewood Baptist Church is celebrating  its 100th anniversary on March 9,  2003.  In 1888, Mr. William Rix, Mr. Hartwell, and  Reverend J. W. Conley started Sunday School  meetings that were held in various homes. In  1891, an unsightly building formerly used as a  pest house was cleaned and renovated.

Mr. Speaker,  I have  only  served  under the distinguished chairmanship  of Chairman DREIER, but I am always  pleased that in each rule that we make  there is always a recommit. Looking  back at history, one of the people that  I think was a distinguished chairman  of the Committee on Rules, Joe Moakley, I am not sure he always had a recommit in the legislation. I am not  sure that former Speaker Tip O’Neill  when he was a member of the Committee on Rules always voted  that  there would be a recommit. But I do  believe that there has been a recommit  in here. More importantly, I think it is  important  that  this  legislation was  thoroughly vetted in two committees,  the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on the Judiciary, and even passed by voice vote in  the Committee on the Judiciary. Just  weeks ago these same committees once  again  took  testimony  and  the  bill  passed through the Committee on Energy and Commerce by voice vote. b1045  The Committee on Rules last night  took testimony for over 2 hours and  reasonably provided 2 hours of general  debate, in addition to the standard motion to recommit, and I believe we will  have a full hour on this rule today.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman  from  Kentucky  (Mr.  FLETCHER). The gentleman, a doctor, is  an expert in this legislation.  ",2003

92,House,108,-0.658,13,2003-03-13,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, there is one  word that best describes this closed rule: cowardly. This  is a Republican  leadership  that  fears a real debate on this cold hearted proposal that would rob victims of medical malpractice. They fear that too many of their own  Members would vote for a democratic bill because it makes sense and would address the  problem.  They have decided to dodge a clean vote  on a real bill and bury real debate in procedural doubletalk. They have decided  to  let  their Members  hide  behind  parliamentary  tricks.  The Republican  leadership has shredded  any semblance of  fairness or open debate.  Just  last year,  for  the  first  time since 1910,  this Republican leadership denied the Minority  party a motion  to recommit. Today,  the  two  most senior members of the House of Representatives, who are also  the  two Ranking  Democrats on the Committees of jurisdiction,  are being denied the opportunity to offer the  amendment of their choosing.  The Republican  leadership’s  bill  doesn’t  solve the problem of medical malpractice insurance rates skyrocketing.  It has no  insurance  reform at all. Doctors who are being  price gouged by insurance companies will not  see one cent of savings from this bill.  The simple fact is that draconian caps on  damages do not reduce insurance premiums.  In a comparison of states that enacted severe  tort  restrictions  in  the mid-1980s and  those  that resisted enacting any tort reform, no correlation was found between tort reform and insurance rates.  Our bill takes away the antitrust exemption  for medical malpractice  insurance providers  that has allowed those providers to collude to  jack up rates for doctors.  The Republican leadership’s bill does nothing about the deadly problem of medical malpractice that costs victims literally their life and  limb. Between 44,000 and 98,000 people die  each year because of medical negligence in  hospitals and the Republican answer is to take  away the rights of surviving family members  and accountability for bad apple health care  providers.  H.R. 5 does nothing about the fact that 5%  of all doctors are responsible for 54% of malpractice claims paid. H.R. 5 does nothing to  solve the problem that medical malpractice is  the fifth leading cause of death in the country.  Our  bill  preserves  accountability  in  the  health care system.  The Republican leadership’s bill does nothing about frivolous lawsuits, only hurts victims.  All this bill does is take away compensation  from  the most  seriously  injured  plaintiffs.  These are the victims who have a case that  has so much merit that a jury of their peers  decides they deserve more than $250,000 in  non-economic damages.  Our bill requires an attorney to file a certificate of merit  that an action  is not  frivolous  and,  if  that certificate  is  false,  that attorney  can be disbarred.  The Republican bill takes a chain saw to the  health care system instead of a scalpel. It is  no wonder they fear a fair and honest debate  and a clean vote.  I urge Members to:  (1) Vote ‘ ‘no’ ’ on the Previous Question so  that we can make in order a vote on ConyersDingell and other worthy Democratic amendments.  (2) If we are not successful in defeating the  previous question,  vote  ‘no ’ ’ on  this one  sided, anti-democratic rule. The material previously referred to  by Mr. HASTINGSof Florida is as follows: FORH. RES. 139—MEDPREVIOUSQUESTION ICALMALPRACTICE: H.R. 5—HELPEFFICIENT  ACCESSIBLE,  TIMELY  LOW-COST,  HEALTHCARE(HEALTH) ACTOF2003 In the resolution strike ‘‘and (2)’’ and insert the following:  ‘‘(2) an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of H.R. 1219 if  offered by Representative Conyers or a designee, which shall be in order without intervention of any point of order, shall be considered as read, and shall be separately debatable for 60 minutes equally divided and  controlled by the proponent and an opponent; and (3)’’ CONYERS/DINGELLDEMOCRATICSUBSTITUTE— H.R. 1219, ‘‘THEMEDICALMALPRACTICEAND  INSURANCEREFORMACTOF2003’’ SECTION-BY-SECTIONANALYSIS  Scope. The  legislation narrowly defines  ‘‘medical malpractice action’’ to cover ‘‘licensed physicians and health professionals’’  for  only  cases  involving medical malpractice. These definitions are intended to  include doctors, hospitals, nurses, and other  health professionals who pay medical malpractice insurance premiums. See, sec. 107(8).  Title I—Reducing frivolous lawsuits  SEC. 101.—Statute of Limitations. This section limits the amount of time during which  a patient can file a medical malpractice action to the later of three years from the date  of injury or three years from the date the patient discovers (or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered) the injury. Children under the age of 18 have the  later of three years from their eighteenth  birthday or three years from the date the patient discovers (or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered) the injury.  SEC. 102.—Health Care Specialist Affidavit.  This section requires an affidavit by a qualified  specialist  before  any medical malpractice action may be filed. A ‘‘Qualified  Specialist’’ is a health care professional with  knowledge of the relevant facts of the case,  expertise in the specific area of practice, and  board certification in a specialty relating to  the area of practice.  SEC. 103.—Mandatory Sanctions for Frivolous Actions and Pleadings. This section requires all plaintiff attorneys who file a medical malpractice action to certify that the  case  is meritorious. Attorneys who erroneously file such a certificate are subject to  strict civil penalties. For first time violators, the court shall require the attorney to  pay costs and attorneys fees or administer  other appropriate sanctions. For second time  violators, the court shall also require the attorney to pay a monetary fine. For third  time violators, the court shall also refer the  attorney to the appropriate State bar association for disciplinary proceedings.  SEC. 104.—Mandatory Mediation. This section establishes an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system for medical malpractice  cases. Participation in mediation shall be in  lieu of any other ADR method required by  law or by contractual arrangements by the  parties. A similar approach is recommended  by the Committee  for Economic Development (CED), which suggests that defendants  make and victims accept ‘‘early offers.’’ The  effect of the ‘‘early offer’’ program, according to the CED, is that defendants will reduce the likelihood of incurring litigation  costs, and victims would obtain fair compensation without  the delay,  expense or  trauma of litigation.  SEC. 105.—Punitive Damages. This section  limits  the  circumstances under which a  claimant can seek punitive damages  in a  medical malpractice action. It also allocates  50 percent of any punitive damages that are  awarded to a Patient Safety Fund managed  by HHS. HHS will administer the Patient  Safety  Fund  through  the  Agency  for  Healthcare Research and Quality. The Secretary will promulgate regulations that will  establish programs and procedures to carry  out this objective. See also, Sec. 221–223.  SEC. 106.—Reduction  in Premiums. This  section requires medical malpractice insurance companies to annually project the savings that will result from Title II of the bill.  Insurance companies must then develop and  implement a plan to annually dedicate at  least 50 percent of those savings to reduce  the insurance premiums that medical professionals pay. Insurance companies must report these activities to HHS annually. The  section provides for civil penalties for the  non-compliance of insurance companies.  Title II—Medical malpractice insurance reform  SEC. 201.—Prohibition on Anti-competitive  Activities by Medical Malpractice Insurers.  This  section would  repeal McCarran-Ferguson Act to ensure that insurers do not engage in price fixing. The Act, enacted in 1945,  exempts all anti-competitive insurance industry practices, except boycotts, from the  Federal antitrust laws. Over the years, uneven oversight of the insurance industry by  the States, coupled with no possibility of  Federal antitrust enforcement, have created  an environment that fosters a wide range of  anti-competitive practices.  SEC. 202.—Medical Malpractice Insurance  Price Comparison. This section creates an  internet site at which health care providers  could obtain the price charged for the type of  coverage the provider seeks from any malpractice  insurer  licensed  in  the doctor’s  state. This section specifies the availability  of online forms and that all information will  remain confidential.  Title  III—Enhancing patient access  through direct assistance  SEC. 301.—Grants and Contracts Regarding  Health Provider Shortages. This section authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human  Services (HHS) to award grants or contracts  through the Health Resources and Services  Administration (HRSA) to geographic areas  that have a shortage of one or more types of  health care providers as a result of dramatic  increases  in malpractice  insurance  premiums.  SEC. 302.—Health Professional Assignments  to Trauma Centers. This section amends the  Public Health Service Act to authorize the  Secretary to send physicians from the National Health Service Corps to trauma centers that are in danger of closing (or losing  care  to  VerDate Dec 13 2002  01:22 Mar 14, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K13MR7.026 H13PT1 ‘ ",2003

Mr. Speaker, I read section 12 of this  legislation and  it  says  that  this  is  going to go into effect on the enactment of this bill, it becomes law. There  is no grant program to help health care  professionals. There is no end of frivolous lawsuits that has been discussed  anywhere in this legislation. There is  no attempt to pass on the savings to  the very doctors who you have conned  into  believing  that  their  rates  are  going to go down.  The insurance industry has said time  and time again, not to the doctors,  that there is no guarantee that the premiums will go down if this is enacted.  And what you are going to do to us in  New Jersey and 10 other States where  we have strong legislation dealing with  HMOs  that  rule  the  roost, you are  going to let them all off the hook and  you are going to protect bad doctors,  bad hospitals and you are certainly  going to protect bad insurance companies. And I say to you, you have created a great injustice here by putting  forth this legislation without even allowing us to consider trying to solve  the problem. Our bill does that.  ",2003
95,House,108,0.274,27,2003-03-13,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  distinguished chairman for yielding me  time and will answer my colleague that  you cannot con doctors into anything.  Doctors are not only trained professionals who  can  diagnosis what  is  wrong with you,  they can diagnose  what is wrong with our country.  I rise in support of H.R. 5. Without  this bill health care in my State of Illinois will change for the worse. I am  standing here representing Dr. Gina  Wehrmann, who after paying her malpractice bill made less than the office  manager in her practice and is now a  pharmacist at Walgreens. I also stand  with Dr. Scott Hansfield, head of obstetrics at Highland Park Hospital,  who recently notified 2,500 of my constituents that he is leaving the practice of medicine and moving to a tort  reform State.  The AMA has just put Illinois on the  crisis list of liability watch for their  practice. And in testimony before the  Committee  on  Small Business, we  learned  that  85  percent  of  neurosurgeons have been sued in my State.  Asked if this is too many, the plaintiffs’ association said, no, 85 percent of  neurosurgeons in Illinois were bad doctors.  I am worried about the plaintiffs’ bar  and its unintended war on women, forcing OB/GYNs out of my State of Illinois.  This is needed legislation. We need to  pass it now. I commend the chairman.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL) 10 seconds  to respond.  ",2003

97,House,108,0.554,34,2003-03-13,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I am  here to give a clear example from my  home congressional district, a Dr. Joseph Hildner, a board-certified familypractice specialist in Belleview, Florida. He had a patient that was overweight and smoked too much. He never  followed the doctor’s advice, missed  many appointments all the time, and  failed to take blood pressure prescriptions. Suddenly  the patient gets a  heart attack, right? Then he sues because he was not cared for. The trial  attorney  simply  identified  anything  that could have been done, declaring  that no standard care was done for this  patient by Dr. Hildner.  Obviously, Dr. Hildner tried to settle  this thing because the doctor felt that  he would go through long litigation. As  it turns out, the lawyer was suing well  above the amount of money that the  insurance company had for his patient.  This is just an example. So what happens to Dr. Hildner? His premiums go  from $30,000 to $70,000. How does he  pay? How do the doctors in this country pay? They start to hustle through  more patients and more patients. They  practice what is called defensive medicine; they have all these tests,  just  simply to protect themselves. He admits he is hustling through all these  patients  like cattle. He cannot give  them the attention they need. So now  he is giving unnecessary tests.  In the end, we need this bill. That is  why I am an original cosponsor of H.R.  5. I rise as an original cosponsor of, and  in  support of H.R. 5. This bill would help curb  some  of  explosive  noneconomic  damage  awards in medical liability cases, and resultant  soaring malpractice insurance rates that lawsuits have been spurring.  Physicians  in my home state of Florida,  among other states, are already in a state of  crisis, as evidenced by the ‘ ‘walk-out’ ’ earlier  this year.  Dr. W. Herman Sessions of  the Family  Practice Associates in Orange Park, FL, wrote  to me recently that his practice is considering  exiting. He wrote, I am telling my female patients to get  their mammograms this year because I feel  that we are not going to be having mammograms read in the state of Florida next year.  A radiology friend told me that it was at the  last minute that they were able to obtain insurance to read mammograms. He told me  that he is not certain that when their policy  expires in one year that they will be reading  mammograms without some sort of resolution to the liability crisis.  We have had difficulty recruiting physicians to our hospital because nobody wants  to practice in the state of Florida with our  liability problem. These physicians are surgeons and surgical subspecialists. Our local  neurosurgeon obtained liability insurance on  the very last day of the year and he is able  to practice for the calendar year of 2003. I  asked him what his plans are for 2004. He  told me that he will either retire, do strictly  office consultation and no surgery, or move  to another state. And my constituent Johnny Beach from Bell,  Florida, a young, married University of Florida  senior worries about his wife’s access to OB/ GYNs.  Importantly, this legislation rightly does not  cap economic damages, so that the tort system can continue to protect patients from malpractice as intended. I am pleased to cosponsor this bill, and urge its passage. Joseph Hildner, M.D., a board-certified Family Practice specialist in Belleview, FL, writes:  ‘We had a patient who is an obese smoker.  Never followed our advice, missed many appointments,  failed  to  fill blood pressure prescriptions. Patients suffered a heart attack,  then sued for failure to arrange a stress test.’ ’  The  trial attorney simply  identified anything  that might have been done, declared that to  be the ‘ ‘standard of care’ ’, threatened to sue  for higher  than  the doctor’s coverage  limits,  then settled for less. Even with a 90 percent  chance of winning, a physician can ’t take the  chance of going to trial and losing: the ‘ ‘excess verdict’ ’ would allow  for seizure of his  own personal assets. So  the doctor settles.  Actual negligence need not occur; an attorney  only has to do is allege negligence.  But citizens of Belleview lose. Dr. Hildner is  known for excellent clinical outcomes at controlled costs. He says, I’ve always enjoyed the art of medicine in  which I get to practice clinical judgment. As  a primary care physician, I am a shepherd,  getting those who need  it expensive high  tech care, and protecting those who don’t  from unnecessary  interventions.  I’m also  known for taking time to listen and explain.  I don’t have my hand on the doorknob while  a patient is trying to talk. Last year his insurance premium increased  from $30,000 to $70,000. How does he pay?  Now has to see more patients, and spend less  time. ‘ ‘I’m now having to talk patients into ‘ ‘defensive medicine ’ ’ tests they don’t need, just  so  I can protect myself.  I am beginning  to  hustle my patients through like cattle, to see  enough to pay the bills. So this friendly country doctor known for using clinical judgment,  and providing efficient, cost-contained, appropriate care, and known for taking time, is now  talking patients into unnecessary tests (which  is  running  up  costs),  and  hustling  them  through.’ Pass H.R. 5.

99,House,108,0.382,41,2003-03-13,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Speaker, medical malpractice lawsuits are increasingly being used  to enrich lawyers at the expense of patients  and doctors. We would never close the doors  of our legal system to people who have legitimately suffered. But the abuse of the system  is threatening the quality of care delivered by  our doctors and hospitals. According  to  the  Ohio State Medical Association, 76 percent of  Ohio doctors say  insurance costs have affected  their willingness  to perform high-risk  procedures. I’ve met with doctors in my district  who say these high costs might force them to  retire. My rural district cannot afford  to  lose  quality physicians.  This is clearly an issue of tort reform, not insurance regulation. State  insurance commissioners strictly regulate liability insurers. Companies are not permitted  to  raise  their premiums to make up for past losses. Malpractice  insurance premiums are skyrocketing because  over the last decade there has been an explosion in the number of lawsuits and particularly  large awards, some reaching  lottery proportions. That’s something the market will reflect.  Reasonable  limits on non-economic damages are a sensible way  to make sure  that  malpractice  lawsuit  awards  address  actual  damages. They work, without compromising  legal rights or physician vigilance. Ohio is a  case in point. When my state placed caps on  these awards  in 1975,  insurance premiums  dropped. When this cap was overturned, lawsuits . . . and therefore, costs . . . went up  almost  immediately. What changed was  the  behavior of lawyers, not doctors.  H.R. 5, the HEALTH Act, is a surgical solution to a crisis that spans from the operating  room to the court room. I urge its adoption. ",2003
100,House,108,0.323,41,2003-03-13,Mrs. BIGGERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5, the HEALTH Act.  Frivolous malpractice lawsuits are spiraling  out of control. Too many doctors are settling  cases even though they have not committed a  medical error. And good doctors are ordering  excessive  tests, procedures and  treatments  out of fear.  Those were the primary issues a panel of  experts highlighted at a medical malpractice  forum  I hosted  last summer  in my congressional district.  At this forum, the doctors, hospital administrators, and other medical personnel that deal  with these issues on a daily basis said these  cracks in our medical system are driving physicians and hospitals out of business. They  simply cannot afford the exorbitant malpractice  insurance rates that result from these frivolous  lawsuits. As a result, they are forced to close  their doors, limiting patients’ access to care.  Even if doctors can afford to stay in business, they cannot make decisions based solely on  their patient’s best  interest. With  the  threat of malpractice suits constantly hanging  over their heads, they must act in ways to protect themselves from being sued.  Take for example, the case of a five-yearold boy in my district who was hit by a car and  sustained a broken  leg, along with a minor  skull fracture. Usually, in these sorts of cases,  a neurosurgeon would monitor the patient, to  make sure his brain  injury remained stable.  Because of malpractice concerns and excessive  insurance premiums, no neurosurgeons  at that hospital or in the area could afford to  treat patients under the age of 18. In Illinois,  a staggering 85 percent of neurosurgeons are  sued for malpractice at least once in their careers.  Without a neurosurgeon  to  follow  the patient, the child had to be transferred to another  hospital and undergo an ambulance ride with  a broken leg. Once he reached the other hospital,  there was no pediatric neurosurgeon  available, so the orthodpedic trauma surgeon  had the child placed in traction. This involved  inserting a pin into the patient’s leg just above  his knee to hang the weights that pulled on  the leg, and keeping him in traction for a few  weeks.  After  two days, his parents wanted  their  child to be transferred back to the original hospital closer to home. This meant that the child  had to endure another ambulance ride in vulnerable condition.  My point here is not that frivolous lawsuits  hurt doctors; it’s that they end up hurting patients—in this case, a five-year-old.  Are some malpractice lawsuits necessary?  Absolutely. Patients must have access to justice and restitution. But it is wrong when trial  lawyers can exploit the system through frivolous or unlimited suits. And it is wrong to jeopardize patients’ access to healthcare.  Mr. Speaker, Congress has  twice before  had the opportunity to fix the malpractice system and I have supported these attempts. The  good news  is  that we have another chance  today to take a big step toward preserving the  long-term viability of the medical system in Illinois and around the country.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in supporting H.R. 5. It is time for Congress to enact  common sense liability reforms that safeguard  patients’ access to care. ",2003
101,House,108,-0.631,41,2003-03-13,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  opposition to H.R. 5, legislation that would undermine the right of patients and their families  to seek appropriate compensation and penalties when they, or a loved one, are harmed  or even killed by an incompetent health care  provider.  At best,  this bill  is a wrong-headed approach  to  the problem of  rising malpractice  health insurance costs. At worst, it is designed  to protect bad doctors, HMOs, and other  health care providers from being held accountable for their actions. Either way, this bill is  harmful to consumers and should be defeated.  The Republican Leadership has once again  brought forth a bill that favors their special interests at the expense of patients and quality  health care. Doctors, hospitals, HMOs, health  insurance  companies, nursing homes, and  other health care providers would all love to  see their liability risk reduced. Unfortunately,  this bill attempts to achieve that goal solely on  the backs of American’s patients. I said, ‘ ‘attempts to achieve that goal’ ’ intentionally.  Despite  the  rhetoric  from  the other side,  there is absolutely nothing in H.R. 5 that guarantees a reduction in medical malpractice premiums. There is not one line to require that  the medical malpractice insurance industry—in  exchange  for  capping  their  liability—return  those savings to doctors and other providers  they  insure  through  lower malpractice premiums. To quote one of many economists on  this matter, Frank A. Sloan, an economics professor  from Duke,  recently said,  ‘If anyone  thinks caps on pain and suffering are going to  work miracles overnight,  they’re wrong.’ ’  In  fact, the outcome of this bill could have zero  impact on lowering malpractice premiums and  instead go  into  the pocketbooks of  the  forprofit medical malpractice industry. Of course,  the bill’s proponents avoid mentioning  that  very real possibility.  Proponents of this bill like to say that they  are taking California’s successful medical malpractice laws and putting them into effect for  the nation. This is also hyperbole. California  did not simply  institute a $250,000 cap on  medical malpractice awards. The much more  important thing that California did was to institute unprecedented regulation of the medical  malpractice insurance industry. This regulation  limits annual increases in premiums and provides  the  Insurance Commissioner with  the  power and the tools to disapprove increases  proposed by the insurance industry. It is this  insurance regulation that has maintained lower  medical malpractice premiums. Yet the bill before us does absolutely nothing to regulate the  insurance industry at all.  Supporters of this bill would have you believe  that medical malpractice  lawsuits are  driving health care costs through the roof. In  fact, for every $100 spent on medical care in  2000, only 56 cents can be attributed to medical malpractice costs—that’s one half of one  percent. So, supporters are spreading  false  hope that capping medical malpractice awards  will reduce the cost of health care in our country by any measurable amount. It won’t.  What supporters of  this bill  really do not  want you to understand is how bad this bill  would be for consumers. The provisions of this  bill would prohibit juries and courts from providing awards  they believe reasonably compensate victims  for  the harm  that has been  done to them.  H.R. 5 caps non-economic damages. By  setting an arbitrary $250,000 cap on this portion of an award,  the  table  is  titled against  seniors, women, children, and people with disabilities. Medical malpractice awards break  down into several categories. Economic damages are awarded based on how one’s future  income  is  impacted by  the harm caused by  medical malpractice. There are no caps on  this part of the award. But, by capping noneconomic damages,  this bill would artificially  and arbitrarily lower awards for those without  tremendous earning potential. This means that  a housewife or a senior would get less than a  young, successful businessman  for  identical  injuries. Is that fair? I don ’t think so.  The limits on punitive damages are severe.  Punitive damages are seldom awarded in malpractice cases, but their threat is an important  deterrent. And, in cases of reckless conduct  that cause severe harm, it is irresponsible to  forbid such awards.  Republicans  claim  to  be  advocates  for  states rights. Yet, this bill directly overrides the  abilities of states to create and enforce medical malpractice laws that meet the needs of  their residents.  This Congress has been unable to pass a  Patients’ Bill of Rights to protect the rights of  patients  enrolled  in managed  care  plans.  Thankfully states have not been similarly immobile. They have moved ahead and enacted  numerous laws to hold HMOs and other health  plans accountable for the care they provide to  patients—and any harm  they may cause  in  that process. My home state of California has  enacted strong  legislation  in  this  regard.  If  H.R. 5 becomes law, those laws will be overridden. It is not just consumer advocates who  VerDate Dec 13 2002  03:27 Mar 14, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A13MR7.025 H13PT1 ‘ ",2003
102,House,108,-0.263,48,2003-03-13,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the HEALTH Act, H.R. 5. Although I  support the concept of sensible medical malpractice laws, this bill goes too far in defending negligence and not  far enough  in protecting patients.  In my home state of Wisconsin, we have  medical malpractice laws that work. The components of this successful law include a cap  on non-economic damages of $442,000, which  is indexed annually for inflation; a requirement  that all providers carry malpractice insurance;  and a victims’ compensation fund.  The victims’ compensation fund is a unique  entity that has served both patients and health  care providers well. The fund operates by collecting  contributions  from Wisconsin health  care providers and paying the victims once an  award has been determined. The physicians  are  liable only  for  the  first $1 million  in an  award.  If  the award exceeds $1 million,  the  compensation fund will pay the remainder of  the award.  A major problem with H.R. 5 is that it goes  beyond medical malpractice law by including  the provisions regarding pharmaceutical and  medical devices. The bill completely exempts  from liability medical device makers and distributors as well as pharmaceutical companies,  as  long as  the product complies with FDA  standards. These provisions would have no effect on medical malpractice  insurance rates.  Instead, they would leave victims with little recourse and render them unable to hold pharmaceutical companies and the makers of defective medical products accountable for faulty  or unsafe products.  Another problem with H.R. 5 is that it overrides some state laws. While the bill would not  override Wisconsin’s own cap on non-economic damages, it would supersede our state  laws regarding statute of limitations, attorneys’  fees, and  the criteria  for punitive damages.  This bill is a one-size fits all solution that is not  right for Wisconsin.  Although I oppose H.R. 5, I agree that medical malpractice  issues must be addressed.  Unfortunately, H.R. 5 is modeled after California’s law, not Wisconsin’s statutes. The successful components of Wisconsin’s medical  malpractice  laws could be  the basis  for a  much better bill. I urge my colleagues to go  back  to  the drawing board  to craft a consensus piece of legislation that both protects  patients and keeps physicians in business. In  Wisconsin, we are proud to have laws that effectively  accomplish  both  of  these  goals.  These laws are threatened, however, by the  current proposal. Therefore, I oppose H.R. 5. ",2003
103,House,108,-0.41,48,2003-03-13,Mr. CROWLEY.," Mr. Speaker, a lot of people  on  the  other  side  have  one  crucial  fact  wrong—capping medical malpractice awards  does not mean insurance rates will fall.  I have charts here that compare the average insurance premium for states with damage caps versus the average insurance premium for states with no caps.  For OB/GYN doctors, supposedly a group  especially hard hit by medical malpractice  awards—we find that OB/GYNs in states without caps on damages pay $44,485 in insurance. OB/GYNs in states with caps on damages pay $43,010—a ‘ ‘whopping’ ’ 3.4 percent  difference.  For  general  surgery  doctors,  they  pay  $26,144 in premiums if they are in a state with  no caps on damages. They pay $602 more — not  less—if  their  state  caps malpractice  awards.  Look, if we want to decrease medical malpractice insurance costs for doctors, then let’s  talk about that.  Let’s talk about investigating insurance company pricing practices.  Or, if we want to cap something, then let’s  cap the actual problem, insurance rates.  But  to put  the blame  for rising  insurance  costs on victims—that’s not only cruel,  it’s  completely false.

104,House,108,-0.294,48,2003-03-13,Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5,  the HEALTH Act. As a nurse, I understand all  too well the high cost of malpractice insurance  and I recognize the crisis this is creating in our  healthcare  system, particularly  in areas of  high-risk procedures. I want a solution to fix  this problem, but H.R. 5 is not the solution to  helping this crisis.  H.R. 5 will only make this crisis worse. H.R.  5 exempts HMOs, pharmaceutical companies,  and  the FDA  from punitive damage awards.

105,House,108,0.484,55,2003-03-13,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to ask the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. TAUZIN) a question which  concerns  the  relationship of Nevada  law and H.R. 5.  In my State of Nevada, we have recently passed a law that sets forth a  $350,000 cap for noneconomic damages,  but it has some exceptions. I would  like to know how this legislation applies in this circumstance.  ",2003
106,House,108,0.585,62,2003-03-13,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Madam  Speaker, a few minutes ago, the majority and the minority  leaders of the  House, or the minority whip and the  majority leader of the House, discussed  the Amber Alert System and how important it was that we do everything  we can to protect our American children. This lectern, or this stand, holds  the faces of about 55 or 60 children who  have been damaged, their parents believe, by vaccines that contain mercury and they have become autistic.  One of those is my grandson.  It is very interesting, Madam Speaker, that today we found out that there  is a just-published report in the ‘‘Journal of  the American Association of  Physicians  and Surgeons’’  that  involves a research study on autism. The  research, conducted by Drs. Mark Geier  and David Geier, analyzed mercury  doses children received from thimerosal, which contains mercury in childhood vaccines in comparison to Federal  safety  guidelines. The  doctors  concluded that mercury from thimerosal  did exceed Federal safety guidelines  and that the study provides strong epidemiological evidence  for a  link between increasing mercury from thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines and  neurodevelopmental disorders such as  autism which has  reached  epidemic  proportions. The authors  stated,  ‘‘A  causal  relationship  between  thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines and  neurodevelopmental disorders appears  to be confirmed.’’ The Geier research confirms the findings of an unreleased CDC study, Centers  for Disease  Control,  obtained  through the Freedom of Information  Act, which found a relative risk of 2.48  between thimerosal exposures and autism. Courts of law have generally held  that a relative risk of 2.0 or higher is  sufficient to substantiate that a given  exposure causes diseases.  So there is no doubt, no doubt, that  the mercury that has been  injected  into our children is a cause, a contributing cause at the very least, but a  cause, of the autism that these children are suffering. I have asked the  parents of these children from across  the country to write to me, to give me  information on how their child became  autistic and how close it was to when  the child was vaccinated with vaccines  containing mercury.  We had a big problem in the last session. Right at the end in the homeland  security bill, there was an amendment  stuck in at the 11th hour which took  away any liability that the pharmaceutical  companies might  incur because of mercury-related damage done  to children. We were able to get that  out early this session. But now in the  other body they are trying to put that  back in in a bill that was introduced  today by the majority leader. That is  something  that  is  intolerable.  It  is  something that cannot be tolerated by  this body or the other body.  I want to tell you why real quickly.  Here is one example, a letter from a  lady named Sue McManus from Kennesaw, Georgia. She says:  ‘‘Eight years ago, in 1994, I adopted a  lovely daughter, Jessica,  from Paraguay at age 5 months. Jessica was not  identified as a special needs child at  the time of adoption and was in fact  seen by pediatricians in Paraguay who  were U.S. trained as well as in this  country  and  given  a  clean  bill  of  health. Being a responsible parent and  following directions from my doctors, I  had her vaccinated within a few weeks  of bringing her home. On 11/15/94, she  received OPV, DPT, HIB and hepatitis  B. On January 17, 1995, she received her  second series of shots. Within 4 hours  of the second series of shots, she reacted with severe infantile spasm seizures and she became autistic. She had  three seizures that week and had never  had any form of seizure prior to the  second shot. Per medical recommendation, she received several shots that  day. I don’t have any doubt that my  daughter reacted severely and directly  as a result of this DPT shot or combination of shots.’’ She goes on to say that ‘‘she has not  developed normally, she has become  autistic, she stares at the walls, she  flaps her arms like my grandson does  and she has chronic diarrhea or constipation and it is a problem that will  not go away.’’ If you saw the movie  ‘‘Rain Man,’’ you know how bad autism  can be. If we do not deal with this problem now, we are going to deal with it  in 15 to 20 years when these people all  become dependent on society.  Let me just say to my colleagues,  this is something this House is going to  have to address. It is not a partisan  issue. Both Democrats and Republicans  have said they want to protect America’s children. The President said he  does not want to leave any children behind. These kids are being left behind  and their parents are being saddled  with  $50,000,  $100,000,  $200,000  bills.  They are selling their homes, they are  going bankrupt to take care of their  children, and the people who are responsible for the damage to them, the  pharmaceutical companies, are being  left high and dry with no damage whatsoever being attributed to them. There  is a responsibility here for this government to make sure these children are  treated properly.  In the next few weeks I am going to  be reading every night  letters  from  these parents talking about how their  child was damaged and in what proximity it was to the shots they received  containing mercury. We can no longer  turn our backs on this. We went from  one in 10,000 children who are autistic  to one in 150 right now. It is an absolute  epidemic. We  cannot  sweep  it  under the rug. f  ",2003
107,House,108,-0.045,76,2003-03-13,Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi.," I thank  the gentlewoman. I think it is important that we remind the American public where we are now. When we passed  the Bush tax cuts in May, just 2 years  ago, our Nation was $5,643,680,010,418 in  debt. Less than 2 years later we are  $6,445,790,102,749 in debt. That is an increase of over $800 billion. If you were  to track the American debt from the  founding of the American Revolution  through the Vietnam War, our Nation  had borrowed  that much money  in  about 180 years. In less than 2 years,  our Nation has borrowed that much  money. What  is  particularly  frustrating I think for all of us is the complete flip-flop on the part of our Republican colleagues.  The  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  HASTERT) has been the Speaker of the  House now for, I believe, 1,500 days or  something very close to it. In those  1,500 days, he has never scheduled a  vote on a balanced budget amendment.  I  find this a bit  ironic, because on  March 17, 1994, then-Member Hastert  said clearly, ‘‘Until our monstrous $3.4  trillion deficit is eliminated, interest  payments will continue to eat away at  the  important  initiatives which  the  government must fund. I will not stand  by  and watch  Congress  recklessly  squander the future of our children and  grandchildren.’’ As I pointed out, the debt has increased $2 trillion since the Speaker  said that, then-Member HASTERT. Yet  he will not allow a vote on a balanced  budget amendment, and we are not  even sure he is going to allow a vote on  the Blue Dog budget. As we know last  year, it was so thoroughly convoluted  in the Committee on Rules that we  were not given a clear opportunity to  offer it as an amendment. I hope, Mr.  Speaker, you will do so this year.  I would also remind you that on that  same day, you said,  ‘‘The American  people have wanted a balanced budget  amendment for a long time, because  they know it’s the only way to force  Congress to make spending choices.’’ Mr. Speaker, if you meant what you  said in 1994, we are willing to help you  do just that, but you have got to give  us a vote on it.  There  are  some  other  interesting  quotes. The next year, January 25, the  Speaker said,  ‘‘Mr. Chairman, a national debt of $4.5 trillion, you can see  how it’s growing, should finally convince every Member in this Chamber  that Congress has got no discipline to  solve its own problems. This balanced  budget amendment will put discipline  upon us.’’ Mr. Speaker, I wish you would live by  those words and give us a vote.  Here a few days later, ‘‘The American  people want their government to be fiscally responsible. They want us to balance the budget in order to lower our  debt and make our children’s future  brighter.’’ We could not agree with you more.  You were right in 1995. Why are you  not for a balanced budget now?  Some other friends of mine on the  other side of the aisle have said similar  things. Now Majority  Leader  TOM  DELAY, it has been a while, March 11,  1994:  ‘‘We are showing what we would do.  If the Republicans were in charge of  this House and in charge of the Senate,  it would be a much different America.  It would be a much different government.’’ In the past 2 years, or less, you guys  have run up $800 billion in new debt. It  is obviously different. I do not think it  is better, but there is always time to  change. I think one of the ways that  you can change is to allow a vote on  the floor next week of the Blue Dog  budget, which would get us back on the  path to a balanced budget.  The  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  DELAY) had some  interesting statistics. This is from a speech that he gave  on the House floor in 1995:  ‘‘In 1980, each child born that year  immediately inherited a debt of $4,000.  That is government debt. By 1985, because no balanced budget had been  adopted, the children that year had inherited a $7,600 debt. By 1990, our children were burdened with almost $12,800  in debt.’’ This is again from Majority Leader  DELAY’s floor speech from 1995:  ‘‘Each year every child born in America this year will begin life with a debt  of more than $16,700. Is it any wonder  that young families have trouble saving money for a down payment on a  house? Is it any wonder that the Federal  Government’s  consumption  of  more than one-quarter of all our economic activity  is driven  in  interest  rates and stifling economic growth?’’ When the majority leader made that  comment, our Nation was about $4.3  trillion in debt. We are now $2 trillion  further in debt, so I think it is fair to  say that your $16,000 debt that you  made reference to is now a $25,000 debt  for every American man, woman and  child. Yet what really troubles me, and  I could go on and on pointing out very  important Members of the Republican  Party: the gentleman from California  (Mr. THOMAS), the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. HASTERT),  the  gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. DELAY),  the  gentleman from California (Mr. DREIER).  One  thing  that  strikes me as an  American who  tries  to be objective  about all of this and who kind of enjoys  watching other people’s political races,  I remember distinctly then-candidate  Al Gore being severely beaten about  the head and shoulders for flip-flopping  on the abortion issue.

108,,108,0.366,90,2003-03-13,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, while reflecting on Dr. Ogilvie’s tenure as Senate Chaplain, I came across a letter of  his dated March 31, 1995. He was just 3  weeks on the job. You could already  see his devotion not only to his official  duties as Senate Chaplain, but his unofficial duties as the spiritual leader of  the entire Senate family.  In that letter, he writes about the  importance of interceding ‘‘personally’’  for Senators—for praying for Members,  for our families, and for our staff. He  says that he is just as close as a phone  call and provides not only his work  phone number, but his home phone  number, as well. He asks that we keep  him up-to-date about the needs of others in the Senate family. And he talks  about building a  ‘‘caring network of  people who support each other.’’  Yes, this is a man who knew early on  the Senate needs more than one prayer  at the start of each day. We needed a  lot of support from him, from God, and  from each other. And that is exactly  the kind of spiritual climate Lloyd  Ogilvie fostered for 8 years as Senate  Chaplain.  He conducted Bible  studies—which  Karyn and I and many in this Chamber  regularly attended. He hosted weekly  prayer  breakfasts  and  small  faith  groups. He researched theological questions and advised us on the great moral  issues of our times. And when he took  time to offer his own private thoughts  to God, he always forwarded our petitions with his.  He even filled in at the last minute  when my office needed a third baseman  on our Senate softball team. Now that  is going above and beyond the call of  duty.  Dr. Ogilvie consoled us during our  darkest hours—September 11th, the October anthrax attacks, the loss of two  Capitol Police officers and three Senate colleagues come to mind. But he  was also there for us every day. To help  us cope with the stress of our jobs. To  help us overcome struggles in our personal lives. And, most of all, to help us  keep things in perspective by reminding us we serve the United States in  our offices, but we serve God in our  lives.  So I simply want to say thank you to  Dr. Ogilvie, for his many prayers on  our behalf, for the many hours he dedicated to his position, and  for being  there—as the spiritual  leader of the  Senate family—every day in the Chamber and every day in our lives.  And, lastly, I want to thank him for  being such a wonderful and supportive  friend. I wish him the best in California  with Mary Jane. And though Karyn  and I will miss them both dearly, we  are certain we will hear from them because they will always be family. And  there is nothing more precious to the  Ogilvies—as  they have demonstrated  time and again—than family.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  SUNUNU). The minority leader.  ",2003

Lloyd Ogilvie has the appreciation of  every one of the Members of this body.  I join in expressing my heartfelt appreciation to him and his family as they  begin the next chapter in their lives.  A Senate chaplain was once asked:  You pray for the Senate? He replied,  no, I look at those Senators as I stand  on the dais and I pray for the country.  For the last 8 years, Lloyd Ogilvie  has done a lot of praying—for our Nation, for the Members of this Senate,  and for our families, for our staffs, and  all the people who work in this building, and for those who come to visit  the Senate from all over the world. He  has prayed  for us and with us. For  many of us, he has been a source of  guidance and support. We are grateful  to him for his wisdom, for his friendship, and for his service to this Senate  and our Nation.

Of course, behind all of this is the  confidence  and  love  of my  wife  Charlene, our boys, and their wives,  who have really sustained me, who said  this is something we ought to be doing,  a commitment of our time and our  lives in a way that has been exciting  for me and I hope for them.  My staff has made it possible for me  to get to the Chamber for all of these  votes. Wherever we are in the country,  in Washington or at the airport, each  one of us is indebted to staff who tell  us when the votes are going to occur  and give us some reasonable idea about  what is being voted on. I pay tribute to  each one of those persons.  I pay tribute to colleagues who have  sustained me each day with their loyal  friendship, likewise the sheer vigor of  the experience. I feel each day it is an  adventure, and I am sure that is shared  by each of  the colleagues who are  present today.  I want to mention specifically Senator ROBERTBYRD, who was the majority leader when I first came. One of the  reasons my vote total escalated so rapidly was that in 1977 I think Senator  BYRDcreated an all-time record of rollcall votes. I am certain he will remember exactly how many, but  I recall  there were at least 650, which was a  substantial  amount  for  a  freshman  Senator to start out with. So we have  had  some money  in  the bank ever  since, thanks to Senator BYRD.  Finally, I want to thank the pages.  They have played a very special role in  these votes because, as some of my colleagues know, occasionally I go running out on The Mall. On several occasions I have been caught as far away as  14th Street or the Washington Monument when the beeper went off. I had  to run swiftly. Fortunately, my pace is  sufficient to get the mile and a half  back to the Capitol during the time of  the vote  to  scramble up  the back  stairs, but in a disheveled condition I  have prevailed upon the pages to crack  open the door, and the reading clerk  has been kind enough to read my name  so that I can peak through and keep  this voting record alive.  So I thank all of you. I appreciate  very much this moment today.  ",2003
112,Senate,108,-0.231,111,2003-03-13,Mr. GRAHAM of Florida.," Having said  that, I believe the standard  for the  kind of information the Senate has a  right and a need for in order to be able  to carry out  its advise and consent  function is not an ideological or even a  precedential  standard but,  rather, a  pragmatic standard.  If a person has  been, for instance, an academic and has  written, as they typically do, extensive  articles or books, there is some means  by which you can get below and beneath the resume and get some feel of  the person who is being considered.  Similarly,  if a person has been a  judge at the State level, or at other  levels within the Federal judiciary, it  is likely that they have written opinions or other statements of their jurisprudential feelings which, again, would  give you means by which to evaluate  and cast an informed vote to consent  to a Presidential nomination.  I have been away from the Senate  most of the time this matter has been  under consideration. I do not serve on  the  Judiciary Committee,  but  colleagues whose judgment I respect have  indicated they do not feel that as of  today we have the information to, in  an informed manner, provide that consent.  I believe this is an issue upon which  honorable men and women can reach  agreement, just as after a series of negotiations, Senator NELSONand I have  reached an agreement on the means by  which the Florida judicial nominating  process will be ordered and respected.  I urge those of my colleagues who  have been particularly involved in this  to not see today’s vote as the  last  chapter but, rather, as a call to find an  honorable way to provide us with the  information, given the status of this  nominee and the dearth of information  which might otherwise be available.  Let me say, Mr. President, I  find  some irony in the issues with which  this Senate is currently dealing. We  may be at war as early as next week.  This Senate has already voted to authorize that war. There have been a  number of rationales submitted for the  war.  One of the rationales that has been  recently advanced with a great deal of  intellectual fervor has been the concept that by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could create a new climate  throughout the region of the Middle  East and that  in that new climate  could sprout the seeds of democratic  institutions which would, in turn, lead  to democracy. That would be a very admirable consequence.  The irony is that at the same time  we are hoping that our actions of war  will lead to democracy in a region of  the world  thousands of miles away  which has little history of democracy,  we are today debating a process that,  in my judgment, if not carefully balanced between the executive and legislative branches, has the prospect, as  John Adams suggested, of destabilizing  one of the key institutions of our more  than two centuries of democracy.  I return to my hope that people of  good will can find a way to provide to  this institution the information that it  legitimately requires, and which the  Constitution imposes upon us, to make  an informed consent to the President’s  nomination.  I offer as an example of that spirit of  cooperation the good deeds that were  extended  to me  by Senator FRIST.  Maybe some people who observe this  debate observe  the Senate  in other  highly partisan conflicts, such as the  one we voted on earlier today, to believe that we are warring armies. Yes,  we are people who have strong views  and opinions, and we will express those  views and support them with our votes.  But we also are people who have a respect for our colleagues and a humanity towards them. I think this is the  time to draw upon that respect and appreciation for humanity, as well as our  responsibilities under the Constitution,  to see if we can find a means to close  this impasse and move on to the other  important business of the Senate.  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity. I again thank you and my  colleagues  for all the expressions of  good will during my absence.  ",2003
113,Senate,108,0.323,139,2003-03-13,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President, I  support the nomination of John Daniel  Breen to be a United States District  Judge for the Western District of Tennessee. I am pleased that the Senate  has moved so expeditiously to confirm  this exceptional nominee.  Mr. Breen  is  currently  a United  States Judge in the Western District of  Tennessee.  Judge  Breen  was  recommended  last year by the current  Senate Majority Leader, my colleague,  Senator FRIST,  and  former Senator  Thompson. I am pleased to add my  voice in support of his nomination. As  someone who, as Governor of Tennessee appointed some 50 judges, I am  confident that Judge Breen will continue to be an able Federal judge when  he is confirmed as a United States District Judge for the Western District of  Tennessee.  Judge Breen was born and raised in  Jackson, TN. He was a summa cum  laude graduate of Spring Hill College  in Mobile, AL in 1972, and was valedictorian of his class. He received his  Juris Doctorate from the University of  Tennessee College of Law in 1975, where  he served as a member of the law review.  After receiving his law degree, Judge  Breen worked for sixteen years with  the law firm of Waldrop and Hall, P.A.  in Jackson, TN. Judge Breen has been  a United States Judge for the Western  District of Tennessee since 1991 and has  an excellent reputation in this position.  Judge Breen has vast litigation experience. As a practicing attorney, he  practiced general civil litigation primarily in the areas of tort law and  workers’ compensation. Judge Breen  was involved in litigating one of the  premier lawsuits in Tennessee in the  1990’s, which resulted in the adoption  of comparative negligence.  Judge Breen has been actively  involved and held leadership positions in  local, State and national bar associations throughout his legal career. He  has also been extremely active in his  community by, among other things,  providing pro bono  legal services to  disadvantaged persons and serving as a  member on a variety of community organizations.  I am confident that Judge Breen will  be a fine United States District Judge  for the Western District of Tennessee,  and I thank all my colleagues who supported this nomination.  f  NOMINATION  OF  MIGUEL  A.

114,Senate,108,-0.212,153,2003-03-13,Mr. BAUCUS.," Madam President,  I  walked over to the floor without realizing we were giving a testament to  General Lenhardt. But  I  could not  agree more with the words I heard from  Senator DASCHLE, as well as the words  from Senator REID of Nevada.  It  is  true, as I reflect upon it, that I know of  no man who contributed greater service for his country than Al Lenhardt.  He is such a professional. He is such a  gentleman. He is so good. We trust him  so much. We are so lucky that he was  our Sergeant at Arms during the tragic  times  the Capitol  family has  been  through the last couple of years.  I know we are all extremely proud of  him and we will have very fond memories of his service here. I say to General  Lenhardt, you are a great man, and we  appreciate your service.  Mr. President, I rise today to pledge  my support  for our brave men and  women who are on the front lines protecting America as we work to eliminate terrorism. . . . To pledge my support for the United States and all that  our  country  represents:  democracy,  freedom of speech and religion, independence of thought. . . . And to pledge  my support for our leaders and our free  and open elections that allow democracy to thrive.  I also rise today to urge and insist  that throughout the ongoing situation  with Iraq, we remember our underlying  goal: To protect our  country  from  weapons of mass destruction and terrorist threats and stop those who provide assistance to terrorist operations.  In order  to  fully accomplish  these  goals, we need the support and assistance of the broadest possible worldwide  coalition of our allies.  It’s not in our Nation’s interest to establish arbitrary deadlines to force us  to act without the support of others.  This  is not the time to  isolate our  country by moving into a unilateral  war against Iraq.  A war that could result in massive  casualties and long term devastation.  A war that has the likely potential of  increasing terrorist threats against our  Nation.  There is no question that the United  States has the ability and the right to  take necessary action to protect our  country. But we  should  not  burn  bridges—bridges  that we will  surely  need down the road—in our rush to war  with Iraq.  There is no debate that the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein must come to  an end. He has a long history of attacking and murdering his own people, employing chemical and biological weapons, and continually defying the limits  set forth by the UN. There have been  reported links between Iraq and terrorist activity, although no link has  been established between Iraq and the  events of September 11. The Iraqi people and the global community deserve  to be free from a cruel dictator and the  threat to safety that he represents.  The credibility of the United Nations  and of America is on the line.  We must take the time to fully weigh  the risks and costs associated with unilateral action against the results we  will achieve. The threat Iraq poses is  not imminent, at least not so imminent that we can’t continue with another week, or another month, of negotiations to garner the support of members of the United Nations Security  Council.  The clock is ticking, but the alarm  has not yet rung. I encourage the administration  to continue  inspections  beyond  their  self-imposed March  17  deadline. In these final critical minutes, we have the opportunity to lay  out hard and  fast, mutually agreed  upon  benchmarks  for  Hussein  to  meet—or not meet—to determine his  fate. Britain laid out definitive steps  yesterday, such as allowing Iraq scientists to be interviewed abroad, destroying banned weapons and providing  documentary evidence of any such destruction in the past.  While  support  for  their  resolution  has not been overwhelming, it is important to continue along this path. Indeed, it is critical. We must both provide assistance to Britain, our strongest ally, while employing every  resource at our command to garner Security Council support.  As the world’s superpower, it is not  only our responsibility, but it is in our  best interest to lead. It’s our responsibility to walk with and secure the support of our allies. The decisions we  make  in the coming days will have  global reverberations and I am hopeful  we won’t have to endure the impacts  alone.  In the case that unilateral military  action is decided upon, the ramifications,  lengthy reconstruction process  and costs involved must be addressed.  There are numerous reports that a war  with Iraq will be a relatively short operation. But what follows in a month,  in 6 months, in a year?  If the United States chooses to go it  alone in Iraq and forsakes the support  of a majority of our allies, the hurdles  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:22 Jan 14, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€3SENATE\S13MR3.REC S13MR3 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2003
115,Senate,108,0.23,174,2003-03-13,Mr. CAMPBELL.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am introducing a bill to facilitate the move of the Denver Veterans  Affairs Medical Center, DVAMC, from  its present site in Denver to the former  Fitzsimons Army Medical Center  in  Aurora, Colorado. I am pleased to be  joined in this effort by my friend and  colleague Senator ALLARDas an original co-sponsor.  The bill would authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to construct,  lease or modify major medical facilities  at  the  site  of  the  former  Fitzsimons Army Medical Center. It instructs the Secretary to work with the  Department of Defense in planning a  joint Federal project that would serve  the health care needs of active duty  Air Force and the VA. It would also require the Secretary to submit a report  to the Committees on Appropriations  and the Committees on Veterans Affairs of the Senate and the House of  Representatives. This report would detail the options selected by the Secretary and any information on further  planning needed to carry out the move.  The relocation of the DVAMC to the  former Fitzsimons site offers a unique  opportunity  to  provide  the highest  quality medical care for our veterans  and certain members of our military.  The University  of Colorado Health  Sciences Center, UCHSC, is moving its  facilities from its overcrowded location  near  downtown  Denver  to  the  Fitzsimons  site,  a  decommissioned  Army  base.  The  UCHSC  and  the  DVAMC have long operated on adjacent campuses and have shared faculty,  medical residents, and access to equipment. A DVAMC move to the new location  in  conjunction with  the DOD  would  allow  such  cost-effective  cooperation to continue, for the benefit  of our veterans, active duty Air Force  members and all taxpayers.  The need to move is pressing. A recent VA study concludes that the Colorado State veterans’ population will  experience one of the highest percent  increases nationally in veterans age 65  and over between 1990 and 2020. The  present VA hospital was built in the  1950’s. While still able to provide service, the core facilities are approaching  the end of their useful lives and many  of the patient care units have fallen  horribly out of date. Studies indicate  that co-location with the University on  a  state-of-the-art  medical  campus  would be a cost effective way to give  veterans and active duty Air Force  members  in  the  region  the highest  quality of care. The move would also  provide a tremendous opportunity to  showcase a nationwide model of cooperation between the University, the  Department of Veterans Affairs, VA,  and the Department of Defense.  The VA needs to move quickly. Assisting our veterans with their medical  needs is a promise we, as a country,  made long ago.  The savings we can realize by approving the timely transfer of our veterans’  medical  treatment  facilities  in  the  Denver region compels me to urge my  colleagues to act quickly on this bill.  We must not miss out on this opportunity to serve America’s veterans and  their families by ensuring that they receive the excellent medical care they  deserve.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 613  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans’  New Fitzsimons Health Care Facilities Act  of 2003’’.  SEC. 2.

117,,108,-0.35,209,2003-03-13,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the achievements of women in community development. Women are key leaders  in building quality, affordable housing and they  are revitalizing their communities in the United  States as well as internationally. The central  role of women in any effective community development strategy, whether the goal is economic development, housing, education or  health, has been well documented.  The National Network of Women in Community Development, in partnership with women  community development leaders from across  the country are working to bring a collective  voice to foster new policies and improve existing ones, which are more responsive to the  housing and community development needs of  women and children.  On the occasion of the 20th Anniversary of  the McAuley Institute, the only national nonprofit  community  development  intermediary  that focuses its resources on the housing and  related needs of women and their families, I  would  like  to  recognize  the vital  role  that  women-led development organizations have  played in creating housing across the country  and in the restoration of communities.

118,,108,-0.348,209,2003-03-13,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor Women’s History Month. Each year, we  pay special  tribute  to  the accomplishments  made  by  our  nation’s most  distinguished  women during the month of March. It is my  great honor to recognize extraordinary women  who are making a difference in my district.  I stand today, to pay special recognition to  Ms. Anna Gutierrez, an outstanding woman of  California’s 29th Congressional District. Over  the years, Ms. Gutierrez has given selflessly  of her time and energy to many different organizations in the City of Monterey Park and surrounding areas.  A  forty-three  year  resident  of Monterey  Park, California, Anna was a payroll supervisor  for Blue Chip Stamps  for  twenty-five  years, and a payroll supervisor  for Figgie  International  for nine years. Despite working  full-time, she found time to volunteer at all of  her children ’s schools: Sacred Heart of Mary  School, Cantwell High School and Marian  School. Besides her children, Dennis, Carolina  and Jeffrey, she has  four grandchildren and  four great-grandchildren.  After her retirement  in 1994, Anna volunteered to serve senior lunches at First Methodist Church and participated in two senior citizen clubs, the Friendship Club and the Senior  Affairs Club, both  in Montebello, California.  Currently she is a member of the Montebello  Breakfast Club and treasurer for the Los Angeles Monterey Park (LAMP) Optimist Club.  For many years, Anna has been a docent of  the Monterey Park Historical Society Museum  and is in charge of the school children tour  program. She volunteers for the City of Monterey Park as a Commissioner on the Historical Commission and is a Precinct Poll Inspector for citywide elections. In addition, she assists the Monterey Park Police Department by  participating with  the Monterey Park Senior  Citizen Patrol.  Of all her activities, the organization that is  nearest to her heart is the Maryvale Orphanage in Rosemead, California. An active participant  for over eight years, she volunteers  in  many ways, including fundraising, assisting in  rummage  sales,  and  packaging Christmas  gifts for the economically disadvantaged.  Ms. Gutierrez’s breadth of volunteer work is  remarkable and all who have the opportunity  to work with her are better off for the experience.  I ask all Members of Congress to join me  today  in honoring a  remarkable woman of  California’s 29th Congressional District, Anna  Gutierrez. The entire community joins me in  thanking Ms. Gutierrez  for her continued efforts to make the 29th Congressional District  an enhanced place in which to live.

119,,108,0.302,216,2003-03-13,Mr. LATHAM.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to share  with my colleagues an essay written by Jefferson Brown, a constituent of mine from Mason  City, IA. Jefferson is a 12-year-old 6th grader  at Roosevelt Middle School in Mason City. He  recently won an award from the Elks Lodge in  Mason City and will soon be traveling to the  State Capital in Des Moines to compete in a  state-wide competition. I submit his award-winning essay for the RECORD. The American flag means many things to  me. It symbolizes pride, joy, strength, and  ability. These all come from the flag of the  great country we live in.  The flag symbolizes pride, the pride of our  country, ourselves, and pride for our flag of  America. It gives hope, it gives us pride, the  flag is a symbol of our pride in our country.  The flag represents joy for the heroes who  stood tall defending our country. Joy when  the warriors came home to us all. The joy of  one, the joy of all is in the flag that flies  high above us, the flag stands for joy in  America.  Strength is in the flag, and the strength is  in the hearts of all the American people. The  strength is in our army, strength in those  who lost a loved one on those days when we  stood  tall. The  strength  is  in one;  the  strength  is  in all,  it  is  in America; that  stands tall.  Last but not least, ability. The flag stands  for ability. Ability is in all of us, it is what  we do. We are better at some things than  others. Some of us can run or jump better  then others, or we can draw or write better;  but the point is that we all must bring our  abilities together just as if we were colors on  the American flag, the colors come together  to make the flag. Just as we must, all united  as one. f  A  TRIBUTE  TO  JACQUELINE  ‘‘JACQUIE’’ FENNESSY, 29TH CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT WOMAN  OF THE YEAR—2003 HON. ADAM B.

The Clarks will be honored March 15 with  a Mass of Thanksgiving at St. Mary’s Church  in Pittston and an anniversary dinner at St.  Mary’s Center in Scranton.  Albert and Mary,  the  former Mary Jordan,  were married March 6, 1943, in their neighborhood church in Pittston, in the middle of World  War II. He wore his Navy ensign’s uniform for  the ceremony. At the time he was an administrative officer with the Navy at the Philadelphia  Ship Yard, which was  then a major deployment facility for troops and shipping traffic.  They are the proud parents of seven children: Michael, of Washington, DC; Patrick, of  Columbia, SC; Kevin, of San Francisco; John,  of Poway, CA; Brian, of Dunmore; Albert, Jr.,  of Scranton; and Mary Kenney, of Clarks  Summit. They are also the proud grandparents  of 22 grandchildren.  In addition  to raising a  large  family, Mary  has been continuously active in various organizations of her parish church,  including her  role as Eucharistic minister. Last year, Albert  was presented with  the Man of  the Year  award by the Greater Pittston Friendly Sons of  St. Patrick.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to call to the attention of  the House of Representatives  the  60th wedding anniversary of Albert and Mary  Clark, and I wish them and their family all the  best. f  SHLOMO ARGOV—A VICTIM OF  MINDLESS VIOLENCE  HON.

121,,108,-0.45,216,2003-03-13,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, a good man has  died after spending 20 years completely paralyzed  because  of mindless  violence  perpetrated by the Abu Nidal Middle East terrorist  faction. Shlomo Argov, the former Israeli Ambassador to Britain, who died on February 23  in a  Jerusalem hospital, was  shot as he  emerged from a meeting in a London hotel in  1982. For more than 20 years he was a living  example of the tragedy that has befallen so  many decent people because of mindless hatred that is used to justify terrorist acts.  I first met him when he showed me around  Jerusalem on my first visit to the Middle East  after the 1973 Israeli-Arab war. He was a political moderate who in his conversations with  me spoke articulately of the need for Israelis  and Palestinians to come to an understanding  about  their differences, and,  yet, he was  gunned down by forces of hatred who have always been anxious to make a political point  regardless of the injury done to other human  beings or to their own cause.  Before he was so viciously assaulted, he  had a distinguished career in Israeli’s Minister  of Foreign Affairs and served as Ambassador  to Mexico, the Netherlands, and finally, Ambassador to Britain. His death is another demonstration of how close the Middle East is to  running out of men of good will before it runs  out of hatred.

This bill provides  tax  incentives  to  make both new and existing buildings more  energy efficient. These  incentives are workable, verifiable and will promote market transformation, stimulating  the market  for energy  efficient technology and services.  Building  construction  and  operation  represents 15 percent of Gross National Product  and buildings consume 35 percent of the Nation’s primary energy budget —almost twice as  much as cars.

124,,108,-0.386,223,2003-03-13,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I am deeply  disappointed by the failure of the recent talks  between the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopolous and Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, which ended yesterday without an agreement due to the intransigence of Mr. Denktash.  We have observed years of intense negotiations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot  communities and were hopeful that this round  would end in success. As you know, in 1974,  Turkey invaded Cyprus, and to this day continues to maintain an estimated 35,000 heavily  armed  troops  in Cyprus. Nearly  200,000  Greek Cypriots, who fell victim to a policy of  ethnic cleansing, were  forcibly evicted  from  their homes and became refugees in their own  country.  Despite  the hardships and  trauma caused  by  the ongoing Turkish occupation, Cyprus  has registered remarkable economic growth,  and the people living in the Government-controlled areas enjoy one of the world’s highest  standards of living. The latest success is the  European Council’s invitation to Cyprus to become one of the ten new Member States of  the European Union. Sadly, the people living  in the occupied area continue to be mired in  poverty. We had hoped  that a united Cyrus  would join EU.  Instead, we are  faced with  failure. Failure  because Mr. Rauf Denktash has denied Turkish Cypriots the opportunity to determine their  own future and to vote in a referendum which  would have likely lead to a solution of the Cyprus problem.  Despite my concerns and disappointment, I  appreciate  the  comments  of  President  Papadopolus who has stated that the Greek  Cypriot  side will  ‘continue  the  efforts  for  reaching a solution  to  the Cyprus question  both before and after Cyprus joins the EU.’ I urge  the government of Turkey  to  take  constructive steps  for  resolving  the Cyprus  problem. And I urge the Administration to continue with its efforts to persuade Turkey and  the Turkish-Cypriot leader to work within the  UN process to end the division of Cyprus.  At a time when tensions are rising around  the world, we must seize every opportunity to  achieve peace and stability. f  A  TRIBUTE  TO  PASTOR  JEAN  BURCH,  29TH  CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT  WOMAN  OF  THE  YEAR—2003 HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 13, 2003 ",2003
125,,108,0.556,230,2003-03-13,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker, today  I rise in recognition of the 50th anniversary of  Cub Scout Pack 596 from St. Alphonsus Parish in Greendale, Wisconsin. For the past five  decades,  the  leaders, and members of Cub  Scout Pack 596 have made  invaluable contributions  to  their community,  to Wisconsin,  and to our country.  Since 1930,  the Cub Scout have helped  young boys learn new skills and civic responsibility. Character development, good citizenship, and personal achievement are among  the ten purposes of cub scouting. Other goal  include spiritual growth, family understanding,  respectful relationships, sportsmanship and fitness, friendly service, and fun and adventure.  Cub scouts earn merit badges in recognition  for physical  fitness and  talent-building activities. As a former cub scout, I believe that the  values I was taught as a member—respect for  nature, for other people, and for ourselves— have helped to shape who I am today.  Pack 596 makes a difference in their community every year through programs such as  Scouting  for Food.  In  this program, scouts  leave empty bags at homes in their neighborhood for the families to fill. The scouts then return the following weekend to take the foodfilled bags to the local food pantry. Pack 596  also participates in a toy drive for needy children every Christmas. These boys have consistently worked  to make  the world a better  place and steadfastly honored their motto to  do their best.  Mr. Speaker, Cub Scout Pack 596 has  served as a model for all cub scout packs for  50 years. They have set a high standard for  cub scouts everywhere through their commitment to God and country and their dedication  to helping develop  the  future  leaders of our  Nation. f  COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  NATIONAL  WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM  HON. RON KIND  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 13, 2003 ",2003
126,,108,-0.263,230,2003-03-13,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, one hundred years  ago, President Theodore Roosevelt displayed  historic vision and took a bold step forward in  his quest to protect our Nation ’s natural wonders. He decided that the plight of one group  of birds on a scant five acres in Florida was  important enough to warrant the protection of  the Federal government. Roosevelt made this  decision on March 14, 1903, continuing his  commitment to protect American public lands.  In creating a National Wildlife Refuge, however, Roosevelt brought the American public  on a great ideological departure from the principles underlying our National Park System:  While those lands are set aside for the enjoyment and appreciation of people, wildlife refuges are for the sole benefit of wildlife. This  ideological leap was truly historic, and I commend President Roosevelt and celebrate his  enduring legacy.  Since the first refuge was established in our  State  in 1912,  the Wisconsin refuge system  has become an integral part of life for our citizens. Our  five wildlife refuges and  two wetlands management districts attract nearly two  million visitors each year. They provide critical  habitat for our State’s world-renowned wildlife  resources, as well as opportunities for recreation and groundbreaking research.  Horicon Marsh, covering 32,000 acres,  is  the  largest  fresh water cattail marsh  in  the  United States and is designated as a ‘ ‘wetland  of national  importance. ’ ’ Tremplealeau, The  Upper Mississippi River, and Horicon National  Wildlife Refuges are designated as  ‘globally  important bird areas.’ ’ And Necedah National  Wildlife Refuge serves as the summer home  for research experiments with the migration of  highly endangered whooping cranes.  I wonder whether the President knew what  he was setting in motion when he set aside  those  five seemingly  inconsequential acres.  Could he possibly have dreamed  that such  humble beginnings would  flourish  into  the  grand national wildlife refuge system that we  boast  today? That system now consists of  more  than 575  individual units and encompasses over 95 million acres. Refuges can be  found in every State in the Union, protecting  more  than 250  threatened or endangered  plants and animals,  including such beloved  and symbolic species as  the manatee, bald  eagle, and California  jewelflower. These  figures far exceed any expectations that President Roosevelt may have had. Our  refuge  system is truly a triumph of American vision  and commitment to responsible stewardship of  our unparalleled natural heritage.  I am proud to support the National Fish and  Wildlife Service in its vital mission and grateful  to be able  to pass  this  legacy on  to  future  generations of Americans. f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO: MR. BRIAN  BRADY  HON. SCOTT McINNIS  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 13, 2003 Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great  honor that I rise today in order to recognize  Brian Brady of Grand  Junction, Colorado.  Brian is a gifted young man whose dedication  and entrepreneurship are a credit to his community. Today, I would like to pay tribute to his  efforts before this body of Congress and this  nation.  As an active member of the Grand Junction  community, Brian serves on a variety of local  boards and works with many organizations including three of the largest and most active organizations  in Mesa County:  the Rotary,  United Way and the Mesa County Crime Stoppers. Brian’s company, Brady MicroTech, creates and maintains websites and is currently  the Webmaster of the Gene Taylor’s Sporting  Goods website, in charge of everything from  the creation of their online catalogue, to taking  the photos of the store and maintaining customer relations. Brian has a lot on his plate,  especially for a young man who is currently a  senior at Central High School in Grand Junction.  A few years ago, Brian and few other young  men, Ryan and Rob Cook, and Daniel Davis,  approached a local radio station about a teen  issues program. The  radio station gave  the  boys an opportunity to broadcast their show,  which became an amazing success. Currently,  the show airs every Tuesday night from nine  until ten o’clock and gives local teens a platform to discuss everything from local issues to  the concerns on  the mind of  today’s  teenagers.  Brian is a true asset to the people of the  Grand Valley, not only for his work with teens,  but also for his contribution to local organizations and businesses. Mr. Speaker, it is with  great pride that I recognize this capable and  gifted young man before  this body of Congress and this nation. His dedication to community service is a credit to Mesa County and  the entire State of Colorado. f  COMMENDING  THE  101ST  AIRBORNE DIVISION OF THE UNITED  STATES ARMY  HON. JOHN S. TANNER  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 13, 2003 ",2003
127,,108,-0.182,230,2003-03-13,Mr. TANNER.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize  the honorable service of  the men and  women of the 101st Airborne Division of the  United States Army, who are again answering  this nation ’s call to duty. They have already  been deployed to the Persian Gulf in preparation for whatever conflict may lie ahead.  While  international debate continues over  the appropriate course of action, Mr. Speaker,  it is easy for us to forget about the men and  women who are already on the front line, preparing for the unknown, ready to accept the  orders that are handed down.  There are almost 20,000 men and women  stationed at Fort Campbell, which sits on the  border between Tennessee and Kentucky.  Fort Campbell is home to the 101st Airborne  Division ‘ ‘Screaming Eagles,’ ’ under the command of Maj. Gen. David Petraeus. The 101st  Airborne Division has a  long history of outstanding military service, playing key roles in  World War  I, World War  II, Korea, Vietnam  and Desert Storm.  From  an  Apache  fighter-helicopter,  the  ‘Screaming Eagles’ ’ fired the very first shots  in the Gulf War, taking out Iraqi communications and paving the way for the ground attack. In the ground war, the 101st made the  longest and largest air assault in world history  into enemy territory. About 4,500 ‘ ‘Rakkasans’ ’  from the division’s 3rd Brigade also spent six  months  in Afghanistan,  fighting  in Operation  Anaconda, one of the toughest fronts in this  nation’s war on terrorism.  Now, the men and women of the 101st are  again  answering  the  call  to  duty.  The  ‘Screaming Eagles’ ’ have  left behind  their  families and their homes to set up camp in the  desert. These brave soldiers know that their  country may need them, and they are ready to  serve.

128,House,108,0.505,3,2003-03-25,Mr. SMITH of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to make some comments on the war in Iraq. Most of us  voted for the resolution to authorize  the President to use force in Iraq to  help solve the problem of weapons of  mass destruction. Voting for that resolution makes us at least somewhat responsible  for  the  young men  and  women  in  the military  going  into  harm’s way. And even though we know  it is the right thing to do, it still gives  one pause for all of the suffering and  the sorrow. Now we have several of our  military who have been captured, or  missing, or who have died. The challenge for this country is that if Saddam gets away with it, other tyrants in  other rogue nations think that it also  is going to be to their advantage to develop these weapons of mass destruction. This will make the world much  less secure and this country much less  secure.  I pray for not only the young men  and women soldiers, but for their families. When I was 21 years old, we got a  phone call notifying us that my brother, Chan, who was 23, that his jet plane  went down and that he was killed. That  grief never left our family. So the sacrifice is great for families. I, for one,  am convinced that the war is the right  thing to do. If we were to delay, it  would mean that much greater of a  challenge for us in the future.  Recently a newspaper in my district  in Michigan ran an editorial saying  that people have the right to protest  against the war; and they do, certainly.  But now that we are in the war, I think  we  should  encourage  everybody  to  rethink what protesting does. Before  we went in, maybe you can protest and  maybe it is going to end up in a decision not to be there. But now, we have  thousands  of  our  young men  and  women over there that need our support. We are in combat. Imagine an  analogy where a mom did not want her  son to go out for boxing because it is  too dangerous, or football; but once the  decision was made, does she not cheer  him and go to the game and cheer him  on? Or a mom and dad that did not  want their daughter to go out for basketball because, after all, that was sort  of wrong for a young lady to do. That  was a boy’s sport. But once that young  lady goes out for the team, the parents  cheer her on and say, good game, do  your best. Or what happened in Vietnam when we literally spat on some of  our  soldiers and  sailors when  they  came home?  My point, Mr. Speaker,  is that to  demonstrate against  the war makes  the challenge for our military greater.  As an old Air Force veteran I assure  my colleagues that it is true, it makes  it harder for our military, when people  now demonstrate and say, look, you  are doing an immoral thing, you are  doing the wrong thing. It makes it that  much more difficult.  We are in it. Let us cheer for our  team and give our total support for the  action of our military men and women  that are now over in this war in Iraq.  Give them our prayers and certainly  give their families and their loved ones  our prayers. f  QUESTIONING THE MATRICULA  CONSULAR  ",2003

131,House,108,0.616,24,2003-03-25,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker, the  President has said that bringing freedom to Iraq would not be easy and that  it would not be fast. I think it is important that Americans know that we  are indeed making incredible progress,  but  it  is unrealistic to expect that  after 12 weeks of digging himself in  that we will be able to remove Saddam  in a week.  Just yesterday, critics were questioning whether Iraqis really wanted  freedom because there had been no popular uprisings against Saddam Hussein’s henchmen. Well, today we have  reports from our allies that in Basra,  Iraqi  civilians  have  challenged  Saddam’s soldiers. Clearly, the President and his advisers have a plan and it  is working.  The second point  I would  like to  make this evening is that we must remember the unsung heroes of this conflict, the military families. For every  American soldier, there  is a  family,  there is a community and an entire Nation who is praying that all will go  well. b1945  It is imperative that we keep them in  our prayers,  for too often the challenges that they face go unnoticed.  Mr. Speaker, Fort Campbell sits in  my congressional district. I would like  to take this time to honor the families  of the soldiers from Fort Campbell, the  Special Operations  forces,  the  101st  forces. We appreciate so much these  families and the sacrifice that they are  making to see freedom and liberty preserved not only in our country but also  for the Iraqi people. f  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  BRADLEYof New Hampshire).

132,House,108,0.75,24,2003-03-25,Mr. TANCREDO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  tonight to bring to the attention of the  body another group of people that I  would like to bring into what we are  now  calling  the  homeland  heroes.  These are folks whose daily lives confront them with incredible stresses and  challenges far different than what their  business had provided them with to  begin with.  They started out ranching, and that  is a difficult task in and of itself. But  after generations in that particular industry and living in the same area on  the border of Mexico, living in Arizona,  many of the people who reside there  are now living in what we can, I think,  accurately describe as a war  zone.  Every week I have been bringing to the  House the names and pictures of those  people that I want to induct into this  homeland heroes hall of fame, I guess  is the way we will describe it.  Tonight I want to talk about Rob and  Sue Krentz, who own and operate a  ranch located on the far southeastern  corner of Arizona, about 12 miles north  of the U.S./Mexico border and 25 miles  northeast of the city of Douglas. They  are  third-generation  ranchers. This  ranch has been in their family since  1907.  Rob and Susie Krentz have  three  children they raised on that ranch.  Their two sons, Andrew and Frank, attend New Mexico State University, and  their daughter, Kyle, is a high school  senior.  The Krentz family story is similar in  many ways to the experiences of hundreds of other ranchers in this border  region. Yet to them and their children  it  is unique and  it  is personal and  dreadful in the impact it has had on  their lives and the future viability of  their way of life as ranchers.  Just one tiny statistic that begins to  tell the story of what these folks face  every single day. In the month of November, 2002, in the Tucson Sector of  the U.S. Border Patrol, which includes  Cochise County, where this the Krentz  ranch is located, the Border Patrol apprehended 23,000 border crossers.  That was in the month of November.  It is anybody’s guess as to how many  people actually come across, but many,  many people would suggest that the  ratio is just about maybe one in five,  and that is a very conservative estimate, that for every one person we apprehend on the border, at least five get  through. Again, I think it is closer to  one in ten, but I will accept even this  VerDate Jan 31 2003  03:58 Mar 26, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K25MR7.052 H25PT1 ",2003

This issue affects the 656 hardworking YMCA employees in Kentucky  that initially brought this problem to  my attention.  With its presence felt in more than  10,000 communities nationwide, YMCA  is  the Nation’s  largest  community  service organization. Each year YMCA  employees  deliver  important  health  and social services to over 17.9 million  Americans. The YMCA mission to ‘‘put  Christian  principles  in  practice  through programs that build healthy  spirit for mind, body, for all’’ is indeed  a very noble endeavor. YMCAs serve  people of all faiths, incomes, ages, and  race. This generous organization never  turns people away for inability to pay.  YMCA’s strength is in both its dedicated employees and the people they  bring  together  through  its  service.  Each local YMCA is tailored to the specific needs of the community in which  it serves. The employees of the YMCA  do God’s work each day. This bill ensures that they will continue to receive  the pensions they have earned and deserve.  With over $3 billion in assets, the  YMCA pension plan has been in place  for over 80 years. The plan has always  been considered as a ‘‘church pension  plan.’’ There are no problems with the  operation of the plan and the IRS has  said it is in full compliance—with one  possible exception.  Generally, in order to be considered a  ‘‘church plan’’ the sponsoring organization must be affiliated with a specific  church. Traditionally, the YMCA has  not affiliated with any one church, but  has instead identified with a  ‘‘Christian affiliation.’’ This bill would clarify that the plan will continue to be a  ‘‘church plan’’ despite the fact that the  YMCA is not limited to one specific  church or religious denomination. It is  important that Congress clarifies this  technicality to ensure that the beneficiaries of the YMCA pension plan receive the benefits they have earned and  deserve.

The bedrock of our close relationship with  Greece is our mutual devotion to freedom and  democracy and our unshakable determination  to fight, if need be, to protect these rights.  Greek philosophers and political  leaders— Cleisthenes and Pericles and  their successors—had  great  influence  upon America’s  Founding Fathers  in  their creation of  these  United States.  We, as a nation, owe a great debt  to  Greece. Greece  is  the birthplace of democracy, as we know it.  Thomas  Jefferson  said,  ‘To  the ancient  Greeks, we are all indebted for the light which  led  ourselves  (American  colonists)  out  of  Gothic darkness.’ ’  The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,  were an attack on democracy and freedom— not just against our people, but also against all  freedom-loving  people  everywhere  in  the  world.

148,,108,0.411,101,2003-03-25,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize an outstanding naval officer, Commander Carol Hottenrott, who served  with distinction and dedication during the past  year for the Assistant Secretary of the Navy,  FM&C, as a Navy Appropriations Liaison Officer in the Appropriations Matters Office. It is a  privilege  for me  to recognize her many outstanding achievements and commend her for  the superb service she has provided  to  the  Department of  the Navy,  the Congress, and  our great Nation as a whole.  During her tenure in the Appropriations Matters Office, which began  in March of 2002,  Commander Hottenrott has provided members  of the House Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Defense as well as our professional and associate staffs with timely and accurate support  regarding  the Department of  the Navy’s Operations and Maintenance, Personnel  and medical  programs  budget  accounts. Her valuable contributions have enabled the Defense Subcommittee and the Department of the Navy to strengthen its close  working relationship and to ensure the most  modern, well-trained and well-equipped Naval  Forces attainable for the defense of our great  Nation.  Commander Carol Hottenrott  has  demonstrated outstanding leadership in the Navy  and on Capitol Hill. She continues to be recognized as a truly unique naval officer and is  one of a very select group of female naval officers  to command a ship. She distinguished  herself as a Commanding Officer of a Mine  hunting ship and has been selected for command of another combat vessel. Exemplifying  the best  this country has  to offer, she has  made many personal sacrifices in the interest  of the Navy and our Nation. Having worked  with her on the highly complex operations and  maintenance issues impacting the port of San  Diego, I know she is a wonderful person and  officer, and a bright and talented individual. Although she departs today to return to sea on  the staff of  the new Pacific Expeditionary  Strike Group, I expect that she will continue  rising through the Navy leadership ranks and  that we will have many opportunities to work  together again in the future. I wish her every  success in her new job, and call upon my colleagues to join me in wishing her ‘ ‘fair winds  and following seas.’ f  NOMINEES  FOR  THE  REGIONAL  ACADEMIC  ALL-STAR  TEAM  FROM THE PENNYROYAL REGION  IN WESTERN KENTUCKY  HON.

150,,108,-0.376,108,2003-03-25,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I am delighted  to pay tribute to one of my most extraordinary  constituents, a beacon of kindness  in  the  world, Ms. Nancy Rivard. This outstanding  woman is a former airline attendant who single-handedly founded the Airline Ambassadors  International (AAI), an extraordinary non-profit  organization dedicated to improving the lives  of needy children from all over the world.  Ms. Rivard’s desire to establish this organization, dedicated to making a difference in the  lives of needy children began over ten years  ago. After years of trial, turmoil and rejection  her dream finally became a reality when AAI  was founded in 1996. Every year this wonderful organization makes a difference in the lives  of over 100,000 children in 25 of the world ’s  most troubled countries by having its members  hand-deliver  food, clothing, medicine, school  supplies and personal care products directly to  the children in the receiving countries. Since  its inception AAI has seen the ranks of its volunteers grow  to more  than 400 people who  have contributed over 600,000 hours of their  time.  Mr. Speaker, this remarkable organization is  made up of 4 different components. First, the  Humanitarian Aid Program  coordinates  the  local effort  to collect and sort humanitarian  and medical supplies. Volunteers arrange the  pick up and packing of donations and  then  with  the help of a participating airline,  they  ship the items to the countries that are currently receiving aid. From there the donations  are hand-delivered directly to the children. The  volunteers also are involved with facility refurbishing, holiday parties and planting  trees.  Second  is  the Children’s Escort Program,  which supplies volunteer escorts for children in  need of medical care in the United States. AAI  provides the adoption agency or nonprofit organization with a previously screened and  qualified escort at a significantly reduced airfare. The child’s airfare is provided through the  ‘Miles for Kids’ ’ program. The third component  is the Youth Programs. These programs give  young people the chance to be involved in the  humanitarian missions, a unique opportunity  that offers adolescences  the chance  to help  needy kids their own age and experience kindness and compassion on a whole new level.  AAI also co-sponsors an annual youth art  competition  that has  received entries  from  over  60,000  children  in  approximately  62  countries. Finally, the fourth component of AAI  involves members  volunteering  at  special  events,  locally, nationally and  internationally  with goals to better the world and bring goodwill into action.  Mr. Speaker, Nancy Rivard’s  tireless work  has helped countless children in their time of  need. Her  selflessness, passion and drive  have not only given the world ’s needy children  the chance to experience things they had only  dreamed of, but more  importantly, she has  given these children a glimmer of hope. Her  plan to build Airline Ambassadors into an organization of even more strength and ability is  an ambitious plan, one  that should be applauded. Nancy was recently presented with a  well-deserved ‘ ‘National Caring Award ’ ’ for her  accomplishments with AAI.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to say that this  remarkable woman is one of my longtime constituents and it delights me to think that I am  representing such a fine example of the American people. I urge all my colleagues to join  me in paying tribute to Nancy Rivard, for this  exceptional woman is truly an inspiration to all  of us, proving that one person can make a difference. f  COMMENDING  THE  ADMINISTRATION’S POSITION ON THE ISSUE  OF TAIWAN  HON. PHIL ENGLISH  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 25, 2003 ",2003
151,,108,0.251,108,2003-03-25,Mr. ENGLISH.," Mr. Speaker, Secretary of  State Powell was in Beijing recently, asking for  Beijing’s assistance on  the  issues of North  Korea and Iraq. Beijing responded by asking  the Bush Administration  to consider  ‘tradeoffs, ’ ’ especially more American  flexibility on  the issue of Taiwan. I want to commend Secretary Powell and the Bush Administration for  refusing to participate in this sort of irresponsible horse-trading.  We continue to support peaceful solution to  any political disagreements between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. At  the  same  time, Congress has repeatedly voiced  its commitment to defend the people of Taiwan  from aggression, and we have backed  this commitment with economic, political and  military cooperation. I believe that this Administration has done an exemplary job of reinforcing this commitment by refusing to compromise Taiwan’s security in the face of Beijing’s attempts at coercion.  Meanwhile, Beijing has turned a deaf ear to  Taiwan President Chen Shui-Bian’s calls  for  renewed dialogue between the two. This lack  of communication will certainly result in misunderstanding, and could  lead  to dangerous  miscalculations by both sides. These sorts of  miscalculations can in turn lead to the sort of  military confrontation that we all wish to avoid.  I therefore strongly urge Beijing ’s new leadership to remove Chinese missiles from the area  along  the Taiwan Strait and  to embrace a  peaceful approach  to managing  the crossstrait relationship.  It is time for bilateral dialogue on economic  cooperation, democratic governance, improved  human  rights and peaceful  resolution of all  issues between Taiwan and the People ’s Republic of China. f  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LABORERS’ INTERNATIONAL UNION  HON. GEORGE MILLER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 25, 2003 ",2003
152,,108,0.484,108,2003-03-25,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  I know  that all Members of  the  House of Representatives will want to join me  in saluting the Laborers’ International Union of  North America (LIUNA) on the 100th anniversary of  its  founding. LIUNA,  through  its millions of members over  the years, has  long  played a vital role in building America through  the construction of highways, bridges, dams  and power plants,  factories, office buildings,  schools, churches, hospitals, apartments, and  houses throughout the country.  The first president of the AFL-CIO, Samuel  Gompers,  convened  the meeting  in April,  1903, that resulted in the creation of the International Hod Carriers’ and Building Laborers’  Union of America. That union represented just  8,000 workers.  In  1965,  the  name was  changed to the Laborers’ International Union  of North America to reflect the expansion of  the union beyond the construction field.  Today, LIUNA  consists of approximately  800,000 members  in more  than 650  locals  throughout the country. LIUNA members work  in a wide variety of fields including local, state  and  federal governments, health care, shipbuilding and hazardous waste removal.  LIUNA is one of the most innovative unions  in the labor movement, with state of the art  training centers across North America. LIUNA  has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment  to protecting  the  rights of  laborers and  is  among  the most successful unions at organizing within the labor federation today.  LIUNA’s success is predicated on the protection and promotion of its members—goals  that are achieved through the dedication and  hard work of union officers and  their  representatives working at all  levels of government. The efforts of these men and women to  protect and enhance the welfare of LIUNA’s  members serves to better the lives of all workers throughout the United States.  LIUNA’s efforts to raise the standard of living for laborers are deserving of our attention  and admiration. This is an extraordinary union  whose  leadership works hard every day  to  protect members’ health and safety, provide  laborers a strong voice in the workplace, provide extensive skill training to empower members to reach their full potential, and perhaps  most  importantly,  to ensure dignity,  respect  and security for laborers in the workplace.  Mr. Speaker,  I  join LIUNA’s officers and  members  in celebrating  their 100th Anniversary, and  I salute  the work of  the Laborers  International Union of North America. I encourage my colleagues  to similarly  respect  the  positive  impacts LIUNA has had within  their  home districts and states, and  I encourage  them to express their support of this historic  anniversary. f  182 YEARS OF FREEDOM AND  INDEPENDENCE IN GREECE  HON.

153,,108,0.274,108,2003-03-25,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in commemoration of the 182 years that have passed  since the Greek people ’s revolution from the  Ottoman Empire. Nearly 400 years ago,  the  Greek people embarked on a powerful revolution  against  the Ottoman  oppressors. As  Bishop Germanos of Patras raised the Greek  flag at Agia Lavras following the fall of Constantinople,  the  ancient Greeks  forged  a  mighty wave of democracy and freedom.

154,,108,-0.306,115,2003-03-25,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  recognize  the achievements and  life of our  former colleague, Herbert Leon Callahan, universally known as Sonny. I appreciate the invitation by our colleague, JOBONNER, Sonny’s  worthy successor,  to express my  thoughts  about Sonny.  Born and raised in Mobile, Alabama, Sonny  graduated from McGill Institute High School in  Mobile, and went to serve his country honorably in the United States Navy from 1952 to  1954. Later, he attended the University of Alabama, Mobile.  Following a successful career in business,  and terms in the Alabama state House of Representatives and state Senate, Sonny was  elected to the 99th Congress. He went on to  serve his district and his state with distinction  for the next 16 years. During this time, he developed  into a key authority on  foreign aid  matters in the House, and he rose to become  one of  the  ‘Cardinals,’ ’  the Appropriations  subcommittee chairmen.  His involvement with foreign aid allowed him  to do great good deeds to help those in need,  and it allowed him to develop friendships with  a unique cast of characters. I laughed at Sonny’s quip about his efforts with the rock star,  Bono, which he described as the ‘ ‘Sonny and  Bono show.’ Also,  first as  the Chairman of  the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations,  then as  Chairman of  the Energy and Water Subcommittee, Sonny always honored every appropriations request with fairness and a muchappreciated willingness to work with members.  Sonny helped me personally in my efforts to  improve the conditions of my district in rural  West Virginia, and I want to publicly and personally thank him for his efforts.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that we are greatly  privileged to serve our constituencies and our  Nation during our time in office. The ‘ ‘People’s  House’ ’ in which we serve is a monument to  the American people, and it is a symbol of our  country’s  sustained  democracy.  Let  it  be  known that during his time in office Sonny Callahan served the People’s House with distinction.  I wish Sonny well  in his retirement. As  I  have said elsewhere, our loss is a clear gain  for his family and friends.

155,,108,-0.428,1,2003-04-07,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  much has been written recently about  Senator  Daniel  Patrick Moynihan,  scholar,  politician,  diplomat,  public  servant. We have been reminded again,  in the wake of his passing, of his intellectual  and  political  contributions  dealing with the most sensitive and  complex questions of our society. Ideas  that were controversial when he first  advanced them are now accepted as  conventional wisdom.  I rise today to salute this giant and  his greatest gift, which is to influence  how America faces its challenges. He  was regarded appropriately as a tremendous architectural  influence. No  one over the last third of a century has  done more to shape American communities. His influence can be seen from  the steps of the Capitol with the creation of the Pennsylvania Avenue Redevelopment Corporation. He worked  to restore once magnificent James Farley Post Office in New York back to  life as a new Penn Station. He was the  intellectual  force behind the revolutionary 1991 ISTEA legislation, allowing communities to use transportation  resources to shape their development  rather  than  transportation  choices  shaping our communities. His legacy  gave more power to citizens at all levels and made the money go farther to  do more and better things.  As we begin the reauthorization this  Congress of his landmark ISTEA legislation, we deal with many opportunities to revitalize America’s communities through wise infrastructure investment, a critical and underappreciated part of the Moynihan  legacy.  But, Mr. Speaker, I think there is an  even more important part of his legacy  for those of us who serve in this Chamber. At a time when our problems appear more complex and difficult and  when our divisions appear deeper than  ever before, Senator Moynihan gave us  a blueprint for channeling the riches  and power of America to greatness at  home and abroad. At a time when the  activities  here  somehow make  the  most monumental  occasions  appear  smaller than life, we can look to this  intellectual and political giant, himself  larger than life, who had a gift to magnify the things he said and did. His advice for us would be to put aside the  narrow and the partisan, not to rationalize what we know to be reckless or  inappropriate in the name of the legislative process, and have the courage to  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

156,House,108,0.461,8,2003-04-07,Mr. POMBO.," Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1368  designates the postal facility at 7555  Pacific Avenue in Stockton, California,  as the Norman D. Shumway Post Office  Building. I wish to thank the entire  California delegation for their support  of this legislation, as well as the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. TOMDAVIS)  for his committee’s expeditious handling of the bill.  Former  Congressman  Shumway’s  leadership reflected three major goals:  first, to restore government back to  the people; second, to build the people’s  confidence in government; and third, to  make government accessible and effective for his constituents.  Elected to Congress  in 1978, Norm  was overwhelmingly reelected to each  succeeding congressional term until his  retirement in January 1991.  Norm was a man of the people who  always made time for personal meetings at his home and in D.C. He was  keenly aware of and committed to the  needs of all of his constituents, whether they were children or seniors, farmers or businessmen, military or civilian. As the representative of a large  farming district, Norm worked hard to  promote policies enabling farmers to  meet the demands of the domestic marketplace. He was a strong proponent of  senior citizens as he brought several  aging committee hearings to the district  to address  the needs of older  Americans.  Before and after his service in Congress, Norm worked diligently for the  people of California on the San Joaquin  Board of Supervisors, where he served  as both chairman and vice chairman,  and the Public Utilities Commission in  California where he served as commissioner for 4 years.  Naming the Pacific Avenue Post Office after Norm is a small tribute to  the Congressman for his contributions  to California and our Nation. ",2003
157,House,108,0.519,8,2003-04-07,Mr. DOOLITTLE.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chance to join in this salute to Norm Shumway as we prepare  to name this post office in his honor.  In reviewing his biography, Norm has  been a son of San Joaquin, and quite  legitimately is. I do note in his biography he was actually born in Phoenix,  Arizona, on July 28, 1934. In 1939 his  family moved to California and was  Norm was educated  in the Stockton  public  school  system and graduated  from Stockton High School in 1952. He  received his A.A. degree from Stockton  which is now known as San Joaquin  Delta Community College in 1954, and  then as the gentleman  from Illinois  (Mr. DAVIS) mentioned, Norm began his  acquaintanceship with Japan when he  served a church mission there from 1954  to 1958.  When he returned from the Orient,  Mr. Shumway enrolled at the University of Utah from which institution he  received a Bachelor of Science degree  in political science in 1960, and then he  commenced his  legal  education and  graduated with a Juris Doctorate degree from the University of California’s  Hastings College of Law in San Francisco in 1963.  Mr. Shumway had been a partner in a  Stockton law firm, and then in 1974 a  vacancy occurred in the San Joaquin  Board of Supervisors, and pursuant to  State law at the time, the Governor,  Ronald Reagan, appointed Norm to fill  that vacancy and he was later elected  to the same position and was reelected  in 1976, and he served as chairman of  the Board of Supervisors in 1978 prior  to his election that same year to the  United States House of Representatives.  Norm, I think it was mentioned, and  his lovely wife Luana are the parents  of six children and 30 grandchildren. As  has been mentioned before, he has been  a very faithful member of the Church  Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and  has served in numerous positions; after  VerDate Dec 13 2002  02:41 Apr 08, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A07AP7.010 H07PT1 ",2003
158,House,108,-0.172,15,2003-04-07,Mr. SKELTON.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise today to commend our troops on  the battlefields  in  Iraq. Their  continuing advance to victory is a product  of that courage and ingenuity under  changing conditions. It is also the results of extraordinarily detailed and  adaptive planning. That itself was built  on the knowledge and wisdom instilled  by our war colleges.  These  institutions  in every service  make great officers into outstanding  war-time  leaders. Military historians  have noted that the allied victory in  World War II is due in no small part to  the fact that some of our top military  leaders both attended and taught at  the services war colleges. I believe the  same will be said for Operation Iraqi  Freedom. In all of the services, including the Army’s exceptional war college  at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, our officers  are skilled in the art of strategy, operations, and tactics that are the foundation of an  innovative and effective  military campaign.  The instruction provided by our service intermediate- and senior-level war  colleges came to fruition in the war  plan  developed  by General Tommy  Franks and his team. The plan outlined  a truly joint effort that has kept American forces a constant 48 to 72 hours  ahead of Iraqi responses. The strategy  has hit hard at Iraqi leadership and Republican Guard targets, degrading command and control and  isolating the  bands of  fighters unwise enough  to  take on our troops. Quite simply, the  Iraqi military is already incapable of  fighting in a coordinated way at division, brigade, and battalion levels. This  is a  stunning military achievement  that would not have  been  possible  without leaders educated in the art of  war. And we as a Nation owe a debt to  the  professional military  education  system that provided that education to  today’s senior military leaders.  The current American infiltration of  Baghdad demonstrates our disciplined  ability to encircle the city and deal  with the remnants of resistance, sector  by sector. The strategy also shows a sophisticated approach to enhancing the  psychological impact of each military  action taken. By removing the will of  the Iraqis to fight, our victory and the  Iraqi people’s liberation will come that  much more quickly. I believe that military historians and  strategists will  long study the plans of this operation,  the planning that was a product of the  American war college system will become the lesson plan for future officers.  As  British  Air  Marshal  Brian  Burridge said this morning, the U.S.  advance into Bagdad has been unique.  Historians and academics will pour  over it for years, and this will be a required case study for students of war.  We should be proud of our troops and  of the officers who lead them. But we  should also feel deep pride for the system of institutions that has made this  leadership as exceptional as it is. f  ",2003
159,House,108,-0.256,15,2003-04-07,Mr. SPRATT.," Madam Speaker,  I  would like to open up by saying when  the President sent us his budget this  year the Office of Management and  Budget, OMB, acknowledged that the  surplus of the $5.6 trillion which we all  hailed 2 years ago is gone. It has vanished. In  fact, OMB now says there  never was such a surplus when they,  the Office of Management and Budget,  adjust the surplus to account for the  economy as they see it now. The 10year surplus is no longer $5.6 trillion.  It is $2.4 trillion. And all of that $2.4  trillion  has  been  committed,  or  I  should say overcommitted, by policy  action to the tune of $129 billion. That  is what we would incur if we did not do  anything else, mostly due to the tax  cuts passed in June of 2001.  So any additional tax cuts and any  additional  spending  beyond  current  services will go straight to the bottom  line. There is no surplus anymore to  mitigate or cushion or offset that deficit. It goes straight to the bottom line  and adds dollar to dollar to the deficit.  The arithmetic is simple.  Knowing that, the President of the  United States nevertheless proposes $2  trillion  in additional policy actions,  legislative actions here, mostly, once  again, in new tax cuts that will add $2  trillion to our national debt over the  next 10 years.  Now, when the Congress Budget Office sent us their analysis of the President’s budget as they are required by  law to do, they saw deficits out as far  as they forecast. As a matter of fact,  when you back out Social Security as I  think you  should because  I do not  think we should be spending Social Security, and everybody on this House  floor who was here just a couple of  years ago  foreswore  the practice of  ever again spending the Social Security surpluses, so when you back it out  and look at what CBO portrays and depicts  the  President’s  budget  to  produce, you will see that over the  next 10 years they  forecast deficits,  without a Social Security surplus to  offset them, deficits of $400 billion at  least every year for the next 10 years.  So when you remove the Social Security surplus from the equation, the accumulation of deficits  is  $4  trillion  over  the next  10 years. As a consequence of this budget that the President sent up here, in a way both Houses  repudiated  the  President’s  budget.  Both Senate Republicans and House  Republicans rejected what the President sent. When the House Republicans  saw the President’s budget, they warmly embraced his tax cuts. They were  ready for another round of tax cuts, despite  our  experience with  the  last  round; but they at least acknowledged  the responsibility to go find some offsets, some spending offsets that would  help mitigate, reduce, cushion the impact of these huge tax cuts. The President was seeking another $1.4 trillion  in tax cuts as much again this year as  he did back in 2001.  They went back looking for some offsets; and they came up with $470 billion  in what we call, in budget parlance,  reconciliation tax cuts. These are reconciliation spending cuts. These are directives to the committees of jurisdiction that write legislation that deal  with Medicare and Medicaid and school  lunches, a whole array of entitlement  programs, to go change that permanent  law so that they can save a certain  sum of money by a certain date.  In this case, as I said, the total of all  those reconciliation instructions came  to  $470 billion. Our Republican colleagues wanted to cut Medicare over  the next 10 years by $262 billion, Medicaid by $110 billion, veterans by $15  billion on the mandatory side, the entitlement side and 15 more on the veterans health care side, education by  $9.4 billion on  the mandatory  side.  That would have to come out of school  lunches and student loans, government  pensions $40 billion, the railroad retirement program, a vested benefit if there  ever was one, $3.7 billion.  Well, those offsets had a short shelf  life. They survived attack in the Committee on the Budget. They all voted  for it on the Republican side of the  committee; but during the markup, the  chairmen of these different committees  who were about to be the object of  these reconciliation instructions came  forth and they said, you have got to  give us some relief. We cannot do it. So  the number was cut from $470 billion to  $265 billion.  VerDate Dec 13 2002  02:41 Apr 08, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07AP7.032 H07PT1 ",2003
160,House,108,0.391,22,2003-04-07,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker,  good  evening to my colleagues. I appreciate  the opportunity to address our group  this evening.  There  are  a  number  of  different  issues I want to talk about, but the  issues I am going to talk about are  going to focus on one thing, and that is  America.  I come back from a weekend in Colorado, spending time with my constituents out there, constituents of all different types of backgrounds. I can tell  my  colleagues  that  the morale  in  America, the patriotism in America I  do not think could be stronger. These  people that are against this war, I have  some appreciation of  some of  their  thoughts; but I want the Members to  know that the people that are making  all these anti-U.S. statements within  the borders of this country I am absolutely convinced are a very small part  of our population.  I am very impressed, very impressed,  with  the  amount  of  support,  overwhelming support, for the troops of the  United States of America. Thank God  we are Americans. I feel so good about  that. I want to tell my colleagues, on  the back of my pickup I have a bumper  sticker. My colleagues have all seen it  before. A  lot of my colleagues may  have it on the back of their pick up or  their car. It is pretty simple. It says:  ‘‘America, love it or leave it.’’ That is  not a bumper sticker that defies anybody’s right for their freedom of speech  under the first amendment.  In fact, we know here on this House  floor we have lots of debate on this  House floor. We are very intense debate. It is one of the checks and balances in the government that we have  of this country, but it at some point in  time even on this House floor no matter how  intense the debate  is, with  very few exceptions, at that point people on  this  floor  I can  say almost  unanimously,  almost  unanimously,  love this country, and I see no reason  to be apologetic, no reason to be apologetic for saying to people if they do not  love America, leave it. There are lots  of choices in this world, but one does  not have to go very far from American  borders to understand that this is the  one Nation of the few nations in the  world that do not have a problem with  people leaving. Our big problem is so  many people want to come into this  country because they understand the  fundamental principles that have made  this country so great, that have made  this country stand out in world history  as the leading country for democracy,  as the country greater than any other  country in recorded history, the country that has done more for its neighbors, as one of the few countries in history, after it goes to war or moves into  other people’s territory, as Colin Powell, our Secretary of State, so justifiably said the other day, the only time  that the United States of America has  kept territory in a foreign country was  under a request for someplace to bury  our soldiers.  This country has got a  lot to be  proud of, and I carry that bumper stick  with a great deal of pride, ‘‘America,  love it or leave it.’’ And I can tell my  colleagues there are a lot of people in  this country, by far the overwhelming  majority, they love this country, and  they love what this country stands for,  and they support the troops of the  United States of America.  I know we have got some people out  there, and I am going to address some  of their  issues, some protesters out  there that are not only not supporting  the  troops of  the United States of  America, but in California and in other  places in this Nation, they are actually  carrying signs that say: ‘‘We support  our troops as long as they shoot their  officers.’’  ‘‘We support our troops as  long as they shoot our officers.’’ It is  an absolute disgrace.  We have other people who, for self-interest, frankly, on the Democratic side,  very limited but on that side who are  seeking the office of President itself  who stand out there and say we need a  regime change in this country.  Let me tell my colleagues about the  administration that we have,  in my  opinion, running this country. George  W. Bush, I think he is doing an outstanding job. What President in history  has had two wars, has had a September  11, has  lost the Space Shuttle, was  handed a bad economy and it is still  going south? The strength of our President is second to none. The strength of  our President is what will lead this  country through this fog, and I can tell  my colleagues that when the storm  came  in, when  the  conditions  got  nasty, we did not see our President anchor the boat at the dock where it was  the safest. We saw our President turn  that boat into the storm to guide people through the storm.  In my opinion and I want to tell my  colleagues in the opinion of Democrat  and Republican, in my travels, in my  calls, in my contacts throughout this  country, Democrat and Republican admire the President that we have. They  think this President is up to the job.  They think this President is leading  the country  in  the  right direction.  They think this President is doing the  right thing in taking out of power the  worst mass murderer in the history of  the world and, by the way, the worst  mass murderer of Muslims. Saddam  Hussein has killed more Muslims than  any  other man known  in  recorded  world history, and that effort to take  him out is being led by our President.  By the way, I do not want to downplay the assistance we are getting from  our allies. I have time after time after  time read in newspapers or heard people say this is the United States picking a fight. As Worley says in his song  ‘‘Have you Forgotten?’’ which is the  number one song on the country hits,  after September 11 maybe we are out  there looking to resolve this situation,  but the fact is it is not the United  States standing alone. In fact, if we  take a look at the coalition that our  President and his cabinet has put together, it is very impressive. Our longtime solid allies, Tony Blair and the  British, and Tony Blair,  if my colleagues want to take a look at an example of a profile in courage, we have  got  it right there. The British, the  United Kingdom, a country that has  long understood  freedom, a country  that has very judiciously, very judiciously, used their military might for  good and just causes.  And then we can go on to the European continent, and I hear people say  this  is a  split between  the United  States and Europe. It is not a split between the United States and Europe. It  is a split between the United States  and the French, the United States and  the German  leadership,  the United  States and Belgium; but it is not a  split between Europe. Jacques Chirac  would like us to think that France is  Europe. Jacques Chirac would tell the  other countries in Europe that France  is the ruling country of Europe and  that when France speaks, it is as if it  is the voice for Europe, and it is not. In  fact, we have more countries in Europe  that  support  the United States  of  America and our position than support  the position of the French.  Take a look at it. We can start with  the British. We can go to the Italians.  We can go to the Spanish. We can go to  the Polish. We can go to the Netherlands.  We  can  go  to  Australia.  Throughout the world nations throughout this world and their leadership recognize that the mission undertaken by  the United States and that willing coalition is the mission that is correct. It  is the mission for the right cause, and  it is the right time to undertake that  mission.  We have strong support, strong support amongst our allies. This is not the  United States acting alone, although I  will tell my colleagues that our country must always be prepared, must always  be  prepared  because  of  our  strength, because of our leadership, because of our history of democracy, we  must always be prepared to act for the  interests of humanity even if it means  VerDate Dec 13 2002  02:59 Apr 08, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07AP7.047 H07PT1 ",2003
161,,108,-0.294,78,2003-04-07,Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Edward G. Lloyd, a  well-respected leader in the not-for-profit organization community. Today he is honored by  Molloy College at  its annual St. Martin de  Porres Minority Scholarship Dinner Dance for  his leadership in the non-profit community.  As the senior vice president of operations  and chief financial officer of the United States  Fund  for UNICEF (USF), Edward  is responsible  for all  financial accounting, human  resources, and all administrative support operations for the USF. He also serves on a threeperson committee charged with the strategic  management of the USF.  Before joining USF Edward was executive  vice president and chief financial officer of the  nation’s largest community building organization,  Local  Initiatives  Support Corporation  (LISC).  Although Edward is extremely busy, he still  finds  time  to help  the community  in other  areas. He is a board member of the United  Enterprise Fund, chairman of  the Business  Resource Investment Service Center (BRISC),  and sits on the Board of the New York Metropolitan Chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  I  congratulate Edward on  receiving  this  honor and applaud his devotion to helping others. He dedicates himself  to  improving  the  lives of others and I thank him for this on behalf of the people of not only the 4th Congressional District but the best of New York who  benefited from his hard work and dedication. HONORING STATE SENATOR  CHUCK S. POOCHIGIAN  HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 7, 2003 ",2003
162,,108,0.484,78,2003-04-07,Mr. RADANOVICH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize State Senator Chuck S.  Poochigian on  the occasion of being voted  ‘Man of the Year ’ ’ by the Armenian National  Committee of Central California. The banquet  honoring Senator Poochigian will be held Saturday, April 12, 2003, at the Holy Trinity Armenian Apostolic Church Hall  in Fresno, California.  Chuck Poochigian was born in Fresno, California, in 1949, as a third generation resident  of the San Joaquin Valley. He received his degree  in Business Administration  from California State University, Fresno  in 1972, and  his law degree from the University of Santa  Clara  in 1975. Mr. Poochigian served as a  member of the California Air National Guard  for six years. He practiced general civil and  business  law  from 1975 until November of  1988, at which time he was chosen, by thenGovernor George Deukmejian, to serve as the  Chief Deputy Appointments Secretary on the  Governor’s senior staff. Chuck assisted  the  Governor in the selection of key administration  officials.  In  1991, Governor  Pete Wilson  named Chuck as his Appointment Secretary,  where he served until his election to the State  Assembly in 1994.  Senator Poochigian ’s reputation  for strong  leadership and hard work was recognized by  California Journal magazine, which ranked him  as  the Assembly Republican  ‘Rookie of  the  Year’ ’ for 1996. In 2000, Chuck was chosen  ‘Outstanding Senator ’ ’ by the California State  Sheriffs’ Association, and received the ‘ ‘Legislator of the Year ’ ’ Award from the California  State Student Association, as well as the California Network of Educational Charters.  Senator Poochigian has received renowned  recognition for his assistance in passing important public safety  legislation and a  transportation package which will significantly benefit local communities. His expertise in business and agriculture in California, and his belief  in  fair and  limited  taxation with minimal  government regulation, have made him a beloved  leader and  respected member of  the  community.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize State  Senator Chuck S. Poochigian  for his meritorious defense of the Central Valley communities of California. His standards and morals  are those of a true genuine leader. I invite my  colleagues to join me in commending Chuck  for his service and hard work and in wishing  him many years of continued success. f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO MR.  LAWRENCE A. BASS  HON.

164,,108,-0.464,85,2003-04-07,Ms. CARSON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to recognize the end of the era for Indianapolis, with the end of the long and exciting career of an Indianapolis broadcasting giant, Lee  Giles.  These are times of trial for our nation. As is  our country’s custom,  in circumstances  like  these we turn our faces steadily toward television, our window on the world, watching the  events of far away, days of desperation and  long nights of noise on parade through our living rooms. In those hours as we celebrate the  devotion and the valor of our armed forces,  we celebrate again  the  tremendous service  television does to inform and link the people.  And Lee Giles, retiring next month as News  Director of WISH TV, Channel 8, in Indianapolis and central Indiana, after forty years at the  station, has witnessed history’s march, at  home in our city and the world around. 1963,  his  first year of service  in  Indianapolis, was  marked by the loss of John F. Kennedy. Then  came the war in Vietnam. 1968, the year he  became news director at WISH, we lost Dr.  Martin Luther King, and Bobby Kennedy, too.  Other  tragedies and other wars,  intermixed  with events of excitement and celebration, followed in full flow.  Many have been  the events—happy and  sad—that he witnessed and helped  to distill  and project to our community during this full  career. And, throughout those years his work  has been underscored by extra service to the  profession: on  the Society of Professional  Journalists/Jane Pauley Task Force on Mass  Communication Education and the faculties of  Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis and Butler University. At the same time,  his life has been punctuated by professional  honor: induction into The Indiana Journalism  Hall of Fame and receipt of the Radio and Television News Directors  Foundation’s  First  Amendment Service Award.  Mr. Speaker, it is ever vital that we recognize, celebrate and honor  those whose accomplishments are an  inspiration  to all. Lee  Giles’  long and steadfast service  to broadcasting, to the vital news center of that art and  to his community, has been a life of true professional distinction. Let us render Lee Giles a  special salute on  the occasion of his retirement. TRIBUTE TO BOB FAUL  HON. SAM FARR  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 7, 2003 ",2003
165,,108,-0.455,85,2003-04-07,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor George Faul, a dedicated and exceptional educator and military serviceman who  served the Monterey Peninsula for over four  decades. George, who was always known as  Bob  to his  friends and  family, passed away  March 29, 2003 at the age of 84.  Bob and I have been neighbors and friends  for years. Anyone who has lived in the closeknit community of Carmel, CA, where I was  raised and still live today, can speak to the  feeling  of  community  that  exists  there.  Through his work, many advances have been  made  towards providing  students  from all  backgrounds with quality education throughout  Monterey County.  Bob began his educational service shortly  after World War II, traveling to community colleges to help them gain accreditation. At that  time, the California community college system  was growing fast to meet the demands of our  returned soldiers, sailors and marines, and  Bob saw a chance  to make a difference.  It  was during his time as a guidance counselor  at the College of the Sequoias in Visalia that  he met his wife Pat, who has also been an active community member. Pat served for many  years on the board of the Monterey Airport,  and was always involved in the daily life of the  students and  faculty at Monterey Peninsula  College. As  the  longest-serving president of  Monterey Peninsula College, Bob immediately  saw a need for greater outreach to students  from underserved populations and set about  creating those networks.  His service in the military during World War  II helped instill that sense of public service, a  feeling that he carried with him his entire life.  Besides being president and a member of the  board of trustees for the college, Bob served  on  the boards of many  local organizations  such as the Community Foundation for Monterey County,  the Monterey Museum of Art,  the Monterey Jazz Festival, the Carmel Bach  Festival, Circle Theater and the American Civil  Liberties Union.  Mr. Speaker, Bob Faul was an exceptional  person, and I am proud to be able to honor  him in this way. He and his wonderful wife Pat  have been outspoken and energetic community members, and I wish to express my condolences to her and their son Robert on Bob ’s  passing. f  EMERGENCY  WARTIME  SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT,  2003 SPEECHOF  HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 3, 2003 The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill.  (H.R. 1559) making  emergency wartime supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30,  2003, and for other purposes: ",2003
166,House,108,-0.454,2,2003-05-06,Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.," Mr.  Speaker, the previous gentlemen spoke  and said that the Democrats have no  plan and have no alternative. The gentleman knows that is false. The Democrats have a solid plan for economic  growth, tax cuts to the middle class,  not to the wealthy, targeting people  who are going to spend it rather than  those who are going to keep it, tax incentives for small business, which are a  solid part of our plan, extending unemployment benefits and helping States  with Medicaid funding. The difference  is that our plan is fiscally responsible  and  fast acting and will prime  the  pump  and  get  the  economy  going  again.  Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to talk  about the threats to our constitutional  freedoms. On September 11, we saw two  planes kill thousands of people in New  York. Our country has been in two conflicts overseas since then. There is insecurity  in the  land. Historically at  times like these, Presidents and Congresses have run rough-shod over our  constitutional  freedoms  and  taken  away individual rights.  A few examples in history: When we  were about  to go  to war with  the  French, the Congress passed and John  Adams signed the Alien & Sedition Act  which made it illegal to talk against  the  government  and  people  were  thrown in jail for doing so. Abe Lincoln  during the Civil War suspended the  Writ of Habeas Corpus. During World  War I, we again threw people in jail for  speaking against the government. During World War II, we rounded up over  100,000 Japanese-American citizens and  put them in internment camps. Fifty  years later we realized we had done  them wrong, and we apologized and  paid them a meager sum. During the  McCarthy era in the Cold War, 160 secret hearings were held and lives were  ruined if you exercised your constitutional rights.  So in sum, war and fear and insecurity can make us lose our moorings.  After September  11, we  rushed  to  pass the PATRIOT Act in 6 weeks. The  PATRIOT Act has some good provisions which update old laws; but it also  seriously undermines the Bill of Rights  and many other provisions. Take one,  the  fourth  amendment, which  says  there shall not be any searches of a  person’s home without a court issuing  a warrant.  One of the worst examples of a fourth  amendment violation in the PATRIOT  Act is a new provision called sneak and  peek. That means you can have a secret search of your house. The government can come into your house, they  can search  it, take things, and you  may  never  learn. Sounds  like  the  fourth amendment out the door.  Under the current regime President  Bush can  label somebody an enemy  combatant, and they are thrown into a  military brig even if they are an American citizen. There is no contact with  the outside world, no attorney, no  charges, no trial, and the person may  be detained indefinitely. That does not  sound like American justice to me. b1245  And then just last week over in the  United States Senate as the New York  Times reports, we had a secret hearing  in the Senate Intelligence Committee.  The White House and the CIA proposed  that the CIA and the military be given  authority  to  collect  intelligence on  American citizens. Not even during the  Cold War did we go this far. We have  always kept separate the FBI, which  does domestic  law enforcement, and  the CIA and the military, which deal  with threats outside the country.  There are many more examples of  our  rights being eroded  today. The  President must be held to account for  these violations. The Congress must  get a grip on these abuses. The Congress should step forward, step up to  the plate and review these policies and  review these laws. The Congress needs  to conduct real oversight in public, not  behind closed doors, and needs to protect our constitutional freedoms. Ben  Franklin said  it best 200 years ago  when he said, ‘‘If we surrender our liberty in the name of security, then we  shall have neither.’’  VerDate Jan 31 2003  03:23 May 07, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K06MY7.002 H06PT1 ",2003

U.S. manufacturers have laid  off 95,000 workers just in the month of  April; and since July of 2000, we have  lost 2.2 million manufacturing jobs in  this country.  We have an obligation through the  money we spend  in this country to  make sure that our companies are buying American. We need to strengthen  the Buy American Act and strengthen  the Berry amendment, which requires  the Department of Defense to buy U.S.made products.  Currently, we are buying our titanium  from Russia to make military  planes, and we are buying our tires for  armored vehicles from France. Meanwhile,  the average U.S.  taxpayer  is  paying $1,000 a year to fund the defense  of this country.  We are willing to stop eating French  fries to protest France; but where the  rubber meets the road, the Department  of Defense is out to lunch. The sad part  is  they are probably eating French  fries.  VerDate Jan 31 2003  03:23 May 07, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K06MY7.036 H06PT1 ",2003
173,House,108,0.627,30,2003-05-06,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," Mr. Speaker, I  would  just  like to take this opportunity to point out to my fellow colleagues and those who are listening in  on C-SPAN, as well as those reading  the CONGRESSIONALRECORD, the tremendous courage it takes for the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TANCREDO)  to be leading this effort.  This is a thankless effort. The gentleman just suggested that when you  add up  these  various  different  approaches of things that are going on  that it is minimizing the importance of  citizenship, and that perhaps this  is  being done by design.  Well, it is clear there is a coalition of  a very powerful people in this country  who do not really believe in the type of  United States of America and the laws  of the population we grew up with, but  instead have more of a  ‘‘global concept’’ and are willing to basically experiment with the rights, if not discard  the  rights, of American citizens  in  order to create this new dream.  These are powerful people. These are  people who have attacked  the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TANCREDO).  They are people that have great deals  of  financial  resources  and  political  power.  I personally am just rising tonight,  when I saw the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TANCREDO) here again trying  to be like Paul Revere and spreading  the word and talking about the danger  ahead of us, I wanted to come down  here and let everyone know what a risk  the gentleman  is taking, that he  is  doing this at great personal expense.  The gentleman could be a ‘‘go-along,  get-along’’ guy. Those of us who try to  make waves here, I try to be very amicable and I know the gentleman from  Colorado does as well. He has a wonderful laugh and smile. We try to be funloving, good people, with good hearts  and of good will; but at the same time,  we are having to tackle  issues that  mean life and death to the people of  the United States. It means whether  our people are going to have their children go to school or not, whether the  standard of living of our people is going  to decline.  Why do we have a situation where  dramatically during the 1990s, there  was such a huge increase in the GNP in  our country, and, yes, the top 20 percent of our country did benefit, but the  working people of this country, by and  large, were kept behind? If you really  trace it back, and the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. TANCREDO) has done this  many times before, we have looked at  the charts,  illegal  immigration, this  overwhelming flood of illegal immigration  in the 1990s dragged down the  standard of living, dragged down any  pressure for an increase in wages for  the working people. I know that I do not come from a  wealthy family, and I am sure the gentleman from Colorado does not either.  We identify with working people.  There is no doubt that in the Federal  Government  there are many people  who come from the elite of our society.  But our job is to watch out for the  working people and the regular human  beings who go off to fight the wars, and  VerDate Jan 31 2003  03:23 May 07, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K06MY7.067 H06PT1 ",2003
174,,108,-0.473,93,2003-05-06,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate and honor  the  life of one of our  country’s  leading disability  rights advocates,  Douglas A. Martin. UCLA and Doug’s family  will commemorate his  remarkable contributions at a memorial on May 8, 2003.  Doug ’s  commitment  to  disability  rights  began in a very personal way. When he arrived for college orientation in a wheelchair, he  was  told he must pass a physical exam  in  order to be in good standing. When Doug did  not pass the physical due to his disability from  contracting polio as a child, he made a vow  that he would pursue his education to make  sure  this would not happen  to anyone else.  Doug applied at UCLA and  later graduated  with the highest honors, earning his bachelor’s  and master’s  degrees  simultaneously. He  completed his Ph.D.  in urban studies  two  years later.  Doug went on to uphold his vow in a truly  remarkable and sweeping fashion. He became  a strong voice for our country’s disabled population and helped shape our national disability  rights policies.  After graduation, he began his career as a  pioneer in the field of disability rights, earning  honors and praise from every level of government, the public sector, and private industry.  Doug  became  an  original  founder  of  the  Westside  Center  for  Independent  Living  (WCIL) and developed a modern model  for  independent living. WCIL remains a leader in  independent  living skills and  is an  indispensable resource  for residents of Los Angeles  County.  Doug was appointed to the State Council on  Disabilities by Governor Edmund G. Brown in  1981, and was  later appointed  to  the Governor’s Advisory Task Force on Long Term  Care, receiving the Governor’s Trophy Award  in 1985. As a member of the State Building  Standards Commission, Doug was  instrumental in the creation of California’s seminal  accessibility requirements. He also was a lead  participant  in developing Section 504 of  the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans  with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.  Doug joined UCLA as a Special Assistant to  the Chancellor in 1989, where he continued to  work until recently. In this capacity, Doug initiated a disability overhaul  for  the campus.  Doug ’s work resulted in UCLA adding access  ramps, handrails and curb ramps in inaccessible areas, and providing volume amplifiers  and special  telecommunications devices on  pay phones for the deaf and hearing-impaired.  Evacuation chairs have been added in numerous buildings for use in emergency situations,  and signs  in Braille have been  installed as  well. Doug also oversaw  the addition of accommodations for students with learning disabilities, including note-takers, disability counseling and peer-mentoring support groups.  When Doug arrived at UCLA in 1989, 75%  of the campus buildings were largely inaccessible  to people with disabilities. Today,  that  number approaches zero, as almost every  building has been modified  to accommodate  the disabled.  In addition to Doug ’s work at UCLA, he has  served on a number of important committees  and has played a vital role in all of them. He  was a member of  the National Academy of  Social Insurance, a member of Senator BARBARABOXER’s Central District Judicial Appointment Advisory Committee, a member of  the  Advisory Committee for the National Council  on Disability, and a participant in both the National Council on Disability Forum and the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation  Forum.  Doug was a founding member of the Society  for Disability Studies, a  fellow with  the  World Institute on Disability, the chair of the  Social Security Subcommittee of the National  Council on Independent Living, and a member  of the National Invitational Working Group.  Our nation owes Doug a debt of gratitude  for his profound commitment to the disabled  and for leaving a legacy of action that will forever enrich their lives. I ask my colleagues to  join me in acknowledging Doug’s tremendous  contributions and in expressing deepest condolences to his family, his colleagues and his  friends. f  HONORING  COACH DOUG DICKEY  UPON  HIS  RETIREMENT  AS  MEN’S ATHLETICS DIRECTOR OF  THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE  HON.

I rise today  to congratulate  the members of  this exceptional club  for such a momentous occasion.  The current members have continued a long  standing Lions Club  tradition of excellence.  They should be proud of their commitment to  assisting their community and fellow citizens  through numerous service activities.  The Roaring Spring Lions Club  is one of  many thousands of local clubs located in 190  countries across the globe, with a world wide  membership of more than 1 million members.  As an internationally known organization, the  many local Lions Clubs make up a large web  of community service projects that range from  improving  the environment,  to helping  local  youth through outreach projects, to assisting  the disabled  in  the community. Lions Club  members are  truly exceptional people and  prove  their commitment  to  the Clubs’ motto  ‘We serve’ ’ each and every day.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have had  the opportunity today to pay tribute to and recognize  the members of  the Roaring Spring  Lions Club for their 50th anniversary. I encourage the members to continue in their efforts to  better  their community  through service oriented projects and I wish them each the best  of luck in all their future endeavors. f  A PROCLAMATION RECOGNIZING  AUSTIN DOUGLAS PICKRELL  HON.

Max Hallman has dedicated his life to education and the community  of Merced has benefited greatly from his efforts.  Max Hallman was  instrumental  in starting  the Honors program at Merced College  thirteen years ago, bringing the Phi Theta Kappa  Honors Society  to  the campus. Max was a  founding member of the Califomia/Nevada Region of the Honors Society, and has received  several awards recognizing his achievements.  Max Hallman has been named Merced College Instructor of the Year, is the recipient of  the National Institute for Staff and Organizational  Development’s  Teaching  Excellence  Award, six different Phi Theta Kappa recognitions and is prominently featured in the directory, Who ‘s Who Among America’s Teachers.  Max Hallman has spent his life teaching the  young to think, to question, to aspire for something greater. Max Hallman has become an  expert  in  the works of Frederick Nietzsche,  who once wrote,  ‘Out of damp and gloomy  days, out of solitude, out of loveless words directed at us, conclusions grow up in us like  fungus: one morning they are there, we know  not how, and they gaze upon us, morose and  gray. Woe to the thinker who is not the gardener but only the soil of the plants that grow  in him!’ ’ Professor Hallman has  long been  teaching his young students to garden —to be  responsible  for  their minds and  lives, and  many of them are the better for it.  It  is my honor and privilege  to recognize  Max Hallman for his service to the community.  Throughout his career, he has distinguished  himself as a leader and mentor. I am delighted  to recognize his service and his retirement as  I wish him the best in the years to come. f  IN HONOR OF MARY BALL  WILLIAMS MIDDLETON  HON. CHARLES B.

Born  in  Charleston, South Carolina  on March  26,  1901, Mrs. Middleton  turned 102  this year.  Since moving to Harlem at the age of 16, she  has demonstrated her commitment to bettering  society. Mrs. Middleton has been an active  member of her church, the Cathedral of United  Methodism in Harlem, NY for over 40 years.  Over the years she served as a member of  the Stewardess Board No. 4 and the United  Methodist women, and as chairperson of Dignity Channel. Her community  involvement  is  also demonstrated through her involvement at  the A. Philip Randolph Senior Citizens’ Center,  the Harlem Council on the Aging, and the New  York City Senior Citizen Volunteers.  I commend Mrs. Middleton on her lifetime of community  involvement and sincerely hope  that  she will continue  to  impart her wisdom and  love on the community for the benefit of today’s youth. f  HONORING CHIEF CAMERON  PHILLIPS  HON.

178,House,108,0.57,20,2003-05-19,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  tonight to recognize a member of the  Texas House from my district and my  hometown of Denton, Texas.  Representative Myra Crownover has  written what I consider to be the most  insightful remarks regarding the recent lack of a quorum in the Texas  House. Her remarks were written and  carried in the Denton Record-Chronicle  last weekend. I ask Members to listen  to Representative Crownover  in her  own words.  ‘‘I would  like to take this opportunity to explain what is at the heart  of the battle between Texas House Republicans and Democrats.  ‘‘Though Republicans and Democrats  debate and disagree on a number of  issues each and every session, none is  as  arduous  or  contention  as  redistricting. While most  legislation concerns issues that cross party lines, such  as children, health care or education,  redistricting is simply about politics  and elections. There is no bipartisan  redistricting. There never has been,  there never will be. It is the nature of  the beast.  ‘‘Although the Legislature addressed  congressional redistricting 2 years ago  in  the  last  legislative  session,  lawmakers could not agree on new lines,  so a panel of three Federal judges did,  and their map led to a 17–15 advantage  for the Democrats. Rather than drawing a map that currently reflects the  political landscape of Texas, the lines  were tooled just enough to keep the  map legal. There is no question that  the current map meets the standards  for redistricting spelled out in law.  ‘‘The argument  for addressing  the  congressional maps this session rests  in the fact that in the 2002 elections  the GOP won every statewide race from  the governor to the courts and took  control over both houses of the State  legislature for the first time since Reconstruction.

179,House,108,0.264,27,2003-05-19,Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, it is  my distinct pleasure to recognize the Honorable LARRYCOMBESTas he completes his final  three weeks serving as a Congressman in the  United States House of Representatives.  In  addition  to  representing  the 19th congressional district of Texas for the past 20 years,  Representative COMBESThas served the entire  U.S. agriculture community as Chairman of  the House Committee on Agriculture. His dedication  to his country, his constituents and  American agriculture should not go unrecognized.  I commend Representative COMBEST for his  hard work and fine leadership while serving as  Chairman of  the House Committee on Agriculture. Although I was elected to Congress in  2000 and only served under his leadership on  the Committee for one term, I was honored to  do so. Throughout the 107th Congress, Chairman COMBESTwas diligent in his efforts to improve farm programs and to ensure the future  of agriculture in America. Due in large part to  his  relentless hours of hard work and outstanding  leadership,  the Farm Security and  Rural Investment Act of 2002 was passed by  Congress and signed  into  law by President  George W. Bush.  I applaud Representative  COMBEST for the strides he made to strengthen agriculture in the United States.  Congressman COMBEST has certainly contributed greatly to our nation and to our agriculture community, and I thank him for all of  his efforts and congratulate him on his accomplishments while serving in the United States  Congress. ",2003
180,House,108,0.351,27,2003-05-19,Mr. HAYES.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  honor  and  commend Congressman  COMBEST for more than 18 years of dedicated  service to the 19th District of Texas.  As a member of the House Committee on  Agriculture, I have appreciated his leadership  as the former chairman and his genuine desire  to pass sound legislation for America’s farmers and ranchers.  LARRY took an approach to crafting the 2002  farm bill that no other legislator took before— he began holding hearings around the country  as well as in Washington, listening to the proLARRY  to  BEST ducers affected by farm policy, asking for concrete  ideas and proposals which helped  the  Committee develop a  farm bill  that met  the  needs of our agriculture industry.  His ability to work in a fair bipartisan manner allowed the committee to establish a bill  that was balanced and supported by members  representing many  regions  of  the United  States.  Throughout the entire process, his tireless  efforts did not go unnoticed by his colleagues  or America’s agriculture sector.  When I go home to North Carolina, I hear  from my own farmers how much the farm bill  has helped their families stay on the farm, and  because of  the  leadership  that LARRY provided, I know my producers have a safety net  that they can count on.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to  serve with LARRYand I wish him and his family the best in the future.  His leadership will be missed but certainly  his accomplishments and all of his efforts will  not be forgotten.  It is again my pleasure to honor congressman LARRYCOMBEST for a job well done. He  is a great statesman and trusted friend. ",2003
181,House,108,0.246,27,2003-05-19,Mr. LAHOOD.," Mr. Speaker, as a  former  member of the House Agriculture Committee,  I would like to pay tribute to Representative  LARRYCOMBEST, who has announced his intention to retire at the end of May. During his  ten terms in Congress, LARRYCOMBESThas  earned a reputation of being a friend of American Agriculture. As Chairman of  the House  Agriculture Committee, Representative COMalways worked  in a  fair and bipartisan  manner to insure that all sides had an opportunity to make their voices heard. This was especially true when the Agriculture Committee  developed what eventually became the 2002  Farm Bill. In order to hear from all interested  parties, Chairman COMBEST held extensive  hearings throughout the country, including one  in my hometown of Peoria, Illinois. I believe  that  this  level of  inclusiveness was a major  factor in Congress passing a Farm Bill that addresses the needs of America’s farmers and  ranchers.  Representative COMBEST’s mark  on  this  Chamber will not only be found in the work he  has done for our Nation’s farmers and ranchers. Representative COMBESTalso served with  distinction as Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. While I  did not have the privilege of serving under his  Chairmanship, as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I know that his legacy of  bipartisanship and integrity remains.  During his tenure in Congress, Representative COMBESTalways worked for the interest of  his constituents, his State, his country, and the  House of Representatives. Knowing  that actions speak louder than words, Representative  COMBEST joined me as co-chair of the House  Bipartisan Retreat Committee to help instill civility and bipartisanship to the proceedings of  Congress.  Representative  missed. ",2003

His unique style of leadership has brought about positive change for his  COMBEST  COMBEST LARRY will  be  sorely  constituency, for the state of Texas, and for  each position he has held as a member of  Congress.  Serving as only the third Representative in  history  from  the 19th Texas Congressional  District, Congressman COMBESThas honored  the statesmen who preceded him in office. Always accessible and a constant voice for the  people, his guiding  strength and  influence  have become standard signatures for his work  in Congress, including the drafting of the 2002  Farm Bill,  the advocacy of medical and scientific advances through Texas Tech University initiatives, and promotion of the Vietnam  Women’s Memorial.  Congressman COMBEST leaves behind  the  conviction to distinguish the need of the people from the will of the people and the courage  to carry on with the good of the people.  He  is a  trusted colleague and a proven  leader. Congressman LARRYCOMBESTwill be  missed. f  ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN  HERITAGE MONTH  ",2003

184,House,108,-0.556,34,2003-05-19,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to  join my colleagues  tonight honoring  the  many contributions of Asian Pacific Americans. In particular, I wish to honor one of my  greatest heroes and long time friend, former  Congresswoman Patsy Mink.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here tonight and  recognize  the many contributions  that Patsy Mink made  to  the people of  this  country, particularly to the girls and women of  this country.  I was privileged to serve with Patsy while  working with her on the House Education and  the Workforce Committee since the beginning  of my tenure in 1992. She served as a mentor  and friend to me while I have worked in Congress and I miss her very much.  Besides being  the  first woman of color  to  serve in the House of Representatives, Patsy  Mink  helped  craft  landmark  legislation  for  women across the country during her 24 years  in Congress. In the early 1970s Patsy played  the key role  in  the enactment of Title Nine,  which prohibits gender discrimination by federally funded institutions.  When most people think of Title Nine, they  think of women’s sports and,  the  impact of  Title Nine of women’s sports can be clearly  seen. Title Nine has increased the numbers of  girls and women who participate in sports in  high school and college.  Even beyond school, we can see the impact  of Title Nine  in  the  impressive accomplishments of American  female athletes at  the  Olympics, and when we  turn on  the TV  to  watch professional women’s basketball and  soccer games.  But, we shouldn’t forget that Title Nine has  also been a major tool for increasing women’s  participation in other aspects of education, as  well.  Even as we stand here on the floor today  Title Nine is being used to make sure that girls  have equal access to classes which teach the  skills that lead to high-wage jobs that women  need to support themselves and their families.  But, Title Nine was not Patsy’s only contribution to the girls and women of America.  Patsy also authored  the Women’s Educational Equity Act, which is still the primary  resource for teachers and parents seeking information on proven methods to ensure gender equity in their schools and communities.  The Women’s Educational Equity Act represents  the Federal commitment  to ensuring  that girls’  future choices and successes are  determined not by their gender, but by their  own interests, aspirations and abilities.  There has been no stronger voice in Congress  for girls, women, and minorities  than  Patsy’s, and it will do Congress proud to remember and honor her not only for her heritage but also  for  the enormous  impact she  made while she was here in Congress.

186,Senate,108,0.091,97,2003-05-19,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to pay tribute to one of the most  extraordinary and courageous people I  have ever had the privilege to know.  Mary Bowers was an integral and beloved member of my staff who sadly  passed away on May 3 at the age of 28.  My thoughts and prayers are with her  husband, Wayne Rolland; her parents,  Betty and Chris Bowers of Hermon,  ME; Mary’s sister, Melissa; and her entire family who she loved so deeply.  Mary’s life was all too tragically brief,  but how rich it was in experience and  love—and how profoundly she taught  us all about the art of living.  On a professional level, Mary was a  tremendous asset to my staff, and I  would be remiss not to recall the myriad ways in which she was the nucleus  of the office. As my Maine scheduler  and Assistant to the Chief of Staff, she  was of extraordinary assistance, and it  is no exaggeration to say that through  her efforts  the people of her home  State of Maine—which she  loved so  dearly—were exceptionally well served.  Yet, it should be said that Mary’s most  significant  contributions  sprang not  from her work in my office—but instead from the positive and irrepressible force of her presence.  I first came to know Mary as a young  volunteer on my campaigns for Congress. She was passionate even then  about politics, and the role that government and  elected officials  could  play in securing for America the blessings and ideals upon which our Nation  was founded. In an era when so many of  our young people feel disaffected and  disenfranchised, Mary believed deeply  that involvement in the process could  make a very real difference—that  it  was a responsibility and an obligation  in return for the fruits of freedom and  opportunity provided by the basic tenets of this great Nation.  As her high school years drew to a  close, Mary sought a nomination to the  U.S. Military Academy at West Point.  It was obvious by then she was not  only a bright young woman, but possessed the kind of exceptional qualities  that would make her a success both at  the Academy and—even more importantly—in  life—honesty,  a  commitment to service, an unassuming yet unmistakable confidence, and an intangible demeanor that inspired others to  their better nature.  Indeed, even early on, Mary embodied  the essence of a  leader. Later, as a  member of my staff, she always took  charge without ever  ‘‘taking over’’.  She would have made a brilliant Army  officer—people would have followed her  anywhere, responding to the genuine  persuasiveness of her personality and  the clarity of her vision.  But Mary’s greatest challenge was  thrust upon her while at the Military  Academy—one far greater than any obstacle course. Young, vibrant, full of  promise—she learned she had cancer.  In the months and years that followed,  in all of the ways that truly count in  this world, she would meet that challenge—and  in  the  process  forever  change the lives of all who were blessed  to know her.  Perhaps what was most heroic about  Mary is that she never allowed herself  to be defined by her disease—yet the  way  in which she comported herself  while fighting her disease epitomized  her very essence—and will surely be  the legacy that lives on in our hearts  and the way in which we lead our own  lives.  Quite simply, Mary was a diminutive  dynamo. Tiny  in stature, she was a  giant  in her  soul. Even  as  cancer  sapped her physical strength, she possessed a deep, more spiritual reserve  from which to draw. Certainly, there  appeared no rational explanation  for  her ability to muster energy. We could  no more understand how she defied the  realities that cancer imposes on the  human body and spirit than we could  determine how she summoned such extraordinary courage.  During her 4 years on my staff, she  endured  numerous,  punishing  treatments—none of which were subtle in  their  physical  impact—even  apologizing for having to go to doctor’s appointments! Throughout it all, her attitude was unfailingly positive and gracious. Any of us would most certainly  have excused Mary for any moodiness  or bristling response, but the opportunity never arose. Rather, she was always more concerned for others than  she was for herself.  With unfailing humor, she had a way  of disarming even the most stressful of  moments and deflating the small absurdities that creep into everyday life.  The treats she baked and brought into  the office—again, even when she was  not feeling well—were a tangible gift  from her heart. And while the rest of  us would be affected by daily trials and  tribulations of a much lesser nature,  Mary was the one whose light shined  into our lives and lifted our emotions.  Indeed—her lifelong love of lighthouses  was entirely appropriate, as she stood  most firm when the seas were at their  roughest  . . .  she was a beacon of  brightness and hope . . . and her presence on the landscape of our lives will  be enduring.  Particularly in our line of work, we  have the opportunity to meet a great  many people—some of high title, others who are the unsung heros of our society. But the universe of those who  truly change the course of our own  lives by their example is much, much  smaller. My staff and I will  forever  count Mary among those individuals.  In my own life, I have known adversity. And yet, Mary has taught me lessons in living I had not yet fully realized. I know  it  is the same  for my  staff—who, to a man and woman loved  and respected Mary and the example  for which she stood. All of us will now  be the personal messengers of her indomitable spirit and, in turn, that part  of Mary that lives on within all of us  will continue to impact the world forever, for the better.  The measure of Mary’s life will never  be the crude yardstick of the number of  years on earth, but rather the number  of  lives  she  touched while  she was  among us. In the words of the great  American author Ralph Waldo Emerson,  ‘‘to  know  even  one  life  has  breathed  easier  because  you  have  lived—this  is  to have  succeeded.’’  I  VerDate Jan 31 2003  05:05 May 20, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G19MY6.060 S19PT1 ",2003

I want to again thank the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. GUTIERREZ) for introducing  this  important  legislation.  I  have to admit it has not been the easiest bill  for me to handle. I have a  Heartland statue of longtime Mr. Cub  Ernie Banks in my office; my father  was a Cubs fan; my former boss, House  Member and Senator Dan Coats was  such a Cubs fan that on the second day  of his honeymoon he went to a Cubs  game; and my subcommittee staff director, Chris Donesa, is not only a Cubs  fan and fanatic, he is a Sammy Sosa fanatic. But I am a White Sox fan like  my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DAVIS); and it is not without  a little heartburn that we are paying  such tribute, because if he were in the  White Sox outfield today, we might be  national champions. I hope the Cubs  can do the same.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of  this measure. ",2003
189,House,108,-0.349,8,2003-06-02,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H. Res. 195, a  resolution  to  congratulate  Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs for hitting  500 major league home runs.  I am proud  to honor Sammy because he  embodies  the Latino values of  family, hard  work, and perseverance, and for being a great  role model  for all children, Latino and nonLatino alike.  Sammy has overcome  tremendous obstacles to achieve greatness. He was born the  fifth of seven children in a poor family. When  his father died, Sammy was only seven and  he had to support his family by selling orange  juice and shining shoes to help his family keep  food on the table.  He  learned baseball  like most kids  in his  poverty stricken neighborhood,  fielding with  gloves made out of milk cartons, batting with  a tree branch, and hitting a tightly rolled and  taped sock. Who knew that he would grow up  to be the baseball star that he his today?  Sammy demonstrates what we can do when  we try hard enough. Despite being sent back  to the minors several times, he worked hard to  improve himself. In 1989, he batted .238 an  only hit 2 home run in 84 turns at bat. But just  four years later, he showed us that hard work  pays off when he hit 33 homeruns, 93 RBI’s  and made the All-Star Team.  Today we congratulate Sammy Sosa not  only  for being a great ball player or  for his  great story of personal triumph, but we also  give tribute to him as a humanitarian.

190,House,108,-0.666,22,2003-06-02,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr.  Speaker,  when you have been away from this  House for a week, sometimes it is hard  to tell what subject you ought to talk  about  first, because this administration  is the gang that cannot shoot  straight. They cannot tell anybody the  truth about anything.  Whether it is weapons of mass destruction, where we have heard every  story in the whole world, yet everywhere you look people do not believe  the President of the United States,  they do not believe our Secretary of  War or anybody else when they talk  about those weapons of mass destruction. Or we could talk about Medicare,  or we could talk about the tax bill.  My colleague, the gentleman  from  California (Mr. GEORGEMILLER), got up  here and told the game that was run on  the people  in this House when they  slammed the bill through here, this  rubber stamp Congress. They did it in  one 2-hour period. Bang, they passed  out $350 billion, but could not find $3.5  billion to cover the kids of the working  poor in this country. They could give  money to millionaires, $93,000; but they  could not give even $400 to the children  of the working people of this country.  Now, there is an overarching question here and that is this whole question of whether you can solve this  country’s problems by tax cuts. You  know, it takes the British. You have to  read the British newspapers to find out  what is going on in this country. If you  read the Financial Times of London,  they tell us that our President hid  something from us when we were passing this bill. He hid from us a report  done by his Secretary of the Treasury,  Mr. O’Neill. Remember him? He was  the guy before the one we have now.  The one now is Snow, so I guess we will  get Snow jobs. But the guy before was  O’Neill.  Mr. O’Neill said to his staff, suppose  the government could get its hands on  all the revenue it could expect to collect in the future but had to use it  today to pay off future expenditures,  including  debt  service. Would  the  present value of the future revenues  cover the present value of the future  expenditures? Very simple question. He  asked a guy from the Federal Reserve  and his own assistant secretary to sit  down and do this report. They did the  report, and they came back with some  pretty ugly facts. This thing was supposed to go into the budget to talk  about what the future of this country  was about, about those kids that cannot even get $400 this year. This was a  report that was supposed to go in about  the future.  Their answer was, no, we cannot pay  for it with the money that we need. We  will be $44 trillion in debt; $44 trillion  in debt because of what they are doing  right now. Now, that is a number that,  if you are sitting at home and you are  thinking  to yourself, my God, how  much is $44 trillion, well, think of it  this way: imagine that everyone in this  country worked for 4 years, every single day went to work for 4 years, everybody in the country, and handed over  every penny to cover this $44 trillion  deficit. That  is what  it would take.  Every man, woman and child. Even  those little kids that they could not  find $400 for now.  They are  creating a problem out  there that when their fathers and their  mothers come to Medicare and come to  Social Security, they will say, well,  gee, we would like to help you out, but  it is all gone. They are creating it right  here  in  front of us. And  it  is bad  enough, I mean, people voted, we did  talk a little bit about it out here, people talked about it; but what is awful  about this is that they knew these figures and they kept them from us.  Just like the weapons of mass destruction. There is a kind of a pattern,  you see, in this administration. Feed  the people the facts you want them to  know, keep snapping your fingers so  they will look up here, and meanwhile  take away from them down here. They  did it with weapons of mass destruction. We were assured. Our President  said he has them. Our Secretary of  State said he has them. He went to the  United Nations and put up charts and  graphs and all kinds of pictures. We  have them, he said. The Secretary of  War, Mr. Rumsfeld, he said the same  thing. One after another these guys  went down the  line telling us what  they knew was not true.  The Voice of America carried a very  interesting interview with a man who  came out of the Iraq situation. He was  in the United States, and he said there  were no weapons of mass destruction  after 1991. This administration will not  tell you the truth, but you are in for  one awful problem dealing with $44 trillion all of a sudden. f  TRIBUTE TO REVEREND RANSOM  HOWARD  ",2003
191,House,108,-0.179,22,2003-06-02,Mr. LAMPSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  great sadness to honor my friend, Reverend Ransom Howard, the pastor for  almost  41⁄2 decades  of First Sixth  Street Baptist Church in Port Arthur,  Texas. Reverend Ransom Howard died  on Thursday, May 29.  Reverend Howard was a remarkable  man who was committed to his community, to his country, and, above all,  to his family. Reverend Howard was a  long-time civic and community leader.  He was always a man who believed in  equality and justice. He fought hard for  civil rights when it was not an easy  thing to do, although it is never an  easy thing to do. His impact on the  community could be felt everywhere,  but you could certainly say he was a  positive  force  for  all  of  southeast  Texas.  Rev, as we called him, was instrumental in the integration of the Port  Arthur public schools and city businesses. He served as youth director for  the YMCA, was a past president of the  NAACP, and president of  the Concerned Citizens of the Port Arthur Association. He was of the utmost character, and his attributes of selflessness  VerDate Jan 31 2003  03:19 Jun 03, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K02JN7.050 H02PT1 ",2003
192,House,108,-0.517,29,2003-06-02,Mr. SANDERS.," If the gentleman will  yield further, Mr. Speaker, I think the  point the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. GUTKNECHT) made and we all made  is that over 1 million Americans now  purchase their meds in Canada, and the  number is growing every day.  The chairman and  I and the gentleman  from Minnesota  (Mr. GUTKNECHT) and  the gentlewoman  from  California (Ms. WATSON), we said to the  gentleman from the FDA who was before the subcommittee, okay, you tell  us you are very concerned about the  safety aspect. We have a million Americans. Tell us how many of them have  been made sick by receiving adulterated or counterfeit medicine. Out of 1  million people, the answer is zero.  Now, we are all going to sign or we  are on a request to the GAO to do  something a  little different. I think  that  if the FDA  is concerned about  health and safety, they should do a  study telling us how many Americans  are dying or seeing a deterioration of  their health because they cannot afford  the prices that the industry is charging  them today. I have the feeling we are  going to see a number a heck of a lot  larger than zero. So maybe the FDA  should worry about health and safety  in terms of prices, rather than hounding people who are buying affordable  and safe medicines in Canada.  ",2003
193,House,108,0.426,36,2003-06-02,Mr. FOSSELLA.," Madam Speaker, I want to  take a minute to discuss an issue that is very  important to many men and women in my district and to the men and women working in the  telecommunications industry.  The FCC is preparing for a release of their  Triennial Review of the UNE–P and I want to  weigh  in with my colleagues as  to  the  fundamentals of how the UNE–P pricing model  works, or as I see it, doesn’t work.  Suppose you, an entrepreneur, go  in  to  manufacture candy bars and you invest significant capital  to create  this wonderful  factory  and generate candy bars. You operate for 30  years, during which you must buy new equipment, and maintain that equipment. The bottom line of your costs is say, $.75. You determine to sell them in the retail market for $1.  Then you discover that there is a regulatory  body empowered by the Congress that regulates candy bars and one of their missions is  to promote competition. One day, these regulators come to you and they say, ‘ ‘You know  what? We think since you’re the largest candy  bar manufacturer, you should have a competitor. And we have someone that we want to be  your competitor.’  Then the regulators tell you  one way in which they’ve determined to promote competition is for you to allow this competitor to sell your product from your machinery and buildings at $0.75 or in some cases  less than $0.75, so they in turn can resell it in  the market for a profit to them, and a loss to  your company.  All  the money you  just spent  to build a  building which stores the machinery you use  to make your product, package your product,  distribute you’re product, and maintain all of  this, is used to provide a product to your competitor for the same price or less of a price  that  is costs you, only  they don’t have any  risk.  I pose the question to the regulators and my  colleagues. What would you do as CEO of this  candy bar company, what do you feel is the  right  thing  to do?  I see  it  to be wrong and  think the regulators should take steps to mitigate  this wrong or change  it while  they still  have a chance. f  GENERAL LEAVE  ",2003
194,House,108,-0.428,36,2003-06-02,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Madam Speaker,  it is interesting to review the ebb and  flow of the political tides, as we have  had here this evening, where we here  on Capitol Hill deal with the ebb and  flow of various political crises, whether  it is the struggle against global terrorism, whether it is the battle of the  economy, budgets and tax cuts, where  the economy is hopefully a short-term  problem, where the perversion of tax  and budget priorities hopefully is temporary in nature, and it is, after all,  within our power to change priorities  to adjust tax rates and make  infrastructure investments.  There is, Madam Speaker, however, a  greater battle, and one over which, if  we are not careful, we may not be able  to exercise such control. I am speaking, of course, of the struggle to preserve and protect our environment, because we are watching the slow, relentless poisoning of air and water, the destruction of habitat, which puts millions of people at risk on a daily basis  and inflicts permanent damage.  The World Health Organization, for  example,  suggests  that water-borne  diseases kill at least 3.5 million people  every year. That is more than three  times as many people who were lost in  the World Trade Center, who die every  day, 365 days a year. It is within our  power, our capacity, to do something  about it.  It was my privilege to be in South  Africa last fall as the world came together, the largest United Nations conference  in history, making commitments to what we were going to do to  try and make changes like that to protect the environment. I watched as the  United States  joined with over  104  other heads of state, 194 countries in  all,  to make  commitments,  for  instance, that over 1 million people who  do not have access to clean drinking  water, we would cut that amount in  half in the next 15 years.  I think a number of people felt uncomfortable with that, thinking about  how many people would be sentenced  to unnecessary death and disease, but  it was an important goal. But that goal  suggests that we are going to provide,  even that modest goal, 211,000 people  per day, clean drinking water who do  not have it, in order to reach that 15year goal of just cutting it in half. It is  an example of these threats that we  face to the environment. I would like to reflect for a few moments this evening about what we are  doing dealing with  these  two great  global threats.  We have focused our attention on the  greater environment in terms of the atmosphere and our oceans. Fifty years  ago space was our proxy in a struggle  against communism. Ten years later,  we had the Stratton Commission, ushering in a new era for the space under  our oceans’ surfaces. We have spent billions of dollars  trying  to penetrate  deep space, a somewhat lesser amount  dealing with our oceans, while we as a  planet continue to affect weather patterns, affect global  climate  change,  global warming and disease.  Madam Speaker, I think it is important for us to be able to focus on what  we can do to make a difference in those  areas.  I have often on this floor dealt with  issues dealing with global warming.  The scientific consensus is agreed to,  although it is slow in dawning on Members of Congress, and our policies do  not yet reflect it. But when you deal  with objective members of science, 15  years ago what was a debatable proposition  that we were  affecting  the  Earth’s climate in cataclysmic ways,  now the vast scientific consensus, including the commission that wrote the  report from the National Academy of  Sciences  2 years  ago  requested  by  President Bush, confirms that we now  know that global warming and this climate change is a reality; that it is, in  all likelihood, a world where our children will  inherit a Glacier National  Park with no glaciers, indeed, no glaciers at all in the continental United  States.  The sudden occurrence of open water  at the North Pole for the first time in  recorded history is now being followed  by evidence of rapid melting of the  polar areas, and we face consequences  like the extinction of polar bears within our children’s lifetime.  But the problems are not just with  trophy  species  and  signature  landmarks like mountain glaciers. We are  changing  the envelope, as Professor  Holden, Director of the Program on  Science and Technology and Public  Policy  at Harvard University,  expresses it, the envelope in which all  other  environmental  conditions  and  processes operate.

195,Senate,108,0.356,64,2003-06-02,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President,  today I rise to introduce a bill to improve the deplorable housing situation  on the U.S. border with Mexico.  In  Texas along the 1,248 mile stretch from  Cameron County to El Paso County,  there are more than 1,400 colonias, or  underdeveloped subdivisions, that suffer from such conditions as open sewage, a lack of indoor plumbing, and  poor  housing  construction.  These  colonias are the most distressed areas  in the country, yet despite terrible living conditions, they have grown in population. The  legislation  I  introduce  today, along with the Colonias Gateway Initiative Act which I am sponsoring, will go a  long way  toward  eliminating  the  substandard  living  conditions that should not exist here in  the United States of America.  This legislation will prohibit Federal  funding  for  counties and municipal  governments that refuse to enforce reasonable rules to prevent the development  or  construction  of  any  new  colonias that lack water, wastewater,  and other basic infrastructure needs. I  have  inserted  and  the Senate  has  passed this exact  language  into the  VA–HUD  Appropriations  bill  every  year since fiscal year 2001.  In  1993,  I  visited with  a woman  named Elida Bocanegra, who led me  through  the  streets  of  the  colonia  where she lived. Elida showed me her  community, which lacked paved roads,  wastewater  facilities  and  running  water. Quite frankly, I could not believe I was in America. After that experience, the first amendment I offered  as a U.S. Senator authorized $50 million  for a colonias clean-up project.  Since my election to the U.S. Senate, I  have worked to improve the quality of  life and ensure  fundamental services  are provided for people like Elida, helping to secure more than $615 million for  the colonias of my state.  This act will ensure that colonias  lacking water and wastewater facilities  will be a thing of the past, and the  neediest people along our border with  Mexico will have the basic necessities  to live. I ask unanimous consent that  the text of the bill be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows: S. 1163 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION  1. RESTRICTION ON DEVELOPMENT  AND  CONSTRUCTION  OF  NEW  COLONIAS AREAS.

197,House,108,-0.372,3,2003-06-10,Mr. EMANUEL.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday’s New York Times story ran a  headline: ‘‘Iraqis Are Out of Jobs, But  Pay Day Still Comes.’’ With the administration’s blessing, 200,000 Iraqis are  receiving $20 a day for no-show jobs.  They do not work. They do not show up  for work. They do not do any work.  Twenty bucks a day. I come from Chicago, from Cook County. We like noshow  jobs. We think that  is a good  thing. We built an  entire political  party on no-show jobs, not at 20 bucks  a day; but  for everybody’s appreciation,  in the  last 2 months we have  given Iraqi families nearly $900. That is  equal to the amount that we would pay  for the child credit. So we are paying  Iraqis and Iraqi families 900 bucks over  the last 2 months, which is equal to  what we are fighting over here, which I  do not believe we need to fight here in  the House since the Senate agreed 94 to  6 for the same amount of money. Yet  somehow we said in Iraq if they do not  work, if they do not show up for work,  we will give them 20 bucks a day. It is  a no-show job. It looks pretty good to  me. But here if they work full time,  trying to help their families, trying to  raise their kids with the right values,  trying  to provide  them  clothes  for  school, food for the summer, a camp, a  program, YMCA, they are not part of  the American family.  I want to tell the Members something. Here is an American official, a  government official who said nobody is  going to quibble about paying a few  dollars into this economy.  I am going to quibble. I do not know  whom he talks to. I do not know who is  paying him except for all Americans,  and he says nobody is going to quibble?  But what we are quibbling about  is  whether the children of America, 12  million children, 6.5 million families,  are going to get the same sense of  value here in America that we are saying in Iraq that for 20 bucks a day they  do not have to show up for work and we  will pay them. But here if they show up  for work, work hard and pay  their  taxes, they do not deserve a tax cut,  that they are unappreciative.  Who are these children? They are  America’s children, and they have done  right. Parents are trying to raise them  with good values, trying to teach them  right from wrong. And what do we do  in Congress? We turn those values on  their head. We turn those values upside  down and say if they work full time  trying to do right by their kids, they  do not deserve a tax cut. We are going  to treat Iraqis with a different sense of  values, a different sense of appreciation.  Let us be clear about what this says  about who we are. America’s children.  Enron in the last 4 out of 5 years had  record profits, did not pay taxes 4 out  of 5 years. They got breaks. WorldCom,  $12.5 billion in profits, 2 out of 3 years  did not pay any taxes. They were big  recipients of government contracts, yet  did not pay taxes. We are paying their  taxes. Tyco decided to move their address down to Bermuda, got a new ZIP  code, new area code. $600 million dollars in government taxes were not paid;  yet they got benefits in government  contracts. That is a form of corporate  welfare. If they do not pay, if they do  not work and they are a corporation,  we take care of them. America’s children, 12 million of them, we are not  going to give them a tax cut.  Recently on a Friday, the unemployment rate hit 6.1 percent. When this  President came to office, the unemployment rate was 4 percent. Nearly 3  million Americans have lost their jobs,  and we have added $3 trillion to the Nation’s debt. What a deal, as we would  say back in Chicago. $3 trillion dollars  added to the Nation’s debt, and Americans are paying with their jobs.  I believe the Senate did right. They  did right by our values as Americans;  and I know people on the other side of  the aisle. They are good people with  good values, but those values that left  the 12 million children on the  floor  while corporate interests were circling  the conference room are not the values  we came here to vote for. We all came  not just to be a vote, but we came to be  a voice for our values and the values  VerDate Jan 31 2003  00:37 Jun 11, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10JN7.011 H10PT1 ",2003

Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary  in supporting S.J. Res. 8 to call attention to National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. The purpose of this resolution is to increase  public awareness of sexual assault and  to recognize the important contributions of various individuals and groups  across the United States that combat  sexual assault.  Mr. Speaker, sexual assault victims  are primarily young people with 44 percent of the victims under the age of 18,  80 percent under the age of 30. Sexual  assault affects women, men, children of  all races, social, religious, age, ethnic  and economic groups and even prisoners. Yet less than 40 percent of sexual assault victims pursue prosecution  by reporting their attack to law enforcement agencies.

Res. 252 introduced by my good  friend  from Missouri, Majority Whip  Roy Blunt. This important resolution  expresses support for the administration’s World Trade Organization case  against the European Union’s unwarranted moratorium on agriculture and  food biotech products.  On May 13, 2003, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman announced that the United States, Argentina, Canada, and Egypt would file a  WTO case against the European Union  over its illegal 5-year moratorium on  approving agricultural biotech products. Other countries expressing support for this case by joining it as third  parties  include Australia, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico,  New Zealand, Peru, and Uruguay.  Since the  late 1990s, the European  Union has opposed the use of agriculture  biotechnology  and  pursued  policies  opposing  genetically  engineered products around the world. The  current 5-year moratorium on the approval  of  new  agriculture  biotechnology products entering the European market has no scientific basis, effectively prohibits most United States  corn exports to Europe, violates European Union law, and clearly breaches  World Trade Organization rules.  According  to  recent  studies,  biotechnology has made substantial contributions to the protection of the environment by reducing the application  of pesticides, reducing soil erosion and  creating an  environment more hospitable to wildlife. Since its implementation in October 1998, the moratorium  has blocked more than $300 million annually in United States corn exports to  countries in the European Union. This  is completely unacceptable.  I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution and support the administration, sound science, and United States  farmers at the WTO.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time. ",2003
200,House,108,-0.322,17,2003-06-10,Mr. KLECZKA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Earlier this year, the U.S. Trade Representative announced that the United  States would file a World Trade Organization  case against  the European  Union over its 5-year moratorium on  approving genetically modified foods.  The measure before us today supports  the Bush administration’s challenge to  the EU’s longstanding moratorium.  The European Union is made up of  sovereign  countries  whose  citizens  have decided that they would rather  not eat genetically modified food. Mr.  Speaker, when did the United States  acquire  the  right  to  tell Europeans  what they should be eating? The issue  before us is not trade discrimination as  the proponents of this bill have argued.  The individual EU countries are simply  debating whether or not to implement  a domestic policy related to genetically modified food which would also  be applied to imports.  Due to the lack of hard data about  the  long-term health effects,  in the  United States there has also been public concern about consuming genetically modified products. According to a  Rutgers University Food Policy Institute study, 90 percent of Americans  said that foods created through genetic  engineering  should  have  labels  on  them. I am proud to join with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. KUCINICH) in his  efforts to require the labeling of genetically engineered food.  Although there have been few studies  devoted to health effects of genetically  modified  food, some scientists claim  that there may be a link between the  resurgence of infectious diseases and  genetic modifications in the U.S. food  supply. There have even been cases of  lab animals suffering immune system  damage and allergic  reactions after  eating biotech food.  I think that Members would agree  that the WTO should not interfere with  the creation of domestic law in this  Chamber, so I ask Members to apply  the same principle to our friends in Europe.  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose this heavy-handed measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2003

As an original cosponsor, I congratulate President Bush and Ambassador Zoellick  for  putting  American  farmers  and  sound  science  first by challenging  this  illegal  trade  ban on genetically modified foods before the  WTO.  Over  the  last  few years, we have seen  country  after  country  implementing  protectionist trade policies, like the EU moratorium,  under  the cloak of  food safety—each one  brought on by emotion, culture, or their own  poor history with food safety regulation.  Simply put, non-tariff protectionism is detrimental  to  the  free movement of goods and  services across borders. We all know that free  trade benefits all  countries. However,  free  trade will be  rendered meaningless  if  it  is  short-circuited by non-tariff barriers  that are  based on fear and conjecture —not science.

Mr. Speaker, just 9 months ago, in  the middle of her campaign for a 13th  House  term, a campaign which  she  most certainly would have won  resoundingly and, in fact, did win posthumously, the late United States Representative Patsy Takemoto Mink was  tragically lost to her beloved Hawaii,  this Congress, our country, and our  world.  The days, weeks, and months that  followed witnessed  a massive  outpouring of  first shock and disbelief,  then sorrow and regret and, finally, remembrance and gratitude for this singular life.  As just a few representative examples, we had a deeply moving memorial  service in the U.S. Capitol here as well  as in the Hawaii State capitol back in  Hawaii attended by many of our colleagues here.  This House published a beautiful memorial volume that memorialized the  many eulogies given to Mrs. Mink on  this floor and a volume for which I  want to relay the deep gratitude of the  Mink family, husband John, daughter  Wendy, brother Eugene.  The students at the University of Hawaii Law School Richardson School of  Law, on their own initiative, created  and funded the Patsy Mink Memorial  Fellowship for the purpose of providing  an internship here in the U.S. Congress  each year to a person in Mrs. Mink’s  liking. b1415  I am very proud to say the first Mink  fellow, Van Luong,  joined my office  last week, and she reminds me a lot of  Mrs. Mink.  There also were and continue to be a  multitude of testimonials on her lasting legislative accomplishments, and I  want to leave to the colleagues that  come after me to document those one  more time because they know better  than I do what she accomplished here.  But maybe what struck me the most,  when I went out to campaign to take  over the representation that she had so  well provided to the Second Congressional District in what is still to this  day referred to as Patsy Mink’s seat,  the testimonies from the ordinary people, the people that she touched during  her  life,  the  people  that  she  represented, like the longtime friend in  Lihue who was sick and who Patsy visited in the hospital just 2 days before  she went into the hospital herself; like  the taro farmers in Kipahulu on Maui,  they wanted to show her their lo’i, and  the only way for her to do that was to  put on boots and walk out there in a  very remote part of our district, and  she did that. And the pig hunter in  Waimen on the Big Island; he had an  issue, and the only way to show her  what that issue was was to take her  into the  forest where he  lived. She  went.  These  testimonials  are  the  testimonies that really count, but they can  really only give testament to the fact  that her remembrances are her best  legacy. But it is entirely appropriate  that we honor her with a more tangible  reminder that will serve as a constant  physical remembrance of her and cause  us to reflect on what she stood for.  So as I talked about this with John  Mink after my election, he relayed his  wish, later endorsed by others such as  the Maui County Council, that the U.S.  Post Office at Paia be renamed the  Patsy Takemoto Mink Post Office. I  want to tell Members about Paia very  briefly. Paia is on the north shore of  Maui on the slopes of Haleakala. Near  Paia, only about a mile away, is a town  called Hamakuapoko. It used to be a  thriving plantation village. It is not  quite that anymore, a time when sugar  and pine were prevalent, and this is  where Patsy Takemoto Mink was born  in 1927 and was raised in all of the good  and not so good of Hawaii in the 1930s  and the 1940s, the community where  the old Maui High School is located  where Mrs. Mink’s  political  career  began when she ran successfully  for  student  body  president,  the  first  woman to accomplish that position,  the  first of many  firsts along those  lines.  In short, this is where she came from,  where her values were forged, where  her spirit was lit, and it represents the  people’s traditions and beliefs that she  never forgot. This is a fitting memorial  for Patsy Takemoto Mink, and I urge  my  colleagues’  full  support,  and  I  thank them for further consideration  of a great Hawaiian and a great American.  ",2003
204,House,108,-0.488,31,2003-06-10,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  proud cosponsor of this legislation here  today, a bill to commemorate the remarkable life and tremendous achievements of a woman who served with  great distinction in the House of Representatives. To Patsy’s friends, to her  husband John, her daughter Wendy,  and her brother Eugene, I offer my condolences as we remember her today.  Over the past few months, we have  all missed the presence of her in our  lives, and we know if she was still with  us today, Patsy would be fighting for  the rights of women and girls through  Title 9, and fighting to see that this  country lives up to its responsibilities  to provide economic opportunity for all  Americans,  and  she would  be  promoting democratic values and human  rights and  international cooperation  abroad  in  Iraq and  throughout  the  world.  She leaves a powerful legacy, and I  will leave it to others to go on, item by  item, but we know she broke down  many, many barriers, first for herself  and then for others. She left a legacy  for millions of working families that  she helped lift out of poverty with education and job training programs, ranging from the war on poverty to welfare  reform. And she helped a whole generation of  female  student athletes  for  whom  she drafted and  implemented  title IX.  I was proud to serve with Patsy on  both the Committee on Education and  the Workforce and on the Committee  on Government Reform where she gave  voice to the voiceless every day that  she served. Patsy provided vision, courage and leadership, speaking out on all  of the vital issues of the day and inspiring those of us who served with her  with her fiery oration and a mastery of  education, economic, and labor issues.  Mr. Speaker, she mixed her persuasive powers with the chocolate macadamia nuts that she used to pass out to  all. Her memory will long remain here  and in Hawaii for another generation of  young women and Americans for the  work she did.  ",2003
205,House,108,-0.486,38,2003-06-10,Mr. GUTIERREZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank my good friend for yielding me  time, and I thank the gentlewoman  from Florida  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN)  for  her work on the consideration of this  bill today. I would like to also thank  all of the staff members who worked  tirelessly in making this possible, and  specifically I would like to thank my  good friend Danielle Simonetta and Michael Layman from the majority side  for all of the work they have done in  making this bill. And I say to Danielle  specifically that my daughter sends her  good wishes. She is doing better, and  she is real excited about Cesar Chavez  and the opportunity for the action that  we can afford his life here today.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate today  the life and legacy of Cesar Chavez and  to recognize his passion  for empowering workers and  for defending the  rights of the disadvantaged.  The  legislation we are considering  today, H.R.  925, would designate a  United States Postal Service facility  at 1859 South Ashland Avenue in my  district as the Cesar Chavez Post Office. The facility would serve as a permanent tribute and a lasting reminder  of  the  selflessness and  self-sacrifice  that embodied Chavez’s life and work.  Mr. Speaker, this  is not the  first  time a legislative body has paused to  honor Cesar Chavez, and it is my hope  it will not be the last. The more buildings,  the more  streets,  the more  stamps and the more parks that are  designated, the more we can keep Cesar  Chavez’s principles, his passion and devotion alive, and the more we will be  able to encourage others to continue  the unfinished business that Cesar Chavez left behind, to take up his fight and  his causes and to make similar sacrifices in the name of justice and dignity.  Throughout history, there have been  few individuals that have done more,  that have fought harder or sacrificed as  much to ensure dignity and decency for  all workers than Cesar Chavez. The  late Senator Robert F. Kennedy called  him one of the heroic figures of our  time.  Cesar Chavez remains a champion to  working people around the world and  an  inspiration  to  generations  of  Latinos, both here in this country and  abroad, and his accomplishments are  an enduring symbol and a shining example of what one man can achieve in  the fight for fairness.  Cesar Chavez stood up to the biggest,  the most well-financed and the strongest corporate growers. He fought for  farm workers who  spent  countless  hours doing our Nation’s most arduous  and strenuous work. b1500  He defended men and women crippled  by despair and deplorable working conditions, so that they too could have a  say in the fight for reasonable and respectable wages. Chavez fought for the  most basic and the most fundamental  and the most essential rights for workers. He fought so that growers would  not  spray  pesticides while workers  were in the fields. He fought so that  they could have a clean water system  and decent housing. And his actions  and hard work were vital in achieving  better pay for migrant farmers, to banning child labor abuses, and to mitigating the proliferation of sexual harassment of women workers.  Cesar Chavez’s courage and his character helped strengthen the farm workers movement, and his principles of  nonviolence continue to play an important role in the quest for social justice  and human rights and for a world without prejudice or injustice.  Mr. Speaker, for everyone who has  ever fought for fairness, Chavez is a  model and a true mentor. Because he  refused to let bigotry and bias go unchallenged, workers are better protected and represented today. Because  he refused to respond to discrimination  and intolerance with silence, we live in  a better and more inclusive America.  According to Chavez, ‘‘The truest act  of courage, the strongest act of manliness, is to sacrifice ourselves for others  in a totally nonviolent struggle for justice. To be a man is to suffer for others.’’ At the time those eloquent words  were articulated, Chavez was too weak  to speak them himself. He was fasting  in protest of violence against workers,  and his speech had to be read by someone else.  Throughout his life, Chavez never relented, he never backed down, and he  never wavered from his commitment to  nonviolence. When he passed away in  1993, more than 50,000 people attended  his funeral to pay homage and their respects to a man who fought so fearlessly, so tirelessly for those not always heard or even seen in our society.  A reporter wrote, ‘‘During the vigil  at the open casket on the day before  the funeral, an old man lifted a child  up to show him the small, gray-haired  man who laid inside. ‘I am going to tell  you about  this man  some day, he  said.’’’  The  legislation we  are  discussing  today would ensure that countless others remember to tell their children  about this man, about his life, his lessons, and his legacy. It will also help  educate tomorrow’s leaders about the  characteristics that they should appreciate,  about  the  achievements  that  they celebrate, and about the types of  individuals that they should emulate.  Mr. Speaker, in the year since his  passing,  Chavez  has  been  awarded  many of our Nation’s highest honors,  including the 1994 Medal of Freedom.  And the passage of this legislation, I  believe, would serve as another important and lasting testament to the outstanding work of Cesar Chavez.  At the Commonwealth Club of San  Francisco,  Chavez  said,  ‘‘The  consciousness and pride that were raised  by our union are alive and thriving inside millions of young Hispanics who  will never work on a farm.’’ And we  must work to keep that consciousness  and pride alive in future generations.  We must work to keep the consciousness and pride alive as we advocate for  a new generation of immigrant workers.  Every time someone in my community drops off a letter, goes to buy a  stamp, or passes by the post office,  they will be able to remember Cesar  Chavez’s  life,  remember his accomplishments, appreciate his vision and,  ideally, summon the strength to embody his teaching in their daily activities. It will also serve as a focal point  in a vibrant and growing Pilsen community and as a reminder of the challenges we face today.  Mr.  Speaker,  Cesar  Chavez  gave  workers everywhere a reason to believe  and a reason to dream. He  inspired  them, with his desire and discipline, to  stand together and to do better and to  reach farther. And in doing so, he gave  so many the courage and the strength  to fight for equity and equality.  That is why I urge the passage of this  important legislation.  In ending, Mr. Speaker, I would like  to thank my friends again, the gentlewoman  from  Florida  (Ms.  ROSLEHTINEN), and my dear  friend,  the  gentleman from Chicago, Illinois (Mr.  DAVIS), who I know when we finally get  this legislation approved will be standing with me in inaugurating this wonderful new post office for Cesar Chavez.

I want  to  commend my  colleague, Representative  GUTIERREZ, for his leadership in bringing this  legislation before the House and I am proud to  join him as an original cosponsor.  Ce´sar Cha`vez was an organizer, an activist,  a protestor, a farm worker, a peace-lover, a  father, and a son.

Many  fine things have  been said about the gentleman, that he  and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  GOODLATTE) have been  fighting  this  issue, this problem, and have really  brought it to our attention, along with  the  gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr.  WOLF), and I commend him.

208,House,108,0.141,52,2003-06-10,Mr. LEACH.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Chairman, this bill  is a great  credit  to  the gentleman  from Alabama’s (Mr. BACHUS’s) leadership. Also,  as indicated, the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. GOODLATTE) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WOLF) have  worked on this for years, and I am very  grateful for their support.  Mr. Chairman, the bill as it comes  before the floor today is, frankly, not  as  comprehensive  as  I would have  liked. It would have been better if the  Committee on the Judiciary had updated the Wire Act. It would have been  better if we had been more precise in  allowing certain law enforcement ties  to the financial system. Nevertheless,  this  is a very credible  first step to  slowing the growth of Internet gambling.  The  issue has been raised on the  floor, and I think it is worthy of serious review, the question of is this an  individual issue, a libertarian issue or  is it a social issue?  I believe very firmly that it is far  more than a libertarian issue. We ignore gambling at our peril. It is simply  not good for the American economy to  send billions of dollars overseas. It is  not good for American national security to allow Internet gambling to provide the ideal basis for money laundering,  for narco-traffickers and  for  terrorists. But most of all it is not  good for the American family.  Anyone that gets hooked on Internet  gambling or any form of gambling, but  particularly  Internet which  is gambling alone, will lose virtually all of  their assets. Anyone that gets hooked  will, in all likelihood, lose their family. Divorce is a serious element of the  gambling problem. In very many cases  the extraordinary circumstance of suicide is contemplated by gamblers that  get this as a virtual disease.  It is a libertarian myth that only the  individual, only  the gambler  is affected. Its effects spill over to the financial systems. When there are losses,  everybody else has to pay higher interest rates. They spill over to the social  welfare system where people have to  pick up the costs of broken lives. It  spills over to the economy where suffering has to be picked up elsewhere;  and they spill over into national security concerns.  Internet gambling serves no social  purpose whatsoever. It is a danger to  the American family. It is a danger to  the American society. It is a danger to  the security of the United States. It  should be ended, and this is a credible  beginning. ",2003

210,House,108,-0.302,52,2003-06-10,Ms. BERKLEY.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentlewoman for yielding me  time.  Mr. Chairman, it has become very apparent to me after listening to this debate that the supporters of this bill not  only oppose the Internet gaming, they  are opposed to any  form of gaming  whatsoever. They speak of gaming and  they speak of addiction and crime and  drugs and suicide.  Well, I grew up in Las Vegas. Las  Vegas has 1.5 million residents; 37 million visitors come to our community  every year to enjoy our entertainment,  and our wholesome family entertainment, I might add.  I grew up in Las Vegas. I represent  the good people of Las Vegas who depend on the gaming industry for their  livelihood. My  father was a waiter  when I was growing up. He worked in  one of these casinos that you disparage  so handily.  Let me state what Las Vegas means  to me. On a waiter’s salary my father  was able to put a roof over our heads,  food on the table, clothes on our backs,  and two daughters through college and  law school. That is not so bad on a  waiter’s salary. And the reason he was  able to do it was because of the strong  economy that the gaming industry created.  Las Vegas to me is churches and synagogues and families and Saturday soccer and proms at this time of year and  graduations and hopes and dreams and  aspirations to millions of people that  come to Las Vegas and the 1.5 million  people that live there.  And, quite candidly, the people  in  this Chamber ought to be ashamed of  disparaging  a  community  like Las  Vegas that I daresay lays shame to all  of your own. So please be careful when  you speak of my community and the  major industry that takes care of the  people  that  live  there and provides  good educations, good economy, good  living conditions, and a quality of life  that  is the envy of the rest of the  United States of America.

And the old saying ‘‘It takes money to  make money’’ is as true for organized  crime as it is for any other business in  America. This is not about Las Vegas.

212,House,108,-0.392,59,2003-06-10,Mr. WEXLER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the amendment from  the gentleman  from Wisconsin  (Mr.  chairman  of  the  Committee on the Judiciary. I oppose  it because it prohibits Americans from  using their credit cards for behavior  that  is entirely  legal. Pari-mutuels,  horse tracks, dog tracks, and jai lai  frontons are all legal in many States.  They are heavily regulated. They pay  taxes. They provide jobs, and in many  communities are an important part of  the tourism industry and local culture.  That is why the National Governors  Association is against this amendment. b1800  Pari-mutuels  employ  thousands of  Americans and provide enjoyment to  millions more. The horse racing industry generates $34 billion a year and creates 472,000 full-time jobs in America.  Greyhound racing is a $2.3 billion industry  creating  over  30,000  jobs  in  America. They both provide very needed tax revenue to our States. It makes  SENSENBRENNER),  no sense for Congress to usurp States’  rights with the result being a loss of  employment of Americans and State  revenue.  The underlying bill rightfully bans  credit card use  for  illegal gambling.  Casino-style offshore Web sites are not  regulated. They do not pay taxes, and  they do not employ Americans. They  are illegal, and American banks should  not help facilitate them. But the issue  here is whether Congress is going to  make a policy that says Americans  cannot use credit cards to engage in behavior which in their State is legal.  Not illegal, but legal.  I would respectfully argue that Congress  should do no  such  thing and  should oppose this amendment.  ",2003
213,House,108,-0.404,66,2003-06-10,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, at a later  moment in this Special Order the gentleman  from  South  Carolina  (Mr.  SPRATT), the ranking member of the  Committee  on  the Budget, will  be  speaking more fully about Al Davis,  the chief economist for the Committee  on Ways and Means, and formerly the  economist for the House Budget Committee.  Today I come to the floor to pay tribute to Al Davis and express my deepest  sympathy to Mary, Al’s partner  for  more than 20 years. Al had a remarkable life, one in which he made an unforgettable  and  immeasurable  contribution to the scope of this country’s  economic and budgetary policies. Although most Americans will  never  know his name or his extraordinary  contributions, he has influenced each  of us in our lives for the better.  Five years after serving in the U.S.  Army  from  1969  to  1971 during  the  height of the Vietnam War, Al began  his  lifelong career as an economist  while working for the Wisconsin Revenue Department  until  1980. While  there, he rose from an analyst to the  bureau chief in the research and analysis division in a very short period of  time.  During the early 1980s, he served as  senior analyst on the Taxation and Finance Committee with the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental  Relations. And from 1994 to 1998, he was  chief  economist  for  the Democratic  budget staff and then was the economist since 1999 until his tragic passing  just last month as the chief economist  for the Committee on Ways and Means.  Al was a master of economic and  budgetary policy through four administrations. He helped our committee staff  navigate every economic budget and  tax proposal put before the U.S. Congress.  Al called us, that is the Members of  Congress and his colleagues on  the  House Committee on Ways and Means  and the Committee on the Budget his  customers, and he provided us with  realms of memos and charts and analysis that only Al could produce. He did  it with insight and humor. He stripped  away the clutter to extract the critical  details  of major  issues  facing  the  American public.  You would often hear about Al’s ability to translate complex and difficult  economic concepts for Members, staff,  and, of course, the press. On his own,  he was a unique gift, but what made Al  truly remarkable was his delivery of  his translation and the integrity that  he actually had which he imposed upon  all of us because anyone dealing with  Al Davis knew they had to be honest  with themselves because of his basic  decency and honesty.  When Al found a provision or proposal that he analyzed to be unfair to  the American public, this translation,  without fail, was laced with humor and  simultaneously expressed his frustration, and he always exposed the unfairness of whatever he was working on if  he believed it to be unfair.  Over the years, Al Davis provided the  Democratic Members of the Committee  on Ways and Means with probably 150– 200 memos. Most of us read all of them,  not only because of the analysis that  he gave us, but also because of his  humor and his sense of humanity. I  would like to take a moment to quote  two paragraphs in a January 30, 2003  memo. The subject from Al Davis to  the Committee on Ways and Means  Democrats  is  ‘‘Snow Hearing Next  Week and Budget Deficits.’’ Of course,  we had a lot of snow during the month  of January, so it was snow hearing and  budget deficits. And  the caption  is  ‘‘The Return of Budget Deficit as Far  as the Eye Can See.’’ He says, and I do  not mean to be partisan here, but it is  humorous. It is not dry. He says, ‘‘Normal mortals would be in the hospital  with whiplash if they changed their positions as radically as my Republican  colleagues.’’ And  then  in  the  same  memo he states.  ‘‘Tax cuts and war  look cheap because we are about to put  them on a national credit card and pass  the costs on to our children.’’ Al had a way of saying the obvious  and stating public policy by actually  communicating with a sense of humor  to all of us. I have to say, Mr. Speaker,  that we  in  this  country  are  very  blessed because we have always had  through the agencies, through the executive branch and the judicial branch,  but particularly through the  legislative branch of our government, people  who are dedicated to the betterment of  our country, and truly Al Davis was a  symbol of that standard that all of us  are here to certainly aspire to.  Al, we are going to miss you very  much and we thank you for everything  you have done for all of us. f  ",2003
214,House,108,-0.378,66,2003-06-10,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker,  like the  gentleman from New York (Mr. RANGEL) who has  spoken and  the gentleman from California (Mr. MATSUI)  who has now just spoken, and those  who will  speak after me about Al  Davis, I relied on him every day on a  wide variety of issues and on this floor  and  in committee I miss him every  day.  When we hit a tough question, the  answer was, ‘‘Ask Al.’’ We expected and  received from him a straight, unvarnished answer, and if he did not know  the answer and I can remember many  days he would say,  ‘‘I am not quite  sure,’’ off he would go to find the information.  Al Davis was available with memos,  with charts. His documents were so  plentiful and useful during debates on  taxes that the staff in my office often  included in my briefing binders a tab  entitled simply ‘‘Al Davis memos.’’ I  cannot recall a tax debate when so  many of us did not rely on some document or some analysis that Al Davis  prepared. He was prolific. He analyzed  tax bills and budgets upside down and  backwards. My  tax  counsel,  who  assures me that Al’s memos were so  valuable that he never deleted a single  one, counted 44 memos, charts, and  other analysis  from Al to the committee from March 1 through May 19 of  this year. So many points from these  memos were used to help shape important tax and budget debates. He was  blessed with the ability to take issues  that were complex and numbers even  more complex and to explain them in  ways that everybody could understand.  He hated dishonesty and inaccuracy.  In the past 2 weeks, many, particularly those in the media, have commented on how accurate and reliable  his work was. His vigilance helped ensure that all of us who relied on him  and worked with him also avoided the  temptation to let the digestible sound  bite overwhelm the accurate and honest debate that America deserves.  The Washington Post in its editorial,  rather unusual in terms of a tribute to  a staffer unknown to the public, so well  known, though, within this institution,  this is what the Washington Post had  to say. ‘‘Unless you are a tax and budget wonk, you probably did not know Al  VerDate Jan 31 2003  04:58 Jun 11, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10JN7.133 H10PT1 ",2003

Mr. Speaker, it is true, Al Davis was  a brilliant economist. But to all of my  Democratic  colleagues on  the Committee on Ways and Means, he was so  much more. He was our conscience on  the committee. Somehow, the words  ‘‘dedication’’  and  ‘‘tireless’’  do not  seem adequate to describe the strength  of Al’s commitment to his work. He  spent countless hours on weekends and  at night  responding  to all  sorts of  Members’  inquiries and  issues; even  some that, to put it kindly, might be  considered harebrained.  Still, he took every request seriously  and would  leave no question unanswered. His efforts were never halfhearted. Unsatisfied with one analysis  or two or even ten, Al would often put  together  hundreds  of  analyses. Al  would leave no stone unturned to proSPRATT),  vide all the facts, no matter how obscure.  Despite his unparalleled knowledge  and command of some of the most complicated issues dealt with by Congress,  Al had an amazing and rare ability to  distill and explain information so that  it was understandable  to  the  least  knowledgeable person. Yet he never,  but never, condescended to anyone.  There was something about Al’s absentminded-professor persona that was  both  disarming  and  reassuring. He  could always be counted on to calm  passionate temperaments and remind  us all of the facts. He would not let us  get caught up  in hyperbole, and he  kept us focused on why we are here: to  serve as a voice for the underprivileged  and the disenfranchised.  Though he might not have enjoyed  the name  recognition  that my colleagues and I do, there is no doubt that  his work was critical to our efforts.  Without capable and dedicated staff  like Al, this place, Mr. Speaker, would  not run. I tell the Members tonight, we  will forever be grateful for his service,  commitment, and dedication.  Mr. Speaker, Al Davis  fought the  good  fight. He kept  the  faith. He  worked hard to make things better for  those who needed it most. I truly believe we are blessed to have known  him. Al, we will miss you. My friend, a  job well done. ",2003
216,House,108,-0.266,73,2003-06-10,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my friend, the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. SPRATT), for organizing  tonight’s Special Order in honor of the  memory of Al Davis.  Mr. Speaker, when I arrived in Washington as a freshman Member of Congress in January, 1993, I received an assignment  to  the Committee on  the  Budget. That was when I met Al Davis.  At the time, Al was the committee’s  senior economist. For  someone  like  me, brand new to the Federal budget  policy, Al was nothing less than the  Rosetta Stone.  Even before I knew his name, I knew  him by my first impression. It was an  impression that I held for the next 10  years working with him, our giant  brain. The Washington Post said that  Al could translate the most arcane economic data into real-world language.  That is absolutely true.  But I must also admit that sometimes even Al’s translations were hard  to grasp. Why? Because, although he  was a master of honing sharp political  arguments out of obtuse provisions in  the Internal Revenue Code, he would  never sacrifice content or accuracy. If  a Member came to Al with a winning  political argument that did not quite  square with the  facts, Al would patiently  explain  how  the  argument  could be changed politically and substantively to be sound and accurate. He  loved politics, for sure, but Al cared  deeply about the enterprise of government, and believed that we all have an  obligation to carry on our public debate with integrity.  Al was a senior economist and then  chief economist for the Committee on  the Budget for all my 6 years on the  Committee on the Budget. Most know  that until recently, Democrat staff of  the Committee on  the Budget were  housed  in  the old O’Neill Building,  which was  also  the  dormitory  for  House and Senate pages.  It was quite appropriate  that  the  Committee on the Budget staff worked  out of a dormitory, because when we  went to see Al Davis, working along  with his colleagues, Richard Kogan and  the others who served with such talent  the gentleman  from Minnesota  (Mr.  SABO) and then the gentleman  from  South Carolina (Mr. SPRATT), we truly  felt like we were in the gifted and talented dorm at college. Here would be  Al in his office, piled high with every  budget and economic resource we could  imagine, statutes, studies, charts, you  name it. Of course, we would always  find Al perched in the middle of it with  an open collar, or in the summer a  short-sleeved  shirt,  jacket  and  tie  hanging on the wall, just in case of  emergencies.  Al would field questions about budget  and tax policy with the excitement and  enthusiasm of a kid. He not only would  answer the question, but also point out  the humor, the irony, the inconsistency, or the sheer lunacy of the provision under discussion. When we went to  see Al, we were truly talking to the  smartest kid in the class.  Al was a very influential staffer, although he had no use for the trappings  of authority. Al loved his work for its  own sake and not because it made him  powerful or sought after, which probably explains why Al treated people  like he did. There would be no one in  the world more surprised than Al to  have an editorial written about him in  the Washington Post. He was just as  happy to explain the finer points of tax  policy to a junior staffer as he was a  senior Member. If one was interested in  learning the substance, then Al Davis  was interested in teaching it to you.  Because of his knowledge and intelligence, we made great demands on Al.  We asked him not only to undertake  economic analyses to support our policies, but also to develop the arguments  and market them. On many occasions,  I would decide the night before markup  that our charts did not quite capture  the perfect argument for the next day.  I would ask my staff to call Al to find  the data to create the perfect chart.  Armed with such an 11th hour request,  you can imagine how anyone would be  exasperated, and occasionally Al was.  But even  those  times, a  few hours  later, sometimes well after midnight,  Al would send over the chart, just as  we had asked.  I served, along with my legislative  director for 10 years, Mike Smart, with  Al and developed the greatest respect  and admiration for him. As he loved  VerDate Jan 31 2003  05:25 Jun 11, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10JN7.154 H10PT1 ",2003

220,Senate,108,-0.25,129,2003-06-10,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I rise  today in tribute to Wind Cave National  Park on the occasion of the park’s centennial anniversary.  Nestled  in the southeast corner of  the Black Hills of South Dakota and  adjacent to Custer State Park, Wind  Cave has a rich and colorful history  that has informed and educated generations of people from around the world.  Wind Cave was established as a national  park  by President Theodore  Roosevelt on January 3, 1903, as the  Nation’s seventh national park and the  first one created to protect a cave. It  was designated as a National Game  Preserve on August 10, 1912.  But Wind Cave’s history is recorded  as part of Black Hills history from the  time Native Americans told stories of  holes in the ground that blow wind.  The first recorded discovery of Wind  Cave dates to 1881 when Jesse and Tom  Bingham were  first attracted to the  cave by a whistling noise. As the story  goes, wind was blowing out of the cave  entrance with such force it blew off  Tom’s hat. A  few days  later, when  Jesse returned to show the phenomena  to some friends, he was astonished to  find the wind had changed directions  and his hat was sucked into the cave.  Since  that  time,  notable  visitors  have included Charlie Crary, the first  person reported to enter the cave; J.D.  McDonald, whose family gave the first  cave tours and sold cave formations to  J.D.’s son, Alvin; Alvin McDonald, who  was the first explorer of the cave and  who kept a diary and map of his findings; and ‘‘Honest John’’ Stabler who  formed a partnership with the McDonalds to develop the first passages and  staircases into Wind Cave. Indeed, the  early history of the cave was plentiful  and colorful.  William Jennings Bryan and Governor Lee visited the cave in 1892. That  same year, one of the first attractions  was put on display. For a quarter, visitors could come to the cave and view a  ‘petrified man’ that had been  found  north of the cave. Over the years, visitors would come to view the natural  attractions Wind Cave would have to  offer.  Captain Seth Bullock became  the  cave’s  first  supervisor  in  1902, with  George Boland  serving as  the area  ranger. South Dakota Congressman  Eben W. Martin was instrumental in  the designation of Wind Cave as a national park. General John J. Pershing  visited in 1910 and took important cave  room readings with his pocket aneroid  barometer.  In  1914, Ester Cleveland  Brazell was a ranger guide at the Cave,  possibly making her the first woman to  hold the title of ranger in the National  Park Service. Walt Disney and other  film and video companies have produced films in the park and countless  rolls of film have been shot by amateur  photographers  for  display  in  home  movies and scrapbooks.  Today, Wind Cave has more than 108  miles of explored and mapped passages,  making it the fourth-longest cave in  the United States and sixth longest in  the world. Well over 5.5 million people  have visited Wind Cave over the past  100 years.  The first major improvements in the  park were accomplished by the Civilian  Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Wind  Cave was  one  of many  important  projects CCC workers  developed  in  South Dakota. Many of the projects  can still be seen today, including roads,  the  entrance  to  the  cave,  concrete  stairs  in the cave and the elevator  building and shaft.

221,,108,-0.302,178,2003-06-10,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor an incredible woman from my  district who recently received a Robert Wood  Johnson Community Health Leadership Program award. Sylvia Portillo earned this prestigious award  through her hard work  in expanding health care for the Latino community  of northern Virginia.  Sylvia Portillo  overcame  adversity  as  a  Spanish-speaking  immigrant  and  low-wage  worker to become a major health leader in her  community. Her career in health care began in  El Salvador where she worked as a nurse.  Upon fleeing war-torn El Salvador, Sylvia became a home health care companion in Arlington County, to support the three children  she left with relatives back home as well as  her new family in the United States.  Ms. Portillo was inspired to become a health  care advocate  for Latinos and other underserved community residents after her experience and  the  roadblocks she encountered  when she tried to get health care and insurance for her two youngest children. In 1996  she joined the Tenants’ and Workers’ Support  Committee as a volunteer  in  the Women ’s  Leadership Group. There she organized  the  Latino community’s first health fair by bringing  together neighbors, doctors, local groups and  city officials. In its seventh year, the fair is the  only source of health care for many residents.  In 1997, Sylvia became lead organizer for the  committee ’s Health Project with a goal of increasing health access for Alexandria’s Latino  community. Since then, she has recruited and  trained more than 80 health promoters to educate  the community about preventive health  practices.  Ms. Portillo has also  led a campaign  that  won $300,000 in medical debt relief from the  leading area health system and persuaded  local hospitals  to hire bilingual  staff. The  project also has completed  three  landmark  studies documenting conditions of Latino immigrants,  including occupational health problems and the consequences of medical debt.  One of  the most  impressive  testimonies  about the work Sylvia has accomplished came  from a woman who sought her help with a  medical debt she could not pay since she was  unable to work. Sylvia helped her understand  our health system, despite her  inability  to  read. ‘ ‘By working with Silvia, I am no longer  afraid, ’ ’ the woman said.  Sylvia and the Health Project have helped  countless people throughout my congressional  district and northern Virginia.  I am proud  to  have Sylvia in my district, and I look forward  to seeing what else she can accomplish in ensuring that her friends and neighbors receive  the health care they deserve. f  HONORING THE THORNTON  SISTERS FOUNDATION  HON.

222,,108,-0.402,178,2003-06-10,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  acknowledge once again a group of talented  and capable women. This month marks  the  12th anniversary of the Thornton Sisters Foundation, Inc. I have been following these women ’s struggles and accomplishments for a long  time now, and after a decade of success, I still  feel  it  is an honor  to  formally salute  these  women for a third time.  On Sunday, June 8, 2003, the Thornton Sisters Foundation will hold an awards ceremony  for the 25 finalists of the Donald and Itasker  Thornton Memorial Scholarship and their family members. The occasion will be hosted at  Jumping Brook Country Club in Neptune, NJ.  The Thornton Sisters have an inspiring history that led to the creation of this foundation.  They come  from a  family  that has always  known the intrinsic worth of a good education.  In 1948,  their parents, Donald and  Itasker,  moved the family from Harlem, New York City  to Long Branch, NJ, so  that  their children  would be able to receive a better education.  And while Mrs. Thornton was unable to attend  college, she pushed all of her daughters to accomplish something that she would never be  able to do.  With the help of scholarships and their parent’s  inspiration, all six daughters graduated  from Monmouth University  in Long Branch.  Having learned early on the importance of an  education, these six sisters now want to give  the same opportunity they had to other young  women.

It is a date that if Medgar Wiley Evers  were here, he would be very proud to  see debate on this floor, to see individuals from all walks of life representing  people here. This is what democracy is  all about. I appreciate all that has been  said. It is in this spirit that we move  forward from this day, not just in my  State, but in this country to make it  indeed a better place. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2003
224,House,108,0.342,8,2003-06-16,Mr. PICKERING.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON) for his leadership on the resolution today, for asking me to join with  him, as we at the Arlington Cemetery  joined together today not only with  the gentleman  from Mississippi  (Mr.  THOMPSON), but Senator COCHRAN, who  led this resolution in the Senate last  week,  and Senator LOTT, who was  present at the cemetery today, shows  that not only does an idea live on, but  the example of courage and also the attitude of wanting not only to love all  people, to find a way that not only did  we demand the equality and the freedom that God gives us, but then we  find a way to work together and come  together.  I think the message  from  Myrlie Evers today and from the other  speakers,  from  the gentleman  from  California (Mr. THOMPSON), is in the  best sense not only the best example  from Mississippi, but one of the best  examples for our Nation as we try to  heal  the wounds and  reconcile and  work together, and to continue the  work and the commitment of equal opportunity for all of our people and all  of our citizens.  I am proud to represent the home of  Edgar Evers in east central Mississippi,  Newton  County  and Decatur. Last  week, Mississippians from all over the  State joined to celebrate his birthplace  and to commemorate his life and his  death 40 years ago, but it was in one of  the regions that some of the most violent and hateful struggles, and now 40  years later, all races, all backgrounds,  all political parties coming to pay tribute to Medgar Wiley Evers and his family. It is a tribute and example of what  our Nation has become and what our  State has become and is becoming, but  it reminds us that we still have much  to do, and that the commitment of  Medgar Evers who has harassed,  intimidated, beaten and who was eventually killed, that that example, that life  lived, makes  us  all  recommit  and  renew and hope for the great idea, the  great ideal and the redemption and the  potential and the promise of this country.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Mississippi  (Mr. THOMPSON)  for  his leadership on this issue, and thank  all of the Evers family for what they  have meant to our home State and to  our Nation. ",2003
225,House,108,-0.283,8,2003-06-16,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Mr. Speaker, I  appreciate the opportunity to offer my thoughts  on H. Con. Res. 220, a  resolution  commending Medgar Wiley Evers and his widow,  Myrlie Evers-Williams, for their lives and accomplishments.  I strongly support  this  resolution  to commend Medgar Evers and his widow, Myrlie  Evers-Williams, who were true heroes in their  fight for justice, peace, and civil rights.  Medgar and Myrlie set up the first NAACP  office  in Mississippi, and  fought  tirelessly  to  desegregate  local businesses and schools.  They advocated boycotts of businesses  that  discriminated against blacks, fought for the enforcement of Brown vs. Board of Education,  and helped James Meredith gain admittance  to  the University of Mississippi. Their efforts  made not only Mississippi a better place,  made America a better place.  On June 12, 1963, Medgar Evers made the  ultimate sacrifice for his beliefs—he was shot  in the back and killed. Myrlie later wrote about  their struggles and their life together in a book  entitled ‘ ‘For us, the Living’ ’, which I read as  a young man. Her story of how humble and  decent people fought hard to make a real difference in the lives of millions inspired me.  I regret that I cannot be here in person to  vote on  this  important resolution, but as we  recognize  the 40th anniversary of Medgar  Evers’ assassination and commend him and  his widow, the reason why I’m not able to vote  is a particularly special one. One June 11, my  wife Sara and  I welcomed a son  into  the  world, whom we proudly named Jack Evers  Smith.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise today in solidarity with my congressional  colleagues  to honor  the enduring  legacy of  Medgar Evers and Myrlie Evers-Williams  for  their lives of service and commitment to racial  equality.  Medgar Wiley Evers, was born on July 2,  1925  in Decatur, Mississippi.  In 1943, Mr.  Evers  left high school early and  joined  the  U.S. Army to faithfully serve his country during  WWII. After completing his military duties, Mr.  Evers completed his high school education  and enrolled at Alcorn College in Mississippi.  It was here, at Alcorn College, that he met his  future wife Myrlie Beasley  in 1950. The  following year, on December 24, 1951, the two  were married.  After  completing his undergraduate education Evers and his wife moved  to Mound  Bayou, Mississippi where  they both became  deeply involved in the unfolding civil rights era.  During his time in Mound Bayou, Evers helped  to establish  local  chapters of  the NAACP  throughout the Delta and organize boycotts of  local gas stations that refused to allow blacks  access to their restroom facilities. In 1954, the  legendary ruling of Brown vs. Board of Education was passed deeming school segregation of any  form  legally unconstitutional. Yet  despite  this groundbreaking  legal victory, efforts to actualize the legislation by means of  school integration proved to be difficult at best.  Mr. Evers applied  to and was subsequently  denied admission  to  the University of Mississippi Law School. And while his efforts to  integrate  the state ’s oldest public university  were constantly ridiculed and criticized by traditionalists, Evers’s willingness to fight the racial injustices of the time attracted the attention of many, including the national office of  the NAACP.  Mr. Evers was ultimately appointed as the  first Field Secretary  for  the NAACP; Myrlie  Evers was his assistant. With her by his side,  Medgar Evers worked diligently to register voters in Mississippi. His desire to encourage and  promote the political empowerment of AfricanAmericans throughout the south made him the  target of violent threats against his life. However, despite the vicious verbal attacks against  him, Evers and his wife continued with dedication and courage. They organized rallies and  educated the public about the injustices of racial discrimination and the inequality that continued to exist in the public school system. His  desire  for quality education  for all children  even led him to file suit against the Jackson,  Mississippi public school system. From there,  Mr. Evers proceeded to organize college students, coordinate protest marches, organize  boycotts of businesses  in Jackson, arrange  student sit-ins, and challenge the segregated  bus system.  Throughout his  life, Mr. Evers maintained  that ‘ ‘violence is not the way.’ ’ However even  he was not able to avoid the violence that racial hatred produces. On  June 12, 1963,  Medgar Evers was shot and killed by an assassin ’s bullet in the driveway of his home in  Jackson, Mississippi.  Myrlie Evers was known  to say  that  ‘you  can kill a man, but you can’t kill an idea.’ ’ In  the years after her husband ’s assassination,  Myrlie Evers dedicated herself to the preservation of her husband ’s memory by promoting  those same ideas for which he ultimately gave  his life. Even after remarrying, Mrs. Evers is  often remembered  for  the diligent and often  lonely battle  she waged  to bring Medgar  Evers’s killer to justice. Two trials resulting in  two hung juries allowed the accused gunman  to walk free. It was in 1994 that Byron De La  Beckwith was brought to trial for yet a third  time and was ultimately  found guilty of  the  murder of Medgar Evers, more than 30 years  after the crime was committed. This was the  moment for which she had hoped and prayed,  and now she could peacefully move on with  the next chapter of her life.  On Feb 18, 1995, Myrlie-Evers Williams became the first woman elected to chair the National Board of Directors of the NAACP, a position that she held until 1998. In 1999, she  published her memoirs, entitled  ‘Watch Me  Fly: What I Learned on the Way To Becoming  the Woman  I Was Meant To Be’ ’, which  chronicles her journey from being the wife of  a civil rights activist to becoming an acclaimed  community  leader  in her own  right. Having  lived some of the most difficult times in her life  in the face of public scrutiny, Myrlie Evers-Williams has accepted  the  fate  that has been  handed to her. She says: ‘ ‘I have reached a  point in my life where I understand the pain  and the challenges; and my attitude is one of  standing up with open arms to meet them all.’ ’  The contributions made by both Medgar  Evers and Myrlie Evers-Williams to our society  are immeasurable. Their tireless efforts to advocate for civil rights during a time when our  Nation failed to enforce the fundamental principles of freedom, equality, and justice for all  citizens, speaks to the enormous impact these  VerDate Jan 31 2003  02:41 Jun 17, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K16JN7.023 H16PT1 ‘ ‘ ",2003

228,House,108,-0.396,36,2003-06-16,Mr. STUPAK.," As you were saying, if  the Secretary of Health and Human  Services cannot negotiate, so we give  your mother, who is 93 years old, this  voucher, who negotiates for her? It is  $4,500. There is no guarantee it will not  go up. What happens if it does go up?  So how do these plans, who are not  under the care of the government, keep  your costs down? They will restrict the  access to the pharmaceuticals, because  that is the most rapidly rising part of  health care. So  instead of providing  that benefit, they will provide you with  a voucher to take care of all your  health care needs and then for the prescription drugs, if you have some left  over, but only if that plan will cover  the prescription drug you need.  It is really crazy. Any drug that is  not in the plan’s formulary would not  be covered. Beneficiaries would have to  pay then 100 percent out-of-pocket of  the costs of that drug because it is not  in their plan, it is not in that voucher  that they got. I think the gentleman  from Washington makes a great point,  how do we know what mine, yours or  your parents’ health care needs will be  3 or 4 years from now? Once you go into  these plans, can you come back in to  traditional Medicare? Probably, but at  a cost you cannot afford.  So, the points brought up tonight are  well taken, and I appreciate the gentleman coming and joining us from the  Committee on Ways and Means. As you  do your markup, we will be doing ours.  And do not feel too bad. Those on the  Democratic side, we have not seen the  Republican proposal. We know we will  see it tomorrow at 1 o’clock. Then we  will make some statements about it,  and then when the real markup begins,  they will slip a substitute in there so  we will be scrambling to make sure our  amendments are corresponding to the  bill, but we do not even have the courtesy to see it before we even begin this  markup. Probably  the greatest program we can put forth right now is prescription drugs. Our parents, we, everyone needs it. But yet here we are, the  night before the beginning of the markup, whether  it  is the Committee on  Ways and Means or the Committee on  Energy and Commerce, and we cannot  see the bill.  ",2003

Mr. Speaker, in just the sixth year of this  school’s existence,  their baseball  team has  won the Class A state baseball championship.  This is no small feat in the state of Florida, for  ours is a state known for great baseball and  baseball greats such as Fred McGriff, Alex  Rodriquez, and Chipper Jones. This year the  state of Florida had 50 men on Major League  Baseball spring training rosters.  This group of fourteen young men and five  coaches compiled a 26–2 record on the way  to their state championship, and along the way  won the American Plumbing Classic in Jacksonville,  the district, and regional championships. For some on this team, these winning  ways are nothing new as Providence was District champion and Regional runner-up in 2001  and made the State Final Four in 2002.  Mr. Speaker, while the crowning moment of  this team’s season came at the end of a 7– 2 win over Orangewood Christian at Tampa ’s  Legend’s Field,  it was more  than  just 28  games that went into this championship. For  most of these young men, this championship  started at age 5 or 6 and has continued  through many  spring and  summer  league  games since. This championship came with  the help and sacrifices of family, friends and  multiple coaches, many of whom are volunteers. This victory came at the expense of free  time, other school functions, and even some  blood, sweat, and a few tears.  It  takes a  lot  to be a champion and  this  team, their family, friends, and coaches have  all shown they know what it takes.  I wish continued success to all fourteen of  these young men who make up  the Providence School’s baseball team: Kellyn Townsend, Joshua Maxwell, Kyle Wilson, Austin  Heilig, Travis Martin, Jordan Bowser, Tim Aldridge,  Connor  Hodges,  Steven  Turner,  Hunter Robinson, Ryan Kramer, Blake Gerber,  Tim Brown, and Robert Hardee. I also wish  continued success  to Head Coach Billy Bell  and his four assistants: Mark Aldridge, Greg  Larrick, Jim Martin, and Mac Mackiewitz. f  THANKING MR.

230,House,108,0.384,2,2003-06-24,Ms. DUNN.," Mr. Speaker, later this  week, we will pass a prescription drug  benefit for all seniors in Medicare that  is affordable and voluntary. We will  protect the poorest seniors by helping  pay for their drug costs immediately.  By using the same principles already  used by private companies, we will  lower drug costs for seniors by passing  along to them bigger discounts from  manufacturers.  We will also strengthen Medicare for  future generations by providing preventive care such as cholesterol screening and  initial physical exams, and  chronic care management for seniors  with serious and complicated illnesses.  We can only strengthen Medicare’s  future if we are able to ensure access to  the services that seniors need today. In  this Medicare bill, we  increase payments to doctors and hospitals, especially  in  the  rural communities,  so  that seniors can get better health services when they are needed.  For much too long, our parents and  our grandparents have paid too much  for their drugs. We have an opportunity now to change this, by passing a  prescription drug bill for all seniors.  f  WAR IN IRAQ: MANUFACTURED  CATASTROPHE  (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

233,House,108,0.54,16,2003-06-24,Mr. COX.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona  (Mr. SHADEGG), the chairman of the  Subcommittee  on  Emergency  Preparedness and Response.  ",2003
234,House,108,0.749,16,2003-06-24,Mr. SHADEGG.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  this  time. I rise in strong support of H.R.  1416, the Homeland Security Technical  Corrections Act.  Today’s  bill  represents our committee’s first adjustment of the Homeland Security Act. As  we have been examining some of the  issues pertinent to homeland security,  it will be necessary to make other  changes to the act in order to provide  clearer counsel to the Department as it  undertakes  its massive new  responsibilities. For example, on my Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness  and Response, we have discovered that  while the Department’s main mission  is to prevent terrorist attacks against  the United States, the law fails to rest  the  specific  responsibility  for  preventing such attacks with any one of  the four directorates; and therefore it  is unclear which of those directorates  is in charge of this most critical mission. Other examples of how and where  fine tuning of the statute is needed will  arise as we do our work, and we will  act to improve the law.  Mr.  Speaker,  the Department  of  Homeland Security became a reality  just in March. It represents the largest  reorganization of the Federal Government since World War II. This is truly  a herculean task, but the Department  has taken some important steps to assist our Nation’s readiness for emergencies. $566 million has been made  available to the States and the cities  from the fiscal year 2003 budget to assist  first responders  in the  form of  funding for equipment, training, planning and exercises. $750 million has  been made available for firefighter assistance grants  from the  fiscal year  2003 budget to help rural, urban and  suburban fire departments better train,  prepare and equip themselves. On April  30, $1.5 billion was made available to  States and localities from the fiscal  year 2003 supplemental budget to help  State and local law enforcement personnel pay for equipment, training and  exercises and to offset the costs associated with enhanced security measures  deployed during heightened periods of  threat. On May 14, $700 million was allocated from the fiscal year 2003 supplemental budget as part of the urban  area security initiative for 30 cities and  their contiguous counties and mutual  aid partners to enhance the security of  urban areas with high-density populations.  I rise in strong support of this legislation. I thank the chairman for bringing it forward. I look forward to working to make our Nation more secure. ",2003
235,House,108,0.559,23,2003-06-24,Mr. HAYWORTH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank my friend from Florida for yielding me this time, and I would rise in  support of this rule.  It has been interesting to hear the  debate, if we could characterize it as  that, thus far. We hear about an internal  redistricting dispute within  the  State of Texas. We have  the other  friends predictably come to this well  and somehow try to trot out the shopworn thesis that the people’s economic  security at home should be invalidated  by command and control spending here  in Washington; and undergirding all  this, Mr. Speaker, is this simple proposition for the left: it is never enough.  Indeed, if we take the debate and the  dispute as it is here and in so many different areas, our  same  friends who  come to us time and again on different  issues and would have the American  people believe that they are the champions of eliminating the deficit, that  they are for fiscal responsibility, when  it comes to spending programs, and  perhaps this one especially, they begin  from the thesis that there  is never  enough spending, not that the considerable resources that we will bring to  bear in this appropriation, billions of  dollars, can be utilized  in  judicious,  concentrated  fashion to bring about  the desired ends. No, no.  Mr. Speaker, the resounding chorus  from the left is, it is never enough,  with an interesting variation. If one  succeeds in America, they are to be  singled out  for punishment  for succeeding,  for paying  their  taxes; we  want to reinstitute taxes on them because their economic security or the  economic  security  they  provide  to  workers they hire  in small business  should be invalidated for the class warfare scenario that states somehow they  are unworthy because they succeed.  So my friends will offer an amendment, I suppose, later when we move  this on to raise taxes; and I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, to this House and to  my colleagues, in so doing, they are denying what is obvious and that is that  there is a link between economic security for all Americans and homeland  security for all Americans.  Just as we understand the best social  program on Earth is a job, we get there  not from the command and control of  the left who believe the answer is always in bureaucratically driven jobs.  We get there by allowing people to use  their money to save, spend and invest  to create new jobs in the private sector; and yes, we maintain a judicious  and concentrated use of funds to protect our homeland and to protect the  American people. b1230  But again, Mr. Speaker, remember  what the resounding chorus will be  from the left: It is never enough. And  there are myriad uses for your money  over and beyond the saving, spending  and investing of same in your family’s  economic security.  You see, I do not believe, Mr. Speaker, these two goals are mutually exclusive.  I believe  the American people  need to keep more of their hard-earned  money to save, spend, and invest, because I believe it will lead to higher  employment and economic gains. But I  also believe the bill we will consider  today stands up for national security,  makes a difference for this American  Nation, and so I would ask my colleagues to join with me in voting in the  affirmative.  ",2003
236,House,108,0.503,23,2003-06-24,Mr. CULBERSON.," Mr. Speaker, with  some  personal  experience,  having  served 14 years in the Texas Legislature, and having many  friends who  serve in the Texas House, and having  just been elected in the 2000 election, I  felt compelled to come to the floor and  offer some personal perspective on the,  I think, highly improper and blatant  partisan attacks that the Democrats  are making that have absolutely nothing to do with homeland security.  The  Inspector General has already  made a report on whatever allegations  the Democrats are making. The Inspector General has already determined  that everything  that was done was  properly done. The majority  leader’s  office has said repeatedly, and this is  confirmed by the Inspector General’s  report, that there was no contact between the majority leader’s office and  the Department of Homeland Security.  This is an irrelevant distraction from  the core important work that this Congress and the Nation must do in protecting our borders, in preventing people from coming across the border who  might pose a threat to the security of  this Nation.  The Democrats in Texas who walked  off the job in the regular session of the  legislature did so in a way that the  public in Texas, the people of Texas  recognized was improper; that it was  wrong for them to walk off. And in fact  it is incredible to me that the Democrats who walked off the job did so in  a way that completely defied the majority will of the people of Texas.  Since Reconstruction, since 1876, the  Democrats have controlled the State of  Texas. We just elected a new Republican majority to the Texas House. The  Texas Senate is now Republican. Our  Governor is Republican. The Federal  courts have controlled our prisons for  up to 25 years. I led the effort to regain  control over our Texas prison system  from Federal Judge William Wayne  Justice. Our State courts control our  school finance system. Federal courts  control our mental health hospitals in  Texas. And it is entirely proper, in fact  it is essential under our constitutional  republican  form of government that  the people control their institutions,  that the people control the way their  congressional districts are drawn, and  a majority of the people of Texas elected a Republican Legislature to pass Republican legislation.  Now, I can attest, as the Republican  whip in the Texas House, that I still  have tread marks on my back  from  being run over every day by Ann Richards and Speaker Pete Laney.

239,House,108,0.29,30,2003-06-24,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of  the fiscal year 2004 Homeland Security  appropriations bill. This bill is a first  of its kind but, more important, in the  history that is being created with this  first-ever homeland bill is the fact that  this bill, simply put, makes America  and my home State of New Jersey a  safer place.  We in New Jersey and New York and  the New York metropolitan area know  better than most how vulnerable an  open and free society can be. We put a  very human face on the homeland security issue, as 700 New Jersey citizens  went into Lower Manhattan that terrible morning on September 11, 2001,  and never came home again, and many  more people in New York City as well  and residents from over 80 countries.  This is all very personal.  These appropriations  if  spent and  managed wisely may well prevent another catastrophic attack on American  soil. While we can never really totally  eliminate our vulnerabilities, this bill  takes important steps to better protect  our people and the infrastructure that  carries  them  into and around New  York City and over and under the Hudson River each and every day and protects people in other communities and  cities around the Nation as well.  Notably, this historic bill recognizes  that, while the Department of Homeland Security has the lead in developing our national homeland security  strategy, implementation of the strategy requires the active collaboration  VerDate Jan 31 2003  03:23 Jun 25, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K24JN7.064 H24PT1 ",2003
240,House,108,0.417,37,2003-06-24,Mr. NUSSLE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak  on the unfolding of the appropriations process  for fiscal year 2004 and the Homeland Security appropriations bill in particular. The actual  appropriations process commenced on April  10 when, five days before the statutory deadline,  the U.S. Congress agreed  to a budget  resolution that established an overall limit or  allocation on appropriations  2004.  THEBUDGETRESOLUTION  The budget resolution provided a total allocation  for  discretionary  appropriations  of  $785.6 billion in fiscal year 2004, including the  amounts held in reserve for the Bioshield initiative. This represents a 2.6 percent increase  over the current year, which is slightly higher  than  the  rate of  inflation. Additionally,  the  budget resolution allowed an additional $23.2  billion to be appropriated in advance for fiscal  year 2005.  The Congress agreed on this number after  considerable deliberations involving the Leadership,  the Budget and Appropriations Committees, and rank and file Members. We started with CBO’s  reestimate of  the President  budget request of $786.6 billion. We added  $890 million  for  biological  and  chemical  threats and another $215 million for the Iraq  supplemental. At  the same  time,  it was  reduced by $2.2 billion to reflect advance appropriations that were not part of the President’s  original budget submission.  302(b) ALLOCATIONS  Last week the House Appropriations Committee finally decided how to divide that allocation across  its 13 appropriations subcommittees. Under these allocations, total appropriations for defense and military construction will  have climbed by 7.1 percent a year between  fiscal years 2000 and 2004. Somewhat surprisingly, all other non-defense discretionary  spending will have increased over the same  period by a robust 8.2 percent.  The Appropriations Committee appropriately  exercised  its prerogative  to allocate  funding  based on Congressional priorities. The Appropriations Committee comes in under the Administration request ’s by $3.2 billion  for defense and $1.8 billion for Foreign Affairs. At  the same time, it would exceed the President’s  request by $448 million for Labor, HHS and  Education, $400 million  for VA–HUD, $279  million  for Energy & Water, $221 million  for  Agriculture, and $241 million  for Commerce,  State & Justice.  HOMELANDSECURITYAPPROPRIATIONS  Today we consider the first of these appropriations bills, H.R. 2555, the Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2004. This is a landmark occasion: the first separate appropriation  bill for the Department of Homeland Security,  which consolidates 22 Federal agencies and is  expected to reach 180,000 employees. The spending levels in this important measure are consistent with the limits for fiscal year  2004. The bill provides $29.4 billion in appropriations for fiscal year 2004, an increase of  $8.1 billion or 38 percent above  last year’s  level. Much of this increase is for Border and  Transportation, Emergency Preparedness, Informational Analysis and  the Coast Guard.  With  total  fiscal  year  2004  appropriations  equal to the allocation for the Homeland Security Subcommittee, the bill complies with the  Congressional Budget Act.  The bill does provide an advance appropriation for Bioshield in fiscal year 2005, however,  that is not permitted under the terms of the  budget resolution.  H.R. 2555 does not contain any emergencydesignated BA, which are exempt from budget  limits. Nor does it rescind any previously appropriated BA.  This bill demonstrates Congress’ unflinching  commitment to win the war against terrorism.

241,House,108,0.211,44,2003-06-24,Mr. LOBIONDO.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today to offer an amendment that continues my campaign and the campaign  of many others to ensure that our maritime security efforts have as much resources available to defend against the  potential disaster of an attack at one  or more of our ports. My amendment  would increase funding for the Coast  Guard  by  $110 million;  $35 million  would go to fund the congressionally  mandated review and approval of approximately 10,000 facilities and vessel  security plans that owners and operators must submit to the Coast Guard  next year; and $75 million to help get  the critically needed Deep Water Acquisition Program back on track.  My amendment would provide roughly half of what has been requested for  support by the Coast Guard for these  programs. b1545  Tomorrow in the full Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure session, we will be marking up the 2004  Coast Guard Authorization Act, which  provides the funding for these important programs at the level requested  and supported by the Coast Guard.  I would add that over 85 Members of  the House have sent the appropriators  a letter in support of our authorized  level of funding.  At a May 22 hearing before my subcommittee,  the  commandant of  the  Coast Guard explained that the Coast  Guard would need an additional $70  million to fund 150 full-time personnel  to review and approve of the Vessel and  Facility Security Plans mandated by  the MTSA. If these plans are not reviewed  and  approved  by  the Coast  Guard within a year of its submission,  the owners will not be allowed to operate their vessels in U.S. waters, and  noncompliant port facilities would be  shut down.  With 95 percent of our Nation’s trade  entering and  leaving our ports, this  will have a chilling effect on our economy. Moreover, without  additional  funding to meet this congressionally  imposed mandate, the Coast Guard will  have to divert precious resources and  personnel from other traditional missions,  including  search  and  rescue,  drug  interdiction,  and  fisheries  enforcement. My amendment would provide $35 million for this purpose, half of  what is needed.  At a June 3 hearing before my subcommittee,  the  commandant  announced his support for the $702 million  in  funding  for Deepwater. This  level of  funding  represents what  is  needed to counteract 3 years of underfunding and would get the program  back on track.  The Coast Guard operates the second  oldest naval  fleet  in the world, and  some assets have been commissioned  since World War II. Nearly half of the  110-foot Patrol Boat Fleet is in immediate need of repair for structural deterioration and has cost over 6 months of  lost patrol days on the west coast. On  average, the High Endurance Cutter  Fleet is having a fire in their main engineering spaces on every patrol, and  the fleet’s main search and rescue helicopter is equipped with radar designed  and  installed  nearly  20  years  ago.  Therefore, the successful and timely  implementation of Deepwater would  ensure  that  the Coast Guard would  have the modern assets necessary to  respond to any threats necessary.  Mr. Chairman, I understand the very  difficult decision-making process that  confronted the appropriators in drafting this bill. I commend the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. YOUNG) and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS)  for their work, and at this point  I  would indicate my willingness to withdraw my amendment if the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS) would be  willing to enter into a colloquy with  me.

243,House,108,-0.416,58,2003-06-24,Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the last  word.  Mr. Chairman, for the better part of  2 years now we have been promised a  vote on closing the Bermuda loophole,  an effort to amend this process on the  floor where the Republican leadership  has accepted by a margin so lopsided  that it rivals any vote that we will  take in any given legislative year. I believe 318 members of this House voted  to do something about these corporate  expatriates who not only  leave  the  United States to avoid paying taxes  but then have the unmitigated gall to  bid on defense work in homeland security legislation. Ingersoll Rand, TYCO,  these companies are avoiding billions  of dollars  in taxes,  joint taxes estimated that we would garner, an additional $5 billion  if we would simply  close the Bermuda tax loophole.  Now, I know what the talking points  of the Republican Party are on this. It  is the corporate tax structure that is at  fault. Well, if that is the case after 9  years why have not we done something  about it? It is unbelievable where we  had a chairman of the Committee on  Ways and Means who used to say he  was going to pull the Tax Code up by  its roots. Well, America tonight knows  that that tax system  is more complicated and more unfair than ever.  We were  going  to  drive  a  stake  through the heart of the Tax Code. We  were going to have tax simplicity. You  know what we have had? We have had  the rewarding of rich friends by our  failure to address this issue.  For the Americans that are viewing  this evening, I would ask you what  would happen if you moved to Bermuda  and declared that by renting a post office box you had taken citizenship on  that island nation. b1730  The IRS would be after you the next  day. There would be no avenue of retreat, no opportunity to do what these  corporations are doing. We have got  150,000 troops in Iraq tonight; and we  talk about patriotism, while these guys  renounce their citizenship and everybody knows that they continue to do  substantial business and have  their  real corporate addresses here  in the  United States? And yet we cannot get a  vote in this House of Representatives  on that matter.  Two years ago, David Rogers in the  Wall Street Journal was promised by  the  leadership of this House  ‘‘there  would have to be a vote on the Bermuda tax loophole.’’ We are no closer  to doing that this evening than we  were 2 years ago; and that argument,  again it galls everybody. It is the corporate tax structure that is at fault,  not  these  folks moving offshore  to  avoid their responsibilities to live in  this great Nation. That is patriotic, to  pay our taxes and the $82 billion that  Iraq is costing and $42 billion for homeland security.  We define patriotism by allowing  these guys to move their corporate address to Bermuda for one exclusive purpose, to avoid taxes. What does that  say about this great Nation and our  principles? Yet the intransigence of the  leadership on the majority side month  after month after month is to do nothing about it. Put that question on the  floor here about whether or not these  folks should pay their taxes and I tell  my colleagues what we would get, 350  votes for it and everybody knows it.  ",2003

245,House,108,-0.384,72,2003-06-24,Mr. STRICKLAND.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to discuss the  funding  of  the Federal Emergency  Management Agency. The bill before us  includes $1.8 billion in disaster assistance for FEMA to use in fiscal year  2004 to assist the many communities  across the country that will encounter  natural disasters such as ice storms,  tornadoes, and forest fires.  Mr. Chairman, I planned to offer an  amendment  today  that would have  given FEMA an additional $1.6 billion  that it needs just to cover a shortfall  in disaster assistance for the 2003 year. b1945  But the communities that are waiting for this money cannot wait any  longer. They cannot wait for the new  fiscal year to begin in October when  FEMA’s  coffers will be  replenished.  The administration has an obligation  to ask Congress immediately to provide FEMA with the money it needs to  help the communities that were promised assistance by the President when  he declared those cities and towns disaster areas. FEMA is running so low on  money right now that I understand the  agency is only fulfilling a part of its  mission under the Stafford Act, parts A  and B  for debris removal and emergency protection measures.  While I believe it is very important  for FEMA to provide funds for these  important categories of assistance, relief under categories C through G of  the Public Assistance Program are also  vitally  important. Unfortunately,  I  have been informed that FEMA has frozen funding for the Public Assistance  Programs that help communities rebuild roads and bridges as well as public buildings and utilities. This is unacceptable.  I know that the communities in the  29 counties in Ohio that the President  declared  disaster  areas  this winter  have already expended money to rebuild the local infrastructure required  to get these towns back on their feet.  In one of my counties, Monroe County,  Ohio, the county engineer has already  spent so much money and has failed to  be reimbursed for it that he has had to  lay off  five county employees. Five  workers in Monroe County, Ohio, are  unemployed tonight because FEMA has  not met its obligations.  In southern Ohio, FEMA approved  1,363 projects across 29 counties to be  funded  following  this  winter’s  ice  storms that occurred  in my district  and districts of many other Members  throughout  the  region, both Republican and Democratic Members. Because  of FEMA’s  funding  shortfall,  however,  293  reconstruction projects  remain to be funded. Only 80 percent of  approved projects in Ohio have been  completed  since  last  winter’s  ice  storm. The State is still waiting for $11  million from FEMA to finish up the remaining 293 projects, but across this  country the situation is the same.  The National Emergency Management Association has  indicated  in a  letter to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. HASTERT) and the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. PELOSI) that thousands of applications will go unanswered if supplemental appropriations  in the range of $1.6 billion are not  passed  immediately. More  than  35  States and Territories have  experienced disasters just this year and thousands of projects in those States will  go unfunded unless the administration  asks Congress for supplemental appropriations.  I am circulating a letter to Secretary  Ridge today, and I ask all of my colleagues to join me. We should ask Secretary Ridge to work with the administration to ensure that a request for  supplemental appropriations  is made  VerDate Jan 31 2003  05:55 Jun 25, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24JN7.065 H24PT1 ",2003
246,House,108,-0.389,86,2003-06-24,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, the Medicare bill that we will vote on this week  is a bad bill. It undercuts this critical  program that has been provided health  care to millions of seniors. It provides  spotty  coverage  that will not help  these  seniors with  their  expensive  medications. And it reneges on a promise that we have made to America’s  seniors by ending Medicare as we have  known it. But I want to talk about a  particularly objectionable provision in  this bill that has not gotten much attention. The part that cuts funding for  cancer care.  The Medicare bill  is  supposed  to  make  it  easier  for patients  to get  health care, but it will actually make  it harder for cancer patients to get the  care they need. Cancer  is a scourge  that has touched nearly every person  and family in this country. Cancer patients and their loved ones have a very  strong loyalty to the medical professionals, this whole team of oncology  care givers who deliver what is so often  brutal  treatment. This  is especially  true of the often unsung heros of quality cancer care, oncology nurses.

247,Senate,108,-0.37,121,2003-06-24,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, I rise  today in strong support of the amendment No. 1001 offered by my colleague  from California, Senator BOXER.  The Senate is debating legislation to  provide seniors with prescription drugs  that is a start but there are also many  shortcomings with  this bill. One of  most glaring shortcomings is the gap  in  drug  coverage.  It  doesn’t make  sense. As drug costs rise, benefits get  shut off and seniors with high drug  costs have to pay all of their drug costs  from $4,500 to $5,800. I think that is  cruel.  How would this amendment address  this shortcoming?  It is simple. This amendment would  let seniors continue to have continuous  coverage until you hit the catastrophic  cap of $5,800 so that means no gap. And,  then your copay would drop to 10 percent just like in the bill. No figuring  out when you hit the coverage gap. No  figuring out how long you are going to  be in the hole. No paying premiums  and not getting benefits. You simply  get drug coverage.  Why is this amendment important?  The coverage gap imposes a  ‘‘sickness tax’’ on seniors. Once drug spending reaches $4,500 and this is a senior  who clearly  is  facing serious health  problems this senior would now have to  pay $1,300 of their own money without  any help from the Government even  though they are still paying premiums  to stay in the plan.  What does this mean?  Millions of our seniors will have no  drug coverage for several months out  the year. Their coverage will just stop  and for many; it may not start back up  again until the next year.  This is wrong. I believe honor thy  mother and father is not just a good  commandment to live by, it is good  public policy to govern by. That is why  I feel so strongly about Medicare. Congress created Medicare to provide a  safety net for seniors. I don’t think  there should be any holes in that net.  That is why I support this amendment  and urge my colleagues to also. ",2003

Allied Command Transformation  replaces the old Allied Command Atlantic, which  had been responsible  for keeping open sea  lanes between North America and Europe during the Cold War. Today, NATO faces a more  pressing task: transforming allied forces from  static  formations designed  for  territorial defense  to expeditionary  forces able  to deploy  wherever needed to combat security threats.  By locating Allied Command Transformation in  Norfolk, home to U.S. Joint Forces Command,  the  transformation  lessons being  learned by  the U.S. military can be shared with our NATO  allies.  The  establishment  of  Allied  Command  Transformation is an important part of the new  NATO command structure, which reduces the  number of NATO headquarters from 20 to 11  and  eliminates  geographic  responsibilities.  This  leaner, deployable command structure  will allow the Alliance to command missions  wherever  the member countries decide  that  NATO is needed.  This Member wishes to commend to his colleagues the attached speech by Lord Robertson, the Secretary General of NATO, at the  ceremony  to  commission Allied Command  Transformation on June 19, 2003. REMARKS BY THE SECRETARYGENERAL OF  NATO, LORDROBERTSON, ATTHECEREMONY  COMMISSION THENEWALLIED  TO THE OF COMMANDTRANSFORMATION  Admirals, Generals, Ladies and Gentlemen,  this is a unique ceremony, because we are  not only welcoming a new commander—we  are also changing fundamentally the very  nature and purpose of this strategic headquarters.  Indeed, we are creating a new  organisation all together. That, in the history of this great Alliance, makes this a very  special day.  Our first task is to thank the man who has  led Allied Commander Atlantic since last October—Admiral Sir  Ian Forbes. Admiral  Forbes, your predecessor, General Kernan,  once described Allied Command Atlantic as  NATO’s bridge to the future. When you took  command of this headquarters, you vowed to  continue that mission. You have done so and  with true distinction. Your staff here at Norfolk has nothing but the highest praise for  the work you have done here. That is an  most important testimonial.  Let me add my own thanks, and congratulations, for the important work you have  done here since January 2002, first as Deputy  and then as Acting Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic. You have provided sound  leadership in Norfolk through a critical period of concluding SACLANT’s  successful  mission and defining the role—and I might  add, daring role—this new command will  play in the Alliance. We will continue to  value your leadership as Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Transformation.  Admiral Giambastiani—or Admiral ‘‘G’’, as  you are already known here—this is your  first day on the job. But you have already  made history, as the first commander of the  new Allied Command Transformation. This  is an honour that is well deserved. I would  like to congratulate you, as well, on this appointment.  In the coming years, Admiral, you will  have a key role to play in shaping NATO’s  transformation. It is a transformation that  has already begun, and the establishment of  this Command—ACT—is proof positive. ACT will shape the future of combined and  joint operations. It will identify new concepts, and bring them to maturity. It will  then turn these transformational concepts  into reality; a reality shared by the entire  NATO Alliance. And it will do so in close cooperation with the U.S. Joint Forces Command co-located here, to ensure that NATO’s  transformation stays in lock step with the  changes taking place in the United States.  Indeed, the creation of a new permanent  command here  in Norfolk—one dedicated  solely to transformation—demonstrates the  investment NATO  is making  in preparing  itself for 21st century operations.  This Command underscores NATO nations’  commitment  to a continuous, permanent  process of transforming and modernising our  armed forces.  ACT is, in a very real sense, both the symbol of the new NATO, and the architect that  will shape its future. It will play an invaluable role in ensuring that the Atlantic Alliance can continue to defend the security and  interests of its members against threats and  challenges which we cannot even  imagine  today.  ACT is a symbol of this Alliance’s confidant embrace of the future and its challenges.  Admiral Giambastiani, as I said last week  to NATO Defence Ministers in Brussels, your  new  title,  Supreme  Allied  Commander  Transformation, means that you more than  VerDate Jan 31 2003  05:49 Jun 25, 2003 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24JN8.009 E24PT1 ",2003

In an event hosted  by the Congressional Taiwan Caucus here in  the Capitol, President Wang and leaders from  the Defense and Foreign Affairs committees of  the Legislative Yuan briefed Members on important security, economic and health issues  of mutual concern. I greatly welcome such direct exchanges and look forward to more such  opportunities in the future.

On behalf of the members of my traveling  party of fellow Parliamentarians from your  brother democracy in Taipei, permit me to  thank you for your time, your interest, and  your enduring friendship.  This building, targeted by terrorists, is revered by all citizens of Taiwan. It stands as  a beacon for our national cause, for those  who believe in the right of all people on this  planet to choose their own form of government.  On behalf of the freely elected President of  Taiwan, I bring you greetings. President Chen Shui Bian has asked me to  express to you his personal appreciation for  the strong support shown by this Caucus—by  this entire Congress—for building a strong  Taiwan. He particularly asked me to thank  you for supporting our efforts to maintain a  robust defense. By approving sales of appropriate arms to Taiwan, you aid our ability to  deter attack and to provide security for peoples throughout our region. By increasing  confidence  in our self-defense capabilities,  you have helped provide stability in Asia.  Taiwan is moving forward deliberately to  secure the resources for our prudent defense  procurement program. We deeply appreciate  your continued support and that of the Bush  Administration.  As President of the Legislative Yuan, the  ‘congress’ in Taiwan, I am honored to represent some twenty three million citizens.  On their behalf, I thank you for the support  of this Congress—support that has time and  again proven essential if we are to continue  to live in an open, free and democratic society.

253,House,108,0.337,34,2003-07-14,Mr. REHBERG.," Mr. Chairman, I offer  an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. REHBERG: Strike section 743 (page 71, lines 8 through  11), relating to country of origin labeling for  meat and meat products. Mr. Chairman, this is a very simple  amendment, that is why I had it read.  It is country-of-origin labeling.  A vote for this amendment is a vote  in favor of country-of-origin labeling.  A vote against this amendment is a  vote to kill it. The proponents of what  they did in the subcommittee and full  committee will  talk about  the  fact  that they are delaying for 1 year, but  that  does  not  occur. Within  this  amendment, by delaying  the  implementation, you in fact delay countryof-origin labeling because the Department will spend no time on this very  matter. We knew all along the administration did not support this. I have  talked  to  the President  personally  about this. I do not know if they necessarily understand the issue.  The issue is very simple. Do we want  to give our producers in America the  opportunity to tout the fact that their  product was born, raised, and processed  in America? Country-of-origin labeling  offers shoppers a choice, but also provides  farmers and ranchers  fairness.  The issue has been fully debated. It was  debated in the House farm bill. It was  debated  in the Senate  farm bill.  It  passed both bodies. It was signed by  the President; and, in fact, the administration  has  had  twelve  hearings  around the country.  By taking the funding away from the  implementation, you are cutting the  legs out from under American farmers  and ranchers and our ability to know  where our product comes from, and it  makes  you wonder why  somebody  would be reluctant to put their name  or their country on their product. Currently you can buy clothes, you can  buy electronics, you can buy toys that  label where they come from; but you  cannot label meat mandatorily. You do  not know where your meat  is necessarily coming from. And yet you can  buy Australian lamb chops, New Zealand apples, and Chilean sea bass.  Some will try to say that COOL violates  the  international  trade agreements. And that is not true. In fact, in  an article just today, the Japanese officials have said that trade would be  banned beginning September 1 if the  United States cannot certify that exports contained no Canadian beef. Our  number one  importer of our beef  is  Japan. They want country-of-origin labeling. Our number three importer of  our meat is Korea, and they want the  same  labeling.  In  fact,  60 countries  around the world are asking for labeling.  I have brought along an article that  was in the Great Falls paper yesterday,  the Great Falls Tribune. Interesting:  ‘‘This spring after a case of mad cow  disease was confirmed in Alberta, Montana’s cattle industry found out just  how valuable it is to know where cattle  are all  the  time.  In June, officials  learned five bulls from a Canadian herd  linked to the Alberta cow with the disease were sold to a Montana ranch in  1997. The paper trails created by the  State’s  inspection process  traced  in  less than 20 hours where the bulls had  been and where they ended up. Montana’s brand inspection laws are among  the  country’s  strictest. Every  time  branded livestock are moved across a  county line, sold to another owner or  brought to a livestock auction, an official  inspection  must  take  place;  records of those inspections are kept in  a State wide registry. Jack Wiseman,  administrator of brand enforcement of  the Montana Department of Livestock  said, ‘If a cow never left the State of  Montana or was exported to State with  a similar brand laws, we could trace  the ownership of a cow from calf-hood  to death.’’’ Do not listen to me as to why this is  important. Listen  to  somebody who  has some experience in enforcement of  livestock laws. ‘‘‘Montana’s system is  enviable,’ says Larry Gray, the director of Law Enforcement for Texas and  the Southwest Cattle Raisers. The  Lone Star State does not require brand  inspections for stock sales between private individuals. Brands are recorded  at the county  level but there  is no  state-wide registry.  I wish our  laws  were more stringent. That is a problem  in Texas, he said, and right there there  is not a way for State officials to trace  an  individual animal’s history.  ‘Perhaps with  country-of-origin  labeling  which would  show consumers where  meat sold at the retail level is born,  raised, and processed, there will be a  way to trace cattle here.’’’  Does that not scare you to death?  Cattle can be stolen in some States  around this country and we have do not  have the process set up to be able to  tell, like Montana did within 20 hours,  where cattle that had come  from a  State or a country that had a problem,  where those livestock went. It is important that we pass this amendment.  It is important that we carry forward  with  country-of-origin  labeling  for  America, for farmers and ranchers, for  consumers. ",2003
254,House,108,0.4,34,2003-07-14,Mr. BONILLA.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, there is strong bipartisan opposition to this amendment in  this body. It is interesting to note on  this occasion when amendments are  presented before this body how much  misinformation is presented. For the  proponents of this amendment to  in  any way indicate that you cannot put  labels on any meat products at this  time is absurd. This is a free country.  Any producer, any retailer right now  can stick a label that says ‘‘Made in  America’’ on any aisle in any frozen  food section, in any section of the grocery store if they choose to do that.  The misinformation about whether  or not this amendment affects mad cow  disease is one of those fear-mongering  arguments that is often times made in  this town and around the country when  you are trying to reach people at the  emotional level and not at all talking  about the truth in substance about the  issue at hand.  This  country-of-origin  labeling  on  meat products that is in the bill, the  prohibition on funding, has absolutely  nothing to do with mad cow disease.  But  again,  this  argument  is  being  pulled off the shelf to try to scare people into voting for this.  This prohibition that we have put in  this bill simply says that USDA will  not be able to work on enforcing, promulgating, developing any kind of regulation for a year until there can be  more ample study and understanding of  the bill.  This country-of-origin labeling provision that was put in the farm bill last  year is controversial and costly. Many  of our producers out there are shaking  in  their boots  right now wondering  about the liability that they would be  faced with, the action that could be  taken against  them by people who  would simply hold them accountable  for not putting the proper  label on  their product. It could drive them out  of business.  Grocery stores in this country, I do  not care what part of the country you  live in, if you have got a Safeway, if  you have got a, like in Texas, an HEB  Food Store or an Albertson’s, all of the  people who run those grocery stores  are opposed to this amendment because  they have a tremendous liability laying before them if that product is not  labeled appropriately.

259,House,108,-0.19,55,2003-07-14,Mr. DOOLEY of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  motion to instruct. And what we are  really trying to do in essence is to have  this body of the House of Representatives join with a bipartisan majority in  the Senate that passed by 76 votes a  measure to ensure that we would guarantee seniors a prescription drug benefit. For those of us who are so supportive of the Medicare fall-back provisions in the Senate, this is crucial to  Medicare recipients. If we are going to  stand up and be able to promise to senior citizens on Medicare throughout  this country that there will, in fact, be  a prescription drug benefit  in Medicare, we must accept the Senate fallback provisions. b1615  Why should we do this? Because we  have a clear example in the past, where  we have allowed private plans to offer  Medicare+Choice on the promise that  every  senior  in  the United States  would  have  access  to  a  Medicare+Choice  plan.  The  private  plans did not provide it.  And the same thing will happen with  the House-passed  prescription  drug  plan. By offering a drug plan through  private insurance, if there is no Medicare fallback as the Senate has, there  is no guarantee, there is no ability that  we will live up to the promise that we  will provide a prescription drug benefit  under Medicare.  We ought to have reason to be greatly concerned, because the Wall Street  analysts, who really did an assessment  of the likelihood of private insurers offering this benefit, have come to the  conclusion that it is quite unlikely, because this is a stand-alone drug policy  that is difficult to provide and they do  not think the private sector will stand  up and provide that.  Furthermore, the approach that the  House bill is taking is one which tries  to bribe the private insurance companies to provide this prescription drug  benefit. They come to the conclusion  that if the private sector is not stepping up to provide this benefit that the  Federal Government is going to step up  and provide taxpayer money to further  subsidize the private insurer to offer  this benefit.  This is not the approach we should be  taking. If we are going to guarantee a  prescription drug benefit, accept the  Senate fallback provisions.  ",2003
260,House,108,0.556,55,2003-07-14,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield 7 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Connecticut (Mrs. JOHNSON), the  chairwoman of the Subcommittee on  Health of the Committee on Ways and  Means. ",2003
261,House,108,0.122,55,2003-07-14,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for  yielding me time.  First, let us get some facts straight.  Any senior watching this debate needs  to understand that the law provides a  Medicare bundle of benefits, period.  That bundle of benefits will be provided to seniors through the Medicare  fee-for-service  program  and  through  any plan that cares to participate in  Medicare. But the law defines that bundle of benefits, and there is nothing in  this bill that changes that law. So do  not scare seniors that something  is  going  to happen  to  their  benefits.  There is not any plan that can participate under this bill that is not obliged  to offer the Medicare bundle of benefits.  Then let us look at a statement made  earlier about costs. All this bill does is  allow the government to pay a plan the  same amount per average senior beneficiary that we spend anyway per senior under Medicare. Not a penny more;  not a penny less. So this is not going to  increase Medicare spending. This is not  going to explode spending.  That is why CBO and OMB disagreed,  because in the private sector, yes, plan  costs are rising, but in this program we  are only paying the plan precisely what  it costs us for the care of an average  senior under Medicare; no more and no  less. So that is not the issue.  There is only one issue here in terms  of the plans in competition. In 2010,  something important happens. Our seniors have the right to know in 2010  what the plan in any area where it provides the care for 20 percent of the seniors, what the average premiums are in  those plans and what  it  is costing  Medicare to provide care for the average  senior under Medicare  in  those  same areas. This  is  just a  sort of  ‘‘right-to-know’’ issue. Then, when you  know, you can make the choice.  If by that time, 2010, the plans have  gotten a lot more efficient and are either offering a lot more benefits for the  same money or lower premiums or are  inefficient and it is costing them more  and Medicare turns out to be the more  efficient provider, which many of you  on the other side of the aisle have always claimed was true, then, Medicare’s premiums will be lower and it  will make the plans look bad. If in fact  the plans are more efficient providers  than Medicare,  then  the  premium  amount will be somewhat higher for  the Medicare plan and seniors will have  a choice.  The whole process is prejudiced toward weighting the Medicare premiums  heavier than anyone else’s premiums  and phasing in any discrepancy. But  the bottom line is that nobody in the  private sector is going to be paid any  more than the average we spend for a  senior under Medicare. So if Medicare  cannot compete on those terms, I will  tell you, the seniors have a right to  know, and, under this bill, they will.  Now,  let us  look at this  fallback  issue. One of the reasons our bill is so  very efficient and the most efficient  and rated by CBO as saving the most  money for our seniors under the prescription drug program is because the  plan’s sponsors have not only the tools  to manage prescription drugs in a costeffective way, they have the motivation.  I will tell you, how many times have  you seen your kid in college have all  the preparation, have good skills, but  they did not care enough to work hard  and get an A instead of a B-plus? It is  not just a matter of tools, of intelligence, of skills, it is a matter of will,  of desire.  The reason CBO gives us so much  higher an efficiency quota than any  other plan is because our plans have  not the big motivation we gave them a  few years ago, we decided that was too  hard for them to meet, but just a little  motivation. They have a little reason  to care whether or not they notice  whether seniors are going to get the  lowest cost prescription that will help  them, the generic where it is appropriate, so on and so forth, or negotiate  hard with the manufacturers to get the  lowest prices.  So if you do a fallback and a guarantee, what plan in their right mind is  going to get in? They are going to wait  until you get to the fallback so they  have no risk.  If you do not have that, two things  happen. First of all, this is a very big  market. A lot of companies cannot afford not to be plan sponsors. So they  are going to get in, and they are going  to get  in early. Twenty-eight plans  wanted to get in when the President offered his discount card just as a voluntary thing. Those same 28 companies  are going to be interested when, under  this bill, they get the right to offer a  discount card. Why? Because they want  to line up their participants so when  the real plan comes along with the subsidies, the taxpayer subsidies, they will  already have a constituency signed up  in their program.  But this is entirely too big a business  for plan sponsors not to want to be part  of it, so they will accept that risk.  In our bill we guarantee not one fallback but two fallbacks: One that is a  pure drug fallback, and one is a plan  fallback. How are we going to get it?  There are lots of way. You will have  Federal Employee Health Benefit Plans  that already contract the drug benefit  with a plan sponsor. That plan sponsor  might very well be interested in providing drugs-only to seniors. He is already  in the district; he  is already  working with the Federal Government.  That is one option.  Other options are to entice enhanced  plans and advantage plans to provide  that. There are lots of ways to do this.  But if you check off and you check out  the responsibility for some risk in the  game, then you will never have the  price cuts, you will never have the efficiency, and our seniors will be the victims.

The military  regime  is  guilty  of  ethnic  cleansing, systematic rape, forced porterage,  destruction  of  homes,  villages  and  food  sources, the use of human land mine sweepers, and the detention of over 1200 political  prisoners.  Two excellent reports describe the horrifying  systematic  campaign  of  rape  against  the  Shan, Karenni, Karen, Mon, Tavoyan and  other ethnic groups.  In the study License to Rape, investigators  found that in ‘ ‘25 percent of the incidents documented, the girls or women were killed following  the  rape, by being shot, suffocated,  beaten, stabbed or burned to death.’ In the study, No Safe Place: Burma ’s Army  and the Rape of Ethnic Women, there is clear  documentation of  the military raping women  fleeing the fighting, raping those incarcerated  in military camps,  raping  those  forced  into  labor for military, and raping women out foraging for food.  In one case, a young women heard her sister’s cries ‘ ‘they are raping me ’ —but could do  nothing to stop it. A day after she was taken,  the soldiers brought her body back  for  the  family  to bury. Her wounds  indicated clearly  that she had been raped, perhaps to death,  Despite the fact that the soldiers continued to  return  to  their village after  the murder,’ ’  the  young women and her family were too afraid  to complain.  The suffering of the people of Burma has  gone on too long.  Sadley,  the  international  community  has  shown little willingness to vigorously address  the  issues  facing  the people of Burma, but  H.R. 2330 is an important step to directly impact the situation in the country.  I urge  the dictatorship  release Aung San  Suu Kyi from detention.  I also urge the dictatorship of Burma to immediately engage in a tri-partite dialogue with  the National League for Democracy and the  ethnic minorities.  Only when the rights of the NLD and the  ethnic minorities are recognized and protected  will there be peace in Burma.  Mr. Speaker, a regime that engaged in this  horrifying campaign of systematic rape to decimate the ethnic minorities, in addition to all the  other human right violations it commits, must  be stopped.

265,,108,-0.531,76,2003-07-14,Ms. WATSON.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  great sadness that I announce the passing of the legendary musician, Benny  Carter, this past Saturday at CedarsSinai Hospital in Los Angeles. He was  95.  Benny Carter’s  life and career  literally spanned the 20th century. His  music encompassed the history of jazz  and much more. Ranked with the likes  of Johnny Hodges and Charlie Parker,  Benny Carter is considered one of the  greatest alto saxophonists of all times.  Ella Fitzgerald described him as ‘‘everything a musician would want to  be’’; while Miles Davis said,  ‘‘Everybody ought to listen to Benny. He is a  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD—HOUSE July 14, 2003 whole musical  education.’’ And  the  great Ben Webster said about Carter,  ‘‘He is the only person that I get the  shakes trying to play my horn behind  or with him.’’ Born in New York in 1907, Carter received his first music lessons from his  mother, but was largely a self-taught  musician. In the late 1920s he joined  Fletcher Henderson’s seminal orchestra and in 1931 became musical director  for McKinney’s Cotton Pickers.  Returning  to New York  in  1938,  Carter formed his own top-flight orchestra and spent much of 1939 and 1940  at Harlem’s famed Savoy Ballroom. His  arrangements were much  in demand  and featured on recordings by Benny  Goodman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Glen Miller, Gene Krupa,  and  Tommy Dorsey.  We will miss this outstanding and  this exemplary musician. May he rest  in peace.  f  SPECIAL ORDERS  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  GINGREY).

Well, I do not know if my colleagues  can see this on television or not, but  this was mailed out into my district  this past week. It is a picture of a little  baby sucking on a pacifier or something, and underneath it is a mother  with a package of pills that are supposed to be the RU–486, the abortion  pill that would cause an abortion 24  hours after conception, or after conception sometime. It says on the front of  it next to this little baby, ‘‘Will Congressman DANBURTONmiss an opportunity  to  protect  the  sanctity  of  human life?’’ I do not understand that, how a religious organization can be manipulated  by the pharmaceutical industry to do  this sort of thing. They are supposed to  be moral people; and yet I am confident, in fact I am dead sure, that the  Traditional Values Coalition did not  have the money to mail this kind of  trash out to congressional districts all  across this country and also do television ads and radio ads going after  Congressmen because they believe that  seniors ought to be able to get reimported drugs from Canada or Germany or some place else that cost onesixth or one-tenth of what they cost in  the United States.  And the reason the pharmaceutical  industry is dead on the reimportation  is because they are loading all of their  profits on the backs of the American  people while  they are giving  these  pharmaceuticals  for  a much  lower  price  in other parts of the country.  Why should Americans pay six times as  much money for Tamoxifen as they do  in Germany? That is a cancer-fighting  drug that women use to save their  lives. In Canada and  in Germany  it  costs $60 for a 30- or 60-day supply. In  the United States it costs $360. Why  should Americans pay that much more  than other countries?  It  is  because  the  pharmaceutical  companies are making so much money;  and because they are afraid we are  going to pass a reimportation bill, they  are going after the people in the Congress who believe that people ought to  pay the same prices here as they do  other places.  How are they going after us? They  are going after us with a meat cleaver,  and they are trying to do it under a facade, under a tent so that they do not  look like they are the bad guys. I am  telling you, the Traditional Values Coalition and the other religious organizations that are putting out this kind  of garbage, when they know it is not  true, are being funded by the pharmaceutical industries. Now, they might  say, oh, no, we are not.  Well, I tell you, tonight on the floor  of the U.S. House, I am challenging  every one of the religious organizations  in this country who have endorsed me  year after year after year for reelection, I am challenging them tonight to  let us see their financial records because I want to see what the pharmaceutical companies are giving them in  order for them to put this kind of stuff  out. The gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. SMITH), who is the leading advocate for pro-life in this Congress, is a  co-sponsor with me and others for the  reimportation of pharmaceuticals  to  make sure Americans pay a fair price  for pharmaceuticals. But the pharmaceutical companies are scared to death  of that, and so what they are doing is  loading up all of these organizations to  come after us and to make us look like  we are people that we are not.  So I say once again, Traditional Values Coalition who wanted me to be on  your board last year because I am such  a great guy, I want to see your financial records. Please show me your financial records and let me know that  the pharmaceutical companies are not  paying for this trash because I believe  they are. And I say the same thing to  all  the  other  organizations.

267,House,108,-0.432,90,2003-07-14,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.,"  The  gentleman’s analysis brings  forward again  the question then: Who benefits from  this reconstruction in Iraq? While we  cannot have schools built in this country, while we cannot have hospitals  paid for, when we cannot get health  care for our people, who benefits? Who  is getting the contracts for this? Who  is getting the no-bid contracts? Where  is the money coming from? Supposedly  from the oil  revenues. Oil  revenues  then will be passing right out of Iraq  and down to Texas, to Haliburton Company, to some of the other construction  companies  that  are  benefiting  from hundreds of millions of dollars  that are now being allocated into their  pockets directly  for this reconstruction, not in the United States but in  Iraq.  ",2003
268,House,108,-0.338,90,2003-07-14,Mr. HOEFFEL.,"  I  thank  the gentleman from Illinois for pointing out  the inconsistency of our admirable generosity to those overseas and our moral  obligation to help rebuild a nation, a  country that we had to use military  power against but our failure to live up  to that same moral obligation to our  own citizens.  Let me ask my colleagues to respond  to what we would like to see happen in  Iraq. There are 8 or 10 or 15 things perhaps  that we might  recommend.  I  would suggest one, and perhaps my colleagues can make further comment.  I think we need to start with a full  explanation by the President of his vision  for what  is happening,  for the  costs that he believes will be necessary  to complete  the  reconstruction,  the  timetable for that, the number of U.S.  military forces that would be needed.  The President needs to come clean.  He has a growing credibility gap in my  view because of the use and possible  misuse of the intelligence leading up to  the war, the statements made with  such certainty that we are now learning the White House was being advised  by  intelligence agencies  that  things  were not so certain at all and by the  fact, as we have commented earlier tonight, that since the President, as our  colleague from Illinois says, flew onto  that aircraft carrier and declared victory, that 30 American soldiers have  been assassinated and 84, as the gentleman points out, have died in some  fashion since military victory has been  declared. We need to know what the  President  thinks. We need  to know  what he believes will be necessary. He  has got to tell the American people  what is coming. That would be my suggestion for just a fundamental need.  ",2003
269,Senate,108,-0.158,118,2003-07-14,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today with a heavy heart and deep  sense of gratitude to honor the life of a  brave young man from Batesville, IN.  Sgt. Chad L. Keith, 21 years old, was  killed in Baghdad on July 7, 2003 when  he was ambushed while on patrol with  his unit. Chad joined the Army with  his entire life before him. He chose to  risk everything to fight for the values  Americans hold close to our hearts, in  a land halfway around the world.  Chad was the eleventh Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today,  I join Chad’s family, his friends, and  the  entire Batesville  community  in  mourning his death. While we struggle  to bear our sorrow over his death, we  can also take pride in the example he  set, bravely fighting to make the world  a safer place. It is this courage and  strength of character that people will  remember when they think of Chad, a  memory that will burn brightly during  these continuing days of conflict and  grief.  Chad Keith spoke to his mother over  the phone only days before his death,  telling her that he was hot and tired,  but proud to be making a difference in  the world and following in the footsteps of several of his uncles who also  served  in  the military. He was described by teachers and classmates as a  polite, respectful young man who always had a smile on his face.  Chad was born in Pennsylvania, then  moved to Newark, OH, before his family settled  in Batesville. Chad graduated from Batesville High School in  2000 and then joined the Army, where  he was assigned to the elite 82nd Airborne. Friends and  family  say  that  serving in the military had been a lifelong dream  for Chad, who was only  days away from being promoted to sergeant, an honor that now has been  awarded posthumously. Chad leaves behind his parents, Kimberly and Mark  Hitzges, two sisters, Courtney and Nicole, and a brother, Alex.  As I search for words to do justice in  honoring Chad Keith’s sacrifice, I am  reminded of President Lincoln’s  remarks as he addressed the families of  the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,  we cannot hallow this ground. The brave  men, living and dead, who struggled here,  have  consecrated  it,  far above our poor  power to add or detract. The world will little  note nor long remember what we say here,  but it can never forget what they did here. This statement is just as true today  as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am  certain that the impact of Chad Keith’s  actions will live on far longer than any  record of these words.  It is my sad duty to enter the name  of Chad L. Keith in the official record  of the United States Senate  for his  service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about  this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that  comes with the loss of our heroes, I  hope that families like Chad’s can find  comfort in the words of the prophet  Isaiah who said, ‘‘He will swallow up  death in victory; and the Lord God will  wipe away tears from off all faces.’’ May God grant strength and peace to  those who mourn, and may God bless  the United States of America. f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  TRIBUTE TO JAMES  HOLLINGSHEAD  ∑",2003

On Sunday, June 8, 2003, Mr. Doyle  Mosley and his wife Linda were enjoying their annual  family vacation  in  Destin, FL.

271,,108,0.229,153,2003-07-14,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Speaker, It is with great  pleasure  that  I rise  today  to honor and pay  tribute to a leader in the business and banking  community—Wilmington Trust Company, one  of the nation’s principal providers of wealth advisory, banking, and corporate client services.  Wilmington Trust is celebrating 100 years of  business, a milestone few companies manage  to achieve. This company has proved outstanding over the years and on behalf of myself and the citizens of the First State, I would  like to congratulate Wilmington Trust on all of  their accomplishments in the past 100 years  and offer  it continued success  in  the many  years to come.  Today, I recognize Wilmington Trust for their  accomplishments in the State of Delaware as  well as the rest of the nation. Serving clients  in 60 countries demonstrates their strong loyalty and support from all their customers.  Family, friends, and fellow Delawareans can  now take a moment to truly appreciate everything Wilmington Trust has offered to the community. One hundred years ago, T. Coleman  duPont recognized the need for secure financial resources in Delaware’s growing business  sector. The company has never had an unprofitable year and is currently only one of 159  public companies  to have  increased  its dividend for over 20 consecutive years.  July 8, 1903, marks  the  first day  for  the  banking,  trust, and safe deposit company,  originally run out of the dining room of a private  residence. Mr. duPont served with  remarkable vision as President and Chairman of  the company  from 1903–1912. After being  with Wilmington Trust for over 30 years, Robert V.A. Harra, Jr. was elected President  in  1996 and is currently continuing at this position. The current Chairman, Ted T. Cecala,  was elected in 1996 and has worked for Wilmington Trust for over 20 years.  This  centennial  celebration  signifies  100  years of service, growth, and commitment to  the company’s founding principles of integrity,  stability, continuity, independence, and excellence. These core beliefs will help  form  the  foundation for Wilmington Trust’s promising future.  Wilmington Trust’s  accomplishments  and  contributions cannot be commended enough.  As the company celebrates their diamond anniversary, we can be sure their contributions  will continue  for many years. Their commitment  to serving  the community has earned  Wilmington Trust a permanent place in Delaware’s history. TRIBUTE TO LLOYD GAYLES  REESE  HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR.

272,,108,-0.366,153,2003-07-14,Mr. PASCRELL.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  call to your attention the life of an outstanding  individual,  Mr.  Lloyd  Gayles  Reese  of  Paterson, NJ, who sadly passed away earlier  this week. It is only fitting that his legacy be  immortalized in this, the permanent record of  the greatest freely elected body on earth.  Lloyd began his  life’s  journey on January  22, 1938. Born the second son of Theodore  and Cornelia Gayles Reese, Lloyd spent this  formative  years  in Westfield, AL. Already  known for its production of steel and the baseball legend, Willie Mays, Westfield would also  become known for producing a musical legend  as well. Whether through vocal talent or mastering an instrument, the entire Reese family  was musically blessed.  During his grade school and high school  years Lloyd was devoted to playing the piano.  Upon graduating high school, he was offered  several college scholarships  for his musical  talent. Choosing to attend Miles College in Birmingham to be close to his family proved to  be a wise choice for Lloyd. While at Miles, his  self-composed songs and  lyrics gained national attention upon being published in a national anthology of college poems.  Lloyd’s musical talent was discovered by the  late Dorothy Love Coates who witnessed his  abilities at  the Municipal Auditorium  in Birmingham. She quickly hired Lloyd  to  travel  with  the  ‘Original Gospel Harmonettes.’ ’ His  career with the group was abrupt, however, as  Lloyd was drafted to serve in the Army.  Service to his country did not deter Lloyd ’s  passion and dedication to music. He formed  ‘The Originals,’ ’  a  singing  group  at  the  Dugway Proving Ground Army Post, in Utah,  where Lloyd was stationed. The group was so  popular that they participated in All-Army concerts.  Upon receiving an honorable discharge from  the Army, Lloyd came  to my hometown of  Paterson, NJ. Upon his arrival, he became the  choir  director  for  the Solid Rock Baptist  Church. Lloyd’s dedication and talent with the  choir led to their recording on the Verve-MGM  label. This was only  the beginning of many  records for Lloyd. Throughout his professional  career, he enjoyed such hits as  ‘Until we  Meet Again’ ’ and ‘ ‘Spread a Little Sunshine.‘ ‘  Due to the success of his musical endeavors,  Lloyd was able to perform on the great stages  in America, including Radio City Music Hall, in  New York City.  Lloyd returned to focusing on choir performances after the passing of his oldest brother  Theodore Reese, Jr. He began working with  the United Presbyterian Church and the Community  Baptist Church  of  Love,  both  in  Paterson.  In addition he  joined  the William  Paterson College community as the Choir Director.  ‘Professor Reese ’ ’ spent his life devoted to  his talent and his family. The legacy he leaves  us with, should remind us all to be true to our  talents and our loved ones. Lloyd has left an  indelible mark on everyone who has heard  and experienced his music.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me, our colleagues, Lloyd’s family and friends, the Community  Baptist Church  of  Love, City  of  Paterson and all who have been touched by  Lloyd Gayles Reese in recognizing the life of  a great man. f  A TRIBUTE TO MAJOR JAMES  EWALD  HON.

When  the Committee of the Whole House rose on  Tuesday, July 22, 2003, the bill had been  read through page 103,  line 26, and  pending was the amendment by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN).  The gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  LEVIN) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. KOLBE) each have 1 minute  remaining in the debate on the amendment. The gentleman from Arizona has  the right to close.

274,,108,-0.491,5,2003-07-23,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  this  time.  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD—HOUSE H7337 I rise in support of the Levin amendment  and  commend  the  gentleman  from Michigan  for his  leadership  in  bringing this important amendment to  the floor and his important work on behalf of America’s working families.  As House Democratic leader, I proudly assert the Democratic Party’s commitment to trade and what it does for  our  economy. That  commitment  to  trade was  exemplified  in President  Kennedy’s 1962 State of the Union Address, which  I point  to with great  pride. At that time President Kennedy  said: ‘‘For together we face a common  challenge: to enlarge the prosperity of  free men everywhere, to build in partnership a new trading community in  which all free nations may gain from  the productive energy of free competitive effort.’’ That was his challenge and it was followed up by the Kennedy Round, the  most ambitious round of trade negotiations under the aegis of GATT until  that time. The Kennedy Round lasted  from 1963 to 1967. Its goal was to lift up  developing countries of the world, open  our markets to their products to help  them develop and create markets for  U.S. products abroad. The gentleman  from Michigan’s  (Mr. LEVIN) amendment is in keeping with that proud tradition. I thank the gentleman.  Last night the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. KOLBE),  the distinguished  representative of the majority party on  this debate and chairman of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and  Related Programs Subcommittee said  ‘‘I want to commend the gentleman  from Michigan for the crafting of this  particular amendment. With it I think  he has shown a great deal of legislative  brilliance and some policy ingenuity as  well.’’ Then the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. KOLBE) went on to oppose the  amendment by saying ‘‘But I have to  say  the  net  result  is  quite mischievous.’’ I beg to differ, and I leave it up to my  colleagues and am asking them to support the gentleman  from Michigan’s  (Mr. LEVIN) amendment.  Is  it mischievous to ask the Trade Representative in negotiating for a Free Trade  Area of the Americas with the Central  America Freed Trade Amendment to  protect against piracy of copyright? Is  it mischievous to say that we should  not support a treaty that does not open  markets for United States agricultural  products, high technology, and other  manufactured  exports  that  provide  greater rights? Is it mischievous to tell  him not to support a trade agreement  that provides greater rights for foreign  investors than Americans in the United  States? And is it mischievous to ask  that Trade Representative not to acquire adoption and enforcement of the  basic prohibitions on exploitative child  labor, forced labor, and discrimination  and to guarantee the right to associate  and bargain collectively?  A vote for the Levin amendment is a  vote for America’s workers who see our  manufacturing and technological base  fading away. American workers are the  most productive workers in the world.  Let us  let them compete. The gentleman  from Michigan’s  (Mr. LEVIN)  amendment does just that. I urge my  colleagues to support the Levin amendment.  ",2003
275,,108,0.351,5,2003-07-23,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Just to set the order of how we are  doing this, last night we had the debate  for the most part on the substance of  this, and so at the conclusion of my remarks I will make a point of order that  I reserved last night that this amendment is not in order. b1100  I did say, indeed, Mr. Chairman, that  the gentleman from Michigan was ingenious in the device of this amendment. He was very clever.  It does not mean I think it is right in  policy. Indeed, I think it is very wrong  policy, because what it does is say that  no funds shall be expended by the U.S.  Trade Representative unless the negotiations  do  exactly  the  following  things. In other words, the USTR is in  a straitjacket from the very beginning  of negotiations.  The very essence of a negotiation on  trade agreement is we give something  here, the other side gives something  there. But to demand they have exact  parity from the very beginning absolutely destroys the essence of a negotiation. That is the substance of what  we are talking about here.  It would be very bad policy. It would  essentially mean that we could not  have a Central American Free Trade  Agreement or a Free Trade Agreement  of the Americas. We would essentially  be saying to the Ecuadorans and the  Salvadorans and the Costa Ricans that  we will never allow them to trade with  us, that we do not care that they are in  poverty, we do not want to give them  the  opportunity  to  trade with  the  United States, to have access to our  markets. It would be bad policy. POINTOFORDER  ",2003
276,House,108,0.484,12,2003-07-23,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Speaker, the most troubling part  of this debate for me is that with the  trade agreements that we have signed,  and no one discounts the importance of  trade to this country and to the world  economy, that we continue to see that  Americans subsidize this trade policy  with the loss of their good-wage jobs.  We are told time and again, as we  were just recently this week, in the  Wall Street Journal that those jobs are  not coming back. This is not a question  of losing your job in recession because  of a slow economic time in manufacturing and then you get called back to  your workplace. You are not going to  get called back because your job has  left the country. We said at the beginning of this trade debate some 15 or 20  years ago that the low-paid jobs, the  not-so-good  jobs were the  jobs that  would go overseas and because of increased trade and because of our intellectual capacity and our ingenuity that  Americans would get the good  jobs,  that the hot, heavy, dirty jobs would  go overseas, the low-wage jobs would  go overseas.  But now what we see is that, in fact,  middle-class jobs are leaving America  to go overseas and in many instances  what I am certain people would consider the high-wage jobs, as we were  told again in the Wall Street Journal  this week, are going overseas. $60,000-ayear software-writing  jobs, computer  engineering jobs are being sent overseas where they can be done for $5,000 a  year. It is just an economic swap. You  simply have a job that you have here in  California or Minnesota or Florida and  you decide that this job you are paying  for, as IBM did, you paid $60,000 for this  job, you can have it done in India for  $5,000; and that is simply an economic  equation and it makes a lot of sense. It  is just not very good for middle America.  These trade agreements continue to  be an assault on middle America. What  I do not understand is why we insist  that that be the case. Because I think  it is clear that we can have expanded  trade, we can open up markets, we can  open up markets for American products and services and talent and at the  same time hold onto these jobs. What  we now see is in every industry those  high-wage jobs are being traded in for  low-wage jobs. It is true in steel. It is  true in the automobile industry. You  say, well, that  is old-fashioned  jobs;  that is an old-fashioned industry. No,  what is old-fashioned about those industries is they had middle-class jobs.  You could buy a house, you could buy  a car, you could  send your kid  to  school. That is what was old-fashioned  about them. And even on the cutting  edge of technology, in the steel industry or the automobile industry, they  are being  sent overseas,  even  from  other countries. We are doing it in insurance  and  financial  services  and  computer  engineering  and  softwarewriting.  The point is this, that the first generation of this trade agreement was we  wanted to open up Chinese markets so  we could sell into the Chinese market.  Now what we see is the next generation  of cutting-edge  technology and cutting-edge countries not just from the  United States but from all over the  world that are going to China for the  purposes of exporting. Those are jobs  that are leaving here. Those are middle-class jobs. That is the assault on  middle-class jobs. As long as we do not  rise up and give workers the right to  organize in other countries, then it is a  fiction. It is a fiction that somehow we  are going to protect American jobs. ",2003
277,House,108,-0.115,26,2003-07-23,Mr. MATHESON.," Mr. Chairman, over  the  last few months, I have met with local law enforcement  in Utah and  the message  is  loud  and clear, COPS and Byrne grants are efficient and effective programs. As a result of  these meetings,  I  fought hard  to preserve  some of the most basic and fundamental law  enforcement  funding mechanisms offered by  the federal government.  The number one program that Utah law enforcement officers bring to my attention is the  importance of the Byrne Grant program. This  partnership among  federal, state, and  local  governments creates safer communities by  providing  funds  for  personnel,  equipment,  training, technical assistance, and information  systems  for more widespread apprehension,  prosecution, adjudication, detention, and rehabilitation of offenders who violate such state  and local laws.  Another successful program  is Community  Oriented Policing Services, COPS. Since  its  inception  in 1994,  the COPS program has  been one of the most successful law enforcement grant programs  in American history. A  central goal of the COPS Office is to help law  enforcement agencies implement and enhance  community-based policing, and this program in  particular has been successful in Utah.  While I am pleased to see that the House  Appropriations Committee provided $683 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services, COPS program, it deserves more funding. I am happy that the House Appropriations  Committee funded the Byrne Formula Grants  at $500 million. This grant program is vital to  local law enforcement in Utah. It is my hope  that Congress and the Administration can recognize the value of these programs and that  in the future we can work toward full funding. ",2003

281,House,108,-0.538,40,2003-07-23,Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.," Mr. Chairman, first I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs  and the subcommittee staff for their  hard work. I think they did a reasonable  job, considering the amount of  money they had allocated to them.  Mr.  Chairman,  the President  requested $18.8 billion for the accounts  that make up the foreign operations  bill. Unfortunately, the leadership of  the House only gave the bill $17.1 billion. That is where our problems began.  From the outset, we were forced into a  position of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  The President’s top priorities are to  fund  the Millennium Challenge Account, MCA, and his bilateral HIV/ AIDS initiative. To fully fund the MCA  and  the HIV/AIDS  initiative would  take up almost 25 percent of this bill’s  allocation. Leadership and legislating  require making tough choices, but that  is not the whole story here. We have  the ability and the resources to adequately fund these accounts. We have  chosen not to. Over the last 3 years,  Congress has chosen  to provide  tax  cuts decreasing revenue by $310 billion  for the 2004 fiscal year. We have chosen  to provide $8.9 billion for a ballistic  missile defense system that will not  work. We have chosen to ignore the  type of rampant poverty, illness and  hopelessness  in  sub-Saharan Africa  that create a breeding ground for terrorism.  Africa today, Mr. Chairman, is in a  state of emergency. This bill makes a  valiant attempt but falls short of addressing this emergency in sub-Saharan Africa. The Congress’ approach has  been disjointed. In 1999, this Congress  said  ‘‘trade, not aid’’  in the Africa  Growth  and Opportunity Act,  that  trade was Africa’s future. Today Congress says aid, yes, but aid for AIDS.  Africa deserves more than a hodgepodge, disjointed approach to its development. An emergency exists on the  continent. Africa is the poorest region  of the world, containing a majority of  the world’s poorest countries. Only one  in three people in sub-Saharan Africa  get enough to eat every day, and one  out of two do not have access to clean  drinking water. An emergency.  Only one in three children completes  elementary school. An emergency.  Average life expectancy in Africa is  just 49 years of age and in countries  hardest hit by AIDS, just 30. An emergency.  While poverty has fallen in much of  the rest of the world, 20 African countries are poorer today than they were  20 years ago. An emergency.  Overwhelming debt burdens, falling  international development assistance  levels, the onslaught of AIDS, and a  combination of falling prices for Africa’s exports and unfair international  trade policies are pushing Africa backwards, stealing the gains of a generation of hardworking African people. An  emergency.  Africa is now at the epicenter of the  greatest  catastrophe  in  recorded  human history,  the HIV/AIDS  pandemic. The gentlewoman from Michigan  (Ms. KILPATRICK) will offer an  amendment which I hope all Members  of this Congress will support to fully  fund the President’s AIDS initiative.  Since its first discovery 2 decades ago,  more than 18 million Africans have  died of AIDS out of 25 million AIDS  deaths worldwide.  All day, Mr. Chairman, we are going  to hear Members of the Congress come  to the  floor and say, We are doing  something for AIDS. We are helping  the Africans. We are doing something.  We are showing something for Africa.

282,Senate,108,0.185,47,2003-07-23,Mr. COLEMAN.," Mr. President, as the  majority leader noted, yesterday was a  remarkable day. I had a chance to listen  to Ambassador Bremer. As  a  former mayor, I understand how difficult it is to have cities function— electricity, water,  and  other  challenges, kind of the basics. I marvel at  the challenge that Ambassador Bremer  is facing.  The good news is that we are making  tremendous progress in Iraq. Yesterday  was  a  good  day  because  two  of  Saddam’s diabolical offspring, as the  majority leader said, are dead. It is  kind of strange to say that the death of  any individual is a great thing. But  here we are talking about the most  brutish, thuggish, reprehensible  individuals who  terrorized  those with  whom they came into contact. There  were  celebrations  in  the  streets of  Baghdad yesterday with news of the  death of Saddam’s sons.  So in this time of good news, yet at  the same time that American lives are  being lost, that the path to liberation  of Iraq and ultimately freedom and democracy and greater stability in that  region is a difficult one, I think it is  important to come to the floor of the  Senate to reaffirm the justice and purpose of American and coalition efforts  in Iraq. My only regret is that it is necessary to do so.  We have a great tradition of dissent  in America, and we need people to ask  the tough questions. But just because  we value dissent doesn’t make that dissent right or just. At a time when lives  are being risked and lost, when America and her friends are trying to do  something which is both very difficult  and supremely important, this is a moment where unity should be at a premium.

286,Senate,108,-0.266,89,2003-07-23,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, I engage in a colloquy with the chairman  and ranking member of the Homeland  Security  Appropriations  Subcommittee.  Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senators COCHRAN and BYRD for  their  leadership on  this  legislation.  They have crafted a very good bill,  which will go a long way toward improving  security along our Nation’s  borders.  For many years now, I have been  concerned about the vulnerability of  the U.S.-Mexico border  in my home  state of New Mexico. I think a lot of  people would be surprised to learn that  there are still miles of border  land  where there is nothing separating my  state  from Mexico. To correct  this  problem, I requested and the Appropriations Committee approved $967,000  in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 for the Border Patrol to construct vehicle barriers  along the U.S.-Mexico border in New  Mexico.  The original appropriations are now  nearly exhausted and this important  project will have to come to a halt in  the near future if more funding is not  allocated to this effort. I have been informed by the New Mexico Border Authority that an additional 76 miles of  vehicle barriers need to be constructed  at an estimated cost of approximately  $2.4 million.  I understand that the bill we are now  considering includes $90.3 million for  construction for the Bureau of Customs  and Border Protection. Is it the expectation of the chairman and ranking  member that the funds in this account  could be used for continuing the construction of additional barriers?  ",2003
287,Senate,108,0.509,103,2003-07-23,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President,  Idaho  faces grim news this morning as the  deaths of  two young wildland  firefighters are reported. They were killed  late Tuesday afternoon while fighting  the Cramer fire in the Salmon-Challis  National Forest west of the town of  Salmon near the confluence of the middle fork of the Salmon River and the  main Salmon. These men are heroes of  battle,  just as the men and women  fighting overseas. They fought a faceless, terrifying enemy with bravery,  heroism, and selfless dedication to the  families and communities of central  Idaho. Their sacrifice will be remembered for years to come as their names  are added to the list of those fallen in  service to their country in the capacity  of wildland  firefighters.  I pray that  those who continue to fight fires in  Idaho and across the West this summer  remain out of harm’s way as they perform their valiant and critical work to  preserve homes, property, and life.  The tragedy is that two more people  have died. We hope it is not followed by  more as we enter another fire season.  The truth is that our forests are overgrown, dead and dying, and this kind of  tragedy was  inevitable. Legislation  that I supported in the past would have  made a difference. Had it been enacted  last year or  the year before,  these  senseless deaths could very well have  been avoided. Idaho’s wildfire season is  just getting into its full swing, and we  are asking our wildland firefighters in  Idaho and throughout the rest of the  Nation to do a dangerous job. We in  Congress owe it to them and to the  family members of those who didn’t  make it to provide them with the tools  necessary to get the job done as safely  and quickly as possible. These deaths  are a tragic reminder of the sacrifices  and risks wildland firefighters make to  ensure the safety of our communities.  Congress must  act  to  reduce  this  threat to our communities and improve  the safety of our firefighters. Today,  Senator LINCOLNand I are introducing  bipartisan  legislation to address the  forest health crisis facing our nation.

288,Senate,108,0.289,117,2003-07-23,Mr. DEWINE.," Mr. President, I rise  this evening in support of the passage  of this bill, the pediatric rule. Passage  of this bill will be a very important  step in protecting the health of our  children. This bill will help keep the  pediatric rule in place to help ensure  the drugs we give our children when  they are sick are actually tested for  use by our children. The tragic reality  is there are medicines on the market  today that are being used by and prescribed for our Nation’s children that  are oftentimes not being  tested  for  their use. It has been that way  for  years and years.  For many years, doctors have had to  take a chance when prescribing medicines for our kids. Doctors have literally had to tell parents to cut the pill  in half or in quarters to be given to a  child. The doctors have used the best  information  they  have  to  literally  guess how much medicine to give a  child. That is all they could do with  the medicines; they have had to guess.  Quite frankly, these medicines have  been overprescribed, underprescribed,  or maybe not prescribed at all when  they should have been prescribed. For  example,  recently  the  drug  Paxil,  which is an antidepressant, has been  prescribed without being tested in children at all. Many people have heard of  this drug. Many people have heard of  the beneficial effects for adults with  anxiety and panic disorders. What people did not know, what doctors did not  know, was what we have recently found  out. Recently the British Government  has warned doctors to stop prescribing  this drug for children, warning that the  medicine increased the risk of suicide  or suicidal thinking among children  with depression. This action, in turn,  spurred the FDA to conduct its own investigation into the safety of this drug  for younger patients, resulting  in a  similar warning to physicians here in  the United States: Don’t prescribe this  drug for children.  That is just one example. We have  page after page of examples of drugs  that have been prescribed to children  in the past and once we then tested  them, once the protocols were done,  the testing was done, lo and behold, we  found they were more effective for children than we thought. Sometimes they  were not effective, sometimes the prescriptions, the amount, the dosage that  had been used was too much, sometimes not enough.  The facts are these. As we all know,  children are not just miniature adults.  You can’t just take the weight and just  reduce  the  dosage. Kids  react  differently. That is why it is so important  to have the testing done. Yet when  Senator CHRISDODDand I first started  on this cause, 5 or 6 years ago, 80 percent of the drugs that came on the  market had never been tested for children at all.  It has been over a year now since this  Senate passed and the President signed  into law the Best Pharmaceuticals for  Children Act. The Best Act was a bill  that  followed  the  Better  Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which we  passed a few years before that. That  law, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, was part of the solution, just  part of the solution to address the  problem of getting medicines tested for  use by children.  That law provides, as its predecessor  bill did, a 6-month patent extension to  pharmaceutical companies in exchange  for the testing of medicines in children. That was a voluntary law and it  has worked pretty well. For as long as  the bill has been law—its predecessor  was law—the Food and Drug Administration reported success  in ensuring  that more medicines are tested for use  in children. With this economic incentive by this Best Pharmaceutical and  Better Pharmaceutical bill  in place,  companies  are  seeing  the  value  of  studying their drugs in children and  are applying for the patent extension,  and children are benefiting.  But the Best Pharmaceuticals incentive cannot work alone. It was never  intended to work alone to ensure that  medicines  for  children are properly  tested for their use. In order to ensure  that no medicines needed to treat children, including vaccines or other biologics, would go untested, the FDA, in  1997, proposed what is known as the Pediatric Rule, a companion rule. The Pediatric Rule allowed the FDA to require that drugs deemed important for  children be tested for their safety, for  their effectiveness, and that they be  properly, then, labeled for children.  Unfortunately—and  this  is  what  brings us to the Senate floor tonight to  consider this bill—the Pediatric Rule  came under legal challenge and was, in  fact, overturned  in court  in October  2002, last year, by a district court. That  court ruled that the FDA lacked the  statutory authority to require pediatric studies.  What the court said was it was incumbent upon Congress to fix it. That  is why we are here tonight. This was a  troubling step backward for children’s  health, considering that today 75 percent of the medicines on the market  still, even with the Better Pharmaceutical bill and  the Best Pharmaceutical bill, still 75 percent of the  medicines on the market today are not  tested and labeled for pediatric use.  Without the Pediatric Rule in place,  without the necessary authority provided to the FDA, new medicines and  biologics coming onto the market are  not required to be tested for use in  kids. Since that court decision on October 17, 2002, the FDA has indicated  that over 300 medicines either have applications pending or incomplete studies pending, and that unless the Pediatric Rule stays in place these will all  be lost. Many more, hundreds more will  be lost in the future. Pediatricians will  not know how to prescribe these drugs  in the future or whether to prescribe  them at all.  That is why Senator CLINTON, Senator DODD, and myself introduced the  bill that we hope to pass tonight. It is  a bill that would codify a significant  piece of the Pediatric Rule to assure  that it stays in place and ensures that  children will remain on safe  footing  when it comes to the testing of the  medications that they use.  Furthermore, we need to keep the  Pediatric Rule in place right now because the Pediatric Rule and incentives  work together to ensure that drugs are  tested for use in children.  The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, as I said already, was never  intended to be a substitute for the rule  but, rather, to reinforce and work with  the rule. For example, the Pediatric  Rule may  be  invoked  in  instances  where pediatric information is essential but the patent exclusivity incentive is no longer available.  The Pediatric Rule also applies to  biologics, whereas the Best Pharmaceutical bill does not. A significant  portion of therapeutics used in children,  including many  cancer  treatments or biological products—by that,  of course, we mean products that include a live agent. Because the Best  Pharmaceutical law does not apply to  biologics,  the Pediatric Rule  is  the  only way to ensure proper and effective  pediatric labeling.  Finally, the Best Pharmaceutical Act  is voluntary.

290,,108,-0.205,138,2003-07-23,Mr. CASE.," Mr. Speaker, Filipino veterans  have waited nearly 60 years for Congress to  take  the  first steps  to undo an  injustice  inflicted upon them. I was pleased to see our  Nation  finally begin  to  take  those steps by  passing H.R. 2357.  When  the United States asked  the Philippines to help America fight the long and difficult battles of World War II, nearly 200,000  Filipinos responded. They responded without  hesitation to defend their homeland and to answer  the call  for help.  In  return, President  Roosevelt  promised  that  Filipino  veterans  would become U.S. citizens and thus have the  same benefits given to all other U.S. veterans.  In October 1945 General Omar Bradley, Administrator of the Veterans Administration, reaffirmed that they were to be treated like all  other American veterans and would  receive  full benefits.  Yet, in 1946, the U.S. Congress broke this  promise to the Commonwealth Army and the  recognized guerrilla forces by enacting the Rescission Act (Public Law 79–301). Congress  broke  the same promise made  to  the New  Philippine Scouts when it passed the Second  Rescission Act (Public Law 79 –391). The Rescission Acts stated  that  the World War  II  service of Filipinos would not be  treated as  recognizable military service. These acts took  away their benefits.  I am pleased to add my voice to those in  this Chamber, both  today and  for decades  past, that want us to face up to this injustice.  The  legislation  (H.R. 2357) passed by  the  House on July 21, 2003 authorizes  the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to provide hospital and nursing home care and medical services to certain Filipino World War II veterans  of  the Philippines Commonwealth Army and  former Philippines New Scout veterans who  permanently reside in the United States, in the  same manner as provided  to U.S. veterans.  The bill would provide health care benefits to  approximately 14,000 Commonwealth Army  and New Philippines Scout veterans who are  permanent and legal residents of the United  States.  I support this legislation, but it is time for  this Congress to turn its attention to the approximately 30,000 Commonwealth Army and  New Philippines Scout veterans living in the  Philippines who served alongside American  soldiers, risked their lives during World War II,  yet were denied  the veterans’ benefits  that  were promised to them. The passage of H.R.  2357 does not release the United States from  its moral obligation  to provide Filipino veterans, regardless of where they live, the benefits that were unfairly taken away from them in  1946.  Filipino veterans are now in their 70s and  80s, and we  lose approximately  five Filipino  veterans each day. They are  in desperate  need of health care. It is time for this Congress to do the right thing and provide them  with the benefits they earned during the World  War II campaigns.  I  thank my colleagues  for passing H.R.  2357, and urge them to continue to push toward full equity for Filipino veterans. f  HONORING  JOSEPH F.  ZABALDO,  RECIPIENT OF THE GOLD LIFESAVING MEDAL  HON. EARL BLUMENAUER  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 22, 2003 ",2003
291,,108,0.627,145,2003-07-23,Mr. ROHRABACHER.,"  As all of us know and acknowledge, Mr.  ROHRABACHER ’s amendment seems like a nobrainer and something everyone would support. To suggest  that our Nation’s veterans  who were held prisoner by  the Japanese  in  World War II should be prevented from filing  a lawsuit for compensation seems outside the  realm of what any politician would argue. But  if my colleagues will allow, I am here to do  just that.  While I do acknowledge the difficulty of arguing my position, I believe it ’s a sound position and one any member of this body could  support if only they were made aware of the  history surrounding this matter and the facts  behind our international obligations.  America  is  indeed  indebted  to our  former  POWs—whether they are World War II POWs  or those, including Jessica Lynch, who were  held captive by Saddam Hussein. That debt  our Nation owes these men and women is not  just one of gratitude, but one of compensation  for their time in enemy hands.  This amendment, however,  is neither  the  best nor a wise approach to ensuring we meet  our Nation’s obligations to our former POWs  and I would like to explain why.  If passed by the House of Representatives  and adopted in conference in its current form,  this amendment would almost certainly invite a  veto by the White House. I firmly believe that  the President would be using sound judgment  in vetoing  the amendment because  it would  violate our treaty obligations under the treaty  we signed with  the Japanese at  the end of  World War II.  Some of us in this chamber may take those  treaty obligations lightly or might suggest that  we should ignore commitments made over 50  years ago. I say we must abide by those treaty obligations because that treaty is what set  the foundation for the 50 years of friendship  and  cooperation our Nation has had with  Japan. Great nations do not violate their treaty  obligations nor do they go back on their commitments to their friends. Great nations abide  by  their commitments and stand with  their  friends in easy situations and in difficult situations.  I believe there is another compelling reason  why this amendment should be rejected and  why we should choose another course. The  amendment offered by my  colleague  from  California only addresses  those POWs who  were taken captive during World War II. What  about  the POWs  from  the Korean War,  the  Vietnam War, the Iranian Hostage Crisis, the  Persian Gulf War, or our most recent war with  Iraq? These POWs have suffered extraordinary hardships and, due to the inequity in  this amendment, would be  left without any  long-term compensation for their sacrifices. I think it ’s important to point out that our Nation is currently home to an estimated 42,781  surviving ex-POWS: more  than 39,700  from  World War II, 2,400 from the Korean War, 601  from the Vietnam War, one from Somalia and  three from Kosovo—and these numbers don ’t  include  the POWS  from our actions against  Iraq.  That is why I have offered an alternative— one  that would accomplish everything  this  amendment does not. My  legislation, H.R.  850, would create a new compensation system  for  former POWs delivered  through  the  Department of Veterans Affairs. Under  the  new system, POWs detained 30 to 120 days  would receive $150 per month, those detained  121  to 540 days would  receive $300 per  month, and  those detained  for 540 or more  days would receive $450 per month. Payment  would be made without regard  to any other  compensation under  the  laws of  the United  States. In addition, the bill contains a provision  to provide outpatient dental care for all POWs.  Current law requires a period of internment of  not less than 90 days in order to qualify. Further, I have already agreed to eliminate the 30  day  requirement  to be eligible  for benefits  under the bill to ensure POWs who were held  for a shorter period of  time,  including  those  who have returned from Iraq, would in fact be  eligible for monthly compensation.  Mr. Chairman, my  legislation offers  this  body an alternative to breaking our treaty obligations and failing to meet our commitments  to 50-year-old friends and allies. World War II  ended nearly 60 years ago and throughout the  last  half  of  the  twentieth  century,  Japan  proved  time and again  that  it  is one of our  most trusted allies and a nation upon whom  we could count for lasting friendship. If anything, the last year has shown this Nation the  value of trusted friends and our need for close  allies around the globe.  We have the chance today to do something  noble. We can both be a good friend to Japan  and meet our commitments to the men and  women who have worn our Nation ’s uniform  and been held captive during foreign wars. We  can do this by rejecting the path chosen by  my colleague from California and by, instead,  choosing an approach such as that offered in  H.R. 850. f  A TRIBUTE TO DR. BRIAN BOWKER  HON.

As a Federation of Animal Science Societies  (FASS) Congressional Science Fellow, Dr.  Bowker serves as Legislative Assistant in my  office.  I’ve had  the benefit of Brian ’s expert  advice on agricultural issues. I have seen the  extent of his education but more importantly  the extent of his character. Brian has reached  an educational  level  that  few people obtain,  yet he desires to learn more and to use that  knowledge to benefit others. He understands  the concept, which few of us really embrace,  that  as  Albert  Einstein  said,  ‘Intellectual  growth should commence at birth and cease  only at death.’ ’  The recipient of numerous awards and honors, Brian has received the Featherston Outstanding PhD Award and  the Outstanding  Teaching Assistant Award.  In addition,  the  Animal Science Department of Purdue University named Brian  the outstanding  freshman,  sophomore,  junior, and senior. He has  received the Oakley M. Ray Distinguished Leadership Award, the Millard Plumlee Scholarship,  and the Richard A. Pickett Scholarship, just to  name a few. Also, Brian is a member of the  American Meat Science Association and  the  American Society of Animal Sciences.  Therefore, on behalf of the Congress of the  United States, I commend Dr. Brian Bowker  for receiving his PhD, and thank him for his  service to our Nation. f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. RODNEY P.

294,House,108,-0.283,9,2003-09-03,Mr. MICHAUD.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1572 is a bill to designate the Federal Building in Pensacola, Florida, as the Winston E. Arnow  United States Federal Courthouse.  Judge Arnow was a native son of  Florida. He was  born  in  1911  in  Micanopy,  Florida,  attended  public  schools, and graduated from the University of Florida in 1932. He received  his law degree in 1933. Judge Arnow  was a World War II veteran, serving in  the  infantry  in  the United States  Army.  Although he graduated from college  and law school during the Depression,  Winston Arnow became the  first research clerk at the Supreme Court of  Florida. He then practiced law for 30  years in Gainesville. President Johnson  appointed him to the Federal bench in  1968.  In  1969, he became  the  senior  judge, and served in that capacity until  1981. As senior judge, Judge Arnow continued his work on the bench until his  death in 1994.  Judge Arnow was instrumental in enforcing civil rights law during the critical period from 1969 through 1978. He  based his decisions on the strength of  the Constitution,  and his  decisions  leave a legacy of fairness and integrity.  On the bench he was all business and  showed no favoritism. His social and  economic decisions had a profound effect on the social fabric of Northern  Florida.  In 1972, Judge Arnow’s decisions regarding the Naval Live Oaks Reservations ended a long and controversial  dispute over ownership, when he declared the historic woodland  in the  Gulf to be owned by the citizens of the  United States.  He was a warm and gracious judge,  generous with his  time and advice.  Judge Arnow was a fearless decisionmaker, known for integrity and honesty. This designation is a fitting tribute to his long and distinguished career. I support this legislation and urge  its adoption.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time. ",2003

296,House,108,0.633,9,2003-09-03,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I thank the chairman for yielding me  time.  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed my distinct  privilege to rise today as the House  considers H.R. 1572, a bill to designate  the Historic Federal District Court  Building located at 100 North Palafox  street  in Pensacola, Florida, as the  Winston E. Arnow Federal Building.  Since  the United States District  Court in the Northern District of Florida moved to a new courthouse location in 1999, this building has been undergoing a major renovation and is expected to be ready for occupancy in the  latter part of 2004. Occupying the building will be the Bankruptcy Unit of the  District Court, the United States Probation Offices and a portion of the District Court, eventually including a U.S.  District Judge and staff. The building  will become an  integral part of the  Florida Northern District Court  in  Pensacola.  Mr. Speaker, earlier this year I introduced this measure to provide a fitting  tribute to the service and life of a man  who did so much for northwest Florida.  He is widely acknowledged as the judge  who made the hard decisions that reshaped our local area in the late sixties  and seventies. Judge Arnow’s decisions  have shaped northern Florida’s governments, its schools and its jails. These  courageous decisions, which led to numerous threats on his life, have stood  the test of time.  A man of honesty and rigid judicial  integrity, Judge Arnow believed that a  Judge had to follow the Constitution,  the statutes and appellate precedents.  He did not care whether he liked them  or not. He did this as his duty, and he  did it as he saw it, regardless of who  the litigant or the lawyer was.  He was a friendly, soft-spoken country lawyer. Friends and colleagues regarded Judge Arnow as a southern gentleman in the traditional sense; very  formal in court, yet very warm and  friendly  in  everyday  life. An  avid  sportsman, he was a good shooter and  could frequently be found in his mintcondition green Jeep on his way to a  dove hunt.  Today, the name Judge Winston E.  ‘‘Bo’’ Arnow is an integral part of the  revolutionary period from 1969 to 1978  in northwest Florida when he followed  U.S. Supreme Court mandates to ensure  the  election  of  blacks,  public  school  desegregation,  and  the  new  Escambia County Jail to improve living conditions of the inmates.  He was the first Federal Judge to be  a Pensacola  resident  since  1934. He  served as Chief Judge of the Northern  District  of Florida  stretching  from  Pensacola to Gainesville until 1981. He  was still on the bench into his eighties,  dying at the age of 83 on November 28,  1994.  Judicial associates saw Judge Arnow  as all integrity, ignoring criticism by  doing what he thought was the right  and proper thing to do to protect civil  liberties. In court he was all business.  Once on the bench, he had no friends,  only the fairness of law, and he took  great pride in giving stern direction to  wayward lawyers. His philosophy was,  ‘‘Be on time and be damn ready when  you get there.’’ He was polite and he  was fair, and exercised a no-nonsense  attitude in his jurisprudence.  Judge Arnow went out of his way to  protect the rights of the accused, and  yet was equally stern in sentencing the  guilty. His social and governmental decisions had profound effect; election of  the  first black county commissioner  since Reconstruction; construction of  the Escambia County Jail and renovation of the Santa Rosa County Jail. In  1972, as we have already heard, Judge  Arnow ended the long-simmering dispute over ownership of the Naval Life  Oaks Reservation by declaring the historic woodland in the Gulf Island National Seashore belonged to the people  of the United States.  A political conservative and a strict  constructionist, Judge Arnow believed  firmly in the United States Constitution and  followed  the  statutes and  higher Federal Court decisions to the  letter, even if he may have personally  disagreed.  The  people  of  northwest Florida,  past, present and future, owe a debt of  gratitude to Judge Arnow’s wife, the  former Frances Day Cease, and his  daughter, Ann Arnow Moulton,  for  sharing their husband and father with  northwest Florida for so many years.  I want to thank the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure, the  subcommittee  chairman,  the  gentleman  from Ohio, and his  ranking  member, the gentlewoman  from District of Columbia, for their assistance  in getting this bill to the floor today. I  also want to thank my 24 colleagues  from the Great State of Florida  for  their co-sponsorship.  I urge my colleagues to support this  measure to recognize a legacy of American fairness by a man whose decisions  were in the right spirit of the instrument in which he believed most, the  Constitution of the United States of  America.

298,House,108,-0.342,16,2003-09-03,Mr. BELL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the  Committee on Government Reform, I  am pleased to join with the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. TOMDAVIS) in the  consideration of H.R. 2309 which, as  amended, names a postal  facility  in  Long Beach, California, after  former  Representative Stephen Horn.  H.R. 2309, which was introduced by  the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  MILLENDER-MCDONALD) on June 3, 2003,  enjoys the support and cosponsorship  of the entire California delegation. In  addition, on July 24, 2003, the Committee on Government Reform unanimously passed and ordered the bill reported to the House floor for consideration.  Former Representative Horn, a Republican, represented the 38th Congressional District for 10 years, from 1992  to 2002. As a longtime public servant  and  political  scientist, Mr.  Horn  worked at  the U.S. Commission on  Civil Rights, the Brookings Institute,  and in academia as a dean at American  University here  in Washington, and  later as President of Cal State in Long  Beach, California.  As a member of the Committee on  Government Reform,  Stephen Horn  served  as  chairman  of  the  Subcommittee on Government Efficiency,  Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations. He  is credited  with focusing on the Federal Government’s ability to respond to the Y2K  crisis that we heard so much about a  few short years ago in grading Federal  agencies for computer security.  Mr. Horn retired after serving his  community and the public  for more  than 50 years. Mr. Speaker, I urge swift  adoption of this measure.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2003
299,House,108,-0.386,16,2003-09-03,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  strong support of this important legislation.  in  I  When Chairman Horn retired last year, Congress lost one of the greatest advocates for  meaningful government oversight, indeed one  of  the greatest advocates  for  the American  People who ever walked our hallowed halls.  His work on the Government Reform Committee includes his eight years of service as  the Chair of the Government Efficiency, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee.  I had the pleasure of serving with Chairman  Horn on  this subcommittee since 1993, my  first year  in Congress. As a Congressman,  Steve Horn championed the public’s Right to  Know. As the Chairman, he cosponsored a bill  (H.R. 3802) that expanded the Freedom of Information Act to include electronic information.  He was outspoken against the abuse of secrecy by executive agencies and the willingness of many Congressional Committees  to  ignore their duties and allow such secrecy. He  forces the CIA and the Department of Defense  to release documents so that Congress could  effectively perform oversight. I was particularly  proud to work with him on the Debt Collection  Bill that I sponsored.  Congressman Steve Horn believed in good  government. He understood  that  there  is a  public right to know and as the people’s representatives we must never forget this fundamental right.  To capture some of his good karma, my  staff and I moved into Mr. Horn’s Rayburn office in December!  I miss working with Steve Horn, and I hope  he is enjoying life after Congress. Ms. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ of California. Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2309, the  Stephen Horn Post Office Building Designation  Act.  This bill honors a former distinguished Member of Congress, Steve Horn.  For years, Mr. Horn fought to have the City  of Signal Hill get its own Zip Code. In honor  of his accomplishment it is appropriate that we  designate the Signal Hill Post Office after Mr.  Horn.  This is just one of many examples that illustrate Steve Horn’s commitment and willingness to fight for his constituents.  With the same vigor, it is an honor for me  to be representing some of his constituents.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  bill to honor Steve Horn’s commitment to public service. ",2003
300,House,108,-0.465,16,2003-09-03,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to support H.R. 2309 and the designation of  the United States Postal Service in Signal Hill,  California as the ‘ ‘J. Stephen Horn Post Office  Building.’ I had the distinct pleasure of serving with  Congressman Steve Horn throughout his ten  years in the U.S. House of Representatives.  From my personal experience, I can attest that  Steve is an honest, genuine, and upstanding  man. He stood up for his principles and represented his constituents with decency and  humanity. His background as a university professor was evident in his thoughtful, reasoned  approach  to  issues great and small. From  1997 to 2002, we served together as co-chairs  of  the Congressional Arts Caucus, where  Steve did yeoman’s work  for arts programs  across  the nation. Steve never hesitated  to  reach across partisan, geographic, or other  lines  to build  the alliances  that would allow  him to achieve our mutual goals.  I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution, which salutes our friend and colleague  a man of courage, integrity, and  Steve Horn— dedication. ",2003

His  brother’s clarion call resounded with  the crowd.  I am quoting  from that  same story. Mourners who came from  as far away as Basra and Baghdad beat  themselves with chains in the traditional  ritual  for mourning  religious  martyrs and chanted ‘‘death to America.’’ We have to be listening very, very  carefully. There is a growing anger, not  just in the so-called Suni triangle, not  just  in Tikrit, but all over  Iraq  in  terms of the American presence. That  is why I would suggest it is absolutely  critical that we  internationalize the  presence.  ",2003

303,House,108,-0.508,9,2003-09-16,Ms. SOLIS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 1284, which amends  the San Gabriel  Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992. This bill will increase the  Federal cost share for the San Gabriel Basin  groundwater cleanup project.  During the project’s onset in 1992, the Federal Government was authorized  to pay 2.5  percent of the cost of projects to cleanup local  water supplies. In 1996 the funding level for  the program was capped at $38 million, funding only a portion of  the projects  that had  been designed. As a result of the cap, projects  in the southern portion of the basin were not  funded, including the El Monte Operable Unit  and the South El Monte Operable Unit in my  district. Since the cap was put in place, the  Southern Operable Units have been working  with EPA  to develop groundwater cleanup  plans. Now, we need money  to make  the  cleanup happen.  Cleanup  literally means  the difference between healthy and unhealthy  families. This  area  is  contaminated  with  perchlorate,  trichloroethene and other chlorinated solvents  known as  ‘volatile organic compounds’ ’ or  VOCs. Each of these contaminants can cause  serious health complications. Perchlorate  increases chances of cancer and can  induce  thyroid problems. Trichloroethene has been  shown  to make people more susceptible  to  lung and  liver  tumors. VOCs are harmful  to  the central nervous system, the kidneys and  the liver and can cause a higher risk of cancer, especially leukemia.  The pollution that these communities have  sustained has not only impacted their health  and environment, but also their economy. Unemployment in the area is as high as 10 percent  in some areas. According  to  the U.S.  Census, 26 percent of  the  residents  live  in  poverty.  It has been difficult  to attract businesses and jobs to the area. One of the factors preventing  those businesses and  jobs  from coming to the area is the pollution.  When the cap was put in place, these areas  lost  the chance  to access Federal  funds  to  clean up their environment, protect their health  and help their economy. Now we have the opportunity to make a difference in this region by  helping them accomplish these much-needed  goals. I urge adoption of this legislation and  yield back the balance of my time.

307,House,108,0.343,30,2003-09-16,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support today of H.R.  13, the Museum and Library Services  Act. I would like to thank my distinguished colleague and friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HOEKSTRA)  for  introducing  this  legislation. His  leadership on education issues has been  instrumental, quite  frankly,  in preparing our Nation’s youth for their future and for ensuring a high quality of  life in our communities.  As a cosponsor of H.R. 13, I urge my  colleagues to pass this very important  legislation. The Museum and Library  Services Act does more than simply authorize  funds.  It  improves  the efficiency and delivery of the services that  libraries and museums supply to facilitate  access  to  important  resources  such as reference materials, classical  literature and the Internet also.  In addition, this legislation coordinates services offered by libraries and  museums  so  they  can match  these  goals outlined in No Child Left Behind.  By giving these great institutions the  tools they need to maximize their impact on schools and communities, this  House can confirm its commitment to  ensure that, indeed, no child is left behind.  The effect of libraries and museums  on education cannot be overlooked, but  we must also examine the role these institutions play in improving the quality of life of the communities that they  serve. Libraries and museums are cultural centers and meeting places for  friends and for families. They are foundations of learning and of entertainment. We must support these institutions so that they can continue to support our community.  Mr. Speaker, I found it imperative  that I speak today on H.R. 13. As my  distinguished colleague had mentioned,  as Michigan’s  former  Secretary  of  State, actually part of my responsibilities for 7 years was serving as Official  Historian of the great State of Michigan and the department I oversaw had  jurisdiction, of course, over the Michigan Historical Center. This center is  truly one of the greatest cultural assets in our State, and so I have firsthand knowledge of the great work of  our State’s libraries and of our museums, and with the passage of H.R. 13,  these institutions will be able to continue their great work.  In October of this year, the ClintonMacomb Public Library will be dedicating its new main library back in my  home County of Macomb. This facility  will be the largest library in Macomb  County and actually will be the seventh  largest  library building  in our  great State of Michigan.  The services of this new state-of-theart library, some that they will provide, are simply remarkable. Not only  will it have the newest technology that  is available, but the library will enact  a 24-hour delivery system. This will actually be the first of its kind in the  world.  Additionally,  its  automated  sorting will be only one of 10 in the  United States.

309,House,108,-0.33,58,2003-09-16,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, I am glad  to be here. I just want to relate to my  colleagues a couple of communications  that I was very impressed with that I  got in the last 2 days. The first was  from a letter from a marine who is  from Colfax, Washington, who was very  early in the operation in Iraq, who is  now recovering in Colfax after he was  involved in an incident where a tank  basically slid off a road and came down  and  crushed and killed  the Marine  standing right next to him and totally  crushed  this  Marine’s  leg.  They  thought they were going to have to  take it off. He has kept it, and he is  now trying to get some weight back on  it and he is recovering. It was a remarkable letter I got from him because  he talked with great pride about his  service. He talked about his feeling for  the Iraqi people, and he talked about  the importance of the prayers and condolences he has received from all over  the country. He got letters from all  over  the  country  helping  him  get  through this time of crisis. And it was  really heartening just trying to read  this letter in the midst of what we  have been talking about, about substantial controversy about what happened in Iraq, to read a letter from  somebody who felt so proud of his service and is still in the recovery mode.  Our prayers and thoughts are with him.  And I will not mention his name because he is a humble person, so I will  not mention his name tonight.  The second communication was on  absolutely the opposite end of the spectrum of at least how I viewed the communication, and that was a communication from the Secretary of Defense,  Donald Rumsfeld, who went to Iraq a  few weeks ago and toured Iraq. He was  asked in Iraq, Mr. Secretary, what did  you find about the weapons of mass destruction upon which you based a war,  upon which you  sent  thousands  of  Americans,  hundreds  of whom  are  never going to come home and many,  many are going to come home to a disability they are never going to recover  from. And his answer was stunning to  me. He said, you know what? I was just  too busy. I did not ask about that.  Here is an official of the administration who sent our sons and daughters  to war based on a premise which has  obviously turned out to be false from  the information we have today, who  went to Iraq and who was apparently so  embarrassed about  this  failure,  this  massive  failure of  intelligence  that  this administration was responsible for  on multiple occasions, and he said he  was too busy to ask about our search  for weapons of mass destruction  in  Iraq. In fact, we have 1,500 people at  least who have been scouring Iraq for  months now to try to find evidence of  weapons of mass destruction and have  not turned up a gram of weapons of  mass destruction.  To me, this administration has some  answering to do to the American people, and this body of the U.S. Congress  has an obligation to get to the bottom  of why this false information led us  into a war. That is why I am proud to  say I am one of the Members calling for  a bipartisan, bicameral investigation,  led by a prominent Republican, to find  out why our sons and daughters were  sent into war based on this faulty information. We have an obligation to  get to the bottom of that, not only for  our soldiers and sailors who are at risk,  but for the future of our future security efforts.  When we deal with Iran, when we  face the challenge in Iran, which is a  real nuclear threat, with a real nuclear  program; in North Korea, which is a  real nuclear threat with a real nuclear  program, we cannot go to the international community under this cloud  of suspicion. We must peel it away, we  must get light, we must remove this  wound to our Nation’s credibility, and  we need this commission to get that  done.  Mr. Speaker, I want to tell my colleagues I am just astounded by what I  heard  this weekend  from  the Vice  President, realizing that it is a tough  job that we are  in. But I was  just  shocked and I want to quote what I am  told he said. I did not see the interview, but I am told he said in part, he  said, ‘‘So what we do on the ground in  Iraq, our capabilities here are being  tested in no small measure. But this is  the place where we want to take on the  terrorists,’’ meaning Iraq. ‘‘This is the  place where we want to take on those  elements that have come against the  United States.’’ After we have had 1,500 people scouring  Iraq  for months, and the  intelligence service that reported to us that  the two highest al Qaeda people we had  in captivity told us they did not have  anything to do with Saddam Hussein,  because they did not trust him because  he is a seculist and they are fundamentalist Islamists; the Vice President of  the United States stands for the American people and said we are just going  to go after al Qaeda in Iraq. Where is  the shame? We have to get to the bottom of this.  I want to make one more comment  about what we are in right now. This is  history, but it is something that we  have to peel back to find out what happened, and that is where we go from  here. I think there is some responsibility now. No matter how we got into  this, there is a mess in Iraq. But I want  to point out that the difficulty we face  in mobilizing support for this is in part  because of the administration’s failure  to level with the American people at  the beginning about what this project  was going to cost.  I was just at a charity event and I  ran into a gentleman who works for  the American Society of Civil Engineers. He showed me this report card  that the Society of Civil Engineers just  did about the status of American infrastructure in this country, and they basically gave a grade to all of our infrastructure:  our  bridges,  our  roads;  wastewater had a D, drinking water  had a D, dams a D, solid waste, C plus,  hazardous waste, D plus, energy, D  plus. Basically, America’s  infrastructure, GPA, D plus, with a backlog of investment needs of $1.6 trillion, $1.6 trillion to fix our electrical system and  our  roads and our bridges and our  schools. But this President cannot afford to do it when he wants the taxpayers to shell out $20 billion for the  infrastructure of Iraq, because he will  not give up the tax cuts that have jeopardized our ability to move forward in  this country. I yield to the gentleman.  ",2003

Xema is a native San Diegan, a graduate of  Patrick Henry High School and San Diego  State University, where she earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science. After graduating from college, she went to work for Congressman Jim Bates, where she served as a  Casework Supervisor and Field Representative in his Chula Vista District office.  In 1990, Xema became actively involved in  the Labor Movement when  the San Diego  County  Building  and Construction  Trades  Council hired her as its Director of the Public  Works Task Force.  In  this role, she worked  with  the affiliated building and construction  trade unions monitoring public works projects  in San Diego County for compliance with relevant labor laws. In addition, she was responsible  for  filing complaints  for violations, contracting Awarding Agencies regarding the public contracting process and representing  the  Council on issues involving public works within  the County.  In 1993,  the  International Brotherhood of  Electrical Workers Local 569, Laborers Local  89 and Sheet Metal Workers Local 206 hired  Xema to monitor public works projects on their  behalf.

316,,108,-0.553,43,2003-09-29,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, today Congresswoman NORTON and  I have  introduced  the ‘ ‘Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act.’ ’ A detailed summary of  the  bill’s provisions is attached.  The bill organizes four regional commissions  under a common framework, thereby providing  a more uniform method  for distributing economic development funds throughout the regions most in need of such assistance. It reauthorizes  the Delta Regional Authority and  the Northern Great Plains Regional Authority  and creates  two new regional commissions:  The Southeast Crescent Regional Commission  and the Southwest Border Regional Commission. Both of  these  latter commissions have  been proposed in legislation introduced in this  Congress and are designed to address problems of systemic poverty and chronic underdevelopment in those regions. Every county or  parish that is currently included in a commission through enacted or proposed legislation is  similarly  included  in  that same commission  under this bill. While the bill follows the successful organizational model of  the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), it does  not include the ARC or the Denali Commission  (a wholly intrastate commission) in its framework.  Regional commissions provide vital assistance to the development of the Nation ’s most  chronically poor and distressed regions. They  are  true Federal-State partnerships, bringing  together Federal, State, and  local governments to expand the economic and development opportunities of a chronically distressed  region. These  regions  typically  experience  rates of poverty and unemployment that are  more than 150 percent of the national average. Further, some of  these areas  lack  the  transportation and basic public  infrastructure  necessary  to support business development,  and importantly, create jobs in the region.  The regional commissions are designed to  assist areas in overcoming chronic economic  distress by focusing on the distressed region  as a whole. By recognizing that systemic economic distress follows geographic and natural  resource realities, rather  than arbitrary State  or political subdivision borders,  the commissions are able to concentrate their efforts over  the entire  region—regardless of State  lines.  One way  that  federally designated  regional  commissions work within the region to overcome the effects of chronic underdevelopment  is through investment in infrastructure, including  transportation,  telecommunications  and  other basic public infrastructure. The commissions also assist  the region  in obtaining  job  skills  training, entrepreneurship,  technology,  and business development. Through these efforts, commissions work to improve the economic development of these systemically distressed regions.  Regional commissions also supplement the  state share of other Federal programs to ensure that areas that do not even have the economic means of meeting a required State or  local funding share are not denied the opportunity  to participate  in  these programs. Regional commissions assist  in  local development planning by helping provide local development districts with the resources and expertise necessary to formulate and follow a comprehensive,  strategic  regional  development  plan. Often it is the local development planning that is the key for the successful implementation of economic and infrastructure development programs.  The Regional and Economic  Infrastructure  Development Act is modeled after the statute  authorizing  the ARC. The ARC has demonstrated that regional commissions are successful  in  fighting chronic underdevelopment  and poverty. Since  the ARC’s  creation  in  1965, employment in the 13-State region has  grown by nearly 66 percent. In contrast, in the  decade preceding its creation, employment in  the region had declined by 1.5 percent. Further, the poverty rate of the region has been  cut by more than one half—from 31.1 percent  in 1960 to 13.6 percent in 2000.  As the Nation continues to suffer through a  weakened economy, the need for these commissions becomes even more important. Figures released this August show that the national unemployment rate has increased to 6.1  percent,  the highest  level since July 1994.  Further, since January 2001,  the number of  people unemployed increased from 5.95 million to 8.91 million—an increase of almost 3  million, or 50 percent.  Moreover, workers who have lost their jobs  are having more trouble finding new jobs. The  average  length of unemployment  is now almost 20 weeks,  the  longest  it has been  in  nearly two decades. Within the last 2 years,  the number of workers who have been unemployed for longer than 6 months has increased  by more than 1.3 million to nearly 2 million— an increase of almost 200 percent. One-half of  the unemployed are out of work for more than  9 weeks and more than one in five have been  out of work for more than 6 months. As the economy continues to founder, it is  these historically depressed regions—the regions that have already been struggling—that  suffer a disproportionate share of the burden.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

317,House,108,-0.329,12,2003-10-07,Mr. DOYLE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in  support of H.R. 2655, legislation reauthorizing  the Walsh Visa program. This program provides U.S. work visas to young people from  economically disadvantaged  communities  in  Northern Ireland.  The City of Pittsburgh, which  I have  the  honor of representing, is one of the hub cities  for the Walsh Visa program. Consequently, I  have had the opportunity to see first-hand the  impressive accomplishments of this important  program.  Nearly 250 young men and women, Protestant and Catholic, have participated  in  the  Walsh Visa Program  in Pittsburgh since  the  city was selected as a hub city for this initiative.  This  program  promotes  tolerance  in  Northern  Ireland  by  bringing  unemployed  Protestant and Catholic youth from economically disadvantaged areas to work and live together  in a vibrant multicultural community.  These young people learn first-hand about the  benefits of tolerance and diversity as they develop useful job skills and important work habits.  The Walsh Visa program literally transforms  the  lives of many of  its participants, ending  their dependence on government hand-outs  and  returning  them  to  their communities as  valuable economic assets— as well as advocates of tolerance and peaceful coexistence in  their deeply divided communities. Their new  work skills reinforce their status and influence  in their communities, and that gives their message of  tolerance and peaceful co-existence  added weight.  And  that brings me  to  the bigger picture.  The Walsh Visa programs doesn’t just benefit  a few thousand individuals. It also benefits the  hundreds of thousands of people in their communities in Northern Ireland.  When  these young people go home,  they  take back much-needed  job skills, and  they  serve as important role models for the other  young people in their community— not just in  terms of promoting  religious  tolerance, but  also  in  terms of encouraging participation  in  the workforce  in communities where unemployment has historically been depressingly  high and many young people have developed  an unhealthy dependency on government welfare programs.  After completing  the Walsh Visa Program,  one of the Pittsburgh hub participants stated  that, having lived and worked in America, she  would never consider being without a  job  again back in Belfast.  The Walsh Visa Program is administered in  Pittsburgh by the Ireland Institute, a non-profit  organization which has a mission to promote  mutual understanding between  the Catholic  and Protestant communities  in Northern  Ireland and job creation throughout all of Ireland.  More than 100 local companies have signed  on in support of this program, and thousands  of dollars  in  in-kind contributions have been  received from the community. If, as I believe,  widespread public support indicates the merit  of a government program, then private support  for the Walsh Visa Program in Pittsburgh represents a ringing endorsement of  this  international initiative.  Mr. Speaker,  the Walsh Visa Program  is  helping the people of Northern Ireland move  beyond  the sectarian strife  that has divided  them for far too long. I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting H.R. 2655 and reauthorizing this important program. ",2003

I brought about questions in my  own heart and mind when I did not  hear the President and others who were  in the White House saying listen, independent counsel? That is fine. Because  we want the individual who leaked the  information to be  found, prosecuted,  what have you. Fired  is not good  enough for me personally. I think the  individuals who have leaked this information knowingly and willingly, revenge, political revenge, need to be  punished and prosecuted. And the only  way we are going to get to that, I believe, is through an independent counsel. So I think the gentleman’s letter is  well within order.

324,,108,-0.484,75,2003-10-07,Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise to honor the life and accomplishments of  Mother Teresa of Calcutta who will be beatified by Pope John Paul II in Rome on October  19, 2003.  Born in Albania on August 26, 1910, Mother  Teresa decided to become a Roman Catholic  sister in 1928. She was assigned to a convent  in Calcutta and became a  teacher of geography and history at St. Mary’s School.  In  1948, Mother Teresa founded a religious order  known as Missionaries of Charity to help the  poor, the suffering, and the dying in Calcutta  and around  the world. Today,  there are approximately 5,000 sisters in the order and over  400 missions around the globe.  Later in life, Mother Teresa focused her energies on hospice programs  for  those with  AIDS. She offered unconditional love to everyone, regardless of class or position in life. Because of her actions, she was awarded  the  Nobel Peace Prize  in 1979 and  the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985.  Few people  in  recent history have done  more to help their fellow human beings than  Mother Teresa. It is a privilege to recognize a  person who has brought care and comfort to  millions.  I hope you and my other distinguished colleagues will  join me  in honoring  her  lifetime of service and dedication  to  the  people of the world. f  92ND TAIWAN NATIONAL DAY  HON.

325,,108,0.75,82,2003-10-07,Mr. TANCREDO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to express my sincere congratulations and  best wishes to the people of the Taiwan Republic of China as we celebrate the National  Day of the Republic. For over half a century,  our  two  nations  have  celebrated  a  close  friendship, and common values.  With the election of President Chen a few  years ago, and the first substantial transfer of  power, Taiwan has helped to set an excellent  example  for many nations about  the  importance, and successful exercise, of democracy,  liberty, self-government, and self determination.  Mr. Speaker, as President Chen said in his  address  last year,  ‘Despite  twists and  turns  along the course of democracy, the people of  Taiwan have never lost sight of the need for  change . . . Looking toward a better tomorrow  requires us  to be vigilant  today. The opportunity to create change is often transient, and  every minute wasted increases the cost of reform. We will not back down from our advocacy of reform and we will not stop until we  achieve our aim.’ President Chen’s passion and his commitment to democratic ideals is commendable. I  know I speak for many when I say that I am  proud to count President Chen and the Republic of China among America’s closest allies.  In closing,  let me again express both my  heartiest congratulations as Taiwan celebrates  her birthday, and my deepest hope  for our  continued cooperation, friendship and shared  progress.

327,House,108,-0.342,5,2003-10-16,Mr. SHERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to object. This is a good  bill if it came up at any other time, but  today, it serves a unique purpose, and  that is, to deal with the great debate  that is the big issue that will come up  today as the gentleman from California  (Mr. ROHRABACHER) pointed out. That  issue is whether the $18 billion, not to  rebuild Iraq but to build Iraq as it has  never been built before, whether that  money will go in the form of a loan or  some other collateralized instrument,  perhaps an advance payment on the  purchase of oil, or whether, instead, it  will go as a gift.  What are we told? We are told that  we cannot make it a loan because the  Iraqi balance sheet is already in such  terrible shape. I would first point out  that the American balance sheet is not  in great shape either, and we will be  adding $500 billion to the debt side of  that just this year.  But why is the Iraqi balance sheet in  bad shape? It is in bad shape because  Saddam borrowed $100 billion, and the  people who hold the promissory notes  signed by Saddam want to be paid, and  for reasons I cannot figure out, the administration feels it is a critical national priority  that  those who  lent  money to Saddam get repaid. Promissory notes were signed by Adolf Hitler;  they were not repaid. Promissory notes  were signed by the Imperial Government of Japan; they were not repaid.  Why is it that this administration believes that we cannot burden Iraq with  $18 billion in debt because we must preserve their ability to pay the $100 billion of debt that Saddam Hussein borrowed?  Follow the money. Because in 2008  and 2010 and 2012, Iraq, a country with  the second largest oil reserves in the  world, will be exporting more oil than  it needs, the revenue to finance its ongoing operations. It will be able to pay  debt service. It has collateral. That is  why these folks lent Saddam $100 billion. It will have that money.  Where will that money go? If none of  it comes to us, the first claimant for  $25 billion is Saudi Arabia. The Saudis  are not content with the revenue from  their own oil. They want $25 billion to  be paid by the new Iraq because they  have a loan made to the old Iraq. Who  is second? Kuwait is in for only $17 billion, except they claim that they are  also owed reparations for the invasion.  Okay. That  is  interesting. The new  Iraq should pay for the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam.  So we are told by the Kuwaitis that  not only, not only did we have to spend  our treasure and our blood to liberate  them, not only do they have more oil  than one can imagine per capita, but  that they should have a high claim on  Iraqi oil and that the American taxpayer should be at the back of the line.  I would say that we must do more  today than give $18 billion to Iraq and  then have this resolution saying, oh,  please, pretty please, these other creditors should forgive their debts. First of  all,  the  resolution  identifies as  the  main creditors France and Germany  and Russia when, in fact, the major  creditors of Saddam are Saudi Arabia  and Kuwait.  Second, they do not have to forgive  the loan. What incentive do they have?  It is not like we are saying forgive  your loan and this will happen or we  will make our efforts contingent upon  yours, but rather, today, we are going  to be asked to give $18 billion to Iraq to  eliminate any possibility of adding an  incentive  for others to  forgive their  debt to enshrine the debt signed by  Saddam while denigrating the American taxpayer.  We will be talking about more of this  in the rest of today, but no one should  believe that the passage of H. Res. 198,  a mere plea to the wrong people that  they forgive debt that they have no intention of forgiving so that we can give  away American taxpayer dollars, that  we do not have to give away, this is the  smallest fig leaf for the biggest problem.

328,House,108,0.416,12,2003-10-16,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Ohio  (Ms. PRYCE), a member of the Committee on Rules.  ",2003
329,House,108,0.32,12,2003-10-16,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio.," I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, everyone in this Chamber needs to support this  important  funding package. The President made  it very clear when he articulated his  plan to fight the war on terror. In no  uncertain terms he declared that Iraq  is now the central front in this war.  The job is only half done, though. Terrorists still roam the globe and threats  still exist. If we leave Iraq now, we essentially allow the country to become  a terror magnet, a flypaper that attracts  terrorists  from  all  over  the  world to its vast deserts and its countless caves. Iraq will become their home  base as they wage their war against  freedom, their war against civilization.  Mr. Speaker, to vote against this  funding package and the goals it seeks  to achieve would be to vote in favor of  terror and against America’s homeland  security. It is that critical. This package will provide the funds necessary to  establish a working society in Iraq. A  government that is run by free Iraqis is  a government that provides hope to her  people. A free government responds to  the wishes and desires of those whom it  governs. People who live under a responsive and fair government have no  need for terrorism. They do not experience the desperation and destitution  that so often are the precursors to a  life dedicated to terror.  So, Mr. Speaker, a free Iraq keeps  terror out of that country and, therefore, out of ours. A free Iraq will send  a clear message to people of the Middle  East and around the world that freedom and democracy, not violence and  terrorism, are the best paths for the future. Hope and stability in Iraq translate into security and peace for Americans here at home. We are close. Iraq is  experiencing the first fruits of freedom  and now  they must  be  completely  transitioned into a state of stability.  So  far, the coalition provisional authority has made significant progress  on  infrastructure  improvements and  governmental  restructuring.  All  of  Iraq’s hospitals are now  fully  functional. Schools are opening and running. They are now places for young  minds to receive information, not indoctrination.  Colleagues of ours who have been  there talk of wheat fields and oil fields  and cotton fields. This is progress. It is  a beautiful picture of what comes of  our noble pursuit in the fight for freedom and the war against terror. But  more is needed to secure Iraq to bring  our troops home soon. The funding in  this package will provide  the body  armor that is so essential to protect  them from terrorists. It will provide  extra pay and benefits to the soldiers  who are already sacrificing so much on  our behalf. It will provide our troops  the weapons and systems necessary to  finish the mission we started and get  our troops home to their families. Finally, this package will effectively help  to  revolutionize  Iraq,  turning  this  country  from  a  terrorist  breeding  ground into yet another beacon of democracy  in the Middle East. Terror  will be shunned rather than invited.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote  in  favor of this bill to secure  America by stabilizing Iraq.  ",2003
330,House,108,0.232,26,2003-10-16,Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Chairman, I thank the distinguished  chairman for yielding time to me, and  I rise just to make one point to my colleagues and  friends, and that  is, to  compare what we are being asked to do  today with what we have done since I  have been in this Congress for 17 years.  Mr. Chairman, President Bush, with  the strong support of both parties and  both bodies, agreed to commit us to  end the reign of Saddam Hussein in  Iraq and to aid in removing the Taliban  in Afghanistan, and we committed to  that effort with a great vote in both  bodies. This is much like what happened  during  the  previous  8 years  under President Clinton when he requested us  to deploy our  troops  38  times in 8 years.  I want to call the attention of my  colleagues to the fact that in the previous 40 years, from 1950 to 1990, all the  Presidents  combined  deployed  our  troops 10 times. In the 8 years from 1991  until 1999, 2000, largely under President  Clinton, our troops were deployed 38  times. One of those deployments, actually under President Bush, Senior, in  Desert Storm, was actually reimbursed  $51 billion from our allies. In the other  37 deployments, Mr. Speaker, this Congress, largely controlled by the Republican party, gave President Clinton the  money that he needed for every deployment.  Let us look at some of those deployments. They were  in Somalia, East  Timor, Macedonia, Cambodia, Colombia, Bosnia. In fact, Mr. Speaker, here  is the irony of what we are debating  today. Eleven times we have approved  supplementals in the 1990s for President Clinton, after the fact, to reimburse our military for the costs that  we spent for the deployments that he  got us into, 11 supplementals.  In addition, Mr. Chairman, we cut  our Defense budget so bad that Democrats and Republicans on this floor restored $43 billion over 6 years that had  to be put in because those moneys went  from our military budget to subsidize  the deployments.  What did we deploy in the 1990s? Let  us see, Mr. Chairman. We subsidized  troops  from  other  countries  and  Kosovo and Bosnia and Macedonia. We  paid  for OSCE  inspectors. We built  hundreds of  schools. Mr. Chairman,  during the 1990s, under President Clinton, this Congress built hundreds of  schools. In fact, we did more than build  hundreds of schools. We trained police  forces. We trained and equipped local  police forces. In fact, Mr. Chairman, we  used  taxpayer money  to  send  fire  trucks to Sarajevo. We paid for fire  equipment. We  rebuilt countries.  In  fact, in addition, we started small business loans.  All of these things were done with 11  supplementals for the 37 deployments  that President Clinton got us into, but  Mr. Chairman, there is one difference.  President Clinton never came up to us  in advance and said this is what it is  going to cost. He simply put the troops  in harm’s way. He started the process  of building the schools, training the police departments and doing all  the  other nation-building work, and then  came to us and said to the Congress,  you find the money. So $43 billion of  that money came out of our Defense  budget and we had to replace it.  In addition to that, we spent 10s of  billions  of  dollars  of  supplemental  money through 11 supplemental bills  which were supported with the Republican party in control.  Mr. Chairman, there is an inconsistency here. I did not hear my colleagues  saying back in Bosnia we were told we  would be out in December 1996, that it  should be a loan. We have now spent  $25 billion in Bosnia. We are still there.  Where is the loan request? Where was  the loan request from the Bosnian government? Where was the loan request  from Kosovo? Where was the loan request  from Macedonia,  from  East  Timor, from Colombia?  This Congress supported Democratic  President Bill Clinton, and I think this  Congress has an obligation. I think this  Congress has an obligation to be consistent. We as Republicans supported  the funding through 11 supplementals  to pay for those same items that President Bush has asked for here, and if we  total up the amount of money of these  37 supplementals, it is far in excess of  what we are talking about with this  bill. The difference  is we have been  asked  to approve  it  in advance.  In  every other case, in the 1990s, it was  done after the fact. ",2003
331,House,108,-0.324,33,2003-10-16,Mr. DEUTSCH.," Mr. Chairman, one of  the things that all of us know is one  and one equals two, and I think a very  good question for all of us to ask is  why are the two parts of this supplemental one part? Why are the military  and the reconstruction parts of this  bill together?  Let me give the Members the answer,  which is not very complicated: one and  one plus two, is that if they were separate,  the  supplemental part dealing  with reconstruction would fail. Every  Member knows that. Why would it fail?  Because my  Republican  colleagues  would vote against it and it would fail.  So they have leveraged to put the two  things together and said  if we vote  against the bill, we are against the  troops. That is not why this bill is in  one bill. The reason it is in one bill is  because if the two things were separate, the reconstruction effort would  fail.  Let me  tell  the Members why  it  would fail. Because it is crazy. Because  it is crazy. Because it is indefensible  from policy grounds to have American  taxpayers,  literally  American  taxpayers, pay for the reconstruction of a  country, 27 million people, that has  trillions, trillions of dollars in oil reserves, the second largest oil reserves  in the world. At the same time, this  country, Iraq, is part of OPEC today,  will be part of OPEC when the middle  class,  lower class people  in America  take their hard-earned tax dollars and  their hard-earned wages taxed by the  monopoly power of OPEC, which is exactly what Iraq is going to do, some of  that monopoly tax, hundreds of billions  of dollars of taxes that we are paying  as Americans, see some of that money  going  to  terrorists.  Some  of  that  money is going to terrorists; and the  terrorists, in fact, are trying to kill us.  Vote down the whole amendment, and  let us send it back as separate bills.  ",2003

But as  soon as we did so, the Bush administration pulled the rug out from under the  U.N. inspectors and decided it would  use  the authority Congress granted  them to fight a unilateral war.  Now we are learning that there were  no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  Congress and the American people were  deceived, misled, and manipulated with  false and misleading intelligence and  political  spin  from  the Bush White  House.  Now the Bush administration cannot  find any weapons of mass destruction.  It cannot find Saddam Hussein. It cannot find Osama bin Laden. It cannot  find Taliban leader Mullah Omar, and  it cannot even find out who within the  White House staff leaked the name of  that covert CIA operative.  What does the Bush administration  now ask the Congress for? They ask us  to trust them and to grant their request for another $87 billion going into  Iraq, a blank check with no clear vision of how we are going to extricate  ourselves from this morass.  Now, I hear a lot of talk from the administration and its supporters about  how we are crafting with this legislation a new Marshall Plan  for  Iraq.  Well,  let me tell you, when George  Marshall was crafting a plan for Harry  Truman to reconstruct Europe after  the devastation of World War II, he was  not setting up a sweetheart, no-bid  contract system for companies associated with the old Pendergast Machine  in Kansas City.  That  is what we are seeing today  with the contracts being given to Halliburton and other favored companies.  We are providing broad transfer and reallocation authority to the executive  branch that gives the Bush administration virtually unfettered discretion to  spend the monies we appropriate in any  way they wish. At the same time the  President asks us to spend $87 billion  in Iraq, he is also going around the  country giving speeches calling for additional tax cuts for the top 1 percent  wealthiest people in the United States  of America.  So if you are wealthy in this country,  you get tax cuts and fat government  contracts. But if you are an ordinary  working American, you get Social Security and Medicare trust funds raided,  the  50 percent who are  in nursing  homes,  the  elderly  dependent upon  Medicaid, payments for their nursing  home care, they are cut; and meanwhile it is all raided for the reconstruction of Iraq, while at the same time tax  cuts of the same amounts are being  given to the wealthiest 1 percent in our  country.  So the Republicans are busy at work  coming up with new schemes to  increase your Medicare co-pays, means  test your benefits, increase payments  for seniors with home health care visits. All of it is wrong, just plain wrong.  It is a blank check. It gives the President and Secretary Rumsfeld too much  authority. And it fails to do what is  needed to build international support  for peacekeeping and reconstruction in  Iraq or craft an appropriate exit strategy to get our troops back home. And  that can only happen if we have multilateral support for this effort, if we  have a real vision for what is going on.  As long as this administration believes that it is going to bring Jeffersonian democracy at the point of a gun  to an occupied country, then we are operating with one of the most naive political schemes ever put together in the  history of this world. And it is time for  us to be ensuring that the Congress  makes  this  administration  accountable, rather than handing over a blank  check with no accountability with at  least 60 to 70 percent of this money capable of being reprogrammed by the  administration at its own whim without Congress voting upon it again, all  of it a mistake of historic proportions.  This is where Congress must check  in. It did so after World War II. Today  it is just providing a blank check.  ",2003
334,House,108,0.739,40,2003-10-16,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  today in strong support of H.R. 3289,  which  provides  supplemental  appropriations to our national defense and  the reconstruction efforts in Iraq and  Afghanistan.  I would like to commend President  Bush for his strong leadership during  the war on terrorism. Under his leadership, our homeland has been free from  terrorist acts since the attacks of September 11, 2001.  For the past 2 years we, as Americans, have come together in an effort  to protect ourselves from all aspects of  terrorism  in both the United States  and abroad. Patriotism has soared as  Americans have supported the war on  terrorism and our troops who are fighting it.  During these difficult times, we have  managed  to  liberate  millions  of  Afghanis and Iraqis while  improving  their way of life and allowing them to  experience the benefit of democratic  rule. We must not stop at this critical  juncture. b1430  We must push forward in our efforts  in these countries and pass this necessary funding measure.  The $87 billion Supplemental Appropriations Act for 2004 provides the essential funding which is the step toward expanding democracy abroad and  is an investment in America’s safety.  The $19.8 billion provided  for reconstruction in both Iraq and Afghanistan  will be used to rehabilitate critical infrastructure so their citizens will have  safe drinking water,  roads, bridges,  adequate  sanitation,  electricity  in  their homes and an increase in public  safety overall. The $64.7 billion provided for our national defense will give  our troops the necessary equipment to  continue the war on terrorism and protect our shores from anyone who seeks  to do us harm.  This debate should focus on providing  the necessary resources to complete  this phase of the war on terrorism and  providing adequate tools for our troops  to complete their mission. Now, more  than ever, we need to rally behind our  troops, and providing adequate tools  VerDate jul 14 2003  03:16 Oct 17, 2003 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K16OC7.078 H16PT1 ",2003
335,House,108,-0.519,61,2003-10-16,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Chairman, I stand today to  state my continued opposition to the funding  of our invasion and occupation of Iraq.  Some of my colleagues have mourned the  apparent death of U.S. domestic policy. They  have detailed what this $87 billion could provide in this country. If we pass this bill, every  person in this country will lose services in education,  healthcare,  housing,  veterans  programs, homeland security and social security.  This is a fact.  Other colleagues have come to this floor to  question our entry into the war, our standing  in the world community, our ability to govern  an occupied nation and our exit strategy. The  Administration has never revealed plans which  indicate when we will have done enough,  committed  enough  resources,  or  restored  enough of the infrastructure to leave Iraq. It is  strange that a country like America, born out  of a desire to shake off British colonialism may  now be engaging in a new era of imperialism.  I align myself with those who have expressed  doubts about the short-term consequence and  the long-term wisdom of such a policy.  And while  I share  those concerns,  I am  most concerned about  the  lack of accountability  throughout  this  Iraqi adventure. We  have already passed a $79 billion spending  bill for the current conflict in Iraq. However, no  one here knows how that money was spent.  We do not have any accounting of the no-bid  contracts, but we do know that the majority of  our soldiers are wearing Vietnam era flak jackets. And while we talk about building an Iraqi  democracy, we refuse to allow the Iraqis the  ability to directly participate in the rebuilding of  their own nation. We do know that the money is not getting  to the soldiers and it is not getting to the people of Iraq. So we are obligated as good stewards of the hard-earned dollars of the American people  to ask where  is  the money?  Where has it gone and where will it go? No  one from this Administration has bothered to  answer and if they cannot answer this basic  question of accountability,  this body— which  controls  the purse  strings— must  keep  the  purse closed. Under the Constitution we have  a duty  to be  responsible  for governmental  spending. Because  this Administration has  spent the budgetary surplus left by the Clinton  Administration by providing $387 billion in tax  cuts which primarily benefitted the wealthy, it  is clear that the cost of this war can only be  paid  by  borrowing money. My  children’s  grandchildren will end up bearing the cost of  this war. It would be irresponsible to saddle  them with a $166 billion burden.  I will not support this resolution. I cannot uphold my constitutional duties as a Member of  this House while signing over a blank check to  this Administration. It is wrong and your vote  should reflect it. Vote no on this supplemental. ",2003
336,House,108,0.56,82,2003-10-16,Mrs. MYRICK.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding me  time, and I thank the chairman  for  bringing this bill forward in good form.  I supported going into Iraq. In fact, I  served  on  the President’s working  group for Iraq, and I think it was the  right thing to do. I believe it was still  the right thing to do, and I support our  troops, the men and women in uniform  over there giving their all for us. There  is no question about that. I want them  to see that they have all the resources  that they need at this difficult time in  their lives to protect themselves and to  protect us. And we need to remember,  we are over there fighting so we do not  have to be fighting here on our own  shores.  But I come  from a district where  there has been a great deal of hardship  lately, a lot of job loss, and my people,  frankly, do not understand why this  cannot be a loan instead of a grant. A  lot of them say to me that this just  does not make any sense. Iraq has all  that oil. I think it has the second largest oil reserves in the world. They are  going to be running a surplus in their  oil reserves very soon, I think by the  end of next year. So if they would pay  for part of their reconstruction, they  buy into the process, and literally they  have a commitment there to help with  their own freedom.  I work for the people of the Ninth  District of North Carolina, and they  feel very strongly about that, and I feel  very strongly that I would like to see  this be a loan as well. That is why I  support the Pence amendment. I would  like to have a vote on this amendment,  so we could express our opinions and  the thoughts of our people at home. I  do support the underlying bill.  The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman  from Arizona claim the time in opposition to the amendment?  ",2003
337,House,108,0.426,89,2003-10-16,Mr. TERRY.," Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  PENCE) bringing this to the floor. All of  us here support our troops. To not ultimately vote for these dollars is, first of  all, I think a slap in the face to all of  the families who have lost a loved one  in this battle for independence for Iraq,  and  it would do a disservice to our  HASTINGS principles of freedom for this country.  And certainly for the $70 billion for our  troops, all of us, I would think, stand  united in support.  But there is one fundamental question here as we strive to make Iraq an  independent and strong country and we  help them out. Why not make that $16  billion a  loan to that country  like  many other countries in the past have  loaned?  I would also suggest, I would like to  add  something  to  the  gentleman’s  amendment and say, well, maybe more  of this should be made a grant, based  on  the condition  that France, Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia,  those  countries that will stand first in line  for repayment, that when they forgive  their loans to Iraq, then this loan can  be forgiven. That is what I think this is  about.  Americans do not want to stand behind in line from an oil rich country  while  they pay off other  countries  while we hold the bag.  ",2003
338,House,108,0.363,89,2003-10-16,Mr. HULSHOF.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the gentleman’s amendment. Mr. Chairman, it has often been said that  freedom is never free. Deposing the tyrannical  regime of Saddam Hussein has indeed proved  costly to America in terms of both lives and  treasure. While we have joined with the Iraqi  people to win their freedom, much remains to  be done in order to secure that freedom for  generations to come.  This debate is of similar gravity as that of  last October, when this Congress authorized  the use of force to enforce all relevant U.N.  resolutions on Iraq. Today, we debate not the  future war, but the future peace of a region.  After much  deliberation,  I  find  that  the  amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana achieves the best balance between our  obligations in Iraq as well as the obligation of  the Iraqi people to play a prominent role in securing their own future. The parallel system of  grants and loans would first build the foundations for a democratically elected government  in Iraq. This new government would then find  a willing partner in the United States to help  finance needed  investments  in  infrastructure  and security. Democracy  is not a spectator  sport, and the Iraqi people must take the leading role to secure the peace for the long-term.  While I am well aware that this amendment  might be ruled out of order on parliamentary  grounds, it represents the best policy for our  nation and for the Iraqi people. That said, failure in Iraq is simply not an option. It is with  serious  reservations  that  I will support  this  supplemental without  the  inclusion  of  the  Pence amendment. As such, I urge the Administration to re-examine loans as a means  of financing the reconstruction of Iraq. ",2003
339,House,108,0.705,89,2003-10-16,Mr. HOSTETTLER.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman from Indiana, my  colleague, for yielding me the time.  Mr. Chairman, in short, we are talking a lot today about values, a very  ambiguous time, from time to time,  but in fact, Mr. Chairman, with the  blood, sweat and tears of our men and  women in uniform, they have bought  the freedom of the Iraqi people.  If the Iraqi people do not learn that  one invaluable lesson of our American  values, then we can throw hundreds of  billions of dollars  into  the  restructuring of their country. That is why I  think the Pence amendment is a very  logical, reasonable, rational approach  to the funding of the reconstruction of  that country.  ",2003
340,House,108,-0.37,96,2003-10-16,Mr. WU.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  strong  support  of  the Lantos-Obey  amendment and in opposition to the  underlying bill.  When my mother brought me across  the vastness of the Pacific Ocean to  America, she did so with the hope that  I would become a good citizen, a good  American citizen. I doubt that she ever  dreamed that I would become a U.S.  Congressman as well. Whether as citizen or as Congressman, however, we  learn certain fundamental values from  parents,  from teachers and mentors.  Some of the most crucial of those values are responsibility, accountability  and having a plan for the future.  By all three of these standards, the  administration’s request for $87 billion  for Iraq fails, and I must reluctantly  vote  against  it. Responsibility,  accountability and a plan for the future.  Responsibility: A year ago I stood in  this well and expressed my grave concern that we were embarking upon an  unnecessary war, and, by so doing, that  we were going to lower the barriers to  future wars.  We were told that Iraq was an imminent threat to our national security.  Well, here we are enmeshed in a quagmire in Iraq, and we have lowered the  international threshold  for war with  this new doctrine of preemption, or  first strike. The administration architects for these policies must be held responsible. We need responsibility.  Accountability: We have been asked  for over $400 billion in regular appropriations and in supplemental appropriations. We have spent a lot of money  on defense and on Iraq. However, we  find that our troops are going without  the best bulletproof vests. We find that  troops are traveling in Humvees with  soft canvas backs rather than armored  vehicles, because their armored vehicles do not have tracks to take them  around. b1945 Where is the accountability? Where  has the money gone? Where is the accountability for our troops? Where is  the accountability to their spouses, to  their parents, and to their children?  And where is the accountability to my  fellow Oregonians who have been told  that there is not enough money to keep  their schools open or to pay for their  unemployment?  We need accountability. We need a  plan  for  the  future. Approving  this  funding without a plan for the future is  nothing  less  than writing  a  blank  check. We need a plan for proceeding  on two fronts. At the one end on the  international front, we need to bring  the international community into Iraq  to share the burden, both in terms of  blood and treasure; and at the other  end, at the local end, we need as rapidly as possible to restore self-government to the Iraqi people. The administration resists both of these efforts.  There is no cogent plan. Mr. Chairman, we have no responsibility, no accountability, and no plan, because this  administration is not listening to either Congress or the American people.  Congress has very few tools to influence foreign policy; and today, we only  have the power of the purse to make  this administration open its ears and  listen  to  this Congress and  to  the  American people. If we fail to use our  VerDate jul 14 2003  06:12 Oct 17, 2003 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00096 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K16OC7.185 H16PT1 ",2003
341,Senate,108,0.364,103,2003-10-16,Mr. TALENT.," Mr. President, it was  not really my intention to come down  on this particular debate and speak. I  would like to give a broader statement  on  the war  at  some  point. But  I  thought I would come for a few minutes today because I have been watching from time to time our friends on  the Democratic side, particularly the  Presidential candidates who seem to be  vying with each other to show their  base, to show the left how much they  are against the war. They are trying to  appeal to the left, which is certainly  understandable given  that  they are  running in a primary.  That has distressed me because  I  think the growing opposition to the  war on the left is a tremendous historical mistake. People in that movement  will view it that way 20 or 30 years  from now. I say with all good faith to  my friends in that movement that this  is not the 1960s. Iraq is not Vietnam.  Saddam Hussein is not Ho Chi Minh.  The terrorists are not some kind of  utopian movement that wants to create a workers paradise around  the  world. The terrorists stand for everything that this country hates, and in  particular, everything the left in this  country has always stood against. They  are bloodthirsty cutthroats. They don’t  believe  in diversity. They are racial  and religious bigots. They are sexists.  They hate the  idea of  international  law. They have no respect for international norms. We should all be opposing them.  This is a war in which we should all  be involved. We should all get in the  same boat and row. I know it is hard to  support a war which is led by a President you do not support. I was in that  situation when we were  involved  in  Bosnia. We are still there. It is hard to  support a war led by a President whose  very election you question. I understand what it is like to lose a contested  election and, in fact, to lose one, the  outcome of which is disputed. I was in  that situation when I ran for Governor  in 2000.  I believe very strongly that this is an  American war. This action in Iraq is  part of it. There is a tremendous strategic aspect of this war. We can and  will win it, if we pull together, if we  get in the same boat and row. There is  no reason we should not. I urge both  parties and all different parts of the  philosophical spectrum to do that.  I want to take a few minutes to talk  about this package, and in particular  the need for reconstruction. There are  three reasons this is very important,  why it is in America’s interest to spend  this money and reconstruct Iraq.  First, we have to get the lights on  there so that we can do the job we have  set out to do. It is very difficult to  hunt people down, hunt the terrorists  down, if you can’t turn on the lights.  We need this infrastructure in order to  do our job. Second, we have to create a  basic infrastructure in Iraq so that the  country can have the stability that  will allow us to leave honorably. None  of us want to be there. But we have engaged in this war for our interests, and  it is now our responsibility to make  sure the country is stable enough so  there is not chaos when we leave. To do  that, they have to have an electricity  grid, among other things.  The third point was made powerfully  by Prime Minister Blair in the House  Chamber. Part of what we have to do in  this war is not just defeat the terrorists but vindicate our values against  which they stand. It is not enough just  to curse the darkness. We have to light  a candle.  One of  the  terrorists’ goals  is  to  spread  their  philosophy  and  their  ideals  all  throughout  the  Islamic  world, from Morocco to Indonesia. We  need to show that the ideals of our democracy—dignity, freedom, the rights  of the individual—are not just for us;  they are for everybody. They don’t just  work for us; they will work for everybody. That is why the creation of a stable, benign Iraqi democracy is so crucial an aspect of this war. It would be  an enormous strategic victory for us if  we  could  create  such a democracy  there. I believe we can. I believe we  are. We can and will win, if we don’t  quit.  I don’t believe the people are going to  quit. I don’t believe this Congress is  going  to quit. This money we are  spending today is in our interest to  spend. That bears on the loan versus  grant problem. Certainly I hope we get  this money back. I would love to get  this money back. We all should do  what we can to enhance the Treasury  and FSC and the American taxpayer.  But if it is in our interest to do it, we  should do it the same way we do everything else that is in our interest—we  just spend the money. If it is not in our  interest, we should not loan it to them  either. I don’t want to loan money to a  country just to help them. I am representing Missouri  and  the United  States of America. We spend money.  We loan money to advance America’s  interests. If it is in our interest, and we  believe that, we ought to be willing to  give it to them in the form of a grant,  especially since everybody knows, if we  give this money in a loan, eventually  we will forgive it. We will not get the  money back anyway. We are going to  urge everybody around the world to  forgive it.  This is in America’s interest. We can  light a candle. We can defeat these terrorists. We can win this war. We ought  to do it. I hope we will all pull together  in the debate on this bill and get it  done.  I yield back the remainder of my  time.

343,,108,-0.447,138,2003-10-16,Mrs. NAPOLITANO.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  tremendous pride  that  I rise  today  to honor  one of my constituents from Santa Fe Springs,  California, Laura Berg, who has recently been  named to the U.S. Olympic Women’s Softball  Team. Laura has been a member of this team  in the 1996 and 2000 Olympic games, winning  gold medals both  times. She  is one of  four  two-time Olympic champions on  the current  team which will compete in the 2004 Olympic  games in Athens, Greece. Berg started as a  centerfielder  in all 10 games  in  the 2000  Olympics and will play outfield for the team in  2004.  Berg has been a part of the USA Softball  national system since 1994 when she was  member of the USA Team that captured gold  at the ISF Women’s World Championship in  St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada. In addition  to her Olympic glory, Laura has won numerous accolades for her softball skills at the high  school, college, national and international levels,  including  two gold medals at  the Pan  American Games and three World Championship gold medals. A graduate of Santa Fe  High School and Fresno State University, she  is of  three players at Fresno State  to ever  boast 300 or more career hits and post a 160game defensive errorless streak. She also  spent 4 years as an assistant coach for the  Fresno State Bulldogs team.  Laura firmly believes in setting challenging  goals for herself and working hard to achieve  them, whether she  is practicing softball and  studying  in school. Her commitment  to her  sport, positive attitude, and strong work ethic  have  led  to her extraordinary success and  make  her  a  role model  for  other  young  women.  Laura began playing softball as a child, tagging along to a program in which her parents  had enrolled her twin sister, Randi. She continues to be inspired by the challenges of the  game and has become a veteran leader for  her teammates.  Laura is married to Rob Peterson, the Assistant Athletic Director at  the University of  South Dakota. The  two met when Peterson  was Director of Facilities at Fresno State.  For  the next 11 months, Laura and her  teammates will be working hard in preparation  of defending their Olympic title. I ask all of my  colleagues to join me in congratulating Laura  and the other outstanding women who make  up the team and in wishing them great success. f  RECOGNIZING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ST. HELENA HOSPITAL IN ST. HELENA, CA  HON. MIKE THOMPSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 16, 2003 ",2003
344,,108,-0.395,138,2003-10-16,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to recognize the St. Helena Hospital of Napa County as it celebrates its 125th  Anniversary.  On June 1, 1878, the Rural Health Retreat  opened its doors to the public. 125 years later,  the Rural Health Retreat has a new name and  a new  look but  its commitment  to quality  healthcare remains the same. Today, the St.  Helena Hospital is the world’s oldest continuously operating Seventh-day Adventist hospital.  The hospital has grown substantially over  the years, both in its ability to heal and in its  physical space. What began as a small twostory building has matured into a state-of-theart  facility, which  includes a 24-hour emergency room, a heliport, and top-of-the-line surgical suites.  Mr. Speaker, among other services, the St.  Helena Hospital offers a wide range of facilities to assist our community members in overcoming  their  illnesses  including addictions.  Specifically, the hospital has a mental health  unit, an alcohol and chemical recovery program and it houses wellness programs such  as the Nicotine Addiction Program.  In 1974, a team of surgeons performed the  first open-heart surgery in the North Bay, paving the way for St. Helena Hospital to become  a leader in cardiac care. Today, history continues to be written and St. Helena Hospital  has been named among the Top 100 Cardiovascular Hospitals in the country.  Mr. Speaker, during its 125 years of existence,  the St. Helena Hospital has been a  medical sanctuary  for  thousands of people  from both in and out of our community. The  hospital has a wonderful tradition of providing  for  the sick. Regardless of who you are or  where you are from, you will receive the best  medical assistance possible at the St. Helena  Hospital.  Mr. Speaker,  for maintaining such a high  standard of excellence and  for healing our  community for over 125 years, it is appropriate  that we honor the St. Helena Hospital as they  recognize their 125th anniversary.

345,,108,0.47,145,2003-10-16,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize an important business in my district  celebrating it’s 50th anniversary. In 1953, Bert  Gross, James Lowry and Daniel Brimm joined  together  to start Chemtronics,  Inc., a  local  small-business specializing in technology that  could remove metal in a very rapid and controlled manner. Chem-tronics, Inc. was incorporated in October 1953, with company offices  and chemical etching facilities set up in rented  World War  II surplus barracks on Gillespie  Field in El Cajon, California.  Early sales efforts were focused on aircraft  frames and skins but they soon realized that  the chemical milling process could be applied  advantageously to jet engine components as  well. With this new opportunity, the company  embarked on a campaign to earn a contract  with General Electric Co., working on  their  TF– 39 jet engine. From the middle 1960’s into  the  early  1970’s, Chem-tronics  Inc.,  built  around nine hundred of these parts.  By  the early 70’s,  tools and  trained personnel were developed for repairing and accurately reforming titanium fan blades for jet engines utilizing a process patented by the company. This activity has expanded in scope and  size over the years and is now a major element of the business with its own specialized  management and marketing staff, known as  Aviation Repair, also located in El Cajon, California.  Chem-tronics, Inc., while still small, was becoming recognized as a high quality productproducing, vertically integrated, one-stop-shop  facility. By 1975, Chem-tronics had products  on space launch systems, most of the larger  commercial airframes, and several of General  Electric Co. and Pratt & Whitney Co.’s larger  commercial jet engines.  During  this same period of  time, Daniel  Brimm, who had bought out his earlier partners, developed a unique  integral stiffening  feature with chemical milling that he patented  called Unistructure. This was a critical turning  point  in  the success of Chem-tronics,  Inc.  Since 1976, Unistructure stiffened light-weight  products have been designed and built for virtually every new By-pass Outer Duct for every  military jet engine built in the USA. Driven by  a company commitment to provide each customer with  a  one-stop-shop, Chem-tronics  began  to  supply  complete product design  services  in 1978, which  included computer  aided design and computer, aided manufacturing.  The trend of expanding Chem-tronics’ technology has continued over the years with increasing  levels of production,  factory  floor  space, manpower and  facilities. Major customers include General Electric Co., Pratt and  Whitney Aircraft, Rolls-Royce-Allison, Allied  Signal, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman  and Boeing. Through these customers, Chemtronics’ products have become an  important  part of military and commercial aircraft, such  as  the B– 1B and B2 Bombers, Joint Strike  Fighter, F22 Raptor, as well as  the space  shuttle and various space launch systems.  The current president, James Legler, joined  the company in 1978. Through his leadership,  Chem-tronics, Inc. has continued to grow as  an aerospace  industry  leader  in  technology,  quality products, and commitment to customer  satisfaction. My  fellow  colleagues, Chemtronics,  Inc.  represents  the  small-business  spirit  that made America great. Join me  in  congratulating this company for their success  in creating jobs, providing critical services and  products to our country’s national security, and  making the San Diego community proud for 50  years. f  SYRIA ACCOUNTABILITY AND LEBANESE SOVEREIGNTY RESTORATION ACT OF 2003 SPEECHOF  HON. BETTY McCOLLUM  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 15, 2003 ",2003
346,,108,-0.419,145,2003-10-16,Ms. MCCOLLUM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in cautious support of the Syria Accountability  and Lebanese Sovereignty Act (H.R. 1828).  It  is entirely appropriate  that we send a  strong message to the Syrian government that  they have not done enough to weaken terrorist  activities  in  their country. Syria’s continued  support of international terrorist organizations  like Hizballah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas is unacceptable. The United States has given Syria  ample opportunity  to  remove  these  terrorist  threats, and we cannot stand idly by while terrorist operations continue.  In addition, the United States must clearly  state  that  the Syrian occupation of Lebanon  will not be tolerated. The people of Lebanon  deserve to be ruled by the Lebanese, and not  an occupying Syrian  force with  ties  to  terrorism. Syrian troops in Lebanon represent a  destabilizing force that threatens the peace of  Israel and the entire Middle East region.  The Syria Accountability Act must be used  as a political lever intended to send an unmistakable message  to Syrian President Assad  that his government’s support for terrorist organizations and occupation of Lebanon cannot  be allowed.  It must not, however, be  interpreted as a catalyst for military action in Syria.  Inflaming the dialogue about Syria’s reported  connections with al-Qaeda or  Iraq will only  lead to rash decisions unreflective of the best  interests of the United States and our allies in  the global war on terrorism.  We must  remain committed engaging  the  Syrian government  in diplomatic exchange.  Only by talking can we expect to improve our  bilateral relations with Syria and bring about a  peaceful resolution to this challenging issue. f  ON THE INTRODUCTION OF DAIRY  FORWARD CONTRACTING LEGISLATION  HON. CALVIN M. DOOLEY  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 16, 2003 ",2003
347,,108,-0.19,145,2003-10-16,Mr. DOOLEY of California.," Mr. Speaker,  today I introduced legislation to make permanent  the authority  for dairy producers and  processors to have an important risk management tool known as forward pricing contracts.  As the ranking minority member of the Agriculture Committee’s subcommittee that has jurisdiction over dairy policy, I hope to move this  legislation forward before the existing statutory  authority expires next year. I am very pleased  that my  subcommittee  chairman, Mr. Gutknecht of Minnesota, has joined me in introducing this legislation, along with 14 other of  our colleagues.  Forward pricing contracts allow farmers and  their customers the opportunity to freely negotiate a long-term contract for the sale of their  agricultural products at a fixed price. This risk  management  tool gives  farmers greater predictability for income streams, which in turn allows for better management of farm and business operations.  Buyers and sellers of many farm commodities rely heavily on forward contracts. According to a report by the GAO, forward cash contracting is the risk management tool most frequently used by producers outside the dairy  sector. A majority of cotton (76 percent), corn  (65 percent), and wheat  (57 percent) producers use forward contracts to lock in their  prices and revenue. Dairy producers have utilized this tool less, primarily because the legal  requirements of  the  federal milk marketing  order system have prevented dairy processors  from offering  this  risk management  tool  to  dairy farmers.  In 1999, Congress decided to amend federal  law  to remove  this  impediment  to dairy  forward pricing contracts. A pilot program was  established,  allowing  dairy  producers  and  processors to enter into voluntary agreements  for the sale of a set amount of milk for a fixed  price over a specified period of time. These  contracts are based on a negotiated price  rather  than  the minimum price set monthly  under federal milk marketing orders.  The pilot program went  into effect  in July  2000, and  is due  to expire December 31,  2004. Although it has only been in place for a  few years, it is an important tool for the dairy  industry  to have  that deserves permanence.  The bill  that  I  introduced  today would make  this program a permanent authority and thereby ensure  the availability of  forward pricing  contracts to any and all producers and processors who voluntarily want to use such a risk  management tool.  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation and making it become  law in the near future. f  SPINA BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH  HON.

349,House,108,0.458,2,2003-10-29,Mr. KELLER.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing the No Financial Aid  for Sex Offenders Act for 2003. It is a  national embarrassment that we are  handing  out  taxpayer  dollars  for  pedophiles and rapists to take college  courses while hardworking young people from poor and middle class families  are left to flip hamburgers and mow  lawns to pay for college.  In 1972, Congress created the Pell  grant program to help children from  low- and moderate-income families go  to college. In 1994, Congress prohibited  State and Federal prisoners from getting these Pell grants. This past year,  54 violent sexual predators in Florida  obtained over $200,000 in Pell grants at  taxpayer expense. They got a free ride  by exploiting a loophole, that is, they  were involuntarily confined in something called a civil commitment center  as opposed to being called a prison.  This legislation closes that loophole  and ensures that this money will be  used as intended, by needy law-abiding  college students. I urge my colleagues  to cosponsor this legislation, H.R. 3385. f  ARMED FORCES TAX FAIRNESS  BILL  (Mr. EDWARDS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

351,House,108,-0.312,9,2003-10-29,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the rule providing for consideration of the Interior Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2004. Although  there are certainly things that I would  have done differently, I am generally  pleased with the process this year and  am glad that we have the opportunity  to bring this bill to the floor as a freestanding measure.  I supported the conference agreement  and am particularly pleased it included  the additional $400 million added by  the other body for emergency wildland  fire costs. The House voted overwhelmingly to have the money included in  the  final conference  report, and we  were successful in providing it.  Other levels in the bill are far lower  than I would have hoped, particularly  levels for conservation spending. Under  the Conservation Trust Fund law established in 2000, this bill should have  funded conservation programs at $1.56  billion for the Interior part of the bill.  Unfortunately, this bill falls roughly  $500 million short of that level. The impact of this cut will be felt nationwide.  Funding is reduced for State and Federal land and water conservation fund,  historic preservation, park and refuge  construction, endangered species work,  and  forest  legacy project.  It means  projects all over the country will not  be done this year.  The agreement does provide small increases for other important programs  that I am extremely pleased about. The  National Endowment for the Arts receives a $5 million increase over last  year, and that was a direct result of  the Slaughter-Dicks amendment that  added $10 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and $5 million for  the National Endowment for the Humanities that was voted on overwhelmingly by the House. And the Tribal College Program receives an additional $10  million. My colleague from the other  body, the ranking Democratic member,  Mr. DORGAN, is to be given a pat on the  back for his efforts on this matter.  The agreement also addresses  the  issue of competitive outsourcing with a  compromise that I think is responsible.  I want to again thank the gentleman  from North Carolina (Chairman TAYLOR) and his staff for their work on this  bill, his first, and urge my colleagues  to support both the rule for the conference report and the conference report itself.  I want to go back on the issue of  funding for firefighting just for a moment. I am deeply concerned about the  process that we have today, the way we  fund the efforts to deal with forest fires  in our country. What we do is we in essence appropriate some of the money,  but then give the agencies the ability,  the Forest Service and the BLM, to  borrow money from other accounts in  order to fund all of the money that is  necessary for fighting the fires. And  then we do not replenish the amount of  money necessary. In 2003, I think we  were short a couple of hundred million  dollars  in terms of replenishing the  money necessary to make up the funding that was borrowed.  Now, with FEMA, we do not do it  that way. We  just give FEMA  the  money, and they draw it down and then  we replenish it; and this is what I think  we should do. We have got to come up  with a new way of funding firefighting  in this country. It is not acceptable.  The other problem we have  is we  have old, antiquated equipment. We  have a whole group of airplanes that  are 40-plus years old that we are using  for firefighting. And according to the  staff on the Subcommittee on Interior  Appropriations, we are losing lives because we are using this old equipment.  So I would urge that next year we  make this a priority, that we have a  committee investigation. I am going to  talk to the gentleman from California  (Chairman  on  the  Subcommittee on Defense and the gentleman from North Carolina (Chairman  TAYLOR) on the Subcommittee on Interior. We have to get some new equipment for these firefighters. It is outrageous that we are sending them out  with these old airplanes and not replacing them. The planes that we use now  are, I think, C–130s that are in some  cases over 40 years old. I just had a  chance to fly in a few of these over in  Iraq; and  I want my colleagues  to  know, I would not want to be fighting  fires in these old planes.  So we have a lot of work to do, and  I hope even in this supplemental, because of the situation in California. I  understand the chairman of the Interior Appropriations Committee in the  other body is considering an amendment to add money for additional funds  for firefighting for the Forest Service  and for the BLM. That should be done.  We should not go in and start this year  and start borrowing  immediately on  the 2004 money in order to fund these  fires in California.  Now, I understand that $500 million  was added  in FEMA; and definitely,  there is a requirement here for $100  million-plus for the Forest Service and  the BLM.  So, Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill,  and I am going to vote for this bill; but  we have additional things that need to  be done in the supplemental or in the  omnibus.

The language of section 11, which is taken  from H.R.  1585  as  revised  by  our Subcommittee on Health requires VA to maintain  a permanent and independent research compliance and assurance office. While establishment of this office may not provide a complete  shield against possible future abuses, it does  send a clear message that the Congress expects compliance with rules already in place to  assure protection of human subjects who participate in research sponsored by VA.  Finally,  I want  to  thank  the Committee’s  ranking member, LANEEVANS, for his support  of  this  legislation, and  for  the work of  the  chairman and ranking member of the Health  Subcommittee,  and  RODRIGUEZ, respectively,  for considering  bill in a timely fashion.

353,House,108,0.386,23,2003-10-29,Mr. TIBERI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  express my support for H.R. 1720, the Veterans Health Care Facilities Capital  Improvement Act. I am pleased that the House  of Representatives acted today to approve  this important bill.  H.R. 1720 includes language originally included in legislation introduced by my colleague, Congressman DAVIDHOBSON, that authorizes the construction of an expanded VA  medical facility on the campus of the Defense Supply Center in Columbus, OH.  I have been deeply and personally committed to improving health care for veterans  for nearly 20 years, going back to my days as  a congressional staffer handling veteran’s  casework. I know first hand the difficulties  our veterans have had receiving the level of  care they earned through their service to our  country.  Columbus is the 15th largest city in America. Central Ohio, a metropolitan area of 1.2  million people, has over 135,000 veterans who  reside here. Yet we have never had a VA hospital, and our clinic has always been too  small to provide the services needed for our  veterans. As one of the fastest growing areas  in the country, we continue to see the number of veterans in central Ohio increase each  year.  On the day it opened in 1995, our existing  clinic was already too small to meet all the  health care needs of our veterans. It was designed to handle 135,000 annual visits. Last  year there were 192,000 visits, and this year  the clinic  is handling 823 visits per day,  which will total approximately 205,000 visits  in 2003. Furthermore, the current veterans  population projection data does not account  for veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom,  Noble Eagle or Iraqi Freedom. In Ohio alone  we have mobilized over 6,000 National Guard  and Reserve Forces who are now eligible for  health care, as well as the hundreds of thousands of Active Duty soldiers of those operations who will be returning home in the  near future. These new veterans will dramatically swell the rolls at our local facilities.  While our local VA officials do the best  they can with the resources they have been  given, the existing  facility  is simply too  small to meet our current needs, much less  the growing needs of the future.  A continued piecemeal approach to veterans’ needs both wastes taxpayer dollars,  and provides substandard care to the central  Ohio men and women who have given so  much to our country. The VA spends nearly  $3 million a year  shipping our veterans  around  the  State,  admitting  emergency  cases to a local hospital, and paying for outpatient specialty care because they lack adequate facilities. Additionally, the current facility is leased, and the lease will expire in  just over 10 years. I believe it is not a good  use of taxpayer money to invest dollars in a  facility the VA will not control over the long  term.  I want to tell you about a veteran I know  who  lives  in Pataskala, OH. Mr. Stanley  Folk is 78 years old, and is a 60 percent service connected World War II veteran who is  forced to travel to the Cincinnati VA hospital twice a month. He gets up at 4:30 a.m.  to catch a shuttle down to Cincinnati to get  the treatment he needs. He is forced to stay  there all day until the shuttle returns him to  Columbus. He does not get home until well  after 7 p.m. The strain of this trip makes  him so tired and ill that he is in bed for several days after to recover. This would be a  hardship on anyone, but is doubly so for the  elderly and disabled. It  is unconscionable  that veterans must go through this to get  the care they deserve. The sad part is Mr.  Folk is not alone. I could go on and on with  stories of veterans who have faced similar  hardship.  Furthermore, there are many veterans who  will not seek emergency care at night and on  weekends, because the VAOPC is closed, and  they are afraid to go to private hospitals  with no prior guarantee the VA will pay the  private hospital  expense. These  veterans  have no health insurance and they are afraid  they will be stuck with a large bill they cannot pay, so they delay treatment at risk to  their health.  I believe the facts clearly show that these  facilities and services are desperately needed  to meet the health care needs of veterans in  central Ohio. I would like to thank Chairman SMITHand Ranking Member EVANS, as  well as Subcommittee Chairman SIMMONS  and Ranking Member RODRIGUEZ for their  hard work on this legislation. My colleagues  in the central Ohio delegation, Congressman  DAVIDHOBSONand Congresswoman DEBORAH  as well  as Ohio Senators MIKE  DEWINEand GEORGEVOINOVICH, also deserve  a great deal of credit for their hard work on  this issue and steadfast support for the interests of central Ohio’s veterans.

I would  like  to  thank him, Full Committee Chairman  SMITH, and my colleagues on the Veterans Affairs Committee  for  their excellent bipartisan  work on this legislation.  We all understand the significant needs of  our VA medical facilities across this great Nation. Many Members of this Congress have a  VA building in their district that is old and in  need of renovation, maintenance, and repair.  The practice of medicine  requires constant  modernization of equipment and facilities, and  we need to do our best to ensure that our veterans continue to receive the quality of care  that  they deserve. Although  there are never  enough resources for our veterans and their  medical centers, this bill will authorize much  needed help for those areas most in need.  In addition to the projects authorized in this  bill, I think we can all agree that more needs  to be done to encourage VA to coordinate with  the Defense Department, the academic community, and maybe even  the private sector  VerDate jul 14 2003  04:25 Oct 30, 2003 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A29OC7.111 H29PT1 ‘ ’ ",2003
355,House,108,0.221,72,2003-10-29,Mr. GERLACH.," Mr. Speaker, I first  would  like  to  thank  the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) and the  ranking member  from  Illinois  (Mr.  EVANS) for their great work and their  staffs’ great work in bringing H.R. 1516  to the floor today. Special thanks to  the lead Democrat sponsor of the legislation,  the  gentleman  from Montgomery  County,  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  HOEFFEL), for his persistence, not only  in this session but in prior sessions to  bring this to a conclusion today legislatively.  I also would like to thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, and his staff and ranking member,  Senator GRAHAM, for their work also  over on the Senate in allowing us to  move this forward.  Most  importantly, I would  like to  thank  the veterans of  southeastern  Pennsylvania  for their great service  and sacrifice to our country over the  years.  This legislation was introduced last  March to establish a new national veterans cemetery in southeastern Pennsylvania;  and  as  that  bill moved  through the Committee on Veterans’  Affairs, I am very pleased to see that  the additional  sites were added  for  other areas of the country that likewise have the need to have veterans  cemeteries for their veterans.  The need for a cemetery in our area  is well-documented and long overdue.  The Philadelphia national cemetery is  virtually closed with the exception of  cremated remains to nearly 400,000 veterans that reside in the five counties  and make up the metropolitan Philadelphia area.  While cremation may be alternative  to some, it is certainly not the preference to most; but unfortunately it is  the only option for Philadelphia-area  veterans currently if they want to have  their remains reposed at a veterans  cemetery close to home.  The only other national cemetery in  our region is the Indiantown Gap Cemetery, which is a long drive from Philadelphia and can be very difficult for  widows, widowers, and other  family  members who want to visit the graves  of their loved ones. I would note that  more than 290,000 area veterans  live  more than 65 miles from Indiantown  Gap National Cemetery.  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs  has expressed his support for the establishment of a new cemetery in southeastern Pennsylvania after analyzing  two factors not taken into account in  the previous veterans affairs department  study. First,  the Beverly National Cemetery in nearby Burlington  County, New Jersey, is filling up faster  than expected and is only available to  New Jersey veterans. Additionally, the  department  recently  added Monroe  County, Pennsylvania, to the greater  Philadelphia service area, thereby increasing the number of the veterans in  need  to over  175,000,  the  statistical  benchmark for the establishment of a  new cemetery. b1345  The  Secretary  also  acknowledged  that  the  Indiantown Gap National  Cemetery in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, is at least 80 miles from Philadelphia, which contrasts with the Department’s guidelines of having a veterans cemetery within 75 miles of a  veteran’s home.  Consequently, the Secretary has expressed his support for a new cemetery  in our area to honor those who would  be laid to rest there. This legislation  would provide  for  its establishment  within a 4-year time period and allow  for the input of local officials and veterans in determining its specific site.  The importance of a veterans cemetery from our part of Pennsylvania has  already been recognized for a long period of time. In 1862, the 37th Congress  created  the National  Cemetery  of  Philadelphia when they initially established what has become a large network of national cemeteries across the  United States. Southeastern Pennsylvania veterans and the veterans living  in the other areas included in the bill  today should, like those in the past,  have the opportunity to be buried close  to home after providing the same level  of heroic service and sacrifice to our  Nation.

356,House,108,0.251,79,2003-10-29,Mr. ENGLISH.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, currently before  the  House is House Resolution 414, to urge  China to live up to its international obligations which it has agreed to undertake upon joining the World Trade Organization  in 2001. We consider this  with a sense of urgency as we are running an historically large trade deficit  and an enormous bilateral trade deficit  with China.  Mr. Speaker, our trade deficit with  China has doubled since 1998, and is  likely to exceed $120 billion this year.  It has become the single largest bilateral trade deficit in the world. And the  most conspicuous feature of our lopsided trade partnership with China is  China’s  state-sponsored mercantilism  which has cost this country millions of  manufacturing jobs.  When the Clinton administration embraced China’s entry  into the WTO,  many of us hoped that China would  adopt  the disciplines of  the global  rules-based  trading  system. Unfortunately,  we  have  been  sorely  disappointed. China continues  to  flout  global trade rules at the expense of our  manufacturers and workers. This cannot be allowed to stand. Americans can  compete with any economic power in  the world, provided there  is a  level  playing field.  Mr. Speaker, our resolution would:  One, show broad support for the administration’s efforts to get China to abide  by its international trade obligations;  two, put Congress on record urging  China  to  follow global  trade  rules;  three, commit to working with the administration  to encourage China  to  modernize  its  financial  system  and  allow a  flexible exchange rate;  four,  urge the administration to continue intensive discussions with Chinese leaders  towards  establishing  a marketbased valuation of their currency; and,  five, state that the United States Government  should  intensify  efforts  to  promote innovation, reduce costs, and  level the playing field for the manufacturing sector.  Mr. Speaker, here are the facts, the  IMF, APEC, and the group of seven finance ministers all have stressed the  importance  of  allowing  for  greater  flexibility  in exchange rates. In the  last month, every top official in the administration’s  economic  and  trade  team, including President Bush himself, has visited China and implored its  leaders to bring its trading practices  up to global standards and allow their  currency value to be dictated by the  market.  Still, China’s leaders have continued  to stall. Our message today is the same  as the administration’s. They have told  China time and time again if they want  to have a healthy trade relationship  with the United States, then they must  be prepared to follow the rules. The  message we  are  carrying  today  is  among the most important that Congress will communicate this year. It is  essential for the economic future of the  next generation, for the future of good  paying jobs in places like my home in  northwestern Pennsylvania where we  make things for a living, that we get  this right.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time. ",2003

Mr.  LINCOLN  DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida. Mr. Speaker,  I  thank my  friend from Ohio for yielding me the  time.  For me, I consider it a privilege and  an honor to be able to speak on behalf  of  the  resolution welcoming  to  the  United States the elected President of  the Republic of China of Taiwan. I have  always had admiration for the Republic  of China of Taiwan.  I  believe  that  first  they  demonstrated an extraordinary, an extraordinary and commendable and admirable will and devotion to work and to  sacrifice  that  permitted  them  to  achieve economic prosperity which is  the envy of the world, and then they  have made, as our distinguished colleagues have mentioned today, also extraordinary and admirable progress in  democratization and have, in fact, established a representative democracy  that is to be admired by all of the  world.  So I join my colleagues in welcoming  President Chen Shui-bian to the United  States. The entire Congress and the  American people welcome him and say  to him that we consider  it a great  privilege to be able to be an ally and a  friend of Taiwan, that that will always  be reality, and here in Congress I think  it is important, Mr. Speaker, that we  reiterate our support for Taiwan, for  the Taiwan Relations Act and that we  never  falter, never  falter  in support  and in reminding the world that the  safety and security of Taiwan is a matter of extreme importance to this Congress,  to  the American Government  and to the American people.

358,House,108,-0.446,93,2003-10-29,Mr. BALLANCE.," Mr. Speaker, as many Chinese-Americans and American friends of Taiwan prepare  to welcome Taiwan President  Chen Shui-bian to New York on October 31,  I wish to pay tribute to this impressive Taiwan  leader.  At the age of 49, Mr. Chen Shui-bian was  elected the tenth president of the Republic of  China on Taiwan in March 2000. Mr. Speaker,  I have learned that his political success came  only after a series of personal tragedies. As  active political opponents of the government in  the 1970’s and 1980’s, Mr. Chen and his wife  were often  targets of attack by  the government. In November 1985, Mr. Chen’s wife was  hit by a tractor-truck speeding out of a narrow  lane. Although Mrs. Chen’s  life was spared,  the lower half of her body was paralyzed. Mr.  Speaker, In 1986, Mr. Chen was sentenced to  eight months in prison for libel for criticizing  the government. At  the end of 1986, campaigning  in her wheelchair Mrs. Chen was  elected to the Legislative Yuan (Parliament).  After Mr. Chen was released  from prison  in  1987, he served as Mrs. Chen’s assistant and  joined the Democratic Progressive Party, the  opposition party.  Subsequently, Mr. Chen became a member  of the Legislative Yuan, chairman of the Formosa Foundation and Mayor of Taipei, prior to  his election as president  in 2000. President  Chen undoubtedly is a fighter for his people  and his country. He has instilled confidence in  his people, making them feel that they are important, that they matter in the world, and that  they must choose their own future, without interference from outside sources. Mr. Speaker,  there are many who believe  that President  Chen speaks for his people; the world should  listen carefully to what he has to say; and only  he and his people can help maintain peace  and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Mr. Speaker,  President Chen needs our help to make the  right decisions that are good for Taiwan.  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting  President Chen’s efforts. ",2003

360,House,108,0.221,100,2003-10-29,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I  find  it  fascinating, Mr. Speaker,  that my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle today seek to instruct conferees to adopt certain higher funding  levels for education when less than 3  months ago they stood on this very  floor and voted against providing the  funding for many of these same programs.  The Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriation bill  that this body approved in July was a  fair and balanced bill. In the area of  Federal education spending, we provided increases in education totaling  $2.2 billion, or 4.5 percent. Further,  within these increases are the highest  levels of spending for both title I programs and special education, IDEA programs, today. Finally, let me remind  my colleagues that not only did the  bill  include  increases  in both  those  highly visible education programs, but  it also included increases in other numerous important education programs  as well.  Mr. Speaker,  I  just want  to  run  through the list of education programs  that were increased in funding in this  bill over last year: title I grants to  school districts, Even Start, Reading  First, Early Reading First,  literacy  through school libraries, migrant education  programs,  programs  for  neglected and delinquent youth,  comprehensive school reform, Impact Aid  payments for children of military families, mathematics and science partnerships, after-school centers, State assessments, education for homeless children,  education  programs  for  rural  school districts, teacher enhancement  programs, charter school grants, credit  enhancement for charter schools, mentoring programs, physical  education  programs, special education programs,  preschool programs for disabled children, grants for special needs infants  and their families, vocational rehabilitation grants for adults with disabilities,  independent-living  grants  for  adults with disabilities,  services  for  older blind individuals, National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation  Research, American Printing House for  the Blind, National Technical Institute  for the Deaf, Gallaudet University for  the Deaf, vocational education State  grants, adult education State grants,  smaller high schools, Pell grants, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Historically  Black Colleges and Universities, TRIO  programs  for  first-generation college  students, GEAR UP programs to encourage minority students to attend  college, Teacher Quality Enhancement  Grants, Howard University, education  research, education statistics, national  assessment  of  educational  progress,  and  national  assessment  governing  board.  Every one of those education programs had an increase in our bill over  last year.  Mr. Speaker, this body passed a responsible Labor, Health and Human  Services and Education appropriation  bill in July. The bill was within the  subcommittee’s  allocation  and  the  budget resolution. Let us work to finish our conference with the other body  so that we can complete the people’s  work for the year and fund these important programs that give hope to the  children of the families of our Nation.  I would like to point out that a previous speaker mentioned the fact that  the President has not supported the  programs in the No Child Left Behind  bill. Since No Child Left Behind was  signed into law, Federal spending for  major elementary and secondary education, including funding for children  with disabilities, has increased by approximately 34 percent, from $24.5 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $32.8 billion in  fiscal year 2003. So I think that this  clearly says that the President and the  majority party have supported responsible increases to fund the No Child  Left Behind programs.  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this  motion to instruct because we want to  provide the most money possible for  education, too. And I agree with the  gentleman  from Wisconsin  that we  should do as much as possible, and the  gentlewoman from California, the minority leader; but we have to live within the budget constraints. We do not do  the budget in our committee; we live  with the money that has been provided  by the Committee on the Budget. And  I think we did a very responsible job  given the constraints of the amount  that was budgeted for Labor, HHS and  Education by a vote of this House when  they approved the budget.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time. ",2003
361,House,108,0.528,107,2003-10-29,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First, Mr. Speaker, I want to say I  have nothing but the highest personal  regard for the gentlewoman from Texas  who is offering this motion to instruct  conferees. She and I have served together in this body for, I think, approximately  11 years; and we have  worked together on many, many issues  and spent many, many moments together in very positive dialogue, and I  appreciate her bringing this issue to  the floor. My objection to the resolution is based on the policy, not on the  person who is bringing the resolution.  I do rise in opposition, respectfully,  to the Johnson motion to instruct. To  put it in the simplest terms, the issue  before us today  is not whether any  Member of this body does not want the  cleanest air possible for our citizens;  the issue is whether we want to apply  common sense to the Clean Air Act and  to codify Clinton administration policy  that was explicitly designed to avoid  what the EPA, under the Clinton administration back in 1994, called an odd  or even absurd result that penalizes an  area for pollution that is beyond their  ability to control.  Let me put this in language that everybody can understand. The Clean Air  Act amendments of 1990 categorized in  a more definitive way ozone as a pollutant that needed to be regulated, and  it set standards. It is the only pollutant in the act that has gradations of  standards. For  the other  controlled  pollutants, it is kind of an in or out,  yes or no, pass or fail. But for ozone, it  has different  levels,  from very moderate to very severe; and each of the  levels has a different standard and a  different timeline for compliance.  I am an author of the Clean Air Act  amendments. I spoke for them on the  floor. I helped to work to put the bill  together in the committee. So I have  some personal history in this issue.  As the Clean Air Act amendments of  1990 were being  implemented,  it became apparent that there were many  regions of this country that were trying to comply; but because there were  other areas down wind from them that  had a different timetable and a different compliance criteria, it was making it difficult for some of these regions to comply in the technical sense  with the act. So the Clinton administration came up with a proposal that  said, we will show some flexibility. If,  in fact, you have a State implementation plan that has been approved or is  in the process of being approved and if,  in fact, it looks like you are making a  good-faith effort to come into compliance, we will give you an extension if  we think it is meritorious and the reason that you need the extension is because there is another region that is  not in compliance that is transporting  their ozone pollution to you. That is  common sense. There is nothing wrong  with that.  VerDate jul 14 2003  04:25 Oct 30, 2003 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00107 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K29OC7.139 H29PT1 ",2003

Since President Bush and Secretary  Principi have  taken  office,  one  as  President, one as the head of the VA,  we have opened 194 new community  clinics for a total of 676 clinics; 87 percent of the veterans now live within 30  minutes of a VA medical facility.  We have  increased enrollment,  increased outpatient visits. We have reduced waiting times for our veterans.  We have increased prescription drugs  coverage for our veterans. We lead for  all veterans health clinic quality indicators throughout the entire scope of  these facilities.  We have increased homeless veterans  outreach with a $35 million collaborative program with HUD and HHS. We  have reduced the inventory of related  claims from over 432,000 to 253,000. We  have reduced waiting times for claims  answers. We have  increased national  cemeteries, now six new cemeteries:  Atlanta, Detroit, South Florida, Fort  Sill, Pittsburg, and Sacramento. We remain on course to complete our national shrine commitment to improve  the appearance of our national cemeteries.  Veterans  have  received  great  response  from this administration. We  are proud of our record.  f  TRULY HONORING AMERICAN  VETERANS  (Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2003
364,House,108,0.855,16,2003-11-05,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise with  great reluctance today to oppose this  bill, particularly because of the respect  I have for the chairman and for the  main sponsor on the Democratic side. I  certainly support the goals of this legislation, but I think it is appropriate to  ask, why is Congress authorizing $100  million in Federal funds to operate a  State program?  There seems to me to be no reason  for Congress to finance the State public defender system. Basic precepts of  federalism dictate that each level of  government should finance its own operations. Once States become accustomed to and budget for Federal funds,  they can never reject the money, and  Federal funding inevitably comes with  increased Federal strings. We have seen  that in every other area, most notably  public education.  In the long run, States risk losing  control over their own public defender  programs. I believe there is no reason  to start down that path.  I would  like to yield to the gentleman  from Arizona  (Mr. SHADEGG),  who has direct experience in the State  Attorney General’s office.

367,House,108,0.411,37,2003-11-05,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr.  Speaker,  this body should be proud. The California delegation, Republicans, Democrats, united. There were no party  lines. There were no district lines in  California. Members whose  districts  were not even affected called to help  and offered concern.  The day before yesterday, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. DAVIS),  the gentleman  from California  (Mr.  the  gentleman  from California  (Mr.  ISSA), and myself went  through 10 town hall meetings with  FEMA, Red Cross, SPA and other government  agencies. We witnessed  in  some cases firefighters who had fought  HUNTER),  fires, saving other people’s homes while  their own homes burned down.  I witnessed people at each of these  emergency centers that had actually  lost their homes, and they were volunteering at those centers to help other  people that had lost their homes and  things. The events of 9–11 showed that  people do come together, and it did so  in the State of California also.  In Lake Wolford we saw the sight of  a young girl, her brother was driving a  car, overcome by smoke, crashed the  car and she died a horrible death in  front of the firefighters that could not  get to her to save her life.  We honor our firefighters. We lost 23  firefighters  in  2003. We  lost a  firefighter, Steven Rucker, in this fight.  Captain Doug McDonald its fighting for  his life with over 18 percent of his body  burned.  If you really want to help our firefighters,  if you  really want  to pay  them homage, there are some things  we can do. We are putting in the defense bill that there are strange laws  where Federal tankers cannot get airborne. They could be there fully loaded  with water and chemicals, and they  cannot touch the fire if State and local  funds have not maxed out. We are  changing that, and we are asking for  this body’s help to do that.  Firefighters for years have asked for  us to put more roads in our forests, not  just to have access to the fire, but so  that they can get out. We lost 15 firefighters in Colorado because they could  not get out of the fire. They did not  have a road to come through. But yet  we have been stopped from doing that  by some people in this body and the  other body.  The bark beetle, we asked to be able  to cut the dead wood and the trees, and  not to cut just the dead wood but to  cut wherever the bark beetles are. And  that same group stopped us from doing  that. In Julian, we lost most of Julian  because of bark beetle trees and the  fuel. The firefighters could not get to  it.  We also have for a decade been wanting to take care and thin brush out.  For a decade. We have dead brush piled  on dead brush every year, and we want  to thin it; but we cannot do it because  of a bird called a gnat catcher and the  desert tortoise and those things. Well,  I ask this body, how many of the endangered species do we have today?  They are all burned up.  Can you  imagine what the winter  rains are going to do with the mud and  erosion  in  our  lakes  and  streams?  Those who stopped us from doing that  are responsible for the aftermath that  we are going through right now.  So we can make those changes, ladies  and gentlemen. Honor the firefighters  and give them what they need. ",2003
368,House,108,0.585,44,2003-11-05,Mr. BURTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor and recognition of my former colleague  and  fellow Hoosier, Congressman Frank X.  McCloskey, upon his untimely death after a  year-long battle with bladder cancer. I strongly  support the ‘ ‘Francis X. McCloskey Post Office  Building Designation Act’  (H.R. 3379), renaming  the United states Post Office  located  in  downtown Bloomington, Indiana, after former  Congressman McCloskey.  Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1939,  McCloskey attended high school  in Norristown, PA, and entered  the Air Force  immediately after graduation. After honorably serving his country, McCloskey attended Indiana  University, where the received both his undergraduate degree and a Doctorate of Jurisprudence. He then settled down in Bloomington  and began his service to both the state of Indiana and our Nation  in a most distinguished  manner, beginning with his ten-year term as  mayor of the city of Bloomington. McCloskey  had the highest of aspirations, and was eventually elected to the U.S.House of Representatives in 1982, serving a 6-term career as U.S.  Representative  from  the 8th Congressional  District of Indiana.  During his  tenure  in  the House of Representatives, Frank McCloskey became highly  involved in the Balkan crisis, introducing several pieces of legislation seeking to avert a humanitarian disaster in the former Yugoslav republics.  In  the years  following his Congressional service, Frank drew upon those experiences in foreign relations and human rights by  pursuing formal training in Balkan studies and  serving as a mediator in negotiations over territorial disputes in Bosnia. As a result of his  dedication and tireless efforts, McCloskey was  awarded by being named Director of Kosovo  Programs for the National Democratic Institute  for International Affairs.  Mr. Speaker and my esteemed colleagues,  please  join me  in honoring and recognizing  the service and commitment  that Congressman Frank McCloskey gave to his fellow Hoosiers,  the American people, and  the  international community.

No  dissent  is  allowed  in  this  room,’’ except if you happen to be a Republican on the other side of the Capitol, in which case maybe we have to  talk to you. But, then again, as we  know, Mr. Speaker, Mr. GRASSLEYapparently feels in effect he is shut out.  Mr. Speaker, let me say that it is absolutely outrageous that Congressional  Republicans  are  considering  acrossthe-board cuts to cover a $3 billion gap,  we hear, between House and Senate  spending bills. We have not been asked,  however, to participate in a conference  in which you may make the decisions  on what to cut.  In the last 7 months, this Congress  has  passed  two  emergency  supplemental  appropriations  bills  totaling  $166 billion. There was zero, none, no  debate on how we would pay for those.  There was a bill pending in which the  Committee on Ways and Means wants  to add $60 billion to the debt confronting  this  country. No  question  about how it is going to be paid for, it  will just be passed. And yet we worry  about how to pay for some $3 billion for  election  reform,  for veterans health  care and for money to combat global  HIV-AIDS, and how to provide $400 million to the Forest Service so they can  fight devastating wildfires in the Interior bill.  Mr. Speaker,  if  this process were  being run by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOUNG), you would find the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY)  and I standing here and saying we may  disagree on this item, that item or the  other item, but we have had a fair opportunity, as he gives us in every committee meeting, to state our points, to  offer our amendments, to vote.

As the gentleman read Members’  names off of amendments that were  worked out, it shows we can work together and that there is a good relationship between the majority and the  minority. In fact, some of those amendments,  if there was any hostility, I  would not have accepted by some of the  Members; but because we tried to work  out the differences, I believe we have  come out with a very good bill.  Again,  I want  to  thank  the  subcommittee chairman and the ranking  member for their work on this legislation, understanding there will be some  discussion on other amendments. Overall, we have  settled  every difficult  amendment prior  to coming  to  the  floor. That is one thing I pride this  committee on, is working behind the  scenes, in front of the scenes, and making sure the scene is finally done. And  this bill does it, and I compliment the  gentlemen. I also thank the staff who  worked very hard on this legislation  over the past 6 to 8 months. We have  come out with a very good product.

372,House,108,0.471,107,2003-11-05,Mr. PEARCE.," The idea that you must  know what you are trying to achieve  from any set of taxes that you take is  really obvious here. We were taking  somewhat of a chance to go out and do  the tax decreases, but it is working out  the way that economists have said it  would work out.  Our State, New Mexico, is leading the  Nation, number two in job growth because our State legislature this year  gave a tax cut, the Democrat Governor  said we all know it, tax cuts cause jobs,  tax cuts cause economic growth. But it  also has taken some discipline. I do not  know how many people are aware of it,  but as we look at the corporate scandals, the President and the Justice Department have taken a leadership role.  There are seven executives currently  awaiting trial. There are  four more  who are already spending time in jail,  including the ex-treasurer from Enron.  The founder of ImClone is spending 7  years in jail, and 12 former executives  from HealthSouth. The American people  respond when  government  acts  properly, when they request and require accountability on the part of not  only their elected officials but also  those people in business leadership positions.  So I salute the President in his plan  for  the  economic  recovery  for  this  country. I salute the President in his  willingness to ensure discipline in our  corporate executives. I salute the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MARIODIAZBALART) for hosting this discussion tonight.  Mr. MARIO DIAZ-BALART of Florida. I thank the gentleman from New  Mexico (Mr. PEARCE) for again his leadership. I think it is worth restating. We  hear it time and time again all the  rhetoric that, I hear it every day, Republicans are cutting taxes on the rich.  I think it is worth restating and the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  HENSARLING) mentioned that some of  the  high-profile Democratic  leaders  around this country, some of them said  they want to get rid of all the tax cuts  they propose.  I want to talk about  what those were, what those are, what  are some of those so-called rich people  that the Democrats want to raise taxes  on. And, again, if that were to happen,  if they were to succeed, it would reinstate nine million low-income Americans back on the tax rolls. Those are  low-income Americans that are now  not paying Federal income taxes at all  because of the previous tax cuts. It  would reinstate the marriage penalty.  Again, I repeat, I guess they think  only rich people get married. It is a  wakeup call. Not only rich people get  married. b2200  It would cut in half the $1,000 per  child tax credit. I am not going to comment on that.  It would raise taxes on education  savings by 75 percent. It would eliminate the income tax deduction for paying for college tuition.  It would increase a double tax of dividends by as much as 62 percent. It  would eliminate the small, I emphasize  it would eliminate the small business  expense again for small businesses.  It would reinstate the death tax, and  it would eliminate the emergency tax  relief to areas affected by the attacks  of September 11, 2001.  That is what is at stake here. That is  what we are talking about. Those are  the tax cuts that before I got elected a  majority of this Congress, Republicans,  fought for, the President fought for and  successfully got. That is why we have  seen the economic growth. Those are  the tax cuts that we better believe that  I think the American people deserve,  again, because  I believe  it  is  their  money. It is their money. They have  the right to keep a little bit more of  their money, and if somebody thinks  that those 9 million low income Americans who are now not paying Federal  income tax are rich, they have the  right to think so.  Like I repeat, the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. PELOSI), who I respect,  has the right to feel that we are not at  war. I just respectfully say that they  are wrong.  We do not have a lot of time, but I  know that the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. HENSARLING) wants to  leave us  with some last remarks.  ",2003
373,House,108,0.703,107,2003-11-05,Mr. HENSARLING.," Madam Speaker,  I thank the gentleman for yielding, but  I think it is again important for the  American people to know that President Bush’s pro-growth economic policies are working. It is absolutely incredible to think that we have just had  the  greatest  economic  growth,  the  greatest quarterly economic growth in  almost 20 years, to think that productivity has increased precipitously, to  think that consumer spending on nondurables is up 7.9 percent, the best in a  quarter century, that, as I said, productivity  increased almost 4 percent  during the first two-and-a-half years of  this administration, the fastest pace of  any presidency since JFK.  It is important that the American  people know that shareholder wealth is  up almost $3 trillion, an increase of 22  percent since October 2, where we are  helping to rebuild nest eggs. There is  so much great economic news that is  out there, totally in contrast to what  we heard from people on the other side  of the aisle, who said that these were  failed economic policies.  We need to do more work to create  jobs, but the question is where do we  go from here? I often feel as my colleagues follow the debate and I follow  the debate, that Democrats seem to  love jobs. They just hate the people  who create them. They want to tax job  creators. They want to regulate  job  creators. They want to sue  job creators, and then they wonder where are  all the jobs, and then they continue to  want to engage in this class warfare  which  I  just  believe  is  so  uncharacteristic of the American people.  I have held a lot of jobs in my life. I  used to clean out chicken houses for a  living. I used to bus tables for a living.  I used to tote luggage at a hotel. I  worked as an officer in a small business  before. I have run my own company.  Actually, for a short period, I actually  practiced law, though I am trying to  live that one down, but my point is, in  all the jobs I have ever had, no poor  person ever hired me. It was somebody  who might have been poor once, but  they went out and they worked hard,  and they were allowed to accumulate  capital. They were allowed  to keep  their earnings, and so they went out  and they took a risk and they put a  hamburger stand over here or a transmission shop over there or a new software company over here. That is the  way that we grow the economy. That is  the way that we are going to create  jobs.  I am a  former small businessman,  and I know that one of the great challenges we face as small businesspeople  is how do we acquire capital. We do not  acquire capital from the Federal Government. When they take our money,  we do not have capital to go out and  create new businesses.  Another great challenge small business faces is in health care costs, and  yet as we work to try to improve the  quality of health care and bring the  cost of health care down, the folks on  the other side of the aisle have fought  us every step of the way, particularly  in reforming medical  liability  insurance. Lawsuit abuse is adding 15 percent to the cost of welfare, and we care  about doctors and patients, and they  care about trial lawyers, but every single step of the way, trying to create an  energy practice to bring down the cost  of energy, to help the economy move  further and create more jobs, they have  fought us every step of the way.  So I appreciate what the gentleman  has done tonight to bring the facts to  this great body and to the American  people, and I thank my colleague for  the opportunity to be a part of that.  Mr. MARIO DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Again, he is absolutely right.  The bottom line, the tax cuts are working. It is doing what our esteemed colleagues on the Democratic side said  time and time again it would not happen, it would not work. It is working.  Those tax cuts are working.  We mentioned who  are  receiving  those tax cuts that so many want to repeal, and I also want to mention one  last time their alternatives. Their alternative to the tax cut, their alternative to letting the American people  keep a little more money that is working, their alternatives are what they  propose, as I mentioned it before, to  raise taxes 25 times. If we combine this  chamber and the other chamber, 25  times to raise taxes. That is their alternative, and they also proposed alternatives to major legislation this year  alone that would have added $890 billion to the deficit.

The Export Achievement Certificate was  created to recognize small and medium-sized  enterprises that have successfully entered the  international marketplace for the first time or  that have successfully entered a new market.  As our economy continues to become more  global, it is important for industries of all types  to develop relationships and ties in the international  community. As  the West Virginia  economy diversifies, Walker Machinery has  taken major steps  forward  to promote  the  Mountain State and all it has to offer to the  world economy.  By making strides to expand opportunities,  Walker Machinery has in turn brought benefits  to  the state  that will be  felt  far beyond  the  business itself. I applaud Walker Machinery for  its efforts and look forward to seeing continued success.

395,,108,0.316,88,2003-11-12,Mr. RAMSTAD.," Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing  the  ‘Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act, ’ ’  legislation  to maintain  and increase the stock of affordable housing  in this country. I am delighted to be joined in  this effort by my  friend and colleague  from  Maryland, ",2003
396,,108,-0.328,88,2003-11-12,Mr. CARDIN.,"  In 1999, Congress recognized the need to  look at this issue by establishing the bipartisan  Millennial Housing Commission (MHC). That  Commission was charged with taking a thorough look at what the government was doing  to fill the huge unmet gap for affordable housing.  The MHC released  their report  in May of  2000. The  report stated,  ‘In 1999 one  in  four—almost 28 million —American households  reported spending more on housing than the  Federal Government considers affordable and  appropriate  (more  than 30 percent of  income).’ ’  The MHC report also contained a list of 13  recommendations for making housing more affordable. One of those recommendations was  for Congress to provide a ‘ ‘new tool’ ’ to encourage the transfer of affordable housing to  entities that agree to maintain these properties  and  keep  them  affordable.  They  recommended doing so by  forgiving  the depreciated recapture tax for owners who sell their  properties to purchasers who agree to maintain  them  for a 30-year period and  to keep  them affordable. The MHC  recommendation  would still hold owners  responsible  for any  capital gains taxes due above and beyond the  depreciated amount.  The lack of affordable housing is something  I hear about and see all across my congressional district and my State.  Indeed  recent  data shows that approximately 35 percent of  renters in Minnesota pay over 30 percent of  their  income on housing and 15 percent of  renters pay over 50 percent of their income on  their housing.  The  legislation we are  introducing  today  tracks closely with the recommendation made  by the MHC. I believe enactment of this legislation would be an  important  step  toward  maintaining and increasing affordable housing  in this country, and I urge my colleagues to  join me as a cosponsor of this legislation. f  TRIBUTE TO EDWARD J.

397,House,108,-0.201,16,2003-11-18,Mr. ROSS.," Madam Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  from Wisconsin  (Mr.  OBEY) for yielding me time.  I rise in support of the motion to instruct, to instruct the conferees that  we accept  in this agriculture appropriations bill the same language that  has already been passed on the House  floor as it deals with reimportation,  and let me tell you why.  In June of last year, I did a study  where we compared the price paid by  seniors in Arkansas’ Fourth Congressional District with the price paid by  seniors in six other countries. And we  found that the price paid by seniors in  the Fourth Congressional District of  Arkansas is 110 percent more on average than the price paid by seniors in  places like Canada, France, Germany,  Italy, Japan, and the U.K.  Let me give you a couple of examples. Prevacid, 30 milligrams. In our  congressional district it costs $128 a  month. The average foreign price, $55 a  month. Celebrex, 200 milligrams. In my  congressional district,  $81 a month.  The average foreign price, $35 a month.  Prilosec, in my district $129 a month.  The average foreign price, $56 a month;  and the list goes on and on and on.  The drug manufacturers wrote this  so-called Medicare prescription drug  bill, which is not for our seniors. It is  a windfall for the big drug manufacturers, and now we see their fingerprints  all over this bill today to go to conference on the ag appropriations bill.  Velma from my district writes and  says she takes seven prescriptions a  month. It costs her $560, and she is trying to get by and live on $604 a month.  Mary from my district says she takes  four prescriptions a month that cost  her $401.88, and she is trying to get by  on $586 a month.  I rise in support of the motion to instruct on behalf of the seniors of America so we can take on the big drug  manufacturers  and  the  Republican  leadership and finally bring down the  high cost of prescription drugs for our  seniors. This is America, and we can do  better than this by our seniors.  ",2003
398,Senate,108,0.538,128,2003-11-18,Mr. ENZI.," Mr. President, I rise today  to introduce legislation that would increase the likelihood that citizens who  live on the American frontier and in  other  sparsely populated areas will  have access to affordable healthcare in  their communities.  Since my election to the Senate in  1996, one of my goals has been to educate folks in Washington about what  life is like in the West.  Obviously there are rural areas along  the East and West Coasts and in the  Midwest. But people who live in these  places are always surprised when they  travel for the first time to places like  my home State of Wyoming. They are  amazed at just how rural Wyoming is.  Well, Wyoming is more than rural.  Most Wyomingites live in the remaining stretches of the American frontier.  Now, that’s not to say that there aren’t  plenty of sparsely populated areas elsewhere, even in coastal States. There  are many places outside the West that  share the characteristics of the frontier. But almost all of Wyoming  is  sparsely populated. In fact, more people live in the 68 square miles of the  District of Columbia than live in the  98,000 square miles of Wyoming.  People who live on the frontier and  other  sparsely populated areas  face  some unique challenges, and one of  those challenges is access to affordable  healthcare. People who live in frontier  areas are more likely to lack health insurance than other rural and urban  citizens. Also, frontier areas generally  do not have population centers that  can  support  the  full  range  of  healthcare services available in most  urban and some rural areas.  One of the proven ways of improving  healthcare  in medically underserved  areas is through the establishment of  federally qualified community health  centers, or CHCs. Community health  centers are not-for-profit providers of  health care to the working poor, the  uninsured, and other vulnerable populations.  These  safety-net  providers  served ten million people across America in 2001.  Community health  centers deliver  preventive and primary care  to patients  regardless of  their ability  to  pay. Almost half of the patients treated at community health centers have  no insurance coverage at all. Community health centers set their charges  according to income, and they do not  collect any fees from their poorest clients.  President Bush has proposed major  increases in funding for the establishment  and  expansion  of  community  health centers, and Congress has begun  to  provide  that  funding.  Senators  across  the political  spectrum agree  that community health centers play an  important  role  in  providing  health  services to the uninsured and underinsured in many medically underserved  areas. We all agree that we ought to  encourage  the development of more  sites where those in need but without  means can get proper care. Unfortunately, many  frontier areas  do not have community health centers.  Wyoming, for example, only has one  CHC,  located  in Casper. That center  just opened a satellite clinic in Riverton, a town of 9,300 people almost 125  miles away, so now we have two sites.  The Federal Government keeps statistics on the degree of ‘‘health center  penetration  into  the  unserved.’’  In  other words, we keep track of what  percentage of those who need access to  affordable healthcare can get adequate  service through community health centers.  In Wyoming, only 7.9 percent of the  unserved had reasonable access to community health center services, based  on 2001 data. Lest you think this is just  a Wyoming problem, Mr. President, let  me share some percentages from other  states: Alabama: 15.9 percent; Georgia:  8.9 percent; Indiana: 10.1 percent; Kansas: 10.4 percent; Louisiana: 4.3 percent;  Maryland: 15.8 percent; Nebraska: 5.3  percent; Nevada:  7.8 percent; North  Carolina: 11.1 percent; Oklahoma: 7.8  percent; Texas: 9.0 percent; and Virginia: 12.2 percent.  Why are these access figures so low?  It’s not because communities aren’t interested in helping their less fortunate  neighbors. It’s because many communities on  the  frontier and  in other  sparsely populated areas can’t even  apply  for  community health  center  funding.  Why can’t they apply? Well, believe  it or not,  the Federal Government  doesn’t consider many isolated communities to be located in ‘‘medically underserved areas.’’ And a community  has to be designated as being a ‘‘medically underserved area’’ before one can  even apply for CHC funding.  The barrier for frontier communities  lies in the index that the Federal Government uses to determine  ‘‘medical  underservice.’’ That index looks at four  factors: the percentage of people over  65 years of age, and the ratio of primary-care physicians per 1,000 people.  Using these four factors, the agency  has calculated  that only  four Wyoming’s 23 counties qualify to be ‘‘medically underserved areas.’’ I find this interesting, since Wyoming ranks 46th  out of the 50 State in terms of physician-to-population ratio.  I have an idea about the source of  this contradiction. When I went to accounting school, one of the things I  learned about was a concept called  ‘‘statistical validity.’’ What I learned  was that the statistical validity of a  sample is a function of sample size: in  other words, the larger the sample, the  more accurate the results associated  with the sample.  Well, as you can imagine, sparsely  populated states  like Wyoming offer  VerDate jul 14 2003  05:08 Nov 19, 2003 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G18NO6.105 S18PT1 ",2003
399,House,108,-0.302,17,2003-12-08,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring the body’s attention to another provision  in this  omnibus appropriations bill.  I know  there are several that are objectionable, and this one may not get any further discussion, but I think it merits  it.  There is a provision in this bill that  says that all of the records of firearm  purchases have to be destroyed within  24 hours.  Now, we know that there have been  more than 3,500 firearms purchased by  people who should not have purchased  them, and that the FBI has been able  to  retrieve  those guns because  the  records are currently kept for 90 days.  They retrieve them if the person that  purchased it is a fugitive, is a felon,  has a history of serious mental illness,  is an illegal alien, any number of reasons  that  they  should not be purchasing guns, lawfully, in the United  States. So 3,500 guns have been retrieved  because we  have kept  the  records available for 90 days. Now, they  have to be destroyed within 24 hours.  Now, the National Rifle Association  thinks this is a good thing, but our law  enforcement organizations do not. FBI  agents will tell us this is very serious,  what this bill would do. In fact, the al  Qaeda training manual cites the fact  that you can go in and buy a gun in the  United States, and as long as you have  not been a convicted felon in the past,  you can buy that and the records will  be destroyed. And, in fact, as the Washington Post  said  in an article  last  week, that is true, that if a person gets  hold of a gun, their records have to be  destroyed as a result of this bill. If  they are denied, then the records can  be pursued. But if they lawfully purchased it, the records are destroyed,  which means that we are deliberately  tying the hands of  law enforcement  agencies.  Now, is it not appropriate that we be  able to consult the list of violent gang  members and terrorists when they try  to buy a gun? Absolutely, is the answer. Yet,  this bill  says, within  24  hours, even if it is a holiday, a weekend, even if it is in some rural area  where they do not have the resources  to check what they need to be able to  check, it has to be destroyed within 24  hours.  Mr. Speaker, we are going to look  back and find this provision as one of  the most dangerous that this House has  passed, and the most irresponsible and  irrational. We should not be doing this.  It was another one of these things  snuck  into  the conference  report.  I  strongly urge Members, unless we can  take this out, this bill should not be  supported in its present form. ",2003

401,House,108,-0.306,87,2003-12-08,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  discuss the Fiscal Year 2004 Omnibus Appropriations bill. I will vote in favor of this bill because it includes federal funding for a great  number of very worthwhile projects in my district of southern West Virginia, many of which  I personally sought and others that were provided by  the esteemed senior Senator  from  my  state, West Virginia’s great  champion,  Senator ROBERTC. BYRD.  On my account, these projects include funding for technological infrastructure in a historically underserved area,  transportation planning and congestion relief funding, funding to  help educate the blind, federal assistance for  wastewater  treatment, and maritime  safety  training dollars for port security.  In addition, it is with tremendous gratitude  for his efforts that West Virginia thanks Senator BYRD for providing much-needed funding  of projects such as a road building effort that  will enable veterans  to access  their medical  center. He also provided funding for our universities and colleges,  funding  for economic  revitalization efforts, and federal dollars for a  great number of other worthwhile endeavors.  However,  I cast my vote with great misgivings.  As a result of White House meddling, this  bill recklessly strips overtime protection provisions that a tremendous majority of Americans  favor and that overwhelmingly passed both the  House and the Senate. To do the President’s  bidding on behalf of his big corporate friends,  the Republican leadership in the House and  the Senate made sure in this bill that the Department of Labor can gut more than 60 years  of worker protections.  As a result of White House meddling, this  bill unwisely fails to fund the No Child Left Behind initiative while actually even cutting many  programs such as teacher quality grants, technology grants, safe and drug-free schools, and  reading first grants.  As a result of White House meddling, this  bill unfairly freezes funding for child care and  wrongly imposes more stringent work requirements for parents receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.  There are also a host of other shortcomings  and deficiencies in this bill.  But this is what happens when the Republican leadership of the House and Senate fail  once again to complete their Constitutionallyrequired appropriations bills in a timely manner. A bunch of different bills get rolled into  one rather than being considered individually  on  their  respective merits. Then,  the White  House threatens, as it did here, to veto the  entire bill, which would  leave many  federal  agencies without  funds and  therefore  leave  many needy people without protection, unless  the President once again gets exactly what he  and his rich friends want.

402,House,108,0.433,87,2003-12-08,Mr. GRAVES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss  the importance of the State Assisted Fair Bid  provision in the FY2004 Transportation Appropriations bill. The Conference Report contains  a provision that will establish a pilot program  to assist states that choose to contract with  the private sector  to provide  intercity passenger rail service. I anticipate there will be at  least  two  or  three  demonstration  projects  under this proposal in fiscal year 2004. The  report provides the Secretary with up to $2.5  million to assist the states in implementing the  competitive process. I have spoken with Appropriations Chairman YOUNG, and he has assured me that the funding may be used for  any purpose in the implementation of a Fair  Bid Demonstration project, including providing  insurance to states and operators in a manner  that results  in  the  lowest possible  insurance  costs. Furthermore, I understand that the Secretary is encouraged to use a portion of the  $2.5 million  in grant money provided  to  the  states  to subsidize alternative  insurance arrangements as a part of  the Demonstration  Projects.  I want to be clear in my understanding that  the states have a great deal of latitude in proposing Demonstration Projects under this provision. The only statutory requirement is that  the state must assist the intercity service with  a subsidy of some nature. My friend, Chairman YOUNG, has assured me that this is so.  Obviously, all of the current state-assisted operations, which  are  commonly  known  as  403(b) service, and are now being operated  under contract with Amtrak, are eligible. One  example of this service that comes to mind is  my state’s Missouri Mule, which operates between St. Louis and Kansas City. The state of  Missouri attempted a competitive bid for the  Missouri Mule service last year when Amtrak  increased the state subsidy requirement. The  process  failed, because Amtrak  refused  to  make facilities and equipment, or even access  to its national reservation system, available to  any bidder on  reasonable  terms.  In many  ways, it is the Missouri Mule example that resulted  in  the Fair Bid  language being contained in this bill. Certainly, the Missouri Mule  will be a candidate under this new provision.  However, there are many other candidates.  The North Carolina Piedmont and Carolinian  provide another example of such trains. The  Amtrak  Cascades  Service  between  Vancouver, British Columbia and Eugene, Oregon  is a 464-mile corridor that is subsidized by the  Washington and Oregon DOTs. Services that  are not current 403(b) services would also be  eligible should the state choose to provide a  subsidy. In another more general example, the  State of Florida is interested in new conventional intercity passenger rail service along the  East Coast, but Amtrak has declined to initiate  the operation.

403,House,108,0.471,94,2003-12-08,Mr. WELDON of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, on  July 22, 2003, I introduced an amendment to  provide congressional support for the current  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)  policy and practice against approving patent  claims directed to human organisms, including  human embryos and human  fetuses. The  House  of  Representatives  approved  the  amendment without  objection  on  July  22,  2003, as section 801 of the Fiscal Year 2004  Commerce/Justice/State  Appropriations  Bill.  The amendment, now included in the Omnibus  appropriations bill as  section 634 of H.R.  2673, reads as follows: ‘ ‘None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under  this Act may be sued  to  issue patents on  claims directed to or encompassing a human  organism.’ The  current Patent Office policy  is  that  ‘non-human organisms, including animals’  are  patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C.  101, but  that human organisms,  including  human embryos and human fetuses, are not  patentable. Therefore, any claim directed to a  living organism must include the qualification  ‘non-human’  to avoid rejection. This amendment provides unequivocal congressional support for this current practice of the U.S. patent  office.  House and Senate appropriators agreed on  report  language  in  the manager’s statement  on section 634. The statement  reads:  ‘The  conferees have  included a provision prohibiting funds to process patents of human organisms. The conferees concur with the intent of  this provision as expressed in the colloquy between  the provision’s sponsor  in  the House  and the ranking minority member of the House  Committee on Appropriations as occurred on  July 22, 2003, with respect to any existing patents on stem cells.’ The manager’s statement refers to my discussion with Chairman DAVIDOBEY, when  I  explained  that  the amendment  ‘only affects  patenting human organisms, human embryos,  human fetuses or human beings.’  In response  to Chairman OBEY’s inquiry, I pointed out that  there are existing patents on stem cells, and  that  this amendment would not affect such  patents.  Here I wish to elaborate further on the exact  scope of  this amendment. The amendment  applies to patents on claims directed to or encompassing a human organism at any stage  of development,  including a human embryo,  fetus,  infant, child, adolescent, or adult,  regardless of whether  the organism was produced by  technological methods  (including,  but not limited to, in vitro fertilization, somatic  cell nuclear transfer, or parthenogenesis). This  amendment applies to patents on human organisms regardless of where the organism is  located, including, but not limited to, a laboratory or a human, animal, or artificial uterus.  Some have questioned whether  the  term  ‘organism’  could  include  ‘stem cells’ . The  answer is no. While stem cells can be found  in human organisms (at every stage of development), they are not themselves human organisms. This was considered the ‘ ‘key question ’  by Senator HARKIN at a December 2,  1998 hearing before  the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and  Human Services and Education regarding embryonic  stem  cell  research.  Dr.  Harold  Varmus, then director of the NIH testified ‘ that  pulripotent stem cells are not organisms and  are not embryos . . .’  Senator HARKINnoted:  I asked all of the scientists who were here  before the question of whether or not these  stem cells are organisms. And I believe the  record will show they all said no, it is not an  organism.’  Dr. Thomas Okarma of the Geron  Corporation stated:  ‘My view  is  that  these  cells are clearly not organisms . . . in fact as  we have said, are not the cellular equivalent of  an embryo.’  Dr. Arthur Caplan agreed with  this distinction, saying that a stem cell is ‘ ‘absolutely not an organism.’  There was a unanimous consensus on  this point at  the 1998  hearing, among witnesses who disagreed on  many other moral and policy issues related to  stem cell research.  The term ‘ ‘human organism’  includes an organism of  the human  species  that  incorporates one or more genes taken from a nonhuman organism. It includes a human-animal  hybrid organism (such as a human-animal hybrid organism  formed by  fertilizing a nonhuman egg with human sperm or a human  egg with non-human sperm, or by combining  a comparable number of cells taken respectively from human and non-human embryos).  However, it does not include a non-human organism incorporating one or more genes taken  from a human organism (such as a transgenic  plant or animal). In this respect, as well, my  amendment  simply  provides  congressional  support for the Patent Office’s current policy  and practice.  This amendment should not be construed to  affect claims directed to or encompassing subject matter other than human organisms, including but not limited to claims directed to or  encompassing the following: cells, tissues, organs, or other bodily components that are not  VerDate jul 14 2003  04:26 Dec 09, 2003 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A08DE7.080 H08PT1 ’ ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ’ ’ ",2003
404,House,108,-0.272,143,2003-12-08,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my  colleagues in fond memories of our friend and  colleague, Joe Skeen, easily one of the most  even-handed, honest, fair legislators elected to  the House of Representatives.  Joe was only a little more senior than me,  but his route here was considerably more entertaining than most of ours. Joe was elected  as a write-in candidate over another write-in  candidate and the nephew of the sitting governor. He made history, becoming  the  third  Member ever to win election to Congress without being on a ballot.  For the next 22 years, Joe served with us  in Congress, making excellent representation  for his home district in New Mexico the standard of his service. He chaired the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural  Development. Those he represented  in New  Mexico could have had no better steward in  Congress.  He was tireless in representing the needs of  ranchers and farmers in his role as an appropriations cardinal.  Joe was my friend, and he was my neighbor  on the third floor of Rayburn where we would  often visit in each other’s office.  He spoke Spanish, and he spoke the all-important language of bipartisanship. Joe Skeen  was the best example of how a member of  this House should comport themselves in any  circumstance. He did more than just talk the  talk, he walked the walk on bipartisanship, an  art often lost in the House of Representatives  today.  He was a pragmatist, and he was a guy  who really enjoyed life, teasing colleagues and  playing practical  jokes. He was  truly a gentleman, and he made our work here  in  the  halls of Congress more pleasant when he was  involved.  I join my colleagues here in the House in offering our collective and individual sympathies  to Joe’s wife Mary and their two children. The  House has been a poorer place for Joe’s absence. He was a great legislator and an exceptional man. f  AMERICAN DREAM DOWNPAYMENT  ACT  ",2003
405,,108,0.443,178,2003-12-08,Mr. HASTERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend to the attention of our colleagues the recent celebration of one of our  former colleague’s 90th birthday this past September 27.  Charlotte Thompson Reid, one of my predecessors who served in the House from January 1963–October 1971, has been known as  the ‘ ‘Grand Lady of Aurora, Illinois, ’ ’ the largest city in my congressional district. Charlotte  Reid has always been an inspiration to those  of us who have known her. Her sparkling personality and just plain Midwest-friendliness is  renown  throughout all of Chicagoland. Her  conscientious service in Congress overlapped  with  the beginning of my  teaching career  in  Yorkville,  Illinois and her outstanding record  helped inspire me to seek public office in the  late 1970’s. In fact, her daughter, Patricia, is  currently a State Representative in the Illinois  General Assembly.  While in Congress, Charlotte served on the  Appropriations,  Interior  and  Insular Affairs,  Public Works,  and Ethics Committees.  In  1971, she was appointed  to be a Commissioner on the FCC where she served with distinction until retiring in 1976. She was a member of  the President’s Task Force on  International Private Enterprise from 1983 to 1985,  and has been a member of the Hoover Institution’s Board of Overseers since 1984. She is  a resident today of Aurora.  One last anecdote. Not only was Charlotte  Reid herself elected  to Congress  five  times  with overwhelming margins, but her enthusiastic support and endorsement helped to elect  two future Congressmen—another of my predecessors Tom Corcoran in 1976 and her work  on my behalf helped elect me ten years later  in 1986, during my  first and  toughest campaign for Congress.  Mr. Speaker, we are all indebted to Charlotte Reid for her energy, her gentle manner  and her zest for life. On behalf of us all, I wish  her a belated, but happy 90th birthday and  many more to come. f  RECOGNIZING  DON WILSON  FOR  OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE  COMMUNITY  HON.

After  faithfully serving as President of Dallas North East  Chamber of Commerce  for  the  last  three  years, Don recently announced his retirement  to serve as Vice President of the Dallas National  Bank  for  the  Breckenridge Corner  Branch.  Since September 25, 2000, Don Wilson has  provided energetic leadership in promoting the  commercial, civic, cultural, educational, and industrial interests of the Northeast Dallas area.  Don’s dedication to the prosperity and health  of area businesses, neighborhoods, and residents is well known and admired by his fellow  Chamber members.  Under Don ’s leadership, membership in the  Dallas North East Chamber of Commerce increased by 38 percent while membership retention rose to 62 percent, well above the national average.  As an active President, Don Wilson oversaw  many new successful activities  including  the  Power-In-An-Hour monthly networking meeting, a new high-tech interactive Web site, the  Women’s Network, the Focus on Health Committee and the Healthier Northeast Dallas Initiative, a program modeled after President  Bush’s Healthier U.S. Initiative.  Don Wilson’s leadership and dedication will  be greatly missed by the community and businesses he served.  I  thank him  for his outstanding service and wish him the very best in  his future endeavors. f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASSASSINATIONS  OF  MAYOR  GEORGE  MOSCONE  AND  SUPERVISOR  HARVEY MILK  HON.

408,,108,-0.472,185,2003-12-08,Mr. FATTAH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  opposition  to  the conference agreement of  H.R. 1,  the Medicare and Prescription Drug  bill.  This conference agreement provides limited  benefit  to vulnerable  low  income senior citizens and people with disabilities. In fact, the  plan prohibits Medicaid from filling in the gaps  in the new Medicare drug benefit, as Medicaid  does now for other benefits. Given the ongoing state budget crises, up to 6.4 million lowincome seniors and people with disabilities  could receive less help with their prescription  drug costs than they do now.  The proposed plan bows  to drug  industry  pressure and prevents Medicare from negotiating better prices. It also adopts a policy that  will prevent access to lower-cost drugs available in other countries, allowing drug companies profits to skyrocket at the expense of patients. Millions of Medicare beneficiaries will  be  forced  to pay more  for Medicare  if  they  don’t give up their doctor and join an HMO. Although the bill’s proponents claim it will be limited, as many as 7 million seniors could be  forced to participate.  Finally, the conference agreement proposes  the  creation  of Health Security Accounts,  which are  tax shelters  for  the wealthy. This  creates an unprecedented  tax  loophole  that  would undermine existing employer coverage  and add to the ever-growing number of uninsured. These funds should be used to prevent  employers from dropping coverage or to improve the drug benefit.

The Lancaster Pee Wee AA hockey  team will now represent the entire East Coast  Region. If the Pee Wee AA’s win there, they  will be crowned North American champions.  The Silver Stick tournament was formed to  promote citizenship and international goodwill  through hockey. In that sense, it continues the  time-honored tradition of using sport to build  understanding and friendship across national  lines.  I am honored to congratulate the Lancaster  Firebird ’s Pee Wee AA coaches Dave Bauer,  Larry Collins and Jim Popp. And  the Team  Manager, Andy Lee.

411,,108,-0.266,192,2003-12-08,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I recently had  the privilege of meeting with John Strauss,  one of North Dakota’s distinguished World  War II veterans at the North Dakota Veterans  Home. John’s unit,  the 164th  Infantry Battalion, saw more than 600 days of fierce combat in the South Pacific. For his heroism, John  was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple  Heart.  I would like to include in the RECORDan article from the Ransom County Gazette in North  Dakota about John’s life and military service. [From the Ranson County Gazette]  NDVH RESIDENT, JOHNSTRAUSSTELLSOF  HISWORLDWARII EXPERIENCES  (By Janet Hansen)  John Strauss, a resident of the North Dakota Veterans Home (NDVH), Lisbon, was a  member of the U.S. Army’s 164th Infantry  Batallion which spent three years  in the  South Pacific during World War II. Strauss,  who recently celebrated his 90th birthday,  can still recall clearly the details of that  time in America’s history.  Strauss was born on September 5, 1913. He  was next to the youngest in a family of six  boys and two girls. He and his younger sister, Mary Bartholomay of Sheldon, are the  last two surviving siblings. He was raised on  a farm near Harvey, North Dakota and attended the Whitby School, a one-room country school located just a half mile from the  Strauss  farmstead. He  received his high  school education at Harvey High School,  from which he graduated in 1932.  Following his graduation from high school,  Strauss worked at various  farm and construction jobs. He spent some time working  in the Sheldon area on the Muscha and  Stansbury farms. He milked cows as well as  caring for a herd of Angus beef cattle. His  other jobs included working for a plumbing  and heating business, doing construction and  cement work, and spending ten months as a  maintenance man at the hospital in Harvey  In January of 1941 Strauss joined the National Guard.  ‘‘I was 27 years old when I  joined  the  guard,’’  commented  Strauss.  ‘‘Most of the guys signing up were only 18.  We organized our own company. Up to that  time, Harvey did not have a Guard unit of its  own, although there were several units in  surrounding towns. Since there was a need  for an anti-tank company, that is what our  unit became.’’  Shortly  after Harvey’s National Guard  unit was  organized.  its members were  shipped to Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, where  they underwent training  for ten months.  Then came  the attack on Pearl Harbor,  which pushed the United States into World  War II and the National Guard into active  duty.  ‘‘It wasn’t long after the attack on Pearl  Harbor that we were loaded on a troop train  for San Francisco. We expected to get sent  overseas immediately, but we were instead  sent up north to guard installations such as  roads and bridges which were thought to be  vulnerable to attack by the Japanese.  In March of 1942 Strauss and his fellow  guardsmen were loaded onto an old luxury  liner, the President Coolidge, for their long  trip to Melbourne, Australia. ‘‘The ship was  nice,’’ recalls Strauss. ‘‘It still had a swimming pool and a continental lounge with a  grand piano. I enjoyed sitting around listening to various soldiers playing boogie-woogie  music on that piano. But the ship was very  crowded! There were many other soldiers besides our battalion on board. I believe there  were about 5,000 of us in all. The ship had  two-room apartments with a bath between.  Each had been made to house a husband and  wife. The single compartments designed for  one person were each crammed with about a  dozen soldiers in bunk beds.’’  Strauss does not complain about the accommodations. He says he was happy with  two decent meals a day. He spent much of  his time on the deck of the large ship. ‘‘I  loved it on the water,’’ he said. ‘‘I didn’t get  seasick. I liked to stand on deck and watch  the waves roll by.’’  After a long ocean voyage, the ship finally  reached Melbourne. ‘‘We had to unload all  our gear and equipment from that ship onto  three small Dutch ships which were waitin  for us in the harbor.’’ said Strauss. ‘‘They  were old wooden vessels with crews from the  Indonesian island of Java. The crew members  were dirty and used to eating tired old mutton for meat. It didn’t look or smell fit to  eat, and tasted as bad as it looked, but I  managed to eat enough to get by.’’  The old Dutch ships took the soldiers to  New Caledonia, a French held island in the  South Pacific east of Australia. It was believed that that island might be one of the  next Japanese targets. The troops  immediately set about  fortifying the beach by  digging in gun enplacements. The soldiers  lived in tents. It was hot and humid during  the day but cooled off at night. The Japanese  attack which had been expected did not  come. Strauss  recalls hearing  that  some  troops encountered problems with the Communist French but it didn’t affect those with  whom he was encamped on the shoreline.’’  From New Caledonia, Strauss and his fellow soldiers were sent to Guadalcanal in the  Solomon Islands. ‘‘We only found out a day  in advance that we were to be sent there,’’  Strauss said.  ‘‘We arrived there just after  daylight. We had to unload our own ships  with small boats that ferried the cargo from  the large ship to shore. We had only a day in  which to complete the job because the ships  wanted to leave the harbor while it was still  daylight. There was too much danger from  Japanese air strikes to chance staying there  at night.’’  Strauss said that the first night at Guadalcanal was the most frightening time which  he experienced during his entire  tour of  duty. ‘‘We sat on the beach,’’ he said. ‘‘There  was a lot of confusion with people milling  around. There were air raids going on and we  were pretty scared because of the lack of  protection. In the evening they lined us up in  formation and told us to march. I did not  know where we were going. I just followed  the guy in front of me. Suddenly all hell  broke loose! There were Japanese ships in  the bay and they were attacking Guadalcanal. The attack from air and sea lasted  until morning. The area was all lit up by the  explosions. We got  initiated  fast! We  felt  completely helpless.’’ ‘‘The main target of  the attack was the airbase at Henderson  Field. The Japanese had originally built the  airstrips and the United States had taken  control of the base. The Japanese wanted it  back. Around 10,000 Japanese troops landed  on the island. They were on the opposite end  of the island from where we had landed. The  Japanese would come in swarms at night but  we were safer on our side of the island than  we would have been if we had landed on the  other side.’’  Strauss explained that his battalion’s first  objective was to entrench their 37 millimeter  guns along the beach. ‘‘We were sent in to  help the Marines at Guadalcanal,’’ he said.  ‘‘We served under General Vandegrift, Commander of the 1st Marine Division.  As a result of their service under the Marines at Guadalcanal, Strauss and his fellow  members of the 164th  infantry were each  awarded  the Presidential Unit  Citation,  which is given by the commander of the regiment. ‘‘To my knowledge we were the only  army outfit in the world to get a citation  from the Marines,’’ said Strauss.  Strauss states that his main job was to  guard the beach area. He manned a 37 millimeter gun entrenched in the sand. ‘‘I was  glad to stay there instead of going farther  onto the island,’’ he said. ‘‘We stayed there  for six months. There were a few small battles, but we were mostly mopping up.’’  ‘‘The Marines left in January and we followed in March,’’ said Strauss. He explains  that by the time they left Guadalcanal most  of the men in his outfit had dysentery and/or  malaria.  ‘‘Most of us were sent to the Fiji Islands  for some R & R (rest and relaxation) time,’’  related Strauss. Some members of his division enjoyed  their vacation, but Strauss  spent five months in the hospital because of  a tropical ulcer on his leg. The ulcer started  as a sand fly bite and became infected by his  boot rubbing on it. After two and a half  months with no results in the treatment of  of the ulcer, a doctor tried grafting some  skin over the ulcerated area. After that it finally began to heal and he was released from  the hospital.  ‘‘I was out of the hospital for one day,’’  said Strauss, ‘‘and I came down with malaria.’’  I  spent another  two and a half  months in the hospital recuperating.’’ By the  time Strauss got out of the hospital his company’s R & R time was over and it was time  to train once again.  ‘‘We were  in Fiji  for a  total of nine  months,’’ said Strauss. ‘‘From there we were  shipped to Bougainville  Island, where we  stayed for the next year. Again, we were sent  there to do some mopping up. We saw action,  but it was usually small attacks. However I  actually saw more action there than I had  previously.’’  Strauss explained that he served as sergeant of a flame thrower platoon. ‘‘I had 26  VerDate jul 14 2003  06:28 Dec 09, 2003 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A08DE8.063 E08PT1 ‘ ‘ ’ ’ ",2003
