0,Senate,109,0.068,6,2006-01-25,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  thank my distinguished colleague for  those comments.  There is no doubt about the suffering  of those who are afflicted with mesothelioma and asbestosis and other ailments. There is also no doubt about  the tremendous impact it has on the  economy of the United States. It has  been estimated that there could be a  bigger boost than any kind of tax cuts  you could have or any sort of economic  recovery program you could have to be  able to deal with the more than 75 companies that have gone into bankruptcy  and others where bankruptcy is threatened.  The amount of work that the Senator  from Vermont has specified has been  gigantic. It has been 3 years in process.  Senator HATCHtook the lead with the  trust fund concept where the manufacturers and the insurers have agreed to  put up some $140 billion into the trust  fund with no government payments  and not coming out of the pockets of  the taxpayers.  The meetings which have been held  and  the efforts and  the momentum  which we have had can’t be recaptured.  I think it is fair to say, certainly during my tenure here of 25 years, that I  have never seen legislation worked on  to the extent this legislation has been,  with the complexity of the problem and  the involvement of Senators and staff  and so-called stakeholders. If it is not  now, it is never.  ",2006

5,Senate,109,-0.383,48,2006-01-25,Mr. REED.," Mr. President, before I  comment on the nomination, I would  like to recognize and thank several  people who have been very helpful in  preparing my comments: Kara Stein,  Justin Florence, and Sharon Rapport.  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the RECORD  a series of letters from national organizations with respect to issues of church  and state separation and the nomination of Judge Alito.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  AMERICANSUNITEDFORSEPARATION  OFCHURCHANDSTATE,  Washington, DC, January 10, 2006.  Hon. ARLENSPECTER,  Chairman, Committee on  the Judiciary, U.S.  Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington,  DC.  Hon. PATRICKLEAHY,  Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,  U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.  AND RANKING  DEAR CHAIRMAN SPECTER MEMBERLEAHY: Americans United for Separation of Church and State urges you to oppose the confirmation of Judge Samuel A.  Alito, Jr. to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Americans  United for Separation of Church and State  represents more than 75,000 individual members and 9,500 clergy nationwide, as well as  cooperating houses of worship and other religious bodies committed to the preservation  of religious liberty. We oppose the confirmation of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court because his record demonstrates that he would  fundamentally alter First Amendment law  and immediately put at risk many of the  crucial protections for religious minorities  that the Supreme Court has recognized and  consistently enforced over the past sixty  years.  Legal scholars have understood the First  Amendment’s religion clauses as striking a  balance between the religious and political  rights of individuals and groups within our  society. There  is a necessary tension between the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause, which serves to balance  the sometimes competing interests of individuals’ freedom of conscience against the  requirement that the state be neutral with  respect  to  religious  viewpoints.  Justice  O’Connor has been successful  in ensuring  that public expression did not turn into government favoritism or state coercion of religious beliefs.  During his  fifteen year  tenure on  the  United States Court of Appeals for the Third  Circuit, however, Judge Alito has  shown  himself to have a view of the First Amendment,  particularly  of  the Establishment  Clause, that differs dramatically from both  Justice O’Connor’s judicial philosophy and  the settled understanding of fundamental Establishment Clause principles that has guided the Supreme Court’s decisions for at least  six decades. Indeed, early on, Judge Alito acknowledged his disagreement with the Supreme Court on its Establishment Clause jurisprudence. When applying for a position in  the Reagan Administration Department of  Justice, Judge Alito declared that his ‘‘deep  interest  in constitutional  law  [was] motivated in large part by disagreement with the  Warren Court decisions, particularly in areas  [such as] the Establishment Clause. . . .’’ As  evidenced by his longstanding appeals court  record, we remain concerned that such a motivation taints his view today.  There is much at stake for the future of religious liberty as a result of Justice O’Connor’s retirement and Judge Alito’s nomination to take her place on the Supreme Court.  As Justice O’Connor has recognized,  it  is  vital that our longstanding Establishment  Clause protections remain in place:  ‘‘At a time when we see around the world  the violent consequences of the assumption  of religious authority by government, Americans may count themselves fortunate: Our  regard for constitutional boundaries has protected us from similar travails, while allowing private religious exercise to flourish. . .  Those who would renegotiate the boundaries  between church and state must therefore answer a difficult question: Why would we  trade a system that has served us so well for  one  that has  served  others  so  poorly?’’  (McCreary County, Kentucky v. ACLU of  Kentucky, 125 S. Ct. 2722, 2746 (O’Connor, J.,  concurring)).  In the Establishment Clause area, replacing Justice O’Connor with Judge Alito likely  would have a profound effect on the religious  freedoms that our dual constitutional commitments to free exercise and separation of  church and state have long ensured. Both the  straightforward holdings and the underlying  tenor of Judge Alito’s decisions in Establishment Clause cases contrast sharply with Justice O’Connor’s views. Throughout her career  on the Court, Justice O’Connor has been  keenly attuned to the plight of religious minorities in society as a whole, and most especially  in  the public  schools. But Judge  Alito’s focus has been elsewhere: on religious  majorities’ ability to express their views  through governmental instrumentalities, at  government owned facilities, and in government-organized enterprises like the public  schools. Judge Alito has given broad license  to religious majorities to use the public  schools and other official settings to broadcast their religious messages without regard  for the competing rights and interests of religious minorities.  Because Judge Alito has not extended the  same protections to all Americans that he  has granted to politically powerful religious  majorities, the Senate should decline to confirm his appointment as an associate justice  of the U.S. Supreme Court.

6,Senate,109,-0.342,55,2006-01-25,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, I rise  this evening to discuss my vote on the  confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito,  Jr., to the U.S. Supreme Court. After  meeting with Judge Alito and studying  his record and comparing his answers  to my criteria for judicial nominees, I  have  decided  to  vote  against  confirming Judge Samuel Alito, Jr., as an  Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme  Court.  The next Justice will have the power  to change the Court, change the country, and change our rights for generations. Judge Alito has a very troubling  record. In his hearing and in our private meeting he did not show that he  will be an independent judge who will  uphold the rights and liberties of all  Americans. With our rights and freedoms on the line, I will not take a  chance on Judge Alito because I have  serious questions about his independence and his commitment to protecting  our rights and our liberties.  As with past nominees, I have evaluated this nominee based on my longstanding criteria, which ask:  Is the  nominee qualified, ethical, and honest?  Will the nominee be fair, evenhanded,  and independent? And will the nominee  uphold the rights and liberties of all  Americans?  Personally, I got involved in politics  because  of  another Supreme Court  nomination, that of Clarence Thomas.  At the time, I was frustrated that average Americans didn’t have a voice in  the process that affects them so much.  I have worked to be the voice of working families in my State, and I have  asked the questions they would ask. I  am voting to protect their interests.  I recognize the significance of a seat  on the U.S. Supreme Court. The Constitution directs Senators to provide  advice  and  consent  on  all  judicial  nominees, and the people of my home  State of Washington have trusted me  to be their advocate to safeguard their  rights as I vote on judicial nominees.  I take that responsibility very seriously. That  is why I have reviewed  Judge Alito’s past writings, studied his  answers to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and asked to meet with him in  my office.  A lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is a tremendous grant of  unchecked power. If the Supreme Court  rules incorrectly, there is no option for  appeal. There is no backstop. Any seat  on the Supreme Court can affect our  rights for generations. But there are  three  factors  involved  in  this  particular nomination that make it even  more significant. Those factors are the  times, the seat, and the process.  First, I am well aware that we are  living in historic times. Each day, it  seems that the rights of the individuals  and the power of government are being  tested. We are at war overseas, we face  threats from terrorism here at home,  and the current administration is pushing the bounds of governmental power  in remarkable ways.  The Bush  administration  has  arrested U.S.  citizens and held  them  without access to the courts. It has run  secret prisons around the world. It has  expressed views on torture that put our  own troops at risk. As we recently  learned, the administration has been  spying on American citizens without  prior approval from a court. These are  grave issues which will likely come before  the Supreme Court. How  that  Court rules will affect the rights of our  citizens, the balance of power between  the branches of our Government, and  the balance of power between our citizens and Government.  So as I make my decision on this  nominee, I am very mindful of the historic times we are living in and the serious questions  this Supreme Court  will address in the coming years.  Secondly, I am very mindful of the  seat that is open on the Supreme Court  and  its  significance. Justice Sandra  Day O’Connor was a pioneer in the field  of law, and her decisions will shape the  lives of the American people for generations to come.  As I said when she announced her resignation, we live in a better America  due to her 24 years of service on the  Court. Justice O’Connor was often a  swing vote on those critical decisions.  Her successor could easily change the  balance of power on the Court, which  could dramatically shift the Court’s  ruling on so many issues. Because this  is a  swing  seat  that could  tip  the  Court’s balance of power, we need to  make sure that the person we confirm  is someone who will protect our rights  and liberties.  Some have suggested that I should  just go along and support the President’s nominee. That is not the way I  make decisions. I have criteria that I  use to evaluate all judicial nominees,  and Judge Alito is no different.  Third, I am also well aware of how  Judge Alito came to be the President’s  nominee. The President, as we all remember, had nominated his counsel,  Harriet Miers, to the High Court, but  Ms. Miers was not acceptable to the  rightwing of the President’s party. I  found it very interesting that before  her nomination, Republicans were demanding an up-or-down vote on the  Senate floor for anyone the President  nominated. But when President Bush  nominated Ms. Miers,  suddenly we  stopped hearing that urgent call for an  up-or-down vote. In  fact, Ms. Miers’  nomination was killed by the President’s own party, apparently because  she did not meet the ideological test of  the extreme right.  I recount this history tonight not to  diminish Judge Alito but to point out  that his nomination comes before the  Senate in the context of an ideological  battle that has been created by the  rightwing. When the President nominated  Judge  Alito,  the  rightwing  cheered, confident that he would vote  their way. That  reaction gives me  pause as to whether this nominee can  keep an open mind on the issues that  come before him. If the rightwing is so  confident that he is going to vote their  way, how can all of us be confident  that he will put our country’s needs  first? That alone does not suggest that  Judge Alito cannot be fair, but it did  lead me to explore those questions diligently.  Given the importance of the Supreme  Court and the background of the times  and the seat and the process, I began to  evaluate how Judge Alito measured up  to my standards for judicial nominees.  Judge Alito’s record contains some disturbing statements, rulings, and pronouncements that require detailed explanations. Does he still hold some of  those views? In many cases, we don’t  know.  I wish Judge Alito had been  more forthcoming during his hearing.  At the same time, many of the things  he said and refused to say spoke volumes.  As I noted earlier, my standards are  simple: Is the nominee qualified, ethical, and honest? Will the nominee be  fair and evenhanded and independent?  And will the nominee uphold the rights  and liberties of all Americans?  I am very comfortable that Judge  Alito is qualified, he is honest, and he  is ethical. But whether he will be fair  and evenhanded  is another question.  And, as was discussed at his hearing, he  does have a troubling record for fighting for the government and corporations and against individuals. He seems  to favor the entrenched power over the  little guy. His record does not give me  the  confidence  that  everyone who  comes before the Court will be treated  fairly.  I am also deeply concerned about  Judge Alito’s independence. We rely on  our courts as a critical check and balance against government abuse. That  independent check helps to protect our  rights. This  is especially  important  today because of the growing questions  of the expansion of Executive power.  The Supreme Court will need  to  evaluate whether recent Executive actions are constitutional. Here Judge  Alito’s unbalanced minority view of  the scope of Executive power tells me  he does not have the independence to  be an adequate check on the Government’s abuse of our rights.  Finally, I have serious doubts that  Judge Alito will uphold our rights and  liberties. One example is his hostility  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:00 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S25JA6.REC S25JA6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006
7,Senate,109,0.548,62,2006-01-25,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached editorial by the Arizona Republic, dated  January 24, be printed in the RECORDof  this debate on  the  confirmation of  Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court. The editors’ support for  Judge Alito  is welcome,  and  their  statement that ‘‘Judge Alito is a superior candidate for the high court regardless of his political leanings’’ is absolutely true.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Arizona Republic, Jan. 24, 2006]  ALITO: WISEINTHEWAYSOF‘‘WHYS’’  If America is not on pins and needles over  today’s Senate Judiciary Committee vote on  Samuel Alito for the U.S. Supreme Court,  perhaps this Web site headline on Monday  helps provide an explanation:  ‘‘Feingold unsure of Alito’’—WSAW–TV,  Wausau, Wis.  If one of the Senate’s most solidly liberal  members, Sen. Russ Feingold, D–Wis., remains  uncertain  about President Bush’s  nominee one day prior to his scheduled Judiciary vote, prospects for derailing the nomination in the full Senate would seem dim.  We’ll see how the votes pan out. Still, it is  worth wondering: Where did the drama go?  The most obvious answer among many is  that Alito is a superior candidate for the  high  court  regardless  of  his  political  leanings. After 15 years on the bench, Alito  has established a lengthy track record as a  fair jurist who has struck a proper balance  between his own constitutional interpretations and those of other courts.  Even his obvious discomfort at the beginning of his Judiciary hearings worked to  Alito’s favor. The candidate is bookish and  uncomfortable in the limelight? All the better for a position on the nation’s most deliberative, most cerebral panel.  Many commentators have noted that the  even-keeled Alito presents himself far differently from Robert Bork, the famously rejected conservative nominee of 1987.  Well, yes. Alito was not combative in the  face of relentless grilling, as Bork was. And  he wears no wicked-looking beard.  But it would seem that Alito’s imminent  success is less a matter of televised theatrics, facial adornment or even judicial philosophy than it is a reflection of the public’s  expectations of a jurist.  Unquestionably, the public wants jurists to  be fair, and it seems to believe that Alito  will  live up to that standard. The public  wants a jurist who respects the judgment of  other courts, but it also wants one who understands that Job 1 is to interpret the Constitution.  Sometimes, Supreme Court  judges have  found those two directives in conflict. The  public, and most of the senators who represent it, seems to believe Alito will find his  way through those conflicts fairly and intelligently.  But most of all, Alito appears to have won  over converts because he has demonstrated  the trait that increasingly seems to distinguish great  jurists  from mediocre-to-good  ones: He can explain why.  We all wish to know why. With all due respect to President Bush’s previous nominee,  Harriet Miers, it was not enough that—wink,  wink—her vote on the ‘‘right’’ issues was ensured.  Indeed,  that constituted  the most  damning argument against her.  Alito, by contrast, has won support because senators believe that his decisions will  be grounded and argued in the facts of the  law, not in some predisposed political prejudice that is unsupported by the case before  him.  And that is a powerful argument for Alito  all by itself.  ",2006
8,Senate,109,0.342,76,2006-01-25,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor an heroic American  who has fallen while serving his country in Operation Enduring Freedom in  Afghanistan. First  Sergeant Tobias  Meister died December 28, 2005, when a  bomb was detonated near his humvee  just south of Asadabad, Afghanistan.  First Sergeant Meister was part of the  Sand Springs based 486th Civil Affairs  Battalion  and was  assigned  to  the  Army Reserve’s 321st Civil Affairs Brigade based in San Antonio, TX. My  deepest sympathies go out to his wife  Alicia, his 1 year old son Will, his parents David and Judy, his brother and  many more family and friends.  First Sergeant Meister was born in  Kingsley,  IA  and  graduated  from  Remsen-Union High School in 1994. He  was employed by Horizon Natural Resources, an oil and gas firm, after he  had successfully completed a business  administration  degree with  a  concentration  in  international  business  from the University of Texas at San  Antonio.  Tobias Meister joined the Iowa National Guard in 1992 and served as an  infantryman before transferring to the  U.S. Army Reserve  in 1998. He was  named Drill Sergeant of the Year in  2002, the award for the Nation’s top  Army Reserve drill sergeant. He will be  remembered for his patriotism, his love  for his country and his fellow soldiers.  As written by comrades on his website,  he had ‘‘so much passion for what he  was doing, so much patriotism it was a  privilege and an honor to work with  him.’’ I urge all of my colleagues here  and all Americans to extend their prayers to the  family of a truly heroic  American, First Sergeant Tobias Meister.

9,Senate,109,-0.25,76,2006-01-25,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I rise  today to pay tribute to Roland Carroll  Barvels who died in Iraq on January 18,  2006.  Roland  was  employed  with  DynCorp  International  and was  assigned to the Civilian Police Advisory  Training Team in Iraq. He was helping  to train and equip a 350,000-member  Iraqi  security  force. Sadly, he was  killed when a roadside bomb struck his  convoy near Basra.  Prior to joining DynCorp in November 2005, Barvels answered his Nation’s  call to duty to protect and defend this  great  country. After  serving  for  12  years in the military, he became a police officer. Beginning his career  in  Minnesota, Barvels eventually served  in law enforcement for nearly 20 years  including his most recent position with  the Aberdeen Police Department.  Friends and former co-workers at the  Aberdeen Police Department remember  Roland with deep admiration. One colleague remarked, ‘‘During his time at  the police department, he diligently  patrolled the streets of our city providing safety and security to the citizens in our community. Roland possessed an incredible ability to talk to  people and [to] make anyone he talked  to feel at ease.’’  Roland Barvels bravely served our  country in so many ways. His wife and  children are in the thoughts and prayers of my family during this difficult  time. It is my sincere hope that they  will take comfort knowing Ronald’s  long and distinguished career of protecting those most in need is truly admirable, and his dedication to helping  others is an inspiration to us all.  I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the  family and friends of Roland Barvels.  He will be missed, but his service to  our Nation will never be forgotten.

10,Senate,109,-0.158,76,2006-01-25,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today with a heavy heart and deep  sense of gratitude to honor the life of a  brave young man from Lafayette. Matthew Frantz, 23 years old, died on January 20 when an improvised explosive  device detonated near his vehicle during a patrol near Al Huwijah in Iraq.  With his entire life before him, Matthew risked everything to fight for the  values Americans hold close  to our  hearts, in a land halfway around the  world.  Following in the family tradition of  service, Matthew had been committed  to joining the military since he was in  the second grade. A 2001 graduate of  Lafayette Jefferson High School, his  teachers recalled how eager he was to  join the service, as well as what a decent and friendly student he was. One  of his teachers told a local news outlet,  ‘‘Matt was very excited about being  part of the military. It was what he  wanted to do. He was just a young man  that wanted  to  serve his country.’’  Matthew had been in the military for  nearly 2 years, but this was his first deployment to Iraq. He arrived there only  4 months ago as a counterintelligence  specialist.  Matthew was killed while serving his  country  in Operation Iraqi Freedom.  He was a member of the 1st Special  Troops Battalion in the 101st Airborne  Division based at Fort Campbell, KT.  This brave young soldier leaves behind  his  father  and mother, James  and  Marilyn Frantz; his brothers, Chris and  Eric, who also serve in the military;  and his fiance, Amalia Cerbin.  Today, I join Matthew’s family and  friends in mourning his death. While  we struggle to bear our sorrow over  this loss, we can also take pride in the  example he  set, bravely  fighting  to  make the world a safer place. It is his  courage and strength of character that  people will remember when they think  of Matthew, a memory that will burn  brightly during these continuing days  of conflict and grief.  Matthew was known for his dedication to his family and his love of country. Today and always, Matthew will  be  remembered by  family members,  friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true  American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving  his country.  As I search for words to do justice in  honoring Matthew’s sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln’s remarks  as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ‘‘We cannot  dedicate, we  cannot  consecrate, we  cannot hallow this ground. The brave  men, living and dead, who struggled  here, have consecrated it, far above our  poor power  to add or detract. The  world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never  forget what they did here.’’ This statement is just as true today as it was  nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain  that the impact of Matthew’s actions  will live on far longer that any record  of these words.  It is my sad duty to enter the name  of Matthew C. Frantz in the official  record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound  commitment to  freedom, democracy,  and peace. When I think about this just  cause in which we are engaged and the  unfortunate pain that comes with the  loss of our heroes, I hope that families  like Matthew’s can find comfort in the  words of the prophet Isaiah who said,  ‘‘He will swallow up death in victory;  and the Lord God will wipe away tears  from off all faces.’’  May God grant strength and peace to  those who mourn, and may God be with  all of you, as I know He is with Matthew.

The Cathedral Choir School of Delaware has been chosen to perform on  January 25, 2006, for an audience at the  White House that will  include First  Lady Laura Bush. They will also be  presented with the Coming Up Taller  Award. This award  is  the Nation’s  highest honor for afterschool and out-  of-school programs that use arts and  humanities to enrich the lives of children. Created in 1998, this awards program is a project of the President’s  Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in partnership with Institute  of Museum and Library Services, the  National Endowment for the Arts and  the National Endowment for the Humanities.  Cathedral Choir School has had an  enormous positive impact on the lives  of the students who pass through its  halls. The more than 50 students, ranging in age from 7 to 17, who attend the  school are encouraged to learn the enduring values of discipline, responsibility, leadership and teamwork.  With more than 800 alumni since its  inception in 1883, the Cathedral choir  school has had a positive impact on  both the lives of the students who have  had the privilege of participating  in  this choir school and the lives of those  around them. By training Delaware’s  young people in life skills and community involvement, the Cathedral Choir  School has consistently enhanced the  lives of all that it touches.  I would like to acknowledge the hard  work and dedication that the paid staff  and volunteers of the Cathedral Choir  School have demonstrated over  the  years. Under the direction today of Dr.  Darryl Roland,  these dedicated men  and women have helped the lives of  countless children. During his time of  overseeing the Cathedral Choir School,  Dr. Roland has served as a shining example of what is possible when good  and caring adults decide to make a  positive difference in the lives of children.  I would especially like to acknowledge the commitment and enthusiasm  that the  individual members of the  choir have shown during their time  with  the  choir. These  outstanding  young people have made a personal  commitment  to  themselves  and  to  their communities to challenge themselves and try their best to live up to  the high standards of the Cathedral  Choir School. The rehearsals and afterschool music training are done with a  sense of love for artistic expression. It  takes a special type of person to share  that gift with the rest of us.  The faculty and students of the Cathedral Choir School are to be commended and applauded  for their extraordinary efforts. Their dedication  and love of music continues to serve as  an example of what is possible when  young people are given the opportunity  to follow their dreams. All of Delaware  is proud of them.∑  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF MAURICE  GUERRY  ∑",2006
13,Senate,109,0.509,83,2006-01-25,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, this past  December  Idaho unexpectedly  lost a  generous and gracious man who will be  missed terribly by all who had the  pleasure of experiencing his welcoming  spirit and warm heart.  Maurice was a sheep rancher from  Three Creek, ID, who was known for  his ready smile, charm and unequivocal  love for his wife, family and the land  on which he made his livelihood. I had  the distinct privilege of working with  him a number of times on collaborative  land management endeavors and remember well that he made an extraordinary effort to get those who thought  themselves at odds to  find common  ground and work together. He saw the  wisdom and value of this approach and  was respected for it.  With his sheep dog keeping a sharp  eye from the back of his truck, Maurice diligently cared for his land and  was known to carry candy with him to  share in case he met someone on one of  the remote roads near his ranch. He  and his wife, Marlene, would put together a dinner party for dozens at the  drop of a hat, welcoming  strangers  with open arms. He was  especially  close to his fellow Basque friends.  Maurice had a soul of generosity,  gentleness, and wisdom and knew the  value of hard, honest work. This legacy  is his gift and it lives on in his family  and friends. My prayers are with them  during this difficult time.∑  TRIBUTE TO DOUGLAS W. BOOK  ∑",2006

15,Senate,109,-0.266,97,2006-01-25,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  am pleased to join with Senators LAUTENBERG, SNOWE, SCHUMER, COLEMAN  and many others to introduce legislation to reimburse States for prescription drug expenses they have incurred  for their residents who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. States  have had no other option but to step in  and ensure seniors can still get their  drugs because the implementation of  the new Medicare drug benefit has been  so poorly handled by the Bush administration.  The  faulty  implementation of  the  new drug benefit has caused a major  health  emergency  in California and  States across the country, particularly  for seniors with chronic and debilitating diseases who rely on multiple  medications every day to keep them  alive.  It  is  incomprehensible to me that  with all the money and time given to  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services, CMS, to implement this new  drug benefit, stories emerge every day  of  seniors  and  disabled  individuals  being hospitalized because  they are  being told they have to pay hundreds of  dollars  for  their medications which  they cannot afford and thus don’t take.  Because of  severe glitches  in  the  database run by CMS, these individuals  are leaving pharmacies without their  medications or are making undue sacrifices to pay for costs they should not  have incurred in the first place.  So far, more than 24 States and the  District of Columbia have stepped in to  say they will cover the cost of prescription drugs for their residents who are  dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and who cannot access lifesaving  and life sustaining drugs as a result of  Federal incompetence.  Earlier this week, the Governor of  California and California’s State legislative  leaders announced a plan  to  make $150 million available for 30 days  to cover drug costs for dual eligible individuals who have fallen through the  system. In California, these individuals  account for more than 1 million of the  State’s 4 million total Medicare recipients.  Problems with the Bush administration’s implementation of the drug benefit have cost California $5.5 million to  fill 63,000 prescriptions, as of January  18. I have no doubt these costs are just  the beginning.  Unless these significant implementation errors are fixed immediately, the  new drug benefit amounts to a massive  unfunded mandate. The Bush administration must reimburse States, in full,  for the drug costs they have absorbed  as a result of major implementation errors that occurred on their watch.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  today  with  Senators  SNOWE, SCHUMERand COLEMANwill ensure that States are repaid in full by  the Federal Government for all costs  associated with prescription drugs for  dual eligible  individuals. The States  did not create the crisis felt by our Nation’s poorest and most vulnerable seniors and disabled and the States should  not be responsible for costs associated  with a Federal program that was intended  to provide  these  individuals  with comprehensive prescription drug  coverage at little or no cost.  It  is  simply unacceptable  for  the  Bush administration to tell States and  the Congress not to worry because the  private health insurance plans will reimburse States for the costs they’ve incurred. States should not be made to  wait to be reimbursed because of implementation foul-ups caused by CMS.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.∑  LAUTENBERG,  By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. REID, Mrs. MURRAY,  Mr. BINGAMAN, Mrs. LINCOLN,  Mr. KENNEDY, Mrs. CLINTON,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:00 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00097 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S25JA6.REC S25JA6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006
16,Senate,109,-0.443,104,2006-01-25,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, what  is past is prologue. Today, we see history repeating itself. In 1978, President  Carter signed into law the ‘‘Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,’’ successfully concluding years of debate on the  power of the President to conduct national security wiretapping.  As a result of lengthy hearings and  consultation, Congress  enacted  that  law with broad bipartisan support. Its  purpose was clear—to put a check on  the power of the President to use wiretaps in the name of national security.  One of the clear purposes of that law  was to require the government to obtain a  judicial warrant  for all electronic  surveillance  in  the  United  States  in which  communications of  U.S. citizens might be intercepted. The  Act established a secret court, the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court,  to review wiretapping applications and  guarantee that any such electronic surveillance  followed  the  rule  of  law.  Since 1979, the special court has approved nearly 19,000 applications and  denied only 4. Last year, the Administration reached an all-time-high with  the number of applications granted.  In the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Congress established the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance could be conducted  in the  United States  for national  security  purposes. One of the principal goals of  the legislation was to ensure that information obtained from illegal wiretaps could not be used to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. We even made sure  that there would be criminal penalties  for anyone who failed to comply with  these rules.  The PATRIOT Act did not give the  President the authority to spy on anyone without impartial judicial review—  and neither did the Joint Resolution,  enacted in 2001, authorizing the use of  force against those responsible for the  attacks of September 11th.  The President seemed to agree. In  2004, in Buffalo he stated categorically  that  ‘‘any  time  that you hear  the  United States talking about a wiretap,  it requires a court order.’’ He said that  ‘‘Nothing  had  changed—when we’re  talking about chasing down terrorists,  we’re talking about getting a court  order before we do so.’’  Now, however, the President and the  administration claim they do not have  to comply with the law. Just yesterday, the administration again asserted  its constitutional authority to eavesdrop on any person within the United  States—without judicial or legislative  oversight and it claims that the Congress implicitly granted such power in  the Joint Resolution of 2001.  But that Joint Resolution says nothing about domestic electronic surveillance. As Justice O’Connor has said, ‘‘A  state of war is not a blank check for  the president when  it comes to the  rights of the nation’s citizens.’’  The bipartisan 9/11 Commission made  clear that the Executive Branch has  the burden of proof to justify why a  particular governmental power should  be retained—and Congress has the responsibility to see that adequate guidelines and oversight are made available.  The Executive Branch has failed to  meet the 9/11 Commissioners’ burden of  proof. The American people are not  convinced  that  these  surveillance  methods achieve the right balance between our national security and protection of our civil liberties.  These issues go to the heart of what  it means to have a  free society.  If  President Bush can make his own rules  for domestic surveillance, Big Brother  has run amok. If the President believes  that winning the war on terror requires  new surveillance capabilities, he has a  responsibility to work with Congress to  make appropriate changes in existing  law. He is not above the law.  Congress and the American people  deserve full and honest answers about  the Administration’s  domestic  electronic surveillance activities. On December 22, 2005, I asked the President  to provide us with answers before the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  began  hearings on Judge Alito’s nomination  to the Supreme Court. We got no response. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin separate  hearings on February 6 on the President’s actions. Instead of providing us  with the documents the Administration relied upon, the Justice Department continues to circulate summaries  and  ‘‘white papers’’ on the legal authorities it purports to have to ignore  the law. It now appears that the President did so on at least thirty occasions  after September 11. There is no legitimate purpose  in denying access by  Members of Congress to all of the legal  thought and analysis that the President relied upon when he authorized  these activities.  Every 45 days, the President ordered  these activities to be reviewed by the  Attorney General,  the White House  Counsel and the Inspector General of  the National Security Agency. That’s  not good enough. These are all executive branch appointees who report directly to the President.  Congress spent seven years considering and enacting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It was not a  hastily conceived idea. We had broad  agreement  that  both  Congressional  oversight and judicial oversight were  fundamental—even during emergencies  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:00 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00104 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S25JA6.REC S25JA6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006
17,House,109,-0.658,6,2006-01-31,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself as much time as I may consume.  Today we mourn the loss of a dignified and peaceful woman who showed  us by example how to pursue change in  the world, despite the costs of that  struggle.  My friends in the Congress, I have  known Coretta King since I went south  during the civil rights movement as a  lawyer. She was a vibrant, consistent,  totally dedicated partner with her husband. She helped him stay strong, especially in the beginning when there were  so many threats and challenges to the  revolutionary idea that we would start  a civil rights movement in the South  itself. Many people tried to dissuade  Martin from that course. As a child of  the segregated South, she agreed that  the movement should begin at the seat  of Jim Crow.  When faced with the loss of her husband, Coretta remained able to advance  their vision of a free and equal America. She continued her husband’s legacy by devoting her life to advancing  racial and economic justice and for the  rights of women, children, the poor,  and the homeless. She also fought for  employment, education and health care  opportunities  for all. Most notably,  this woman  stood  for  equality and  peace, the very virtues to which her  husband had dedicated his life.  It was with Coretta’s approval that 4  days after Martin’s assassination on  April 4, 1968, that I introduced a bill to  name a holiday in his honor. Coretta  was at the heart of this effort, as well  as were many others to continue the  life and work of King. In 1969, I joined  Coretta at the King Center in Atlanta  to kick off the campaign for a national  holiday. She orchestrated a national  grassroots movement that urged passage of this legislation and would come  to Congress in 1979 and 1980 and 1981  and 1982 and 1983 to testify before the  Congress and urge support of the King  holiday. It was with her diligence and  perseverance that that holiday bill was  passed in 1983 and first observed in 1986.  Today, upon the passing of Mrs. King,  we will pledge to continue the King  legacy as she has for the past 37 years.  As  the  life and work of  the Kings  touched millions during their lifetime  in this country and around the world,  we here in Congress must ensure that  their lives continue to impact millions  more in the coming years, and that is  why I am so proud to join the rest of us  in supporting and urging passage of the  King resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I would now yield to the  gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr.  WATT), the distinguished chairman of  the Congressional Black Caucus.  ",2006
18,House,109,-0.526,6,2006-01-31,Mr. WATT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in  support of the resolution honoring the  life and memory of Mrs. Coretta Scott  King and would like to pull up some information  from the resolution  itself  that other people may not focus on because we are  tempted  sometime  to  think  of Mrs. King  as  simply  the  spouse, the wife of Dr. Martin Luther  King, and I think it would be a grave,  grave mistake for people to do that.  So I first point to the part of the resolution that says, Whereas Mrs. King  received honorary doctorates from over  60 colleges and universities and authored three books. That  in and of  itself is something that, aside from her  commitment to the civil rights movement and her companionship and partnership with Dr. Martin Luther King,  would in and of itself be deserving of  particular note.  Second, I pull up the fact that, as has  been pointed out by my colleague, Representative JOHNLEWIS, Coretta Scott  came of age in the segregated South  and  took an active  interest  in  the  emerging civil rights movement. This  coming of age in the segregated South  is something that I think we should  not allow to go unnoticed because either, in many ways like slavery or the  movement itself, either segregation or  slavery  tramped down people or  it  made them stand up and raise their  shoulders and raise their sights. And  when you find somebody like a John  Lewis and a Coretta Scott King who  fall into the latter category, it is important to take note of that fact.  So then I go to the first paragraph of  the resolution, and when I first read  the resolution, I kind of pushed back  from the  first paragraph because  it  says Whereas Coretta Scott King was  an inspirational figure and a woman of  great strength, grace and dignity,  I  think most of us focus primarily, if we  knew Coretta Scott King, on the grace  and dignity part of that, and had I kind  of an off the top of the head reaction  would be I would put grace first and I  would put dignity second and then I  would put the word  ‘‘strength.’’ But  when you note that she grew up in the  segregated South, it is really appropriate the way this has been drafted to  put the strength part of that three-part  prong equation first.  b1630  I think it is something that says here  is a woman that is strong and willing  to fight and yet still has grace and dignity.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would just  like to read, on behalf of the members  of the Congressional Black Caucus, the  press release and make a final point. It  says: ‘‘The Congressional Black Caucus  released the following statement: ‘The  Congressional Black Caucus extends its  sincere condolences to the family of  Coretta Scott King, the First Lady of  the Civil Rights Movement. Mrs. King,  who became a symbol of strength and  resolve during the life of Dr. Martin  Luther King, after his death was an inspiration to millions of people around  the world who  sought  justice  and  equality. She has remained the carrier  of the  freedom  flame  for almost 38  years since Dr. King’s death.’’’  And then the following paragraph is  what I want to focus on. It says: ‘‘‘Mrs.  King’s death marks the end of an era,  but certainly not the end of the continued struggle that she was such an integral part of and that African Americans face daily for equity and parity in  education, health care, and employment security.’’’  I do not think we should lose sight of  that last part because the struggle goes  on and we would honor Coretta Scott  King’s memory by keeping that struggle alive until we reach full equality.  As we approach the State of the Union  address tonight, let us not miss the  point that this lady fought and lived  and died for the struggle for equality.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",2006
19,House,109,-0.379,6,2006-01-31,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my friend for yielding me the time.  And  I thank the chairman and the  ranking member for bringing this resolution to the floor.  I was honored to stand many a time  on the west wing of the Capitol of the  United States as Mr. CONYERS led the  effort to ensure that America recognized the extraordinary contributions  of one of America’s greatest sons, Martin Luther King, Jr., and that we set a  day aside to recognize not only his contributions but to recommit ourselves  to the objectives that he lived for and  died for. And I want to congratulate  and thank him for the  contributions that he has made to live  out that commitment of Dr. King’s.  Our Nation has  lost a  true hero.  Coretta Scott King was one of the most  eloquent and determined civil rights  activists in our history, both as a partner to her husband, Dr. King, in the  fight for equality and justice in the  United States and as a keeper of his  legacy after his assassination in Memphis on April 4.  Mrs. King’s grace, of which Mr. WATT  spoke  and  of which  the  resolution  speaks, was experienced by all who met  her. Her tenacity ensured that the civil  rights movement that she helped to  pioneer has continued to stay in the  Mr. CONYERS VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:15 Feb 01, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K31JA7.015 H31JAPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

21,Senate,109,0.549,27,2006-01-31,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. President,  I  thought the leaders agreed not to ask  for additional time. Otherwise, I would  not have an objection. I don’t know  what Senators Reid and Frist  said.  They have  the  time  set  for an  11  o’clock vote. So I am inclined to object  unless——  ",2006
22,Senate,109,-0.362,27,2006-01-31,Mr. DURBIN.," I renew the request. At  the risk of being smitten, I think we  can afford 4 more minutes on a Supreme Court nominee.  ",2006
23,Senate,109,0.003,34,2006-01-31,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, President Bush has nominated Judge Samuel Alito to replace Justice Sandra Day  O’Connor on the Supreme Court. Justice O’Connor has had a remarkable career of public service. Her strong and  moderate voice on the Supreme Court  will be missed. I was lucky to get to socialize with  her  and  her  husband  through mutual acquaintances and recommend her book about growing up on  a ranch in arid Arizona—The Lazy B.  She is an exceptional person.  As is the custom, Judge Alito sought  a meeting with any Senator so interested. For our meeting, I suggested the  Capitol steps and he agreed since it was  a warm sunny day. I thought it was appropriate to be visually connected to  two of the three branches of government as we talked about constitutional  issues. If confirmed, the decisions he  will make on the Supreme Court will  affect  the  lives  of Americans  profoundly.  Judge Alito has outstanding  legal  credentials and an inspiring life story.  However, I am greatly concerned about  his philosophy on some important constitutional issues. In particular, I carefully examined his record on executive  power, women’s reproductive freedoms  and the commerce clause of article 1,  section VIII of the Constitution.  On executive power, it is likely that  cases dealing with the fourth amendment will be heard by the Supreme  Court. The fourth amendment reads:  The right of the people to be secure in  their persons, houses, papers, and effects,  against unreasonable searches and seizures,  shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall  issue, but upon probable cause, supported by  Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the  persons or things to be seized.  To me this language is very clear  that a warrant is required for a search.  That premise is now being questioned  regarding warrantless wiretaps.  At the Judiciary Committee hearings, Judge Alito was asked a question  on executive powers and warrantless  wiretapping. He said he would have to  determine  ‘‘whether  the President’s  power,  inherent powers,  the powers  given to the President under article 2  are sufficient, even taking away congressional  authorization,  the  area  where  the President  is asserting a  power to do something in the face of  explicit congressional determination to  the contrary’’.  The only power  in article  2  that  Judge Alito could be referring to would  be:  The President shall be Commander in Chief  of  the Army  and Navy  of  the United  States. . . .  Judge Alito was also asked ‘‘. . . is it  possible under your construct that an  inherent Constitutional power of the  President could, under some analysis  or some case, override what people believe to be a Constitutional criminal  statue?’’ Judge Alito responded that  this was possible, noting a ‘‘possibility  that that might be justified’’.  How far do we want Commander in  Chief stretched? As Justice O’Connor  wrote in a recent case, ‘‘a state of war  is not a blank check for the President  when it comes to the rights of the Nation’s citizens’’.  On the issue of Roe v. Wade as with  other issues, I am less interested in  what Judge Alito wrote or said as a  lawyer for his client the Reagan Administration, than how he has ruled as  a  judge and how he testified at his  nomination hearing. As an appellate  court judge, Judge Alito was the lone  dissenter on Planned Parenthood v.  Casey,  a  court  case  reviewing  the  Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act.  The Supreme Court wrote on this  landmark affirmation of Roe v. Wade:  These matters,  involving the most  intimate and personal choices a person may  make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to  the  liberty protected by  the Fourteenth  Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the  right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the  mystery of human life. Beliefs about these  matters could not define the attributes of  personhood were they formed under compulsion of the state.  The  five majority  Justices, who  wrote that, were all Republican appointees: two Reagan appointees, one  each of Bush ‘‘41’’, Ford and Nixon.  An important standard of law is the  concept of stare decisis—it stands decided. At the hearing Chairman SPECTER asked Judge Alito to discuss his  view of stare decisis. He responded:  It’s not an inexorable command, but it is a  general presumption that courts are going to  follow prior precedents’’.  In the Supreme  Court dissent on Casey, the justices who arguably wanted  to overturn Roe v. Wade  wrote ‘‘stare decisis is not . . . a universal  inexorable command.  Not only did Judge Alito  rule  in  favor of  the Pennsylvania Abortion  Control Act as a lower court judge, he  used the same language as the high  court dissenters at his Supreme Court  nomination hearing. Stare decisis  is  not an inexorable command.  Additionally, at his nomination hearing Judge Roberts was willing to call  Roe v. Wade ‘‘settled law’’ but Judge  Alito refused to make a similar statement.  The last point I would like to make  concerning constitutional law is on the  commerce clause. As you know the  Constitution creates a Government of  limited  power—Congress  can  only  enact legislation in areas that are specifically set out under the Constitution. Congress is expressly prohibited  from  enacting  legislation  in  other  areas,  leaving this authority to the  States per the tenth amendment:  The powers not delegated to the United  States by the Constitution . . . are reserved  to the States respectively, or to the people.  Every law enacted by Congress must  be based on one of the powers enumerated in the Constitution. The Framers  of  the  Constitution  gave  Congress  broad power to regulate immigration,  national security and economic activity between the states, and left most  other power with the States.  However, section VIII of article 1  states that  ‘‘the Congress shall have  the power to regulate Commerce . . .  among the several states’’. This is the  commerce clause and it is the most  powerful provision in the Constitution  providing Congress the authority to  enact legislation in a host of areas—including environmental protection. A  key Supreme Court case regarding the  commerce clause was in 1942 when the  Supreme Court upheld legislation that  allowed USDA to set quotas on local  wheat growing. The Court noted that  while crops regulated may never actually enter  into  interstate commerce,  such local activity, coupled with similar activity in other States as an aggregate has a direct impact on interstate commerce. Since then using the  ‘‘aggregate effects test’’ or  ‘‘substantial effects test’’ Congress has passed  broad ranging environmental  legislation such as the Clean Air Act, Clean  Water Act and the Endangered Species  Act, all of which were signed into law  by Republican President Nixon.  While I agree there should be constitutional limits on legislative power,  Judge Alito seems to have agreed with  Justice Thomas who wrote:  I believe we must further reconsider our  substantial effects test with an eye toward  constructing a stand that reflects the text  and history of the Commerce Clause.  Indeed  in a dissent to a gun case  heard before his  court Judge Alito  wrote:  In sum, we are left with no appreciable empirical support for the proposition that the  purely  intrastate possessions of machine  guns, by facilitating the commission of certain crimes, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, and without such support I  do not see how the statutory provision at  issue here can be sustained.  What is noteworthy in this dissent is  that Judge Alito was alone with all  members of his appeals court ruling  the other way.  If ‘‘the aggregate or substantial effects tests’’ are overruled as Justice  VerDate Mar 15 2010  20:27 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S31JA6.REC S31JA6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006

28,Senate,109,-0.308,55,2006-01-31,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, as a  known  sponsor of  international  terrorism, and in light of the president of  Iran’s  recent apocalyptic  statements  calling  for the destruction of Israel,  Iran must not be allowed to develop  nuclear weapons. The  international  community must respond quickly and  decisively to Iran’s gross disregard of  international treaties and obligations  and to its concerted and malicious efforts to develop the capability to create nuclear weapons.  The international community must  take concerted and decisive action to  prevent Iran from furthering its nuclear research and technology development. In its forthcoming meeting on  February  2,  2006,  the  International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board  of Governors should heed the calls by  Russia, China,  the European Union,  and the United States to reaffirm its  findings that Iran has blatantly violated its international obligations, recognize the grave nature of Iran’s recent  actions, and refer Iran to the United  Nations Security Council. The Security  Council should then speak with one  voice to condemn Iran’s actions and  send a clear signal that continued defiance of the international community  will not be tolerated.  It  is  essential  that  the Security  Council approve specific actions to prevent the furthering of Iran’s nuclear  capabilities. The Security Council specifically, and the  international community generally, must recognize the  potentially devastating  link between  the violent and defiant  rhetoric of  Iran’s president and his regime’s determined effort to undermine approved  and transparent methods of developing  civilian nuclear technology for energy  use.  Congress can also take steps to help  stop or slow Iran’s acquisition of nuclear  and  other WMD-related  technology, including adding teeth to export control  legislation such as the  Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act.  The  Iran Nonproliferation Enhancement Act, S.1976, that Senator KYLand  I introduced late last year would do  just that. It would toughen the ISNA  by requiring rather than merely authorizing  sanctions on proliferators,  extending sanctions to the parent companies, and  increasing  the  types of  sanctions that apply to proliferators.  By adopting this legislation, we would  be sending a crystal clear message to  would-be proliferators: if you choose to  assist  Iran  in developing nuclear or  other WMD-related  capabilities, you  are also choosing to forgo doing business with the United States.  History teaches us that we cannot ignore the stated intent of those who  seek to destroy nations. A nuclear-  armed Iran would pose a grave threat  to the region, to Israel, and to the entire international community. A concerted international effort is needed to  prevent Iran from procuring the technology and materiel needed to develop  a nuclear weapon. This effort must  begin now, and it must be comprehensive.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  IN RECOGNITION OF DR.  KATHERINE ESTERLY  ∑",2006
29,Senate,109,0.403,69,2006-01-31,Mr. ISAKSON.," Mr. President, I rise  on behalf of myself, all Georgians, and  I am sure all Americans, to express my  deepest sympathy and condolences to  the family of Coretta Scott King, the  wife of Dr. Martin Luther King. We  learned this morning that she passed  away  yesterday  at  the  age  of  78.  Coretta Scott King is known in history  for being the wife of Dr. Martin Luther  King, but she was far more than that.  As he wrote in his ‘‘Letter from the  Birmingham Jail’’  to  the concerned  clergy of Birmingham about his justification for coming to Birmingham  on behalf of the citizens who had been  discriminated against, Dr. King said:  I come because  injustice anywhere  threat to justice everywhere.  is a  As we all know from history, he took  his mission wherever it took him to  fight on behalf of justice for all Americans. He was able to do that in large  measure with the support and the partnership of his great partner  in  life,  Coretta Scott King. I had the privilege,  as a Georgian, of knowing her since my  days in the legislature. I saw her as an  equal with Dr. King in the movement.  I saw her as a loving mother in the  raising of their four children. And I  have seen her, since the loss of Dr.  King, as an untiring advocate on behalf  of ensuring that the legacy of Dr. King  and his movement  is perpetuated  in  American history.  A few months ago, the United States  of America and this Senate honored  the life of Rosa Parks as a significant  leader, the matriarch of the civil rights  movement. There is no question today,  as we pause in sympathy for the loss of  Dr. King’s wife, Coretta Scott King,  that she joins Rosa Parks as a great  woman in American history and as a  tireless advocate for equality for all  Americans.  On behalf of my State, myself, and  all those who love peace and justice, I  express our sympathy on the loss of  Coretta Scott King.  ",2006
30,Senate,109,0.423,69,2006-01-31,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to remember an extraordinary and courageous woman, Coretta  Scott King.  Coretta Scott King was one of the  most influential women leaders in our  world. She entered the public stage in  1955 as wife of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and as a leading participant  in  the American  civil  rights  movement.  Born  and  raised  in Marion, AL,  Coretta Scott graduated valedictorian  from Lincoln High School. She  received a B.A. in music and education  from  Antioch  College  in  Yellow  Springs, OH, and then went on to study  concert singing at Boston’s New England Conservatory of Music, where she  earned a degree in voice and violin.  While in Boston she met Martin Luther  King, Jr. who was then studying for his  doctorate  in systematic theology at  Boston University. They were married  on June 18, 1953, and in September 1954  took up residence in Montgomery, AL,  with Coretta Scott King assuming the  many functions of pastor’s wife at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.  During Dr. King’s career, Mrs. King  devoted most of her time to raising  their four children. However, she balanced mothering and work, speaking  before church, civic, college, fraternal  and peace groups. She conceived and  performed  a  series  of  favorably-reviewed Freedom Concerts which combined prose and poetry narration with  musical selections and  functioned as  fundraisers for the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, the direct action organization of which Dr. King  served as first president.  After Dr. King’s assassination in 1968,  Mrs. King devoted much of her energy  and attention to developing programs  and building the Atlanta-based Martin  Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent  Social Change as a living memorial to  her husband’s life and dream. For 27  years, Mrs. King devoted her life to developing the King Center. As founding  President, Chair, and Chief Executive  Officer, she dedicated herself to providing local, national and international  programs  that have  trained  tens of  thousands of people in Dr. King’s philosophy and methods; she guided the  creation and housing of the largest archives of documents  from  the civil  rights movement;  and,  perhaps her  greatest legacy after establishing the  King Center  itself, Mrs. King spearheaded  the massive educational and  lobbying  campaign  to  establish Dr.  King’s birthday as a national holiday.  In 1983, an act of Congress instituted  the Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal  Holiday Commission, which she chaired  for its duration. And in January 1986,  Mrs. King oversaw the first legal holiday in honor of her husband—a holiday  which has come to be celebrated by  millions of people world-wide and, in  some form, in over 100 countries.  Coretta Scott King carried the message of nonviolence around the world.  She  led goodwill missions  to many  countries in Africa, Latin America, Europe and Asia. She spoke at many of  history’s most massive peace and justice rallies. She was the first woman to  deliver the class day address at Harvard, and the first woman to preach at  a statutory service at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London.  In 1974 Mrs. King formed a broad association of over 100 religious, labor,  business, civil and women’s rights organizations dedicated to a national policy of full employment and equal economic opportunity, as co-chair of the  Full Employment Action Council. In  1983, she brought together more than  800 human rights organizations to form  the Coalition of Conscience, sponsors of  the 20th anniversary march on Washington, until  then  the  largest demonstration in our Nation’s capital. In  1988, she reconvened the Coalition of  Conscience for the 25th anniversary of  the March on Washington. In preparation for the Reagan-Gorbachev talks,  in 1988 she served as head of the U.S.  delegation of Women for a Meaningful  Summit in Athens, Greece; and in 1990,  as the USSR was redefining itself, Mrs.  King was coconvener of the Soviet-  American Women’s Summit in Washington, DC.  Mrs. King received honorary doctorates from over 60 colleges and universities; authored three books and a nationally-syndicated column; and served  on, and helped found, dozens of organizations,  including the Black Leadership Forum, the National Black Coalition for Voter Participation, and the  Black Leadership Roundtable.  On a very personal note, I had the  pleasure of meeting Mrs. King on a  number of occasions, both within my  great State of Georgia as well as outside of our State. Most notably, I have  been to a number of the Martin Luther  King, Jr., Day celebrations at Ebenezer  Baptist Church and was there last year,  which happened to be the  last time  that Ms. King was there. She was unable to be there this year.  She was a remarkable lady in that, in  spite of her high profile relative to the  civil rights movement, as well as since  Dr. King’s death, she remained a very  humble, a very personable, a very congenial lady who had a great sense of  humor. Certainly during the time of  the civil rights movement, this lady  was undoubtedly one of the most admired women in the world because of  what  she  saw  her  husband  going  through.  She was loyal and steadfast in the  support of her husband. She obviously  loved her husband. She loved her family until her death last night. Her legacy will live on for generations, generations and generations to come.  Coretta Scott King worked tirelessly  to make a better world. History will  judge that she did. We mourn her passing.  ",2006
31,,109,-0.353,83,2006-01-31,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to acknowledge a dear  friend and a  good citizen, Ms. Tina Arapkiles. Tina recently  ‘‘retired’’  from  the Rocky Mountain Regional  office of Sierra Club to spend more time with  her family and other pursuits. I have known  Tina for many years and have the highest regard  for her work on behalf of conservation  and the environment.  Tina’s reputation for gentle, but persuasive,  advocacy  is well known  in Colorado and  I  think  it  is  fair  to say  that she has admirers  from across the broad spectrum of public opinion, and not just from within the environmental  community.  Certainly,  her  reputation  with  members of the Colorado Congressional Delegation  (past and present)  from both parties  has been above reproach.  Advocacy in the public arena is all too often  characterized  by  angry  debate  and  an  unhealthy appetite  for making villains out of  those with whom one disagrees. This has  never been Tina’s way, and it is much to her  credit that she leaves her service at the Sierra  Club with  a well-deserved  reputation  for  thoughtfulness and respect for others. Her example of quiet, but determined and passionate  advocacy, is one I greatly admire.  For the last 20 years, she has been a consistent advocate  for protecting  the West’s  land, air, water, and wildlife. She began her  work on these matters with a lobbying trip to  Washington to help pass the Superfund law in  1985.  In 1989 and 1990, she worked with  Congress to revise the Clean Water Act and  Clean Air Act. She has worked to protect the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge since  the  inception of  the campaign and has been a  staunch supporter of Utah wilderness.  She also helped pass the California Desert  Protection Act and  the Colorado Wilderness  Act of 1993. In fact, Tina, some say, single-  handedly gained protections for the Wheeler  Peak area. She also worked  to designate  Colorado’s  first Wild and Scenic River—the  Cache  la Poudre along Colorado’s northern  Front Range  just north and east of Rocky  Mountain National Park.  Because  of  her work  on  environmental  issues and her reputation for thoughtful advocacy, Tina was invited to be a member of the  Denver Post’s Community Roundtable in 1995  to discuss international trade issues. She was  also appointed in 1992 to the Board of Editorial Contributors  for  the Rocky Mountain  News to offer regular perspectives on environmental policy.  In January of 2000, Tina directed the Southern Rockies Wolf Restoration Project, a coalition of groups and  individuals  that played a  strong  role  in  the Colorado Wolf Working  Group, which  pushed  the State  to  allow  wolves  to roam  freely  throughout  the State.  Her essay on wolves and camping with her  family appears in the recently published collection Comeback Wolves.  She highlights working with Sierra Club volunteers as one of the best memories of her  job, as well as attending  the signing of  the  Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993 in Colorado  by President Clinton.  In addition to her work in the public arena,  Tina has perhaps the more important distinction of successfully raising  two children. For  anyone who knows Tina, it is clear that her  passion for the natural world is directly related  to her interest in humanity. She cares deeply  about Mother Earth, not because  trees are  more important than people, but because people need trees and all the other wonders of  the natural world in order to be fully human.  Although she is leaving a distinguished career of service on behalf of the environment,  and will be missed at the Colorado State capitol and in the halls of Congress, I know she  will continue to be active in all the causes that  she believes in, and I ask my colleagues to  join me in wishing her the very best in her future endeavors.  f  TRIBUTE TO MR.

32,,109,-0.402,83,2006-01-31,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great honor  that  I congratulate Mr. James  Reyome on his retirement as Public Works Director  for  the Town of Griffith. James has  spent over 40 years of his life dedicated to the  interests of the residents of Griffith, Indiana.  His career in public service has allowed him  the opportunity to touch the lives of numerous  people.  James has accomplished many visionary  goals throughout his career. He started his career with  the Griffith Police Department  in  1962, where he worked until 1983, spending  the last 7 years as Chief of Police. James also  worked security at LTV Steel. He then became  Lake County Police Chief under then Sheriff  Bob Stiglich. In 1997, he was named Town of  Griffith Public Works Director, a position his  father held for 20 years. However, shortly before assuming the position of Public Works Director, James had a major stroke, followed by  2 milder strokes  in 2002 and August 2005,  which caused him to speed up his retirement  plans.  James’s family and friends should be proud  of his efforts, as his leadership has served as  a beacon of hope throughout the community.  His longstanding commitment to improving the  quality of life for the citizens in Griffith, Indiana  is  truly  inspirational  and  should  be  commended. Our community has certainly been  rewarded by the true service, uncompromising  dedication,  and  loyalty  displayed  by Mr.  Reyome.  While James has dedicated a considerable  amount of time and energy to his community,  he has never limited the time he gives to his  most important interest: his family. James and  his wife, Anna, have 3 children, 2 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and  my other distinguished colleagues join me in  congratulating Mr. James Reyome for his outstanding devotion to Indiana’s First Congressional District. His unselfish, lifelong dedication  to those in need is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent him in  Congress.  f  HONORING MARY UBER FOR HER  SUCCESSES  HON.

Please insert the following article from  the Jamestown Post Journal of December 18,  2005 into the RECORD.  STATEAGENCYNAMESJAMESTOWNWOMAN  ‘‘OUTSTANDINGPERFORMER’’  Mary Uber of Jamestown recently was honored by the state as an ‘‘Outstanding Performer’’ for her success in overcoming disabilities to become a high-quality worker.  Ms. Uber was recognized by New York  State Industries for the Disabled as part of  its annual program to acknowledge exceptional job performance and personal success  by  people with  disabilities  employed  on  NYSID contracts. She has a job through The  Resource Center’s Environmental Services  division, which employs people with disabilities  in  janitorial  jobs  throughout Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties. Some of  its cleaning contracts come to The Resource  Center through NYSID.  Ms. Uber has overcome disabilities and a  history of short-term job experiences to become a successful member of the Environmental Services team. While lacking in self-  assurance at first, Ms. Uber, who now is in  her fifth year as a custodian, proved that she  had a desire to work and was willing to try  any job assigned to her. She has grown tremendously  in terms of personal maturity  and her ability on the job.  Due to hard work and personal growth, Ms.  Uber was promoted to the position of leader  of a three-person crew that cleans the Western New York Developmental Disabilities  Services Office in Little Valley. As the lead  member of the crew, she is responsible for  seeing that all cleaning tasks are completed  and supplies are on hand. She must also communicate with the customer as well as her  supervisor, who says of Ms. Uber, ‘‘She takes  charge, thinks on her feet and can lead others.’’  With the Resource Center’s assistance, Ms.  Uber has obtained her driver’s license, so she  now can transport her crew members and  cleaning supplies to Little Valley, and she  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:09 Feb 01, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A31JA8.019 E31JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 2 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2006
34,,109,-0.161,90,2006-01-31,Mr. COOPER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  salute  an  outstanding  group  of men  and  women—the  Tennessee  Army  National  Guard’s 168th Military Police Battalion of Lebanon, TN. On Sunday, February 5, the 168th  will receive the Valorous Unit Award at a special presentation at the Armory in Lebanon.  The Valorous Unit Award is one of the Nation’s most prestigious military awards.  It  is  presented to units of the Armed Forces of the  United States for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of  the United  States while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing force. To receive this award, a unit must have performed  with marked distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission  so as to set it apart from, and above, other  units participating  in  the same conflict.  Its  equivalent  in  individual awards  is  the Silver  Star.  I know all Tennesseans, and all Americans,  join with me  in  thanking  the 168th  for  their  bravery,  their commitment and  their selfless  service while in Iraq.  The 168th received its award for performance of duties  from May 20, 2003  through  January 31, 2004. While they performed many  duties, some of  their key accomplishments  during their service were to establish law and  order operations in all of east Baghdad, establish Iraqi police stations, train Iraqi police officers and establish an  Iraqi police academy.  The battalion coordinated numerous offensive  operations and patrols within its area of operations under very austere conditions. They  were  responsible  for confiscating numerous  weapons caches, counterfeit money, and ammunition. And they frequently provided escort  and security service to convoys in the region.  During their service, the 168th Battalion and  its subordinate units receive numerous Bronze  Stars, Purple Hearts, and Army Commendation Medals for Valor. Their service was one  that required heroism and courage on a daily  basis.  I am honored to serve as the Congressman  for Lebanon and privileged to represent these  men and women in Washington. We are all  blessed to live in the greatest country in the  history of the world. And we are particularly  blessed that men and women, like the members of Tennessee’s 168th Military Police Battalion, willingly put their lives on the line every  day so that we may continue to enjoy freedom  here at home.  Words cannot adequately  thank  the members of the 168th for their exceptional service.  But I want to take this moment, and this occasion of their Valorous Unit Award presentation,  to salute them on behalf of all Americans for  their heroic service to our country and to freedom around the world.  f  HONORING  ST.

35,,109,-0.233,90,2006-01-31,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor as a community St. Xavier University  and to celebrate its 50th Anniversary. St. Xavier is located in Chicago’s Mount Greenwood  neighborhood.  When  founded  in 1846 by  the Sisters of  Mercy, St. Xavier was a Catholic  institution  grounded in the tradition of the liberal arts. As  one of 18 colleges and universities sponsored  by  the Sisters  of Mercy, St. Xavier  has  evolved into an institution that seeks to provide its students with the meaning of scholarship, the support of the community, and the  spirit of moral and ethical sensibility.  Although a Catholic university of approximately 5,700 students, St. Xavier welcomes  students  of  all  faiths  and  religious  backgrounds. Because of  its  rich  traditions and  commitment to excellence St. Xavier has become one of Chicago’s premier collegiate institutions for students studying nursing, business, as well as education.  It is my honor to recognize this school and  its many achievements both academically and  athletically. In addition, I commend St. Xavier  University for fostering the intellectual and cultural growth of the administration, faculty and  students who all play a vital role in the success of  the university’s existence  in  today’s  society.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF GUADALUPE, ARIZONA ON THE 31ST  ANNIVERSARY OF ITS INCORPORATION  HON. ED PASTOR  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 31, 2006  ",2006
36,,109,-0.421,90,2006-01-31,Mr. PASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise before you  today to pay tribute to the Town of Guadalupe,  Arizona, a community  in my district which  I  proudly represent, on the occasion of the 31st  Anniversary of its incorporation. Named after  the patron saint of Mexico, the Virgin of Guadalupe, this culturally-rich community is home  to about 5,500 residents.  Guadalupe was  founded by Yaqui  Indians  around the turn of the century when they fled  their  traditional homeland along  the Yaqui  River in Sonora, Mexico to avoid persecution  and enslavement by the Mexican government  under Porfirio Diaz. When  the Yaqui people  fled as refugees, many were able  to  find a  home  in  the Salt River Valley’s agricultural  economy. One of  the villages was  in south  Tempe, just north of the present Guadalupe  site. A missionary Franciscan Friar, Lucius  Zittier, petitioned President Woodrow Wilson  for 40 acres of land so the Yaqui could permanently  settle.  The  site,  undesirable  as  uncultivable,  is  located  in  the center of  the  present community, known as ‘‘La Cuarenta,’’  or ‘‘The 40,’’ as some still call it today.  Guadalupe also became home to many Hispanic families over the years, and it has become a stopping point for Mexican immigrant  workers. As the community has grown, it has  demonstrated its resilience in the face of difficult economic times, poverty, and racism.  Many young men of Mexican and Yaqui descent answered  the call  for military service  and defended our country. Dozens of Guadalupe veterans’ names are on the rolls of those  who served, and many paid the ultimate sacrifice.  In the early 1960s, Guadalupe Organization,  Inc., was formed and it began to identify and  address  the community’s needs. Many services  taken  for granted  in other communities  were not provided in Guadalupe and residents  began to get organized. A new voting precinct  in Guadalupe was formed, and U.S. Sen. Carl  Hayden was  instrumental  in securing home  mail delivery for residents. As the Guadalupe  Organization advocated for community betterment  and  educated  residents  about  civil  awareness,  many  small  victories  were  achieved for the community. The organization  prevented a freeway from being built through  the center of Guadalupe, opened a dental clinic with volunteer dentists, fought discrimination  against Guadalupe students, and most notably, led the charge for incorporation.  Neighboring cities had mostly rebuffed Guadalupe and its residents until property values  soared. To stop annexation attempts and preserve their community’s rich culture, the Guadalupe Organization began  incorporation efforts and  the Citizens Committee  to  Incorporate Guadalupe was formed. It was led by  Mr. Andres ‘‘Andy’’ Jimenez, who served as  president of the group. Election results of Feb.  4, 1975, which showed an 83 percent voter  turnout, approved  the plan of  incorporation,  and the Town of Guadalupe was born.  Since  then,  the Town of Guadalupe has  been a leader in demonstrating concern for its  residents and passing progressive policies.  The Town Council was the first in Arizona to  ban smoking  in public places.  It declared a  paid Cesar Chavez Holiday  for Guadalupe  town employees. The town has also donated  land for construction of educational and recreational entities.  Maricopa County Community Colleges also  have established a branch of South Mountain  Community College in Guadalupe with its rental fee subsidized for many years by the Guadalupe Organization. Guadalupe had one college graduate in 1960 and one in 1967. Now  graduates at all  levels,  from high school  to  Ph.D., call Guadalupe their home.  As you can see, Guadalupe is a community  rich with the traditions of three cultures, deeply  devoted to the welfare of its residents, and the  prosperity of its community. As the former director of the Guadalupe Organization, I feel a  special bond to this community and take great  pride  in  its progress. This bond  is  felt by  many, as children follow in their parents’ footsteps, opting to make a home in Guadalupe  as they begin to make a life of their own. Ironically, the current Mayor of Guadalupe is Ms.  Bernadette  Jimenez, daughter of Andy  Jimenez, who led the Citizens Committee to Incorporate Guadalupe.  In honor of the success of this community  and  its  residents,  I ask my colleagues  to  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:09 Feb 01, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A31JA8.046 E31JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 2 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2006

After serving on  the staff of U.S. District Court Judge Walter  Huxman  for  two years, John Anderson won  election as Johnson County Attorney in 1947,  where he served  for six years. He was a  member of  the Kansas State Senate  from  1953–1956, and was appointed Kansas Attorney General, serving from 1956–1961. Elected  Governor of Kansas in 1960 and 1962, he defeated incumbent Governor George Docking,  served as Governor during Kansas’ centennial  celebration, and appointed James B. Pearson  to the United States Senate upon the death of  Senator Andrew Schoeppel.  John Anderson’s  tenure as Kansas Governor was marked  by  numerous  achievements, including:  Revision of  the state’s pardon and parole  systems;  Creation of a combined state medical and  psychiatric hospital;  Restructuring of  the state’s public school  system into unified districts;  Increasing of the state’s per-pupil expenditure allowance;  Addition of the University of Wichita to the  state board of regents system;  Sanctioning of  fair employment practices  standards;  Approval of an advanced public employee  retirement system;  Advancements in highway construction;  Expansion of vocational-technical schools;  Authorization of a state library consultant;  Improvements in the public welfare system;  and  Reorganization of state agencies, commissions and boards.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation honoring an important Kansas leader is long overdue, and I  know that my delegation colleagues look forward with me to its speedy enactment.  f  IN  MEMORY  OF  FRANCIS  L.

38,,109,0.232,97,2006-01-31,Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today with great sadness and tremendous gratitude to honor the life of Francis L.  Brannigan, who over  the years has helped  firefighters be more astute to the importance  of knowing building construction  to promote  firefighter safety. As a groundbreaking leader  in providing  for  firefighter safety, Frank was  one of  the  first  to  realize  that  the biggest  threat  to  firefighters were  the buildings  they  were working in. Throughout his career, Frank  provided constant focus on the issues associated with building construction and the fire environment. The safety of  firefighters was always the focus of his message and as a result, generations of  firefighters will be safer  because of his message. The knowledge that  he possessed, and generously shared, was  second to none.  Frank Brannigan devoted more than half of  his 63-year career to the safety of firefighters  in building fires. He was well known as the author of  ‘‘Building Construction  for  the Fire  Service,’’ and for his lectures and videotapes.  The first edition of his ‘‘Building Construction  for the Fire Service’’ was an instant success in  1971. Since  then,  it has  sold more  than  130,000 copies in three editions, the most recent of which was published  in 1992. Designated by Fire Chief as one of the 20 people  who most  influenced  the  fire service  in  the  20th century, Frank Brannigan was truly one  of the giants of the fire service.  Frank Brannigan was not a fire chief or an  engineer, but he became one of the most important influences in the fire service in the last  quarter of the 20th century. I am proud to say  I knew Frank Brannigan.  Mr. Speaker, the Fire Service has lost an  exceptional leader and guardian of firefighters  everywhere.  I wish Frank Brannigan’s wife  Maurine and family my heartfelt condolences  and may they find comfort in knowing that the  many people he  impacted deeply value his  dedication and generosity and the example of  his life and work. Frank Brannigan exemplified  the spirit of service that has made this country  great. As long as firefighters fight fires, the fire  service will be the beneficiary of Frank’s writing, scholarship, zeal and life-saving message.  f  TRIBUTE TO MARIA DE LOS  ANGELES OBREGON  HON.

39,,109,-0.225,97,2006-01-31,Mr. CUELLAR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the 100th birthday of Maria de los  Angeles Obregon Pen˜a who was born on the  23rd of December, 1905, in San Luis Potosi,  Mexico.  Maria de los Angeles Obregon Pen˜a moved  to Laredo, TX in 1910 with her two brothers  and widowed mother. Her  father, Gumaro  Obregon, was the youngest brother of President Alvaro Obregon and was assassinated  for political reasons. While  in Laredo, Maria  has memories of sitting on the rooftops in Laredo and listening to gun fire just across the  border in Nuevo Laredo during the 1910 Revolution.  Maria attended public school until the eighth  grade when she was forced to leave to help  the  family make enough money  to sustain  itself. Later, on July 10th, 1933, she married  Ramiro Santos Pen˜a in Laredo. Together, they  had  three children, Pauline P. Baclesse of  Mexico, MO, Ramiro A. Pen˜a of Holland, TX,  and Carlos D. Pen˜a of Clear Lake, TX.  Maria and Ramiro were both active members of  the Primera  Iglesia Bautista where  their children were baptized. Maria credits her  outlook on life and her faith in God for her longevity. Laredo is proud to have Maria as a citizen, and  is pleased  to celebrate her 100th  birthday.

Standing on the top of Mount Sentinel—the backdrop of the University  of Montana—on a clear day, a person  can see nearly 50 miles in almost every  direction. I might say that at the top  of Lone Mountain in Big Sky, MT, you  can see the Tetons in Wyoming. Back  at Mount Sentinel, which many of us  climb from time to time, at the foot of  it a professor is studying a horizon that  stretches much farther than 50 miles.  Professor Dan Reisenfeld is one of the  key astrophysicists working on a mission to map and study the edge of the  solar system.  Professor Reisenfeld is busy playing  a part in the design of the interstellar  boundary explorer, or I-BEX, an instrument that uses a large-aperture camera  to detect high-energy particles coming  from the edge of the solar system.  What does this mean? If I-BEX is successful at gathering information about  the boundaries of the solar system, this  will help companies  that build  satellites orbiting the Earth to predict  solar storms. Solar storms can disrupt  a satellite’s operation and even cause  irreparable damage.  Here  on Earth,  that means  that  emergency communications equipment  would be able to function without the  fear of interruption. And global communications can be more seamless.

43,Senate,109,-0.45,48,2006-02-13,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, I rise to  honor the memory of the late LCDR  Frank Carl Wittwer. Lieutenant Commander Wittwer, a longtime Hanford  resident, perished when his F/A–18C  Hornet went down during a training  mission near Naval Air Facility El  Centro on January 18, 2006. He was 35  years old.  A 1994 graduate of the U.S. Naval  Academy,  Lieutenant  Commander  Wittwer was fondly remembered as a  friendly and active student who participated in a number of activities such  as music and youth ministries at his  church. Upon receiving his bachelor of  science degree in systems engineering,  he began his successful active-duty career as a surface warfare officer aboard  the  USS  California  and  the  USS  McFaul.  In recognition of his considerable talents, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer  was assigned to the Hornet Program  with VFA–137 in 2001. Subsequently, he  received postings at Strike Fighter  Wing Pacific Fleet as safety officer and  a follow-on assignment with the VFA–  97 Warhawks. Throughout his years of  service,  Lieutenant  Commander  Wittwer was known as a dedicated and  honorable  serviceman who embodied  the best qualities and ideals of the U.S.  Navy.  In his personal life, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer demonstrated a genuine  commitment  to  improving  the  lives of others. A popular figure in the  community and an elder in the First  Presbyterian Church  in Hanford, he  had a passion in working with kindergartners and grade school students. A  man of many talents, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer  recently  completed  the executive MBA program at  the  California State University, Fresno’s  Craig School of Business.  Lieutenant Commander Wittwer will  be remembered by those whose lives he  touched as a devoted family man, a  loyal friend and an outstanding member of the U.S. Navy. He is survived by  his wife Mendi; daughters Erin and  Abbie; son Jack; sister Patti; nephew  Josh; and his grandfather Hurdis Harris.  f  STOP COUNTERFEITING IN  MANUFACTURED GOODS ACT  ",2006

The  joint resolutions are cosponsored by  Senators FRISTand LEAHY. Alan Spoon  and Phillip Frost have been approved  and recommended for appointment by  the Smithsonian Board of Regents. I  ask unanimous consent that the text of  the resolutions and the biographies of  both  gentlemen  be  printed  in  the  RECORD. I ask the Senate to approve  the resolutions.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  Alan G. Spoon, Appointed 2000, Executive  Committee, Chair, Finance and Investment  Committee.  Alan G. Spoon, of Massachusetts, is Managing Partner of Polaris Venture Partners,  which invests in Internet-related businesses,  networking,  biotechnology,  and medical  technology. He was previously President of  the Washington  Post  Company,  having  served 18 years in various leadership roles.  He maintains leadership and advisory roles  with numerous companies and organizations  in the technology, communications, and financial industries.  S.J.

Phillip Frost  Chairman of the Board and CEO, Ivax Corporation, Miami Beach, FL  Nationally recognized for his creative enterprise, business and marketing acumen,  and generous support of education and the  arts, Phillip Frost has held leadership positions with numerous corporations and organizations. Born in Philadelphia, where his  family lived above his father’s shoe store,  Dr. Frost worked at a brother’s hardware  store before heading to the University of  Pennsylvania. There Dr. Frost majored in  French literature and spent one year studying at the University of Paris, a seminal period that led to Dr. Frost’s life-long commitment to the arts.

45,Senate,109,0.219,8,2006-02-17,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, our  country needs additional  funding  for  LIHEAP. Temperatures in rural Alaska  have reached 62 below zero. These temperatures have frozen heating systems  and water and sewer lines in many of  our villages. Alaskans are struggling  this winter and paying over $5 per gallon to heat their homes. In fact, the  mayor of a North Slope community  told me that at one point, a village  paid $8 per gallon.  While the home heating picture  is  not as bleak in other parts of our country, all Americans are feeling the effects of high energy prices.  In December, I tried to address this  situation  by  including  emergency  LIHEAP funding in the Defense Appropriations Bill. Our bill created a new  revenue stream by authorizing oil and  gas development in the Coastal Plain  of ANWR—and used this revenue to  provide  funding  for  several  emergencies. Our bill included $2 billion for  LIHEAP and funding for the hurricane  victims, first responders, and farmers.  The ANWR provision would have created a  long-term, dedicated  funding  stream for home energy assistance.  Most of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle successfully filibustered  consideration of  this package  under the guise of a Rule XXVIII violation. They then noted to remove the  ANWR provision and the funds it provided  from the bill,  including emergency funding for LIHEAP.  It was a sad display of good policy  dying a quick death at the hands of  partisan politics. It was a particularly  sad day for the people this funding was  designed to help.  Despite  this, Americans  still need  heating assistance this winter. I hoped  the Senate would put partisan politics  aside and create a long-term funding  stream for LIHEAP in December. I believe that would have been the best solution.  The measure before us today is the  only other solution available, and  I  urge my colleagues to pass emergency  LIHEAP assistance.  f  S. RES. 374 (PASSED THURSDAY,  FEBRUARY 16)  ",2006
46,Senate,109,0.091,22,2006-02-17,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to introduce a bill that will help  struggling  communities,  like Aroostook County  in my home State of  Maine, take full advantage of the special tax  incentives  for creating economic growth and community revitalization in empowerment zones. The bill  enables those economically depressed  communities, already  taking advantage of these incentives, to secure the  full 15 years of targeted growth originally granted to the areas first designated as empowerment zones.  I believe all empowerment zone communities need 15 years to reverse the  decades of decline that originally impacted their economies. I have  long  supported  empowerment  zone  incentives, and I believe that these targeted  tax incentives provide struggling communities the best chance for sustained,  long  lasting  economic  renewal.  In  Maine, I have seen first hand empowerment zones’ ability to revitalize faltering communities, with new jobs, and  the creation of the economic activity  needed  for vibrant and strong cities  and towns.  Empowerment zones are vital to the  health of rural Maine. The story of  Aroostook County demonstrates how  decades of decline can force people to  leave rural areas in order to find better, more stable, employment opportunities. Since the 1960s, difficult economic circumstances have caused a  continuous decline in Aroostook County’s population.  In  1994, Loring Air  Force Base closed, the major employer  in Aroostook County at the time, further  decimating  the  area’s  already  struggling economic base and population. The Pentagon wrote, in their  assessment of closure at Loring that,  ‘‘closing Loring Air Force Base would  result in a population loss of approximately 22,000 persons, (the) direct and  indirect  employment  loss of nearly  9,900 jobs, and regional income loss of  just over 92 million dollars.’’ Today,  over 11 years after the Air Force left  Aroostook County, the population hovers near a sparse 73,000 people with 14  percent of these households still living  in poverty.  In 1994, Congress designated the first  empowerment zones setting 2009, a 15-  year timeframe, as the date that these  tax incentives would expire. The 2009  expiration date of empowerment zone  status was held firm for Round II communities designated in 1997, and the  Round III communities designated in  2002; granting communities like Aroostook County, which was designated in  2002, as little as 7 years to use tax incentives to reverse decades of decline  and economic neglect.  Unfortunately, Aroostook’s economic  problems will not be fixed within the 7  short years this area qualifies for empowerment zone tax incentives. Instead  a long-term and lasting commitment of  at least 15 years is necessary to help  Aroostook  communities work  their  way to stronger economic prosperity.  Many  communities,  like Aroostook  County, that were unable to qualify for  empowerment zone status until 2002  are in need of the long-term 15-year  commitment in which to address their  stubborn causes of poverty.  Businesses  operating  within  empowerment zones receive a 20-percent  wage credit for the first $15,000 they  pay in wages to local residents. Other  tax  incentives encourage businesses,  and industries, to further commit to  these  communities. Companies with  businesses in empowerment zones are  eligible for an additional $35,000 worth  of  179  business  expensing—making  these  long-term business obligations  more attractive, affordable, and likely.  Empowerment zones are also eligible  for expanded tax exempt financing for  building  the  infrastructure  communities need to attract long-term developers and business partners.  To qualify  for empowerment  zone  status,  communities  develop  comprehensive strategic plans that depend  on these tax incentives to help them  transform their economies. Each community’s plan focuses on establishing  long-term partnerships between private  businesses, nonprofits, State, local, and  Federal Government agencies, to help  develop the local economy. Together  these  parties  use  the  community’s  strategic blueprint to implement interconnected projects  that address  the  factors creating the area’s economic  sickness. These types of projects focus  on building needed business and industrial infrastructure, developing an educated workforce and diversifying local  economies away from a reliance on one  employer or industry.  In 2002, Aroostook County was designated an empowerment zone based on  population loss, one of only two empowerment zones designated because of  population decline. The county formed  the Aroostook Partnership for Progress  to spearhead their empowerment zone  strategy,  initiatives,  and  projects.

The only people who came to  the Congress that day were the Presiding Officer, a clerk, and myself to  deliver  that address.  I  remember  I  walked from my then-residence some 2  miles in the snow. There was a farmer’s  march here, and they were all in a tent  camp, and a tractor drove me up the  hill the final 3 or 4 blocks. It was one  of the few moments of any fame in my  life.

48,,109,-0.438,43,2006-02-17,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to the life of Hattie McDaniel, a  woman of  firsts, whose career as an acclaimed singer and actress on film, television,  and radio inspired and illuminated the lives of  many. Her dynamic career afforded her  the  opportunity to break barriers in the entertainment industry, which allowed her to inevitably  create a path for other gifted and aspiring African-Americans in the arts to travel.  Ms. McDaniel was born on June 10, 1895 in  Wichita, KS, to Henry McDaniel, a Baptist minister and  freed slave and Susan Holbert, a  spiritual singer. She was  raised  in Denver,  CO, and was the 13th child of the family. Realizing her talents at an early age, her father  put her in the family performance troupe he  organized and managed.  Her experience aided her  in winning a  medal in dramatic art at age 15. However, in  1910, she dropped out of school and gained  employment as a band vocalist with Professor  George Morrison’s Negro Orchestra.  She  toured the country and in 1915 became the  first African-American to sing on network radio  in the United States.  Ms. McDaniel worked in minstrel vaudeville  shows until the Depression. During this time,  she moved to Milwaukee and worked as a domestic. In 1930, while working as a bathroom  attendant, her vocal abilities were discovered  by the club manager. Subsequently, she landed a job in the club singing for a year and  never looked back.  In 1931, Ms. McDaniel moved to Hollywood  in pursuit of a  film career, a  time  in which  many African-Americans were solely portrayed  as domestics and servants. These roles were  often deemed to be stereotypical and insulting  in the African-American community. However,  Ms. McDaniel did not share this belief, and instead of  turning her back on  the roles, she  worked against the stereotype from within the  system.  As a result, she was able to build a remarkable  three-decade career comprised of over  300 movies, and was able to accomplish what  many others would still consider unattainable.  She was praised for many of her roles including the role of Queenie in Show Boat in 1936;  however, her most memorable role and greatest achievement was through her portrayal of  Mammy in Gone with the Wind in 1939.  Similar to the characters she played in other  movies, she portrayed Mammy as a humble,  submissive, and trusted servant that also possessed an assertive and chastising attitude.  Her subservient yet stem demeanor gained  her immense respect both on and off the camera. In fact, her clever and brilliant performance in Gone with the Wind led her to becoming the first African-American Best Supporting  Actress nominee and winner at  the 1940  Academy Awards. She became the first African-American guest to be invited to the ceremony and was also the first and last recipient  of the prestigious honor for 25 years.  Unfortunately, Ms. McDaniel’s accomplishments were not  revered by everyone. Although heavily criticized by African-Americans,  some whites were  equally  condemnatory.  Many blacks protested at the movie premiere  describing Mammy as a symbolic reminder of  slavery. In fact, Ms. McDaniel had to make the  painful decision not to attend the Gone with  the Wind premiere in Atlanta because of the  highly charged racist climate in the South at  that time.  In response to critics of her career, she simply stated, ‘‘it’s better to get $7,000 a week for  playing a servant than $7 a week for being  one.’’ In fact, as her career progressed, Ms.  McDaniel was able to broaden her career and  shift  into  playing  more  dramatic,  less  stereotypical  roles which encapsulated  the  depth of her talents.  Ms. McDaniel was also an advocate for racial equity and integration. When Whites tried  to block her from moving into her Los Angeles  home, she  rallied her Black neighbors and  they took the case to the Supreme Court and  won. Additionally, she served as the chair of  the African-American sector of the Hollywood  Victory Committee, which provided entertainment for segregated black soldiers. She also  organized  fundraisers  for African-American  youth education.  In 1947, she was cast as a regular in The  Beulah Show radio show. In 1951, The Beulah  Show expanded to the small screen. Unfortunately, Ms. McDaniel appeared in only three  episodes before she lost her battle with breast  cancer and died in 1952.  Her dying wish was to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery on Santa Monica Boulevard  but because of her race, the owner at the time  refused. However,  in 1999,  the new owner  overturned the decision and asked that her remains be  transferred  to  the cemetery. The  family did not want to disturb her remains and  respectfully declined. Nevertheless, the cemetery was dedicated to honoring her wish and  as a result erected a cenotaph memorial on  the lawn overlooking the lake in her memory.  Ms. McDaniel was a  resilient, gifted, and  witty  figure  in American history and her accomplishments are merely the testimonies of  her diligence. She has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame—one for her contributions  to radio and one for her motion pictures contributions.  One of Hattie McDaniel’s favorite and most  famous sayings was, ‘‘Humble is the way.’’ Although she had an admirable career, she had  to travel an arduous path to attain it. However,  through her humility and determination, she  was able to carve her rightful place in American history. That is why I introduced legislation  in  the 108th Congress seeking  to have  her image memorialized on a postage stamp.  As a result, on January 26, 2006, the Postal  Service did indeed select to honor this great  woman by making her the 29th image to appear on  the Black Heritage commemorative  stamp series. I also congratulate fellow Marylander, Ms. Ethel Kessler of Bethesda, for designing the stunning image on the stamp.  Mr. Speaker, though her spirit is gone with  the wind, her  legacy will always  resonate  through her artistic works and thus will continue to live on forever.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF ATASCOSA COUNTY  HON.

Lance Cpl Price was a 19 year-old  from  Woodlawn,  Illinois and was assigned  to  the  3rd Battalion, 10th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division,  II Marine Expeditionary Force,  Camp  Lejeune, N.C. He  graduated  from  Woodlawn High School in Woodlawn, Ill.  Price paid the ultimate sacrifice for his country. He  is survived by his mother and stepfather, Cheryl Price Hunsell and John Hunsell  of Woodlawn; his father, David Price of Indianapolis,  Ind.; a brother, John R. Hunsell of  Woodlawn;  two sisters, Krystal Martin and  husband Eric of St. Louis and Rachel Hunsell  of Woodlawn; his  fiancee, Brea Tate of Mt.  Vernon and many other  family,  friends and  loved ones.  I am proud of  the service  this  young man gave to his country and the service his  fellow  troops perform everyday. Not  enough can be said about Lance Cpl Price. It  is soldiers like him that are risking their lives  day  in and day out  to ensure our  freedom  here at home and  to others  throughout  the  rest of the world. I salute him and my best  wishes go out to his family and all the troops  fighting  to ensure  freedom and democracy.  God bless  them and may God continue  to  bless America.  f  TRIBUTE TO MAYOR RICK ALLEN  HON. GREG WALDEN  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 16, 2006  ",2006
50,,109,0.339,50,2006-02-17,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to pay  tribute  to a great American, a  dedicated Oregonian, an avid Oregon Duck  fan, and a good friend of mine, Mayor Rick  Allen. Throughout his career, Mayor Allen has  played a significant role in shaping the City of  Madras, while paving the way for future development and growth. Today, we thank him for  his years of public service and recognize the  numerous contributions he’s made during his  tenure in office.  Mr. Speaker, following graduation from Madras High School in 1975, Rick took over as  the manager of the local bowling ally. It was  there that he began learning the ways of the  business world. His hard work at the bowling  alley gave him the experience and knowledge  that led him to his next business endeavor as  the manager of the Tiger Mart. It didn’t take  long until Rick had purchased Tiger Mart and  turned it into a thriving gas station and mini  mart. Soon, he’d be on  to even bigger and  better endeavors.  First elected in 1982, at the young age of  25, Rick embarked into the world of politics as  a member of  the Madras City Council. His  business savvy brought efficiency and effectiveness to his elected post and to the operation of local government. Rick served 6 years  as a member of the city council, and served  as the mayor for the last 2 years. Following  his service on  the city council, Mayor Allen  went on to serve 8 years as a Jefferson County Commissioner, continuing his role of public  stewardship.  Mr. Speaker,  following a brief departure  from elected office, Rick’s dedication and devotion to his community called him back for a  second tour of duty. In 2000, the City of Madras faced great uncertainty with alleged scandals and wrongdoings within the city government. During  these  tumultuous  times, Rick  recognized  the need  for stability and consistent leadership, which encouraged and inspired him  to mount a write-in candidacy  to  once again return to serve as the Mayor of  Madras. He was overwhelmingly elected  in  2001, securing 80 percent of  the vote and  upon election immediately went to work to rebuild and restore trust within the community.  Mr. Speaker, those who know Rick best will  tell you that he’s not one to back down from  a challenge and he’s not afraid to make an  unpopular decision if he believes it is best for  the community. During his tenure, Rick tackled  challenges and controversy head on. He was  a visionary for growth, led the charge for expansion, and has been a champion for economic development  in  the region. Under his  leadership,  the city acquired  industrial  land  near  the airport while making significant  improvements and enhancements to the airport  property. Rick has been a strong advocate for  recreation and  rafters who  float along  the  lower Deschutes River. He was a key player  in East Madras Development Project, which  will establish 1,700 new homes, an 18-hole  golf course, over 60 acres of open space, and  20 acres set aside for the local schools.  Mr. Speaker, these illustrate just a few of  Mayor Allen’s accomplishments during a long  and distinguished career. I ask that my fellow  colleagues join me in congratulating this extraordinary man  and  great American. For  years to come the region will flourish and residents will benefit from the foundation and vision that Mayor Allen has pursued. I wish Rick  the best in future endeavors, and personally,  I would like to thank him for all he’s done for  the people of Jefferson County,  the Second  Congressional District, and the great state of  Oregon.  f  TRIBUTE TO CLOYCE DICKERSON  HON.

52,,109,0.284,57,2006-02-17,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for  Mr. TOMDAVISof Virginia and I to remember  the Honorable John F. ‘‘Jack’’ Herrity, former  chairman  of  the  Fairfax County, Virginia,  Board of Supervisors, who passed away on  February 1. If anyone is worthy of the title ‘‘Mr.  Fairfax,’’ Jack Herrity is that person.  A driven leader during his time with the Fairfax County Board, Jack was the guiding force  in setting the firm foundation for a growing and  developing  Fairfax County. His  leadership  brought us the Fairfax County Parkway, Interstate 66 inside the Beltway and the Dulles Access Road. The Virginia General Assembly  aptly named the Fairfax County Parkway in his  honor in 1995.  After attending Georgetown University as an  undergraduate and as a  law student, Jack  formed Jack Herrity and Associates, a pension  planning and  insurance business. But public  service was Jack’s forte. He quickly became  engaged in northern Virginia politics, serving  on  the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors  from 1971 to 1987. He was elected chairman  of the board in 1975 and served three terms.  He recognized the potential of Fairfax County  to become the largest jurisdiction in the Washington area and helped develop  the once  sleepy rural crossroads, Tysons Corner, into  the thriving commercial district it is today.  Jack Herrity carved a place which  is now  and will  forever be unmatched  in Fairfax  County history. We honor and remember Jack  for his countless accomplishments and unwavering dedication to the people of Fairfax County. We  insert  for  the RECORD a Washington  Post obituary  from February 2. Jack will be  deeply missed by the people of Fairfax County, and at home by his family.  [From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 2006]  (By Lisa Rein and Peter Baker)  John F. ‘‘Jack’’ Herrity, the former chairman of the Fairfax Board of Supervisors who  ushered in a development boom that transformed  the  county  from  sleepy bedroom  community to suburban colossus, died yesterday of heart failure. He was 74.  Herrity, whose scrappy battle with a weak  heart first endeared him to Fairfax voters in  the 1970s, succumbed to an aortic aneurysm  at Inova Fairfax Hospital, where he was admitted two weeks ago with chest pain. He  had a heart transplant 12 years ago.  In his heyday, Herrity dominated Northern  Virginia politics as few others have, commanding attention with his pugnacious style  and unabashedly pro-growth policies. His  was a classic rise-and-fall political story—  from his landslide victories as the Fairfax  economy soared to unprecedented heights to  his crushing defeat  in 1987 when the onslaught of new cars  finally overwhelmed  county roads and voter patience.  Herrity was engaged in county affairs until  the end. From his hospital bed last week, he  was asking former aides to help run his likely campaign for board chairman next year, a  race he lost in 2003 in a Republican primary.  He was busy fighting plans to extend Metrorail to Dulles International Airport, saying  the expense could not be justified. And, in an  about-face some local politicians saw as cynical, he had joined in recent months with  grass-roots activists—and the woman who  defeated him, slow-growth Democrat Audrey  Moore—to fight dense development planned  for the county’s last slivers of open space. He  was at meetings almost every night.  ‘‘To Jack’s credit, if he had a difference of  opinion [with the county’s leadership], he  never sat on his hands,’’ Eric Lundberg, the  Fairfax GOP chairman, said. ‘‘He was willing  to engage in the battle.’’  Herrity could be seen most mornings in a  floppy wide-brimmed hat walking his black  Labrador retriever, Raven, on the W & OD  trail near his Vienna home, where he lived  with his wife, JoAnn Spevacek-Herrity. They  married in November.  ‘‘He’s a piece of our history,’’ said Board  Chairman Gerald E. Connolly (D), who ordered county flags flown at half-staff yesterday. ‘‘He was a political adversary, but he  would do it more often than not with a certain twinkle in his eye. It was more the love  of the fight than the substance of the moment.’’  Herrity was the fourth person to serve as  countywide chairman but the first to hold  the job for a full term, let alone three. He defined the role as a quasi-mayoral position  even though it has no real executive power.  He played a major role in building what  was commonly referred to as the economic  engine of Virginia. By  fostering a superheated business environment, he helped lure  Fortune 500 companies such as what was  then known as the Mobil Corp. to Fairfax  and convert a suburban crossroads called  Tysons Corner  into a commercial center  larger than downtown Miami.  ‘‘Instead of jobs going out of the county,’’  Herrity wanted jobs to stay in the county,  Northern Virginia developer John T. ‘‘Til’’  Hazel said.  During  this  period  of  growth  under  Herrity, more than 1,000 people moved into  Fairfax every month. The county grew into  the largest jurisdiction in the Washington  area. From Herrity’s first election as chairman in 1975 to his ouster in 1987, the county’s  population  jumped by more than a third,  from 554,500 to 746,600—surpassing most U.S.  cities and even several states. Today, more  than 1 million people live in Fairfax.  He was an advocate  for  improving  the  county’s road network and pushed to widen  Interstate 66 inside the Capital Beltway. He  first opposed, then campaigned hard for a  major new road cutting through the county’s  midsection.  The General Assembly named the Fairfax  County Parkway in his honor in 1995.  It was  his  quick-witted,  never-say-die  brand of politics that earned him a loyal following during a crucial transition period in  Fairfax history.  With his burly build, balding pate and  ever-present U.S. flag lapel pin, Herrity became a familiar figure in political and civic  circles. Known simply as Jack, he crisscrossed the 399-square-mile county almost  every day in search of any gathering of two  or more people, often driving so fast that he  collected a glove compartment full of speeding tickets that became legendary.  Throughout his tenure, Herrity was notorious for his penchant for the outrageous,  shoot-from-the-hip statements.  When county officials were thinking about  building a major government center, he suggested that they instead ‘‘build a circus tent  and put the bureaucrats in it.’’ He called  Metro, which opened while he was in office,  a  ‘‘Mighty Expensive Transportation Rip  Off.’’  His tart tongue extended to his rivals as  well. In 1987, he derided Moore as a gadfly  with so little support on the board that, if  she made the motion, she ‘‘couldn’t get a  second to go to the bathroom.’’ Four years  later, he dismissed Rep. Thomas M. Davis III  (R-Fairfax) as a  ‘‘left-wing liberal’’ whose  support from a taxpayers group was ‘‘like  the chicken endorsing the fox.’’ His relationships with both had softened in recent years.  Herrity saw no reason to apologize for his  close alliance with the region’s powerful developers, who he said had helped create a  quality of life envied across the country—  high-paying jobs, good schools, low crime.  But his ties to the real estate industry became his political undoing.  His 1986 conviction on a misdemeanor conflict-of-interest charge for failing to disclose  a relationship with a builder only cemented  Herrity’s public image as a handmaiden of  developers. By then, voter support for the  breakneck pace of  construction had dissolved amid maddening traffic gridlock.

54,House,109,-0.306,6,2006-02-28,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 5  minutes  to  the  gentlewoman  from  Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE).  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to  be able to thank my good friend from  New Jersey, Mr. PAYNE, for his eloquence in commenting on this very important site that will be established.  The site is a national historic treasure  and contains the world’s largest collections of materials related to Thomas  Edison.  As a member of the House Science  Committee,  clearly we  should  use  every opportunity to focus on America’s researchers and inventors and emphasize that Thomas Edison is one of  America’s greatest inventors, who has  shown not only his love for research  and  invention, but his  inexhaustible  energy and genius that produced 1,093  patents in his lifetime, frankly, more  than any other American.  Just this weekend we spent time in  the city of Houston with the State of  the Black Union, and one of the issues  dealt with the digital divide among African Americans. The  idea of highlighting the importance of invention  and the importance of technology of  that time by establishing and making  better the Edison National Historical  Site is, I think, an asset not only to  the Nation but certainly to the place  where it is lodged. I frankly think that  America is a Nation that has great creativity, and I am proud to be an American for that very reason. We are problem-solvers.  Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the further recognition of the works of Thomas Edison by establishing the Thomas  Edison National Historical Park in the  State of New Jersey, it causes me to be  moved to comment on some of the  statements that have been made earlier on the floor of the House and the  week’s events as relates to signs of  showing that we are not creative in our  governance of America today, that is,  of course, the debate and the recognition of the recent contract with UAE  as relates to the taking over of a number of ports throughout America.  Frankly, let me just say that this is  not a debate about the UAE, though we  now know today that the Coast Guard  has indicated that they are not sure  that there is not a potential for there  to be a security risk in light of port operations being in the hands of foreign  entities.  My concern, of course, in this whole  debate is the fact that we are dealing  with foreign entities in one of our most  difficult areas to secure. We know that  a ship laden with weapons of mass destruction  can  be  volatile  and  dangerous.  ",2006
55,House,109,-0.366,6,2006-02-28,Mr. PASCRELL.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to include these in the extension of remarks.  I want to speak in strong support of H.R.  1096—legislation to help restore the Thomas  Edison National Historic Site.  I congratulate  my colleague SCOTTGARRETT for introducing  this worthy legislation. It has been a privilege  to work closely with Representative GARRETT  and Representative DONPAYNE, whose district  houses a large portion of the Edison site, to  preserve this national treasure.  I am proud that I represent a region of New  Jersey  that has given birth  to some of  the  greatest  innovations  in our Nation’s history:  Thomas Edison’s Glenmont estate in West Orange and the Great Falls National Historic District  in Paterson—America’s First  Industrial  City. Each of these impressive areas—only 10  miles apart—sprang  from  the  imagination of  two of the great pioneers in American history:  Thomas Edison and Alexander Hamilton. Both  of  these sites—the Edison National Historic  Site and the Great Falls Historic District—have  been  included among  the most endangered  historic areas in our Nation. The artifacts of  both sites are in terrible physical condition and  are in grave peril of being lost to the country  forever.  Together, these majestic places tell the inspiring story of the rise of the greatest technological and economic power  the world has  ever known. I strongly believe that it is the role  of the Federal Government to partner with the  local community to preserve the glory of these  places for all future generations to behold.  Although these sites are both close to my  heart, I want to specifically voice my support  for  the preservation and rehabilitation of  the  Edison National Historic Site, which embodies  Edison’s  legacy as a pioneer of American  technology. The Edison National Historic Site,  encompassing Edison’s home and laboratory  complex,  is  regarded as one of America’s  original  research and development  facilities.  Half of Edison’s astonishing 1,093 patents  were earned during the 44 years he lived in  West Orange.  The classic inventions created at this site include the phonograph, electric generating systems, the dry storage battery, and the motion  picture camera. Edison left a vast collection of  artifacts, models, photographs, drawings, and  furnishings at the Edison site. In addition, he  left nearly 3,500 notebooks documenting every  experiment,  idea,  failure,  observation  and  business strategy of his long career.  Even as Thomas Edison lives on as one of  the leading visionaries of our time, his home  and labs have tragically fallen into severe disrepair due  to age-related decay. The public  and private sector must work together to ensure that adults and young people alike will always be able to rediscover the genius of Edison and the impact he has had on all of our  daily lives. The support of the National Park  Service has enabled the Edison Preservation  Foundation to create a vital public-private partnership to maintain the site as a major community and educational resource.  Despite  this progress, Congressional support through H.R. 1096 is vital to the Edison  site’s long-term success. The legislation is an  important symbol of Congress’s commitment  to preserving the legacy of one of America’s  most  influential  inventors and  to restoring a  Federal site that is a historic landmark. I urge  the House of Representatives to move forward  and approve this important legislation.  ",2006
56,House,109,-0.347,13,2006-02-28,Mr. GONZALEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong support of H. Res. 668 to give recognition where recognition is long overdue. With  this  resolution,  Congress  applauds  the  groundbreaking  significance  of  the  1966  NCAA Division I men’s basketball championship in which Texas Western upset the heavily  favored University of Kentucky. That year, the  Miners had an all-Black starting line-up, a first  in a national championship competition  that  helped change  the perception of Black athletes.  Texas Western Coach Don Haskins and his  players may not have set out to change history, but  they did. The 1966 championship  game helped pave the way for integration of  athletics, opening sports  to  the civil  rights  movement, often being dubbed, the Brown v.  Board of Education of sports. The next season,  the Southwest Conference was  integrated, and in 1967–68, Vanderbilt broke the  Southeast Conference color barrier.  Unfortunately, it has taken decades before  Coach Haskins and his players’ achievements  have been recognized. In 1966 there were no  trips to the White House or appearances on  the Ed Sullivan show, both customary for national champions. The team did not even receive national championship rings until  their  20-year reunion in 1986.  It is time to recognize the profound contribution to the civil rights movement that this game  spurred, and to recognize the 1966 NCAA Division  I men’s  basketball  champions,  the  Texas Western Miners. I urge my colleagues  in joining me in supporting this bipartisan legislation.  ",2006
57,House,109,0.602,13,2006-02-28,Mr. MARCHANT.," Mr. Speaker, today I recognize  the 40th anniversary of Texas Western’s 1966 NCAA Basketball Championship.  The title game had a profound impact on the  state of racial  integration  in sports and civil  rights in America.  On March 16, 1966, Coach Don Haskins led  the first ever all-Black starting lineup to play in  a major championship contest in a victory over  the heavily-favored Kentucky Wildcats.  Coach Haskins played high school basketball in Enid, Oklahoma, and in college at Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State). He  then  became a successful high school basketball  coach  in Texas. Haskins was a coach at  Dumas High School before becoming  the  head of  the men’s  team at Texas Western  College, now  the University of Texas at El  Paso, in 1961.  Haskins coached the Miners to 33 winning  seasons over the course of his career with the  Miners. He won seven Western Athletic Conference championships, four Western Athletic  Conference  tournament  titles, and made 21  post-season appearances. He established a  proud winning tradition in the community of El  Paso  that still exists  today. Coach Haskins  was voted in to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997.  The Texas Western Miners’ victory was a  watershed moment for diversity in college athletics. It helped expand the civil rights movement into the realm of sports. On January 13,  2006, Walt Disney Pictures  released Glory  Road, which tells the story of the historic 1966  season and pays tribute to the dedication and  bravery of Coach Haskins.  ",2006

The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman  from  Florida (Mr. KELLER) that the House  suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 668, as amended.  The question was taken.

60,House,109,-0.514,20,2006-02-28,Mr. RANGEL.," Thank you to the Tuskegee  Airmen. Thank you, America, for recognizing  these  battle-worn  soldiers.  God bless them and God bless America.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1259,  ‘‘to authorize  the President  to award a gold  medal on behalf of the Congress, collectively,  to the Tuskegee Airmen in recognition of their  unique military record, which inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces.’’  On July 19, 1941 the American Air Force  created an all black flight training program at  the  Tuskegee  Institute  in  Alabama.  The  Tuskegee Airmen were not only unique in their  military record, but they inspired revolutionary  reform in the Armed Forces, paving the way  for  integration of  the armed services  in  the  U.S.  The first class of cadets began in July 1941  with 13 men, all of whom had college degrees,  some with PhD’s and all had pilot’s licenses.  From  all  accounts,  the  training  of  the  Tuskegee Airmen was an experiment established to prove that ‘‘coloreds’’ were incapable  of operating expensive and complex combat  aircraft. Stationed in the segregated South, the  black cadets were denied rifles.  The Tuskegee Airmen were credited with  261 aircraft destroyed, 148 aircraft damaged,  15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions  over Italy and North Africa. They destroyed or  damaged over 950 units of ground transportation and escorted more than 200 bombing  missions. ‘‘We proved that the antidote to racism is excellence in performance,’’ said retired  Lt. Col. Herbert Carter, who started his military  career as a pilot and maintenance officer with  the Tuskegee Airmen’s 99th Fighter Squadron.  Clearly, the experiment, as it was called, was  an unqualified success.  The Tuskegee Airmen were awarded three  Presidential Unit Citations, 150 Distinguished  Flying Crosses and Legions of Merit, along  with the Red Star of Yugoslavia, nine Purple  Hearts, 14 Bronze Stars and more than 700  Air medals and clusters. It goes without question that the Tuskegee Airmen are deserving  of the Congressional Gold Medal.  I would like to thank Congressman RANGEL  for his work in bringing this legislation to the  floor of Congress, and his efforts in gathering  308 cosigners. This is an important, and long  overdue piece of  legislation.  I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to give  their support  to H.R. 1259, authorizing  ‘‘the  President to award a gold medal on behalf of  the Congress, collectively,  to  the Tuskegee  Airmen . . .’’  ",2006
61,House,109,0.249,20,2006-02-28,Mr. SCHWARZ of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, I have had the pleasure of  meeting the Tuskegee Airmen, the survivors, on a number of occasions. A  number of them live in my home State  of Michigan, especially Major General  Lucius Theus, who lived in Detroit, a  distinguished member of the Tuskegee  Airmen. They last rallied in Michigan  at Jackson, Michigan, in the summer  of 2004; and our colleague  from the  other body, Senator MCCAIN, and  I  were privileged to be at that meeting  and greet the airmen.  As the unit approached its first year  in action, it learned that it was being  transferred to the 332nd Fighter Group,  a unit activated at Tuskegee in mid-  1942 and transferred to Michigan in 1943  where  it  conducted  training  at  Selfridge Air Base and Oscoda Air  Base, both in the eastern side, on the  eastern side of the State of Michigan,  before deploying to Italy. The 332nd  was composed of four African American  squadrons, the 99th 100th, 301st, and  302nd under the command of Colonel  Davis.  Not long after arriving in Italy, the  members of the 332nd were heavily involved in combat missions. Assigned to  bomber escort with the 15th Air Force,  it escorted the bombers on missions  around Italy, flew on the raids to the  access oil refineries in Ploesti, Romania, and strafed German troops retreating from Greece. It established a reputation for protecting its bombers. The  pilots always followed Colonel Davis’  orders. Your  job  is  to protect  the  bombers and not chase enemy aircraft  for personal glory, he said. The Germans called the 332nd the Schwartze  Vogrl Menshen, the black birdmen, and  began to see a plane with a red tail as  something to fear.  On March 24, 1945, the 332nd went on  the longest mission flown by the 15th  Air  Force  to  the  Daimler-Benz  tankworks in Berlin. On this mission,  it downed three of the new Messerschmitt ME–262 jet fighters. The group  received a distinguished unit citation  for its performance that day.  At the end of the war, the Tuskegee  Airmen returned to an America that  was as segregated as the one they had  left.  b1600  Some of the veterans became leaders  in the  fight  for desegregation, both  military and civilian. With their own  community, they offered pride and encouragement. And to the white community they offered an example of the  equality of men. The Air Force became  desegregated in April of 1948. Unfortunately, the rest of the Nation would  take much  longer. But  there  is no  doubt  that  the  example,  professionalism,  and  expertise  of  the  Tuskegee Airmen hastened that day.  It is fitting today, then, Mr. Speaker,  that this bill would bestow the Congressional Gold Medal, our body’s highest expression of national appreciation  for  distinguished  achievements  and  contributions, upon the members of the  Tuskegee Airmen  in  recognition  of  their service to our country during  World War II and in the years after  that conflict. They are living examples  of what is possible when racism is defeated and opportunities are equally  available to all members of our great  country.  ",2006
62,House,109,-0.256,20,2006-02-28,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I cannot rise to the  heights of CHARLIERANGEL, but I rise  in tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen. For  years, it seems we have considered bills  honoring the contributions of these heroic airmen. It is about time this one  passed and passed with huge support.  Their achievements in support of our  efforts in World War II have inspired  books and movies. They have earned  decorations and awards for valor that  are too numerous to cite. As Mr. RANnoted, 992 graduated  from pilot  training at Tuskegee; 450 went overseas  to North Africa and Italy; some 150  died either in training or in combat  missions. And yet, though they were  shot down, not a single bomber, as Mr.  RANGELnoted, among the many they  escorted was ever shot down.  While  their accomplishments have  been recognized by the military, the  military  in truth cannot adequately  honor all of their accomplishments because these men fought and won other  battles that were not military in nature. They defied those who thought  they lacked the intelligence, the skills,  the courage, even the patriotism to fly  and fight. Their courage in the air is  legendary, but their courage on the  ground and in our society made their  achievements in the air all the more  meaningful and remarkable.  Today, the impact of the Tuskegee  Airmen reaches far beyond the skies of  Italy and North Africa. Their service  led to social changes in our country  that  include  the  integration of our  Armed Forces.

63,House,109,-0.438,27,2006-02-28,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  applaud the House Republican leadership  for  finally  standing up  to  the  President and saying no on this agreement, this $6.8 billion contract with  the company  from the United Arab  Emirates.  The problem, however, is more fundamental than just stopping this one. It  is what happens with national security  in our trade agreements. We are in the  middle of negotiating a trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates.  If this trade agreement had already  been signed, we could not back out of  this deal with this United Arab Emirates country. It would be an unfair  trade practice.  The administration and the Congress  have it exactly backwards. Before signing trade agreements, before negotiating a new trade agreement, we need a  provision to address national security  concerns  first. That means a review  about all the implications of national  security before we  sign  these  trade  agreements. That is why I am introducing legislation tonight to do just  that.  f  MARGARET  ROGERS  OF  BROOKSVILLE,  HONORING  GHIOTTO  FLORIDA  (Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to  revise and extend her remarks.)  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is March 1,  and  each March we  celebrate  the  achievements of our American women  during Women’s History Month.  This year I want to take the opportunity  to  honor Margaret  Rogers  Ghiotto from Brooksville, Florida. A  decorated and accomplished business  leader and humanitarian, she deserves  special recognition for her good work  and deeds throughout her 89 years. She  was a pillar in the Hernando County  community until her death earlier last  month. Her story is an inspiration to  all Americans, but especially women.  Known by her friends and family as  Weenie, her  success  as  a  businesswoman came at a time when a woman’s  place was supposed to be in the home.  She owned and managed Rogers Christmas House, as well as Jennings House  in Brooksville, Florida, that is on the  National Register.  It was with great reverence and admiration  that  friends,  family,  and  members of the community paid their  respects to Margaret on February 18,  2006. Margaret’s story is an inspiration  not only to women business owners but  to all residents throughout the Nation.  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET IT  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, I think it is important, as we  have participated in the rising thunder  of  the discussion of port ownership  around America, to say that the American people get it. What they get is  that we are in a new day after 9/11. We  want to make sure that our constitutional rights are protected, but we also  want to make sure the homeland is secure. That is the promise that this administration made  to  the American  people. And, frankly, to know that our  ports are subjected to the potential of  being bought and sold on the open market is a frightening concept.  It  is well known  that  a  tanker  massed with weapons of mass destruction at any one of our ports could be  probably more devastating than the  horrific events of 9/11. Tomorrow, I will  introduce legislation that will ask for a  moratorium for the Nation’s ports and  the buying and selling to foreign entities, not entities in the Middle East,  not entities in Europe, but all foreign  entities. I will ask, as well, for a GAO  study to determine what is the status  of security for our ports. And finally, I  will ask for a report on the security  status of the 10 largest ports in America.  Let’s give a solution. We don’t need  contracts that sell away our security.  f  HONORING  NATIONAL  PEACE  CORPS WEEK AND THE 45TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  PEACE  CORPS  (Mr. KLINE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

66,House,109,-0.656,34,2006-02-28,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to address the deteriorating situation in Iraq. Over the past 10 days, we  have seen a country on the brink of  civil war slide into civil war.  On February 22, a bomb exploded at  the Golden Mosque causing significant  damage to one of Shiite Islam’s holiest  shrines and setting off the latest and  most violent sectarian violence since  the war began in 2003.  Since the war began, we have witnessed almost daily bombings in Iraq.  Thousands of IEDs have been exploded.  Hundreds  of  suicide  bombings have  been staged. Tragically, the number of  such attacks has grown each year, a  stark contrast to the Vice President’s  prewar assessment that we would be  greeted as liberators.  According to the U.S. Department of  Defense, the number of insurgent attacks on our soldiers, Iraqi security  forces, and civilians increased 29 percent in 2005 when compared to 2004.  Specifically, the number of car bombs  increased to 873  in 2005, more than  twice of the number of car bombs in  2004, and the number of suicide car  bombs went to 411 from 133.  Conservative estimates suggest that  more than 30,000 Iraqi men, women and  children have been killed since the war  began. Unfortunately,  Iraqis are not  the only ones caught up in these attacks. More than 2,296 U.S. soldiers  have died in Iraq and more than 16,825  have been injured. And I am sorry, I do  not have the number of amputees or  suicides tonight. But they are serious.  Our very presence in Iraq fuels the  death, destruction and has helped create the civil war which now endangers  millions of lives. These are not just my  words. The same thoughts and sentiments are being  echoed  throughout  conservative America.  It was said here earlier tonight, William F. Buckley, Jr., the founder of  ‘‘The National Review’’ recently wrote,  ‘‘One cannot doubt that the American  objective in Iraq has failed.’’  Bill Kristol, one of the war’s staunchest defenders recently said, ‘‘We have  not had a serious 3-year effort to fight  a war in Iraq.’’  Even columnist George Will recently  described Iraq in this manner. ‘‘This is  a civil war,’’ he said.  The bombing of the Golden Mosque  pushed Iraq over the edge. Thousands  of Iraqis are in the streets protesting  and others are attacking their historical  enemies  in  retaliation  to  the  bombing of the Golden Mosque.  According  to  today’s Washington  Post, more than 1,300 individuals have  been killed, and more than 1,000 Sunni  mosques have been attacked since last  week’s bombing of the Golden Mosque.  Instead of putting a stop to the violence, Iraq’s security forces are contributing to the murders. It is clear  that some Iraqis have joined the Iraq  Army  to  continue  family or  tribal  feuds under the protection of the Iraqi  military uniform and that many Iraqis  do not trust the military because of  ethnic divisions.  This is a stark difference from the  President’s words that the Iraqis are  successfully assuming the role of protecting their fellow countrymen. It is  very interesting to note that the very  week that Iraq has seen the most violent sectarian violence in years, the  Defense Department announced  that  the number of Iraqi Army battalions  capable  of  fighting  the  insurgency  without U.S. help had fallen from one  to none since September 2005.  Last  summer,  a  defense  official  claimed that there were three battalions ready to take on the insurgency.  However,  in September 2005, General  George Casey, the top U.S. commander  in Iraq, told the Senate Armed Services  Committee that the number of Iraqi  battalions  capable of  fighting  independently of U.S. troops had dropped  from three to one. Therefore, despite 3  years and more than $260 billion, we  find that the number continues to decrease.  Now, the President  is asking Congress to pass a supplemental appropriations request of $75 billion for the Iraq  war, the war on terrorism, and the gulf  coast recovery efforts. The lion’s share  of this money, about $63 billion, is for  the Iraq war. If this bill passes, the  total amount we will have spent on the  war will be over $350 billion.  The President is asking us to spend $350  billion a war  that his Administration claimed  would be of minimal cost  to American  taxpayers.  Perhaps worse,  the President wants  to  spend hundreds of billions of dollars on this  war at a time when the Congress is pushing  through  tens of billions of dollars  in cuts  to  Medicare, education, Community Development  Block Grants and other important programs.  Mr. Speaker, the Administration has failed. It  is long past time for our troops to come home.  Civil war has broken out—we can not expect  our soldiers  to  try  to sort out which side  is  which in this civil war and we should not take  sides.  I urge  the President  to conclude  this  war and bring our troops home.  f  b2030  MARKING THE 18TH ANNIVERSARY  OF THE SUMGAIT MASSACRES  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  CONAWAY).

68,House,109,-0.201,48,2006-02-28,Mr. ROSS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman from Georgia for joining us  this evening, and I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for joining us.  As members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, we are 37  strong. There are 37 of us in this town  that are committed to trying to get  our fiscal house in order, to once again  have a nation that knows how to live  within its means.  If you have questions or comments  that you want us to answer next Tuesday night, you can e-mail them to us  at bluedog@mail.house.gov.  At the beginning of our hour, I pointed out that the debt as of today is  $8,251,355,000,000.  That  is  $8,251,355,000,000. Every man, woman,  and child in America, their share of the  national debt  is $27,674. And  it continues to grow. It continues to grow. In  fact, just in this last hour our Nation’s  debt has increased by $41.666 million.  So, obviously, you see when we started  an hour ago  it was $8,251,355,000,000,  and, unfortunately, it has increased to  $8.293 trillion. Just another example of  how our Nation must get  its  fiscal  house in order.  I think it is very appropriate that we  spend a  little bit of time changing  these numbers and letting people see  that in the hour that we have stood  here talking about our Nation’s debt  and deficit and getting our fiscal house  in order, we have seen the Nation’s  debt go up by $41.666 million. The debt  now in our Nation $8,251,293,000,000.  f  AMERICAN HERITAGE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  DAVISof Kentucky). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 4,  2005, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  PRICE) is recognized for half the time  remaining  until midnight,  approximately 42 minutes.  ",2006
69,House,109,0.644,48,2006-02-28,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I  appreciate  the opportunity  to come  and chat with the House and to maybe  set the record straight a little bit.  As a freshman Member of the House,  we have 24, 25 freshmen on our side of  the aisle, and over the past 13 months  we have grown a little weary with what  we see as the amount of misinformation and disinformation that we so oftentimes see brought by the other side,  so we have developed what we call the  Official Truth Squad. And so I am here  to bring you some messages with some  of my  colleagues  from  the Official  Truth Squad, which is an effort to try  to embrace the American Dream, to  embrace the American vision, and to  present to the American people and our  colleagues the story that Congress is  working in a positive manner, that we  are optimistic about the Nation’s future in spite of some things that you  hear from some of our friends on the  other side of the aisle.  When I go home and I talk to constituents, I oftentimes hear them say,  What is going on up there? Why all the  negativity? Why all  the pessimism?  Why all the misinformation that we  appear to hear all the time? And I commiserate with them. So this Official  Truth Squad is an attempt to try to  bring some light to truth, to some of  the  information that we believe the  American people ought to have in contrast to some of the things that you  have heard, even here tonight.  I am pleased to hear the Blue Dogs  present a proposal or two. They talk  about being fiscally conservative. They  talk about being fiscal hawks. But my  recollection is a little bit to the contrary of that. There  is a wonderful  quote that I like from Daniel Patrick  Moynihan, a former United States Senator from New York, Democrat. And he  was such a cogent individual. He was  one of those individuals who worked  for the truth regardless of where it led.  And he had this wonderful quote. He  said,  ‘‘Everyone  is entitled to their  own opinion but not their own facts.’’  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. And I really think that that kind of crystallizes  what we have heard in this Chamber  over the past few minutes.  You have heard the other side talk  about deficit  spending and how we  ought not be spending into the deficit,  and they are right. They are right. But  when they had an opportunity to decrease spending by nearly $40 billion  just a few short weeks ago, not a single  one of them, not one of them, voted for  it. A $39.8 billion decrease in spending  and not a single one voted in favor of  it.  You heard them talk about the alternative minimum tax and how it is an  unjust tax and it needs to go away, and  they are right. They are right. A colleague of mine, Congressman ENGLISH,  has a bill, H.R. 1186, that would repeal  the alternative minimum tax. Not a  single Democrat on that bill, not a single cosponsor  from that side of the  aisle.  You hear them talk about the need  to balance the budget and not spend so  much money, and they are right. They  are absolutely right. But when the proposals are put on the table to do away  with programs that are wasteful or do  away with programs that have significant abuse, where are they? Nowhere  to be found.  So you are entitled to your own opinions, but you are not entitled to your  own facts. And to crystallize that a little more because the disinformation  that we heard over and over about  budgetary cuts really does a disservice  to the debate, does a disservice to the  discussion, does a disservice  to  the  American people, because when you  look at the numbers, when you look at  the truth, that is not what is going on.  And this evening you have heard the  other side talk about budgetary cuts in  the area of defense spending and spending on veterans. So, at home, if I were  sitting there  listening,  I would say,  well, my goodness, they must have addressed the amount of money that was  going to the military or decreased the  amount of money going to veterans.  Mr. Speaker, is that not what you  would think? That  is what  I would  think if I heard that. But here we have  the Defense Department appropriation,  budgetary  authority  from  Congress  from the year 2000 projected through  2007. In 2000 it was $287 billion. In 2001  it was $303 billion. That does not sound  like a cut to me. In 2002, $328 billion.  That  is real money. That does not  sound like a cut to me. In 2003, $365 billion.  Remember, down here in 2000 we were  at $287 billion.  So these are the actual numbers. Fiscal year 2006, $411 billion of budgetary  authority for the Department of Defense. Mr. Speaker, that is not a cut.  That  is responsible spending on the  part of the United States Congress.  And I am proud of the support that we  have given to our military. And I am  proud of the support that we continue  to give to veterans.  You have heard this evening that  veterans’ budgets were cut. Here are  the numbers, the actual numbers, from  1984 through 2005, and I want to draw  your attention to what has happened in  the last 10 years. In 1994 discretionary  spending  for  veterans:  $17.2  billion;  1995, $17.6 billion; 2005, $30.7 billion.  Mr. Speaker, I do not know what  arithmetic they are using. I do not  know where they went to school, but I  do know that that is not a cut in anybody’s book.  So when we get this kind of misinformation, this kind of disinformation,  it does not contribute to the public debate. It is not honest. It is not truthful.  So the Official Truth Squad is here to  try to bring some truth to the situation.  This is veterans’ medical care, and  you heard it talked about this evening,  how we have these incredible cuts in  medical care for veterans. Mr. Speaker,  here are the numbers: 1994, $15.6 billion; 2005, $29.9 billion. Mr. Speaker,  that is not a cut. It is an appropriate,  responsible move by Congress to take  care of those who are protecting our  freedoms.  So  remember what Mr. Moynihan  said, You are welcome to your own  opinions but you are not welcome to  your own facts.  So  I would  like to highlight this  evening what is called the politics of  division that seems to be practiced by  so many here in Washington, and it is  disheartening and it does a disservice  to all of us. We are going to talk tonight in a positive way about America.  We are going to talk in a positive way  about our future. We are going to talk  in a positive way about our Founding  Fathers and about our history and  about our heritage.

70,House,109,-0.434,55,2006-02-28,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, our nation’s history  is  interwoven with  the accomplishments  and contributions of African Americans—from  Hank Aaron, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong to George Washington Carver, W.E.B.  Du Bois, and Maya Angelou—and because of  their efforts our nation is stronger. The African  American community recently  lost  two of  its  leaders and as we mourn the passing of Rosa  Parks and Coretta Scott King, we should be  reminded that we must continue the civil rights  work they devoted their lives to. What better  way to celebrate the legacy of these leaders  and all of those who have worked to ensure  racial justice than by reauthorizing the expiring  portions of the Voting Rights Act. The struggle  for civil rights continues today and we must  make certain that all citizens not only have the  right  to vote, but  that  their ability  to vote  is  protected.  Although the Voting Rights Act has been essential in protecting the voting rights of minorities, additional safeguards are necessary  to  ensure  that every citizen  is  included  in  the  election process.  I remain committed  to  furthering the causes of the Civil Rights Movement and will work hard in the coming months  to guarantee the right to vote for every citizen.  I hope that this month we will celebrate the  lives of all of the strong and determined men  and women who have worked  to ensure  equality for all Americans.  ",2006

Each Congress, Senator KENNEDY and  I  introduce hate  crimes legislation that would add new  categories to current hate crimes law,  sending a signal that violence of any  kind  is unacceptable  in our society.  Likewise, each Congress I have come to  the floor to highlight a separate hate  crime that has occurred in our country.  On June 15, 2005, Dwan Prince was  savagely beaten by three men as Prince  stood outside of his apartment building  in New York, NY. The apparent motivation for the attack was Prince’s sexual orientation. According to police,  the three attackers shouted anti-gay  slurs throughout the attack on Prince.  I believe that the Government’s first  duty is to defend its citizens, to defend  them against the harms that are born  out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act  is a symbol  that can become substance. I believe  that by passing this  legislation and  changing current law, we can change  hearts and minds as well.  f  LETTER ON THIRD ARMORED  CAVALRY REGIMENT  ",2006

With  the Oscars soon approaching,  television sets around the Nation will be tuned in  to watch movie stars as they stroll down the  red carpet, hoping  to  receive  the Academy  Award, an internationally recognized symbol of  excellence in film. While the main attraction of  the night may be the directors, actors, and film  makers receiving the awards, the 131⁄2 inch,  gold-plated statuettes hold an important place  in the night’s event and traditions.  R.S. Owens  is  the Chicago-based award-  manufacturing company  responsible  for producing  the world-renowned Academy Award.  Since they were recommended for the manufacturing of the award in 1983, the academy  has  selected R.S. Owens  to produce  the  statuettes year after year,  in  recognition of  their fine work in the field of award design and  production and of their exemplary dedication  to the craft.  R.S. Owens has been  involved  in awards  manufacturing since 1938. It began, as many  great things do, as a small idea from an enterprising man, Owen Siegel. His idea has grown  from a small dream into one of the most successful award manufacturing companies in the  United States.  While so many companies in the manufacturing field have turned to automated machine  work, R.S. Owens has remained grounded primarily  in handwork. The company employs  workers who are masters  in  their craft, and  take great pride  in  their work—pride  that  is  evident in the quality of award they continually  produce  in a  field where  the product  is so  closely scrutinized as  to allow no errors  in  workmanship.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I  recognize the excellent craftsmanship of R.S.  Owens & Company in their production of the  Academy Award. The company’s  fine work  and dedication make it an excellent example  of flourishing businesses throughout Chicago.  It is an honor to know that such an innovative  and  responsible company calls Chicago  its  home. On behalf of the Fifth District of Illinois  and  the city of Chicago,  I congratulate R.S.  Owens on their continued excellence in their  field, and look forward to the showcase of this  year’s batch of awards at the ceremony this  March.  f  TRIBUTE TO PASTOR CATO  BROOKS, JR.  HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2006  ",2006
79,,109,-0.262,118,2006-02-28,Ms. HARMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  last week  I  stood at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long  Beach, the largest container port complex in  the nation, with my good friend Senator SUSAN  the chair of  the Senate Committee  on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  We both have  championed  the  fight  to  strengthen security at our ports. As of  last  week, neither of us had been briefed on the  review conducted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS,  into the sale of stevedoring and terminal operations of many major eastern seaboard and  Gulf Coast ports to a state-owned firm from  Dubai. This sale would not only affect the six  major US port terminal facility leases that have  been reported, but additional operations in 15  other locations, including ports shipping military materiel.  Last week, we stated our concerns about  the announced sale and our plan to issue a  Joint Resolution of Disapproval.  Today,  I am  introducing  in  the House  the  Joint Resolution which Senator COLLINS introduced yesterday, S.J. Res. 32. This resolution  would do  three  things. First,  it officially disapproves of CFIUS’s initial review of the Dubai  Ports World deal. Second, it requires CFIUS  to rescind its previous decision and conduct a  formal 45-day investigation. Third, it requires  that CFIUS brief the Congress before allowing  the deal to proceed, if in fact that is the decision after a full, complete and proper evaluation of the national security risks posed by this  arrangement.  Since Senator COLLINSand I announced our  intentions  last week,  there has been some  progress. Dubai Ports World has agreed to a  secondary  review,  the  Administration  has  agreed to a 45-day assessment of the sale,  and, beginning this week, some committees of  Congress will now be briefed.  But the bad news is that this process got as  far as it did, and that it took deep bipartisan  concern  to have Congress brought  into  the  loop. When our country considers  these  important deals, Congress should be on the front  lines, not the back bench.  And as we heard yesterday from a Senate  briefing, the U.S. Coast Guard cited their concerns over  the deal at  the  time. The U.S.  Coast Guard plays a critical role in ensuring  the security of our ports, and their reservations  make me question why  this deal was approved as quickly as it was.  This issue has also served to highlight the  fact  that  our Nation’s  ports  remain  inadequately protected.  As a member of both the House Intelligence  and Homeland Security Committees,  I have  consistently worked  to  improve our national  security, and believe much  remains  to be  done. When we focus 9 out of 10 transportation security dollars on aviation security, we  fall into the trap of fighting the last war instead  of the next one. Fighting terror requires that  we  look  forward, and what keeps me up at  night is the possibility of a radiological bomb  or human  terrorist entering our ports  in an  uninspected container.  When it comes to port security, we should  have solid answers, not lingering questions. In  this Era of Terror, there remains a constant  threat to our homeland. We don’t have the luxury of waiting to harden the obvious vulnerable targets.  I have visited the Los Angeles/Long Beach  port complex many times. I have authored and  co-authored bipartisan port security legislation.  Representative DANLUNGRENand I will introduce a comprehensive bill soon to ensure a  coordinated approach to maritime and cargo  security through the authorization of key security programs and initiatives, as well as a dedicated funding grant program to shore up security gaps that exist at our Nation’s ports. Senators COLLINS, LIEBERMAN, and COLEMANhave  introduced similar  legislation  in  the Senate,  and both bills will be the subject of hearings  in this Congress.  This resolution on CFIUS is prudent; so are  our efforts to legislate enhanced port security.  I urge its support.  f  TRIBUTE TO MINNESOTA  STATE  REPRESENTATIVES NEVA WALKER AND KEITH ELLISON  HON. MARTIN OLAV SABO  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2006  ",2006
80,,109,-0.516,118,2006-02-28,Mr. SABO.," Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to  celebrate Black History Month by recognizing  distinguished Minnesota  legislators who are  civil and human  rights  leaders: Minnesota  State Representatives Neva Walker and Keith  Ellison.  Representative Neva Walker was born and  raised in Minneapolis, and attended the University of Minnesota. A ‘‘community baby,’’ as  referred  to by elders, Walker comes  from a  family deeply involved in the community, especially the Sabathani Community Center which  is a pillar of the community and a source of  assistance to many. Walker grew up with this  sort of activism, and she now embodies it herself.  Representative Walker was encouraged  to  run for office when lobbying Minneapolis City  Hall on housing issues. When she learned that  no African American woman had served in the  Minnesota Legislature, this firmed her resolve  to run for office. In 2000, Neva Walker was  elected  to  the Minnesota House where she  continues  to address disparities of all kinds:  health, poverty,  racial profiling and out-of-  home placement.  Representative Walker has a son, and is the  youngest of seven children herself. In addition  to her service in the State House, Rep. Walker  contributes with many  community  involvements such as the Blaisdell YMCA board, the  ‘‘GirlsBEST’’  initiative  through  the Women’s  Foundation of Minnesota, and the Minneapolis  Youth Coordinating Board. She  takes every  opportunity reach out to people, speaking to  groups that range from children in daycare to  college students.  ‘‘I consider myself a seed planter,’’ Walker  said about her efforts.  ‘‘I’m always  trying  to  educate and bring useful information to people, especially youth, people of color and  women.’’  Representative Walker believes it critical to  get civil rights  issues back  into  the public’s  eye. Disparities in poverty and the justice system are too great to stand idly by, she said.  Representative Keith Ellison was born  in  Detroit, attended Wayne State University and  then came to Minneapolis to attend the University of Minnesota Law School. As a student, he first got involved in the anti-Apartheid  movement. He and his wife have four children.  ‘‘I was raised in a household where I was  encouraged to question things,’’ he said. His  grandfather had worked for voting rights, and  Ellison grew up listening to stories of those experiences. Ellison’s activism continued, and  evolved into his profession as a trial lawyer,  working on death penalty cases in Louisiana,  as well as indigent defense work. Today at the  Ellison Law Office, his legal work consists of  criminal cases, civil rights cases and  family  law.  Ellison was  first elected  to  the Minnesota  House of Representatives  in 2002. He said  that instead of cajoling and persuading government leaders to pursue worthy programs,  he was determined to work for change from  inside the system.  ‘‘When you’re a community activist, you propose change,’’ he said. ‘‘But when you’re in  office as a public official,  you make  the  change.’’ As one of two black Representatives  in Minnesota, Ellison believes he helps to improve the level of engagement for people of  color in the state. ‘‘I think all people need to  have equal access to their government.’’  He continues to work on issues of environmental justice, equal justice in the courts, voting rights, and public safety. He is also a cofounder of  the Environmental Justice Advocates of Minnesota, which deals with environmental hazards posed by pollution.  Ellison believes  that  the civil rights movement forever changed America, but that Americans must still work  for economic, health,  educational and social equality for all people.  Mr. Speaker, Neva Walker and Keith Ellison  are dedicated public servants who are making  unique  contributions  to  their  communities,  working for all people, but especially African  Americans and other people of color, women,  and the poor. They are committed to bringing  the promise of America to all its people, and  work day in and day out to achieve that ideal.  I commend them for their activism and their  service in the Minnesota Legislature, and their  dedication  to making  their communities, our  State, and our world a better place.  f  IN MEMORIAM THEODORE R.  ‘‘TED’’ SWEM  HON.

81,,109,-0.283,125,2006-02-28,Mr. MICHAUD.," Mr. Speaker, early  in November  I had  the pleasure of attending  the  opening of the Lincolnville Central School in  Lincolnville, ME. In Lincolnville, as in so many  small towns across this country, the local elementary school  is an  important part of  the  community.  As Lincolnville opens a modern new school  building, it honors its past by displaying an old  bell, formerly housed in the old school building. The old bell will be a  reminder of  the  many teachers, staff, and students who were  a part of the old school. It will challenge the  Lincolnville community to continue its long tradition of quality education.  The school bell is named for Rufus Knight,  a former teacher at the old Lincolnville school.  The bell was honored in a poem by his great-  grandson, John A. Knight, which was read at  the school opening:  This is the bell that called to us to drink at  springs of learning.  This is the voice of the silver tongue that  satisfied our yearning.  The tocsin sound of wisdom this ancient bell  awakened and horizons of us  rural  folks no longer were forsaken.  The light of education Our knowledge is expanding. This ancient bell awoke in us  deep thoughts of understanding.  And, for many generations we did study and  excel with the beauteous sounding of  this old bell.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE WORK OF  HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATE JOHN  P. SALZBERG, PH.D.  HON. BETTY McCOLLUM  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2006  ",2006
82,,109,-0.589,132,2006-02-28,Mr. LEWIS of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in vehement opposition to the proposed elimination  of National Youth Sports Program  (NYSP) funding, contained in the President’s  Budget Request, for the second year in a row.  I am concerned that some of my colleagues  may not understand the severity of the situation that NYSP is facing. If Congress does not  provide full FY07 funding for NYSP, the program will be forced to close its doors. This will  result in 75,000 of our nation’s most vulnerable youth, being left behind next summer.  NYSP uses sports instruction and competition, as a vehicle to enhance self-esteem and  respect, among boys and girls  from  low-income households. Established in 1969, with a  $3 million funding commitment from the White  House, NYSP has provided over 2 million participants with  instruction  in career and educational opportunities, and exposure  to  the  college environment for nearly four decades.  Because I have witnessed, firsthand, the difference that the NYSP program has made in  the  lives of under served youth  in my Congressional District  I  cannot,  in good  conscience, sit idly by as this essential program is  dismantled.  In my  Congressional  District,  Morehouse College has done an outstanding  job of running the NYSP program for nearly  four decades, serving over 10,000 children  throughout Atlanta. The Morehouse College  NYSP program  is unique, because  it has  taken great pains to maintain a balance between athletics and academics. Similar  to  NYSP programs throughout the nation, Morehouse College offers  instruction  focusing on  sports. However, it also includes additional instruction  in areas  such as: nutrition, drug  awareness and prevention, creative writing,  and leadership development.  The NYSP program has a tremendous impact on the youth that it serves in my Congressional District. By placing NYSP participants  in academic settings, where  they  receive hundreds of hours of exposure  to  the  benefits of higher education, the participants  begin to believe that they, too, can succeed in  college and beyond. Furthermore,  the mentoring  relationships established between  the  teaching/coaching staff, college student volunteers, and NYSP participants, have resulted in  hundreds of former NYSP participants returning to work in the program at Morehouse College as student volunteers.  Mr. Speaker, NYSP  is not asking  for a  handout from Congress. In fact, in 2005 NYSP  secured  two-thirds of  its operating expenses  from other public and private sources, such as  the National Collegiate Athletic Association  (NCAA) and  the 202 selected  institutions of  higher education with which  it partners. The  Administration knows that NYSP works. Congress knows that NYSP works. Institutions of  higher learning in 47 states and the District of  Columbia know that NYSP works. Most imporf  TRIBUTE TO MARCIA S. SMITH  HON. SHERWOOD BOEHLERT  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2006  ",2006
83,,109,0.103,132,2006-02-28,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, today I would  like  to draw our colleagues’ attention  to  the  pending retirement of Marcia S. Smith  from  the Congressional Research Service after over  thirty years of service to Congress. Marcia is  one of  the preeminent and most highly  respected policy analysts in her field, and while  she will remain an active figure in space and  telecommunications  policy  at  the National  Academy of Sciences, her intelligence, expertise, objectivity and balance will be greatly  missed on both sides of Capitol Hill.  Marcia Smith began her career at the Congressional Research Service  in 1975, after  graduating  from Syracuse University with a  degree  in political science. She quickly became an accomplished and adept analyst in  space and aerospace policy,  rising  to Specialist in Aerospace and Telecommunications  Policy, first in the Science Policy Research Division, and  then  in  the Resources, Science  and Industry Division, of CRS. In her service  to Congress, she has provided background  and analytic reports, memoranda, committee  prints and expert  testimony  to Members of  Congress and committees of  the U.S. Congress on matters concerning U.S. and foreign  military and civilian space activities, and on  telecommunications  issues  (and  formerly on  nuclear energy).  Marcia has been a mentor and advisor to  over a dozen CRS analysts and researchers  during her time in that organization. She was  Section Head for Space and Defense Technologies from 1987–1991, and Section Head  for Energy, Aerospace  and Transportation  Technologies from 1984–1985.  To give my colleagues an idea of how prolific and proficient Marcia Smith has been during service to Congress, she has authored or  coauthored over 160 reports and articles on  space,  nuclear  energy,  and  telecommunications policies and issues. She has testified  as an expert witness before House and Senate Committees nearly 20 times, a significant  number of  those  times  in  front of  the committee I chair, the Committee on Science.  I would like to point out 2 instances in which  Marcia has served both Congress and her  country in an exemplary manner. In both instances, these were circumstances marked by  tragedy—when the Space Shuttle Challenger  was lost at launch on January 28, 1986, and  again when the Space Shuttle Columbia was  lost during re-entry on February 1, 2003. Within hours of  the Challenger disaster, Marcia  was briefing congressional staff and talking to  Members of Congress about  the  technical,  policy, and human costs of this accident. She  was widely interviewed and quoted by the national and  international news media. And  in  the painful months  following  the accident,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:29 Mar 01, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A28FE8.095 E28FEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o y r r e h c y         ",2006
84,,109,-0.204,139,2006-02-28,Mr. GORDON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  thank Libby Johnson for her tremendous service  to Tennessee’s Sixth Congressional District while working in my Washington, D.C., office.  After serving as my executive assistant, the  Sumner County native is moving on to greener  pastures. Her last day is today, and although  my staff and I are sad to see Libby go, we are  glad she has taken a job that will further her  career and is worthy of her incredible abilities.  Libby’s conscientious work ethic and incomparable enthusiasm have served her well  in  the  fast-paced world  of Congress. Those  same abilities also have gained her  the respect of her colleagues. Now, she will share  her tremendous abilities and experience with a  new employer, who should be ecstatic over  having found such a fine person.  As busy as she has been, Libby always  took time to say a kind word to those around  her. It seems she has never met a stranger  during her time on the Hill. With her vivacious  personality and contagious smile, she certainly  has made a lasting impression on virtually everyone she has met.  Libby, you have endeared yourself  to me  and my staff. We will miss you and wish you  well in your future endeavors.  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO KEKAHA  FEDERAL CREDIT UNION  HON. ED CASE  OFHAWAII  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2006  ",2006
85,,109,-0.205,139,2006-02-28,Mr. CASE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the Kekaha Federal  Credit Union on winning the 2005 Dora Maxwell Social Responsibility Award.  Chartered in 1938 to serve the employees  of  the Kekaha Sugar Company,  the Kekaha  Federal Credit Union has expanded its membership to include all businesses and individuals  throughout  the  island of Kauai.  It also  acts as a Community Development Credit  Union, catering to the financial needs of low-  income individuals. The Kekaha Federal Credit  Union has over 1,500 members.  In January 2004, the Kekaha Federal Credit  Union initiated a partnership with the Kekaha  Elementary School to support and encourage  student achievement and  raise school-wide  standardized rest scores. Kekaha Elementary  School serves a community of 3,700  residents, dominated by  low-income, native Hawaiian and immigrant families. At the school,  11 percent of the student body speak English  as a second language, 49 percent are Native  Hawaiian (a historically disadvantaged group),  and 62 percent qualify  for  free or  reduced  lunches due to low-income status. Many students live in single-parent homes or face situations that are not conducive to learning.  As part of their partnership, the credit union  and  the  school  established  the Maximum  Communication Journal program, also known  as the MAX Program. The MAX Program has  become  the cornerstone  to  learning at  the  school, as students must keep a  journal of  class activities and homework, including notes  and notices  from  teachers and  the school.  Each student is then required to have his/her  parents or guardians read and sign the MAX  notebook each week. This ensures communication between the students, parents, teachers, and the school.  With  the  incentive of prizes  that  include  boogie boards, movie passes and bicycles,  students are instructed to write in their MAX  journals and have their parents read and sign  it every week. In order to earn a chance to win  a prize, students have to write in their MAX  journals and have their parents read and sign  it every week. Prizes were also given to the  class with  the highest percentage of completed and signed journals. Prizes are given at  the school’s monthly assembly. Often, parents  and guardians attend these assemblies.  By all measures, this program has been a  great success. The program’s goal of 80 percent student participation has been achieved  for the past four semesters and, more importantly,  Kekaha  Elementary  School  has  achieved passing levels in the State of Hawaii  standardized tests each of the last two times  the tests have been administered.  Students and parents alike are excited and  have a sense of accomplishment. Billy Smith,  the principal of Kekaha Elementary School,  explained:  ‘‘The celebration assemblies are  fun and crazy. Parents are invited to attend  and the kids are happy and excited.’’ Students  have become more responsible as they see  tangible results for their MAX participation.  Dora Maxwell is recognized as one of the  original pioneers of  the credit union movement. This award was created to promote social responsibility among credit unions by formally recognizing and celebrating their social  achievements. The Dora Maxwell Social Responsibility Recognition Award is awarded to  credit unions, based on seven asset-size categories, and  to  specific  chapters  for outstanding social  responsibility projects  in  the  community in which they are located.  I want to recognize and commend Kekaha  Federal Credit Union not only for sponsoring  this important and innovative program, but for  receiving this national recognition by the Credit Union National Association. This award  is  just another example of  the great work and  strong personal  relationships  that our credit  unions provide  their respective communities,  and  represents a perfect union of  the very  best of credit unions and community service.

Reverend Atkins is a vital part of the  religious  community  in  northwest  North Carolina’s rural mountain region. Prior to leading 350 members at  Courtney Baptist Church, he served at  Zephyr Baptist  Church  in Dobson,  North Carolina, from 1995 to 2000, and  at Oak Grove Baptist Church in Madison, North Carolina, from 2000 to 2005.  He graduated from Fruitland Bible Institute in 2000 with an associate’s degree in biblical ministries.  Reverend Atkins was born and raised  in Mt. Airy, North Carolina. He is the  son of Tommy and Rebecca Atkins,  whose  support was  instrumental  in  helping him get to Washington today.  Reverend Atkins and his wife, Debbie,  currently reside  in Yadkinville with  their two children Alison and Lee.  Reverend Atkins’ life has been one of  service  to God and his community.  Throughout the years he has brightened and enriched the lives of many  others. It is an honor to have him serve  as our guest chaplain. I hope that his  words of prayer will remain with all of  us as we do the people’s work today.  f  ON THE CHILDREN’S SAFETY AND  VIOLENT  CRIME  REDUCTION  ACT, H.R. 4472  (Mr. KELLER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2006
87,,109,0.458,1,2006-03-08,Mr. KELLER.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today in strong support of the Children’s Safety and Violent Crime Reduction Act, because it is a commonsense  way to protect our schoolchildren from  pedophiles. Isn’t it a matter of common  sense to allow a local school district in  Orlando, Florida, to do criminal background checks on coaches, janitors and  teachers who work with our children to  make  sure  they  are not  convicted  pedophiles from Georgia or some other  State?  Isn’t  it common  sense  to protect  young schoolchildren in the first place  by keeping these pedophiles locked up  with lengthy prison sentences?  Isn’t it common sense that coddling  repeated sex offenders with self-esteem  courses  and  rehabilitation  doesn’t  work, and that locking them up works?  It is high time that we crack down on  molesters by implementing these commonsense  reforms.  I  urge my  colleagues  to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on H.R.  4472  today.  f  PORT SECURITY AND REPUBLICAN  FAILURES TO SECURE OUR NATION  (Mr. CARDOZA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

That outrage should be extended to  this administration’s pathetic record  on securing our ports and our coastlines.  Since September 11th, according to  the U.S. Coast Guard, the Republican  Congress has shortchanged America’s  seaports by more than $4 billion in security improvements. It is because of  this serious lack of funding that only 6  percent of the cargo coming into our  ports is ever checked.

I also want to thank Chairman  SENSENBRENNER for his solid effort in  making sure that this House is once  again on record in working to protect  our children and our families.  I am pleased that an amendment that  I offered to the original legislation last  year, which was adopted with a unanimous vote, is included once again in today’s final bill.  My amendment requires the GAO to  study the feasibility of implementing  on a nationwide basis a tough annual  driver’s  license  registration  requirement that my home State of Nevada  has imposed on sex offenders.  Just last month, it was reported that  there are almost 2,000 convicted sex offenders living in Nevada that are out of  compliance with these registration requirements. Something must be done  to fix this problem. It is nationwide.  This bill takes a huge step forward in  protecting the most vulnerable among  us, our children.  b1145  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this critical bill and send a message to all that preying on our children  will not be tolerated anytime, anywhere.

92,House,109,-0.266,36,2006-03-08,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Talk, talk, talk. The time for talking  is over. Last week I had the opportunity to stand with people whose children have been taken from them, children who were  victims  of  horrific  crimes. So that their children not die  in vain, these wonderful people, including Linda Walker, who is the mother of  Drew Sjodin who lost her life in North  Dakota, have focused their energies on  trying to help keep other children safe  and to keep them safe by giving families the information about dangerous,  high-risk sexual predators who are living in their communities.  It is time we move this bill forward  so that it might be conferenced with  action the Senate would take on similar legislation. I am not happy with the  Senate’s handling of this proposal, not  one bit, but I am not going to let some  quest for perfection delay our efforts to  make our  families safer any  longer.  These families want action now, and  this Congress should give it to them.  Vote for this bill.  ",2006
93,House,109,0.593,36,2006-03-08,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to  thank the chairman for making sure  that our children are safer. The days of  child predators playing hide and seek  are over in this country. No longer will  they be able to hide in our communities and seek out our children as  their prey.  The national registration in this bill  will help protect our children so that  when child molesters leave our penitentiaries and move about from State  to State, we will be able to keep up  with them.  As many Members of the House, I am  the  parent  of  four  children,  three  grandchildren and two on the way. I  have met with parents who have lost  their children to child predators who  left penitentiaries and preyed against  them. Mark Lunsford and Marc Klaas  both came to Washington to talk about  the  loss of  their children  to  these  criminals.  We need to have a response, and the  first duty of government, which is to  protect the public and to protect our  children, is the greatest cause that we  can be involved in. As a member of the  Victims Rights Caucus that was started with KATHERINE and JIM  COSTA, we support these efforts and applaud this act.  ",2006
94,House,109,-0.53,36,2006-03-08,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  not to address the substance of this  bill, but to address a matter that is  most unfortunately missing from this  bill. Today we consider H.R. 4472, the  Children’s Safety and Violent Crime  Reduction Act of 2005, under the suspension  calendar, which,  of  course,  means that amendments cannot be offered.  This bill encompasses H.R. 3132, the  Children’s Safety Act of 2005, which  passed the House in September of 2005.  When that bill was considered on the  floor, a hate crimes amendment was offered by the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. CONYERS), and  it passed by a  strong bipartisan vote of 223—199. Yet  despite that strong bipartisan support  from the Members of this Chamber, the  hate crimes provision has been stripped  out of the bill before us today, and  there is simply no good reason for the  House to consider H.R. 4472 without  hate crimes language.  One cannot fully address the issues of  crime reduction and child safety without acknowledging the terrorizing impact hate-motivated violence has  in  HARRIS VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:32 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H08MR6.REC H08MR6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2006

96,House,109,0.251,50,2006-03-08,Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support of this bill  and particularly to congratulate the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  GERLACH), who is its primary sponsor  and who has carefully shepherded  it  forward at a very sensitive time  in  U.S.-Ukrainian relations.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this  bill especially when taken in tandem  with economic and political reforms  made by the Ukraine, as well as the efforts of our negotiators to put together  a solid WTO market access agreement.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of passage of this bill on the heels of  the other body passing a similar measure under unanimous consent. Just 2  days ago an agreement on market access was signed between the U.S. and  the Ukraine. This agreement is an excellent start to fostering a continued  growth between our two countries.  We recognize that some frictions remain, but this agreement, along with  the Ukraine’s accession to the WTO,  will better enable us to resolve these  frictions expeditiously, and in a mutually beneficial manner. Granting permanent normal trade relations, along  with steps already taken to make government loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank available to U.S. exporters to the Ukraine, will significantly increase U.S. investment in the  Ukraine.  Granting  the Ukraine  permanent  normal trade relations status will not  only  complement  the  difficult  economic reforms that have been made. It  will also  support and  reinforce  the  democratic  reforms  being made  by  President Yushchenko.  It is vital that Congress move forward and reaffirm our commitment to  the Ukraine, to its reforms, both democratic and economic. Mr. Speaker, I  urge passage of this bill.  ",2006

98,House,109,-0.378,50,2006-03-08,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I join my  colleagues in support of this for the  reasons that they have all given. What  happens in Ukraine is important for its  people, obviously. It is important for  its neighbors. It is important for us in  the United States, and I think really in  the world. Let me  just state why I  think it is important in terms of its  economic and democratic development.  Clearly it has met the requirement in  Jackson-Vanik  as  to  immigration.  Jackson-Vanik was an amendment to a  trade bill, and so it is relevant for us to  look at the economic and democratic  developments  within  Ukraine.  The  Jackson-Vanik instrument is our opportunity in the Congress to deal with  the accession of countries to the World  Trade Organization, and that is why we  have withheld PNTR in several cases  until we were satisfied in terms of the  WTO accession agreements and could  participate in the development of those  agreements.  The U.S. has now negotiated with  Ukraine a WTO accession agreement,  and it is satisfactory. I think it will be  mutually beneficial. I think also it will  spark further reforms within Ukraine,  both economic and also, I think, help  the evolution of democracy within that  country. So this is an important moment in terms of the economic role of  Ukraine and the evolution of its democratic processes.  Let me say another word, if I might  quickly,  about  the  importance. We  have been working on this legislation  for a number of years. In proposals  that we have placed on the record, that  we have  introduced, we have talked  about various aspects of our relationship with Ukraine, and various doings  within Ukraine, both human  rights,  how it treats its workers and many  other aspects.  All of these aspects are not covered  in this legislation, but I do think this  legislation points out the importance  of Ukraine to continue its democratic  evolution. There are challenges ahead.  I have had the chance to talk with constituents, with the  large Ukrainian-  American community in the 12th District.  And I want to close with this. To  echo what Mr. LANTOS has said, and  others, what happens in Ukraine is important, as I said, not only for its people, but really for the whole world. The  Orange Revolution  really  resounded  throughout the globe. It was an important moment for all of us, and so is its  progress in terms of human rights and  in terms of the elimination of anti-  Semitism within Ukraine.  Mr. Speaker, so I join in this effort,  and I urge that we all support it.  ",2006
99,House,109,0.343,50,2006-03-08,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for  yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, as has been discussed  here  today  certainly,  the  Jackson-  Vanik restrictions were made as an  amendment to a 1974 trade bill actually  to punish the Soviet bloc nations for  their despicable human rights record.  Following the collapse of the Soviet  Union,  Jackson-Vanik  restrictions  were placed on all of the former Soviet  Republics,  including the Ukraine. In  recent years, the world has watched as  the Ukraine has embraced democracy  and freedom through their Orange Revolution.  The Ukraine has been a great ally in  the war on terror. The Ukraine has  clearly taken appropriate steps to open  their society and economy and becoming an important member of the community of free nations. The Ukraine  should be free of the onerous restrictions, because they have met each of  the tests laid out by the law.

100,House,109,-0.488,78,2006-03-08,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, this is  yet another example of the government  under this majority in the House, and  the Senate and the Republican White  House of failing to live up to its role to  protect the American people from circumstances beyond their control.  We have troops over in Afghanistan  and Iraq that are not protected in the  manner in which they should be protected. We have people down in Louisiana and Mississippi and other areas  affected by the storm, Katrina, who are  not getting the attention and the protection that they deserve and their situation warrants.  Here we have a failure of the government to step forward and to protect  the American working family, who has  paid into pension funds, expected them  to be protected, expected something to  be there after 20, 25 or 30 years of work  and contributing to these funds, only  to find out that management people,  CEOs, walk into bankruptcy court and  somehow wipe out the workers’ interest while they end up with golden parachutes and protection for benefits once  they come out of bankruptcy.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. MILLERand I and  others have been fighting this issue for  the working people for some time. In  committee we offered an amendment  that would allow the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation,  that corporation, an entity which would protect  workers. We wanted that to intervene  earlier to be able to work with companies to make sure that they first exhausted all of their possible remedies  by permitting them to terminate plans  and go into bankruptcy only after they  had done that.  We presented a substitute  for this  bill, but we weren’t allowed to have a  vote on it. Our colleagues in the majority, I think, speculate or were afraid  that Members of  their party would  have joined in this motion, because it  would have improved the bill. Companies should first have to exhaust every  possible  remedy  to create  financing  and be creative in order to save and restore pensions before they are allowed  to go into bankruptcy court and wipe  them out while enhancing the position  of the CEOs and other management  people.  b1345  We are fighting here, Mr. Speaker, to  protect  the  retirement  security  of  American families. We are protecting  benefits of airline employees and seeking to encourage retirement savings.  Both the Congressional Budget Office  and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation say that H.R. 2830 would actually add to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s deficit. They say  the bill would actually chase companies out of the defined benefit system,  that traditional benefit system that  people have come to rely on, and it  would leave workers with fewer choices  actually than the plans for retirement  that they have now.  This motion  to  instruct conferees  would at least address some of those  issues, Mr. Speaker. It would protect  the pension benefits of airline employees by asking to support the Senate  provision, to keep American and Continental and Delta and Northwest from  terminating their plans at the expense  of  employees and  taxpayers, giving  them additional time to actually work  on their plans.  It would support the Senate provision to provide  full Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation retirement protections for pilots that are forced to retire at age 60. As Mr. MILLERsays, they  are getting a double-whammy now, and  they should not have to face that situation.  The motion would also make permanent the Saver Tax Credit, urging conferees to accept the House provision for  the credit that provides a matching  contribution for low- and moderate-income workers, and make sure that that  provision, which is used now by 5.3 million people both in 2002 and 2003, to  continue on, and support the House  provisions to split the tax refund for  automatic forwarding to a retirement  account and to provide for the protection of traditional plans, dropping new  funding provisions in either the House  or Senate bill that would encourage  companies to terminate or freeze.  Mr. Speaker, all those things are necessary to improve this bill, and I ask  for support for the Miller amendment.  ",2006

This motion takes some parts of our  tax agenda and says they are important, like the savers credit, the direct  payments of tax refunds to IRAs, but  ignores so many other parts of our bill  that are critical, like the permanency  of  the pension and  IRA provisions,  many of which were in the Portman-  Cardin legislation which this House has  debated  long  before,  I noticed Mr.  CARDINwas here earlier, and long-term  care  insurance, which  is a  critical  issue, and FSA rollover, which many of  my friends on the other side are vitally  interested in as well.

104,House,109,-0.473,85,2006-03-08,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, after  hearing the last speaker on the other  side  of  the  aisle  on  this  rule, he  claimed this is a bill that is well-balanced, thought through; it would lead  to  national  regulations  based  on  science. That all sounds well and good,  but it is just not true.  b1445  This bill has never had a day of hearings. We don’t know all that is in this  bill. You wonder why  the Congress  would do its work in this way: a bill  that has never had a hearing in the  committee, even though  it has been  around for three Congresses. Those who  favor it have never made a record of  why they think it is necessary. The opponents from most of the States, if you  look at this map there are a few States  we have not heard from, but almost all  the States attorneys general and Governors and agriculture commissioners  and the food and drug people in those  States oppose it, but they have never  been able to come in and tell the Congress why. So the other side has never  had a chance, nor has our side of the  aisle, to hear testimony and to make a  record, and yet we are told this bill is  well balanced.  Let me point out that the proponents  of this legislation have said a lot of different things. It has been almost like a  covert legislative campaign. They have  sent people in from the districts, from  some trade association or other, and  said to Members, this is a national uniformity bill. It is just going to clarify  the law. It is going to require all the  States to have the same rules so that  we will not have the burden on interstate commerce.  Well, they have never shown there is  any burden on  interstate commerce.  But  it  sounded  so good  that many  Members cosponsored the bill without  fully understanding that this bill  is  going to overturn 200 State laws that  protect our food supply. Why are we  doing that? What is broken about our  system of federalism that allows the  States to pass laws to protect their  own people? And now the proponents of  this bill want States to come, hat in  hand, to the Food and Drug Administration, a wonderful bureaucracy at  the Federal level, not even elected people, and that agency will decide whether the State laws can continue in effect? They will have higher power than  the States legislatures and Governors?  That is not a well-balanced or well-  thought-through piece of  legislation.  And now we are on the floor arguing a  rule that would so severely limit the  time for debate on all the amendments  and this bill that you have to ask yourself: Why is this going on? What are  they hiding from us? Why don’t they  want this bill to be held up to public  scrutiny through hearings? And why  won’t they let this bill be fully debated  on the floor of the House of Representatives by  the people’s elected Representatives? Why do they have to rush  this through?  Mr. Speaker, this is the early part of  March. We have barely been in session.  We have been meeting 21⁄2days out of  each week as we go from recess in January to recess in February to recess in  March. Let us have another day. Congress can do its work. We don’t have to  rush out to another CODEL or another  junket. We ought to do our job and let  people come in and tell us what they  think of bills and not get steamrolled  into something that no one has fully  examined and that would repeal State  laws. So let us vote against this legislation.  ",2006

107,House,109,-0.146,99,2006-03-08,Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota.," Mr.  Chairman, I rise today in support of  the gentleman’s amendment. Several  of my colleagues have raised valid concerns about the importance of warning  labels for specific serious health issues,  including  birth  defects  and  cancer-  causing agents. I believe the language  in  the gentleman’s amendment  improves the underlying bill by allowing  for an expedited review process by the  FDA.  If a State identifies a health issue fitting the critical categories  listed  in  the amendment, then a warning is necessary,  and  this  amendment  allows  FDA to enact the warning nationally,  not just in the State that proposes it,  granting greater consumer protection  everywhere, and if the FDA approves a  State’s request for a warning, it is important for consumers not just in that  State, but all States, to have that information.  As I said during the general debate  on this bill, we have the world’s safest  food supply, the lowest cost to its consumers, and every American benefits  from a system of national food safety  standards. This amendment and  the  underlying bill builds on the record of  success that we have had in this system by extending the same approach to  food safety standards that is used by  USDA and other agencies.  I strongly urge my colleagues to join  me  in  supporting  this  important  amendment and to oppose any amendments that would gut this bill.  ",2006
108,House,109,0.484,99,2006-03-08,Mr. RADANOVICH.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for yielding me  this time.  I am a cosponsor and will support  final  passage  of  the National Uniformity for Food Act today. This is because I believe that a national standard for food labeling under the authority of the FDA makes sense.  In addition, I support the Cardoza  amendment to this bill, which would  accelerate the consideration of warnings for food labels in certain cases,  such as when dealing with the potential for birth defects and cancer-causing agents.  This amendment protects the most  vulnerable in our society, particularly  children. Expedited consideration by  the FDA for these types of labels is the  right thing to do to protect the health  of our families. I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment and urge a  ‘‘yes’’ vote on final passage.  ",2006
109,House,109,0.4,99,2006-03-08,Mr. ROGERS of Michigan.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise to support the Cardoza  amendment and thank the Member for  working with us. This does improve the  bill and makes very, very clear that we  are going to have an expedited review  for cancer-causing agents or reproductive effects or birth defects.  The reason we have an expedited review here, as we have said many times,  those State laws in effect remain in effect until they get an affirmative ruling from the FDA, so those would remain  in place until they get a scientific ruling from the FDA, and then  we would have the benefit of that information shared with all 50 States, all 50  States’ children, all 50 States’ men and  women who call America home.  I thank the gentleman for working  with us and in supporting this fine bill.  ",2006
110,House,109,0.581,106,2006-03-08,Mr. DEAL of Georgia.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, we have already seen  evidence of action at the Federal level  in March of 2004. In fact, the FDA and  the EPA issued a joint guidance to consumers about the issue of mercury in  fish. And that guidance was designed to  try to strike a careful balance that  would demonstrate both the benefits of  eating fish as well as the potential dangers associated with exposure to mercury.  If the bill passes as presented, and  this is an issue with regard to warning  on fish, there are several things that  would be authorized: A State, if it feels  it has a peculiar situation, could petition for a waiver so that they could  apply a nonFederal standard to their  warning. There is absolutely nothing in  the bill that would prohibit a State  from issuing warnings. It just cannot  require that the manufacturer or distributor be the one that be required to  place warnings on the product. But the  State could issue whatever warnings it  saw fit to do so.  I think, as Mr. ROGERS related earlier, the Tufts Health and Nutrition  Letter, indicating that you have to be  careful that you do not do more harm  than good sometimes by issuing warnings that are blanket in nature, I think  that clearly indicates we could go in  the wrong direction.  We believe the bill strikes a careful  balance. It does allow States that have  peculiar situations to ask that they be  allowed to put additional warnings on  products in their State if they think  that is justified. We believe that the  current Federal policy on mercury,  however, in fish is an appropriate and  adequate one, and I would urge the defeat of this amendment.  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.  Chairman, I yield for the purposes of  making a unanimous consent request  to  the  gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr.  KUCINICH).  (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
111,House,109,-0.582,106,2006-03-08,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the Wasserman Schultz  amendment.  It is widely known that mercury is a highly  toxic chemical, especially  to our children.  It  causes entire clusters of cells  in  the developing brain to die. It causes loss of fine motor  skills, learning disabilities, and seizures. Later  in  life,  it can  translate  into kidney diseases,  and immune system disorders.  One of  the primary ways children are exposed to mercury is through consumption of  fish—either they eat it or their mother does. At  the same time, eating fish that is not contaminated has been shown to be important to childrens’ health.  The best way to deal with the problem is to  stop mercury  from getting  into our environment in the first place. Of course, this administration and Congress have repeatedly refused  to take substantive action to require coal burning power plants to take responsibility for their  toxic mercury releases that end up in our fish.  But because mercury pollution  is allowed  to  persist, people are forced to take on the coal  plants’ responsibility by trying to avoid fish that  are contaminated.  In recognition of this, some States are considering laws that will label fish that are high  in mercury. It is a critical consumer empowerment tool that is the last line of defense for  those who do not want their children or themselves to be exposed to this toxic substance.  But the Food Uniformity Act would undercut  States’ ability to even provide that basic level  of protection  through  labeling. So not only  does the bill undercut States rights, but it also  undercuts personal responsibility.  The Wasserman Shultz amendment makes  an exemption for labeling laws that apply to  mercury and  fish and shellfish.  It  is a commonsense amendment. Please join me in supporting it.  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself the balance of  my time.  One of the things I want to point out  that I think is important to note is  that the petition process that the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DEAL) pointed out, that whole process has been  scored by the GPO. They have estimated that it would cost $400,000 per  petition.  Should we be creating the obstacles  to information that women need? I will  give you an example. I have a 21⁄2-year-  old baby girl, and I  first  found out  about the dangers of methylmercury  when I was pregnant with her and my  OB–GYN told me, do not consume tuna.  Do not consume any oily-based fish.  Think about someone who does not  have the access to prenatal care that I  had. We have absolutely got to make  sure that depending on the levels of  mercury poisoning in a particular body  of water in different States, that each  State be able to decide the type and  method of information that they provide, and that we not leave only the  ability to notify women and parents of  young children about the dangers of  methylmercury on a Web site put out  by the FDA. That would be inappropriate.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. PRICEof  Georgia).  The  question  is  on  the  amendment  offered  by  the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.  ",2006
112,House,109,-0.184,120,2006-03-08,Ms. HERSETH.," If the gentlewoman  would yield, back to the point that Ms.  SA´NCHEZmade about Head Start, Mr.  Speaker, I think this is so important as  it relates to Women’s History Month  and the importance of the Head Start  Program, the women that have been a  core part of this program, I represent  nine sovereign Native Tribes  in the  State  of South Dakota,  and  tribal  women are among the strongest advocates for Head Start, in both the in-  home program as well as the traditional Head Start Program.  So I could not agree more that any  budget, whether it comes from the administration or the majority in this  House, that would slash or freeze or not  adequately fund Head Start programs  to meet school readiness  is  inexcusable, as well as what had you both  mentioned, and Ms. SA´NCHEZ, I too am  paying off those student loans, how important it is to have access to ways to  finance one’s higher education to become that productive citizen, a taxpayer in one’s community, giving back  and finding good opportunities.  But when you look at the impact of  the egregious budget reconciliation bill  that this House passed by two votes  earlier this year, that found a third of  its savings from Federal student loan  programs, it is also inexcusable. And  when you tack that on to what is happening as I mentioned with Head Start  in Indian country, we have very high  up employment rates, so you can imagine what Native women are faced with.  But the one thing I want to mention,  because we have been focusing on a  number of the challenges, especially as  it relates to the budget and the misplaced priorities, when we talk about  Women’s History Month  I want  to  highlight what will always stand out as  a hallmark, one of the most significant  achievements of women banding  together and being advocates, and that is  in the area of breast cancer research  and awareness.  My grandmother that  I was mentioning earlier, she was a breast cancer  survivor. One of my aunts is also a  breast cancer survivor. I think that is  a model of advocacy in all of women’s  health and how we find creative ways  to adequately fund the research, as we  have done through the Department of  Defense programs that have existed for  that research, and to continue it in  other areas, and to applaud the women,  to applaud the women that were the  strategists,  that were  the activists,  that brought this to the attention of so  many here in the halls of Congress to  make  sure  that  this  serious health  issue was addressed that paved the way  for us to address other health issues for  women that we know are continuing to  be challenges for us.  Ms. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ of California. If you will yield, since we are on  the topic of breast cancer, I want to  mention two weeks ago I lost a Member of my staff in my district office.  She had a 3-year battle with breast  cancer. She died at the age of 49. She  was the most wonderful, outspoken,  helpful caseworker in our office.  Her husband said at her memorial  service, ‘‘You know, Idalia Smith did  not die. She was killed. She was killed  by cancer.’’ He was angry that more  had not been done to try to help eliminate breast cancer in terms of one of  these  horrible  diseases  that  causes  such suffering and takes people from us  far, far too soon.  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. It is so  sad how we literally now have reached  the point in history where every person  that you talk to can name a woman  that they know that has touched their  lives in some way that has fallen victim to breast cancer. One of my close  friends, 42 years old, a mom of twin 5-  year-olds, just passed away in December, also killed by breast cancer.  You know what  is the most  frustrating thing, is that we have only just  in recent years been able to get NIH  funding  for  women-specific  disease  study, and yet the President has now  proposed a cut in funding for every institute in the NIH.  How are we going  to  reverse  the  trend in breast cancer? Breast cancer is  not even the leading cause of death in  women in this country. It is heart disease. Heart disease is the leading cause  of death. We only just accomplished  having women-specific studies in that  area.  Again, the priorities are just startling.  Ms. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ of California. I just have this to say. We have  talked a little bit about priorities and  we have talked about some very worthwhile programs that are being cut to  the core,  to  the point where  these  kinds of services are going to be eliminated altogether, will be so crippled by  lack of funding that they are not going  to really function and serve the people  they need to serve.  The question for me, and I get angry  about this, I hear colleagues talk about  how they care about breast cancer research, they care about preparing kids  for kindergarten, they care about making sure that educational opportunities  are available, yet they have no qualms  about voting to slash these programs  to the core so they can give tax cuts to  the wealthiest Americans.  If that is not the clearest example of  misplaced priorities, I don’t know what  is, because there is an old saying, you  put your money where your mouth is.  So you  can  talk  about  supporting  something, but if you are not willing to  put your money into that to support it,  you are just giving lip service to it.  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Our  colleague ROSA from Connecticut has introduced legislation in  the area of breast cancer that we still  cannot get brought to this floor that  would  deal  with  drive-through  mastectomies. You have women in this  country now who, after having their  breasts removed as a result of breast  cancer surgery, are forced out of the  hospital by their insurance company in  24 hours and less after a radical mastectomy, regardless of what their doctor thinks.  What Congresswoman DELAURO’s legislation would do is it would ensure  that it is the doctor, in consultation  with the patient, that would decide  what the appropriate length of stay is.  That is legislation I worked on in Florida, and it is one that we should apply  nationally. Yet we cannot get a hearing, even a hearing, on that bill under  the Republican leadership in this Congress.  That is why it is so important. Listen, I will say this straight out. It is  not  just  important  that we  have  women serving in Congress; it is important that we have women who share  the priorities of most women in America, who are willing to come here to  the Congress and  stand up  for  the  things that we care about.  There is no point in having a woman  here if she is just going to vote just  like men have for generations, really,  because why elect a woman then? We  have got to make sure that we make  progress, that we go forward. This leadership is not taking us forward.

113,House,109,0.591,127,2006-03-08,Mr. CONAWAY.," Mr. Speaker, if the  gentleman will yield  for  just a moment, your good colleague from Georgia was sharing with us last night an  experience he had with a town hall  meeting. Somebody asked him about a  proposed cut of the President, and I  will not name the particular policy  area because I don’t want to get off  into that kind of thing, because it just  distracts us. But anyway, they asked,  why are you in favor of cutting whatever?  His great answer back, and  I am  going to steal it from him, was to look  at them and say, okay, how many in  here think that is the Federal Government’s responsibility; that particular  area of public policy? And not one person raised their hand. And this is an  area that  is very  important to our  country, very vital to our country, but  it is just not the Federal Government’s  role.  And he did it again. Somebody else  brought  up  another  area. And  he  thought, well, it worked once so let me  try it again. How many people here  think that is a role that the Federal  Government should be doing? Not one  hand raised.  So I think Americans are like that.  They understand that if we begin to  pose things in that frame, questions  just like that, that we will begin to get  the political will and  the political  backbone and support for getting back  to basics and getting back to the constitutional Republic that we have.

120,Senate,109,-0.343,155,2006-03-08,Mr. OBAMA.," Mr. President,  I rise  briefly to support the amendment offered by Senator REID. I also support  the amendment that was introduced by  Senator DODDand Senator SANTORUM,  of which I am a cosponsor. But let me  focus on the particular provision  in  Senator REID’s bill, the honest leadership bill, that I think all of us should  pay attention to, and that is the provision which closes a loophole that would  still allow Members and staff to receive  free meals from lobbyists up to $50 in  value.  On my way over to the floor, I passed  a couple of security guards and Capitol  police. I asked them how often lobbyists had bought them a meal. Surprisingly, they said none.  I talked to the young women who  help us on the elevators on the way up.  I asked  them: Has a  lobbyist ever  bought you a meal? The answer was  ‘‘no.’’  In cities and towns all across America, it turns out people pay for their  own  lunches and their own dinners,  people who make far less than we do,  people who cannot afford their medical  bills or their mortgages or their kids’  tuitions. If you ask them if they think  that  people  they  send  to Congress  should be able to rack up a $50 meal on  a lobbyist’s time, what do you think  they are going to say? You ask them if  they think we should be able to feast  on a free steak dinner at a fancy restaurant while they are working two  jobs to put food on the table. I don’t  think we need a poll to find out the answer to that one.  I want to be clear. In no way do I  think that any of my colleagues or  staffers would exchange votes  for a  meal. But that is not the point. It is  not just the meal that is the problem,  it is the perception, the access that the  meals get you. In current Washington  culture, lobbyists are expected to pick  up the tab when they meet with Members or staff. It is understood by all  sides that the best way to get face time  with a Member is to buy them a meal.  You don’t see many Members eating  $50 meals with constituents who come  into town to talk about issues on their  minds, or with policy experts who are  discussing the  latest economic theories. Most of  these meals  that are  taken are with lobbyists who are advocating on behalf of special interests. It  diminishes perceptions, and it is something that I think has to stop.  Let me close by saying this. If people  are interested in meeting with lobbyists or having dinner with lobbyists,  they can still do so. It is very simple.  You pull out your wallet and pay for it.  I strongly urge we support the Reid  amendment.  In addition,  I  strongly  support  the Dodd-Santorum  amendment, of which I am a cosponsor.  I yield my time.  ",2006

I will see if we can get  that done. I think it would be to everyone’s advantage if we could resolve this  part of the situation we have on the  floor.  I would say that the Leader and I  have had many discussions during the  day and in the weeks prior to this matter coming to the floor in an effort to  move this lobbying reform bill along. I  think we can get a lobby reform bill; it  is now a question of when we will do  that.  But in the morning, cooler heads will  prevail, and we will see what we can do  to move the country along on these  things that need to be done.  The  f  HOLD ON LAMBRIGHT  NOMINATION  ",2006
123,,109,0.241,211,2006-03-08,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Louise Lorenzi Fountain, a lifelong citizen of Las Vegas, who died on Sunday, January 29, 2005, at the age of 92.  Louise was a link to the past as the last remaining child of David Lorenzi, the namesake  of Lorenzi Park. Louise was born on November 14, 1913, to David Lorenzi, a French immigrant, and Julia Travese Moore. Her younger years were devoted to helping her father  develop  and manage  Lorenzi  Lake Park,  which was built by Lorenzi and is considered  a primary  landmark  in  the development and  life of the citizens of Las Vegas. Louise’s father has been noted as one of the 100 most  influential citizens of Las Vegas. He opened  the park  in 1926 with a pair of man-made  lakes, a swimming pool, a dance hall, a band  shell, and other amenities that made it a recreational refuge in the desert.  Louise married Edgar Fountain in 1936. He  had hitchhiked from Georgia in search of work  on the construction of the Hoover Dam. The  couple left Las Vegas for 10 years and lived  in Grand Coulee, Washington, where Edgar  helped build Grand Coulee Dam. After returning to Las Vegas, she became a full partner  in several business ventures the couple started, including the Nevada Amusement Co., a  Toyota dealership, and a television sales business.  Louise was active in two Methodist churches and was a member of  the First Presbyterian Church. She was a charter member  and regent of  the Valley of Fire Chapter of  The Daughters of  the American Revolution.  She enjoyed gardening, playing bridge, and  entertaining friends. She was a loving, wonderful person and a dear mother who will be  sorely missed. Louise’s  life exemplifies her  service and contributions to the city she loved.  With her passing, a small fragment of beauty  and kindness has left us.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand on the  floor of the House to recognize Louise Lorenzi  Fountain and the wonderful life that she lived.  f  HONORING ROCHELLE STEVENS  HON.

VIRGINIA FOXX  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 2006  ",2006
125,,109,-0.376,218,2006-03-08,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Madam Speaker,  today  I  rise in support of S. 2271, a bill to add civil liberty protections  to  the conference report on  H.R. 3199, the USA PATRIOT Reauthorization  Act. Although I voted against the Patriot Act in  December,  the  Republican  Leadership  rammed  it  through Congress anyway.  I welcome this opportunity to eliminate some of its  most egregious provisions and to further enhance civil  liberties protections.  I will keep  fighting to improve this law so that we can find  the right balance between waging the war on  terrorism and protecting  the  rights of  the  American people.  S. 2271  improves civil  liberties  in  three  ways. Under  the Patriot Act,  libraries, bookstores, and other recipients of court orders for  information are bound by a nondisclosure requirement. These organizations are unable to  tell the target of the investigation that records  have been obtained on the public, if they believe the search is unwarranted. As currently  written,  the Patriot Act prevents appropriate  oversight to affirm the need for such requests  for  information. S. 2271 allows recipients of  these court orders to challenge the nondisclosure requirement, which helps protect civil liberties by placing a check on unrestricted use  of these court orders and protects against unlawful search and seizure.  As currently written, the Patriot Act greatly  expands the use of administrative subpoenas,  known as National Security Letters  (NSLs).  NSLs are equivalent to search warrants, but  they are signed by government bureaucrats instead of issued by courts. These subpoenas  have minimal civil  liberty checks  in place  to  ensure an  investigation  is warranted. Presently,  the Patriot Act  requires  recipients of  NSLs to disclose to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) the names of their attorneys  who are notified of the NSL. This overzealous  provision could launch investigations into attorneys trying to defend clients who received unwarranted investigations. S. 2271 removes this  requirement to disclose attorney names, and I  am pleased to support this change.  Finally, S. 2271  increases  the burden of  proof on obtaining evidence  from  libraries.  Under the Patriot Act, an NSL could require libraries to hand over book checkout lists and  Internet records for specific users, which is a  tremendous violation of privacy. S. 2271 requires  investigators  to obtain a court order,  which would prevent overzealous investigators  from trying to find evidence without probable  cause.  If S. 2271 does not pass, I am concerned  that  the Patriot Act will move  to  the President’s desk for signature lacking protections to  prevent  challenging  nondisclosure  requirements, increasing the opportunity for civil liberties abuses, and subjecting libraries to unnecessary and intrusive scrutiny. While I continue to oppose the underlying Patriot Act, I  will vote  for  these  improvements.  I  look  forward to working with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to correct other deficiencies  and protect  the American people  from both  terrorists and potential abuses of our  freedoms.  POLISH  NATIONAL  ALLIANCE  (PNA)  OF  NORTH  AMERICA—  LODGE 711 100TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. RICHARD E. NEAL  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 2006  ",2006
126,,109,-0.416,218,2006-03-08,Mr. NEAL.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize on the House floor that 2005 marked  the one-hundredth anniversary of Lodge 711  of the Polish National Alliance (PNA) of North  America.  I’m  proud  to  have  Lodge  711  headquartered  in my district  in  the  town of  Wilbraham.  PNA is the largest ethnic fraternal insurance  society in the United States that offers quality  life insurance and annuity products, which allows its members and families to achieve financial security. But the PNA’s involvement in  the communities it serves goes beyond providing quality financial services by organizing  various social and cultural programs. Whether  its sports and youth programs, spelling bees,  college scholarships, or Saturday Schools promoting Polish heritage and culture, PNA helps  its members  live more  fuller and enjoyable  lives.  Mr. Speaker, I’m honored to have the opportunity to represent a diverse and culturally  rich constituency, particularly the Polish communities that have a large presence in Massachusetts’  second  congressional  district.  Throughout my years of public service I have  witnessed with great pleasure the Polish communities’ dedication and commitment to civic  affairs. The lessons of Poland’s long and hard  history of achieving  independence has not  been  lost with  the Polish  immigrants who  came  to America or  their offspring born  in  America.  The American and Polish people have a  long  and warm  relationship  that  evolves  around the love of freedom and opportunity.  This bond goes back  to America’s  revolutionary years when the Polish patriot, Tadeusz  Kosciuszko,  fought  in  the American War of  Independence and achieved the title of brigadier general. Later, Kosciuszko once again  fought for independence when leading the Polish-Lithuania uprising of 1794. The American  people honor Kosciuszko with a statue of the  patriot in the U.S. Capitol building.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Teresa  Struziak-Sherman, Director for PNA Region A,  for all her wonderful work over the years that  has contributed to the success of the PNA. I  would also like to recognize all the other people of Polish ancestry that I have known and  worked with throughout my years as a public  servant and look forward to my continued relationship with them.  f  TRIBUTE TO HALEY SACK  HON.

128,House,109,0.547,2,2006-03-15,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, on Monday, Senator RUSS  FEINGOLDsadly reminded America that  the Democrat Party is still dancing to  the tune of retreat and defeat through  appeasement.  Senator FEINGOLD’s call to censure  President Bush for implementing a legitimate and effective terrorist surveillance  demonstrates  that Democrats  continue to push political ambitions  more than our national security.  From DICKDURBIN’s slandering our  troops  as  communists,  to Howard  Dean’s defeatist  remarks about our  troops’ efforts, to Senator FEINGOLD’s  careless call to censure our President,  it is obvious that Democrats have no  positive plan to protect American families.  Instead of proposing ways to prevent  terror attacks on our soil, Democrats  prefer to spend their time and energy  on political tricks that do not serve  the interests of the American people.  As  our  enemies  continue  to  issue  threats daily against our country, Republicans will remain committed to  proactively  investigating,  capturing  and detaining al Qaeda operatives and  any other terrorists who seek to attack  American families.  In conclusion, God bless our troops  and we will never forget September 11.  f  CONGRESS MUST STEP IN TO EXTEND DEADLINE ON MEDICARE  PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN REGISTRATION  (Mr. MORAN of Virginia asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)

129,House,109,-0.302,2,2006-03-15,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, in 2 months, about 10 million senior  citizens are about to get a Bush Medicare tax imposed on them for the rest  of their lives. If they don’t sign up for  the Medicare prescription drug bill by  May 15, then they can’t sign up again  until the end of the year, and for the  rest of their lives they will pay a 7 percent higher premium than their neighbors  under  exactly  the  same  circumstances just because they couldn’t  figure out this myriad of dozens of different plans that they are presented  with.  This is wrong. The Republicans and  the Democrats need to get together to  extend the deadline to the end of the  year, regardless of what the President  decides. It is time for Congress to act  and to save these 10 million Americans  from having an unfair tax burden on  their shoulders  for the rest of their  lives. It is wrong. Let’s fix it.  f  ROBERT G.

130,House,109,0.439,2,2006-03-15,Mr. GOODE.," Mr. Speaker, Mr. Robert  G. Canar has distinguished himself by  exceptionally  meritorious  achievements in public service to this Nation  by serving the United States Army for  over 42 years. Mr. Canar began his public service career in the U.S. Army as  an air defense artillery officer and as a  military  intelligence officer. During  his 22 years on active duty, he served  in various assignments  in Vietnam,  Korea, Europe  and  in  the United  States.  Mr. Canar joined the former Foreign  Science and Technology Center in 1983  when he was assigned as a division  chief  supervising  collection  requirements, imagery, and electronics intelligence branches. Because of his demonstrated abilities, he has been given  positions of greater responsibility as  the director, information management,  and later as the director, programs and  resources, which led to major initiatives to renovate Foreign Science and  Technology Center’s  facilities to accommodate growth of the workforce  and to secure facilities to meet Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  standards.  Mr. Canar served as  the National Ground  Intelligence Center’s chief of staff from 1994 to  2003, and as the center’s acting executive director from 2003 to 2004. In response to the  Global War on Terrorism,  the center underwent a massive growth with the influx of new  responsibilities to support the soldier.  In 2004 Mr. Canar volunteered to serve for  a year as the senior intelligence officer with  the Civilian Police Assistance Training Team,  Baghdad, Iraq. In this capacity he supervised  an  International Police Liaison Officer Team  and a Multi-National Command-Iraq military  team which organized and  trained  the  Iraq  Ministry of Interior Criminal Intelligence Service Directorate.  He ended his civil service career as  the  special assistant to the commander, National  Ground Intelligence Center responsible for the  establishment of a Joint Use Intelligence Analysis Facility in Charlottesville, VA.  Throughout his service, Mr. Canar has provided outstanding  leadership, sound advice  and expert professional  judgment on significant issues that affected the Army. His actions  and counsel were invaluable to Army leaders  as they considered the issues facing the Nation today. Mr. Canar’s dedication to accomplishing the Army’s missions has been extraordinary. He has been a truly outstanding public  servant and will be missed by  the United  States Army.  f  DRUG  FOR  MEDICARE  PRESCRIPTION  PLAN;  BAD  MEDICINE  AMERICAN SENIORS  (Mr.  CARNAHAN  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

132,House,109,0.335,9,2006-03-15,Mr. COLE of Oklahoma.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to address several of the points  of my good friend from Massachusetts.  First,  in terms of going  into war  without the information and without  the debate. I was not in Congress when  that decision was made, and, frankly, I  looked back and have read the debates  very carefully, watched the debates at  that time, and know that, frankly, everybody that was voting voted on the  best information they had available at  that time.  Frankly, I remind my good  friend  that we were operating with a CIA that  was run by a President Clinton appointee, that he was pretty adamant in  terms of there were WMDs there. That  was the shared opinion of every other  intelligence agency in the world. And,  again, I don’t question the motives of  the decision that was made.  I would also add this. For me, the  more compelling figure is not what we  found before we thought we were going,  but what we found after. I go back to  those mass grave sites and I go back to  those tens of thousands of people that  were killed. And, frankly, I go back to  a level of American responsibility for  allowing that to persist, in my opinion,  after 1991.  I relate to my friend a story that I  heard on my very first visit to Iraq,  when I was talking to a young American sergeant. It was becoming evident  at that point that the stockpiles we  thought were going to be there weren’t  there. There was dual-use technology,  and perhaps the potential to recreate  something. No question Saddam Hussein was working his way out of restrictions, but what we thought was  there, wasn’t there.  And I asked this young sergeant who  had risked his life in the drive to Baghdad what he thought, given that information. And he first gave me sort of a  nice stock political answer and said basically what  I  said: Well, we don’t  know. We are still looking. And I said,  but we haven’t  found any. And he  looked at me, and I will never, ever forget what he said when I said, so, was it  worth it? And he answered my question  with a question.  He said, sir, have you ever been to a  mass grave  site? And  I  said, no,  I  haven’t. He said, I have. He said, you  haven’t seen anything until you see  bodies coming out of the ground and  hundreds of family members trying to  identify them and wailing. And I have  seen that, and I wonder why the whole  world wasn’t here 10 years ago. That is  a good question for us to ask ourselves  inuring the course of this debate.  I also want to address my friend’s  point about a commission in two ways.  First, by making the point that there  is a good deal of oversight that goes on  in this process. I used to serve on the  House Armed Services Committee.  I  still do. I have a waiver on that committee now. But that committee, I can  assure you,  is very thorough  in  its  oversight. I think appropriations has  an oversight function.  But, finally, and more importantly, I  think on this particular piece of legislation, both sides of the House often  ask for an open rule, and anything germane to this piece of legislation, this  supplemental  appropriation,  can  be  brought here. I think that is a very  good thing. Now we are being told we  not only want things that are germane  to one of the largest spending bills and  one of the most important pieces of  legislation that we will deal with this  year, we want things that are not germane. We want waivers granted.  And, by the way, we are being told  that by both sides of the aisle. This is  not an exclusive demand. I think it is  a misdirected demand. I would like to  see us move back toward more open  rules, more regular order, and I think  this rule is a step in that direction.  ",2006
133,House,109,-0.516,9,2006-03-15,Mr. SABO.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  ranking member for yielding.  I am disappointed  that  the Rules  Committee has not allowed me to offer  my  amendment  to  strengthen  the  CFIUS foreign investment review process during consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill.  Americans deserve a rigorous review  of foreign investments that affect our  national security posture. Never again  should we find that the President and  the Secretaries of Homeland Security,  Treasury and Defense are unaware of a  critical transaction until after it has  been approved.  As you know,  the Appropriations  Committee voted overwhelmingly last  week to kill the Dubai World Port terminal acquisition, which, it is my understanding, requires a rule waiver to  be made germane.

137,House,109,-0.388,16,2006-03-15,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of this bill, and I am pleased to  have worked with Chairman KOLBE to  develop the foreign assistance portion  of  this measure. The bill  cuts  the  amount requested for international assistance by about $140 million from the  administration’s request, and rescinds  an additional $17 million in previously  appropriated funds that are no longer  needed.  However, I do have concerns about  what we have included and what we  have not included. I am particularly  concerned about the lack of funding in  this bill for Afghanistan. During the  chairman’s recent visit to Afghanistan,  the ambassador and USAID staff outlined a need for $600 million in FY 2006  supplemental funding to help address  the power and infrastructure needs in  Afghanistan.  Our ambassador, the Afghan government, and provincial leaders all agreed  that progress on reconstruction and development was critical to help consolidate the rule of law, curtail the influence  of  the Taliban  and  al Qaeda  operatives and combat opium poppy  cultivation.  Yet, the President’s request does not  contain the $600 million that Ambassador Neumann requested. It does not  even contain the $407 million that Secretary Rice requested in her submission to OMB. The President requested  just $62 million for assistance to Afghanistan  in the supplemental, one-  tenth of what  is needed. The committee  further cut this amount providing only $8 million for Afghanistan.  Now, I do understand that Chairman  and Chairman LEWIS are frustrated with the lack of response from  the State Department on the counternarcotics program in Afghanistan, and  I share that frustration. However, in  this instance, I fear that we are cutting  off our nose to spite the State Department’s face. I do not think this is a responsible strategy. And before this bill  is enacted,  I hope we can  find the  means to restore or even increase the  KOLBE VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:38 Mar 16, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15MR7.033 H15MRPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006
138,House,109,0.351,23,2006-03-15,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Chairman, I want to  commend  the gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS), the Chairman of the  committee,  for his work  in bringing  this supplemental appropriations bill  to the floor. He has really done an outstanding job of, I think, balancing the  different  interests that are  involved  here.  I want to take my time, Mr. Chairman, Members, to speak a bit about  that part of the bill that deals with the  foreign assistance funds. That is Chapter 3 of H.R. 4939.  The Foreign Operations portion of  the  fiscal year 2006 supplemental  is  $2.08 billion. That amount is $140 million, or 6.7 percent less than the request of the administration of $2.2 billion.  Now, here is how we arrived at this  lesser figure.  First, we  eliminated  funding  requested by the President that is not for  the current fiscal year. That is $74 million. We eliminated funding that was  requested  for  non-emergency  costs.  That is $99 million. And we reduced  costs by rescinding previously appropriated funds of $17 million that are  not needed because of changed circumstances.  Let me talk for a minute about specific regions and countries. First, Iraq.  The bill provides new budget authority  of $1.67 billion for Iraq, or two-thirds of  the amount  in  foreign assistance  is  going to Iraq. But that is a reduction  of $58 million from what the President  requested. This  reduction  represents  the amount requested for fiscal year  2007 costs for the U.S. Agency for International Development. As I said a moment ago, we concluded that this 2006  supplemental bill should not be used to  pre-fund expenses of the next  fiscal  year.  In addition, the supplemental transfers $185 million from the Iraq Relief  and Reconstruction Fund appropriation to augment the new funds provided in this supplemental. These are  still unobligated funds that are appropriately applied to the purposes of this  legislation. And that brings the total  available to Iraq of $1.85 billion.  Many Members are greatly concerned  about Darfur and our efforts to stave  off genocidal warfare in that region of  Africa.  Though  a  fraction  of  the  amount requested for Iraq, our bill attempts to accomplish this. It contains  $201 million, fully funding the President’s  request  for Darfur programs.  This includes $123 million for the African Union Mission in Sudan, or called  AMIS, for peacekeeping activities. The  administration has assured us that this  $123 million will finance the entire U.S.  fiscal year 2006 contribution.  Also included in this amount is $11.7  million for refugee assistance and $66.3  million  in nonfood assistance  in the  International Disaster and Famine Assistance Account. The plight of displaced persons in Darfur remains critical and is pathetic.  The supplemental bill provides new  budget authority of only $8.4 million  for Afghanistan. This is a reduction of  $54 million from the request but does  not constitute a lessening of our commitment to this emerging democracy.  Rather, it represents, first, the amount  requested, $16 million, for fiscal year  2007 funds for USAID. It reduces that  amount.  Second,  it  eliminates  the  amount requested  for non-emergency  requirements of $38 million. The $8.4  million  fully  funds  the  request  for  emergency replacement of an electric  turbine generator and assistance  for  migration and refugee requirements.  My colleagues should know that the  Secretary of State has not yet met the  requirements of the fiscal year 2006 Appropriations Act which requires a certification that the Government of Afghanistan  is  fully  cooperating with  U.S.-financed  efforts  to  eradicate  poppy cultivation. It did not seem prudent at this  juncture to appropriate  any non-emergency funds for Afghanistan until that certification can be  made.  The legislation includes $10 million  in the Democracy Fund appropriation  for the promotion of democracy, governance, human  rights,  independent  media and the rule of law programs in  Iran. This is a reduction of $55 million  from the requested amount. However,  $50 million of that is for broadcasting  efforts and is addressed in Chapter 6 of  this bill, the jurisdiction of Mr. WOLF’s  subcommittee.  For Liberia, the bill includes a total  of $63.8 million. $13.8 million of that  amount would be used to cover the extraordinary costs of refugees returning  to Liberia, and $50 million will provide  assistance  for economic and project  support.  Now let me turn to the issues that  are not specific dollar amounts. One of  these is a general provision, Section  3012, not in Chapter 3 of the bill. It  deals with assistance  to  the Palestinian Authority.  I want to be clear. This bill includes  no new, no additional funding for the  Palestinian territories, and the President’s supplemental request  included  no such funding. However, the fiscal  year 2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill did include $150 million  to support the Palestinian people and  build  the capacity of  the Abbas-led  government. Since the fiscal year 2006  bill was passed, as my colleagues know,  Hamas won a majority of the Palestinian legislature in the recent elections.  The provision included in this bill before us today reconfirms and reemphasizes congressional oversight of our foreign assistance programs to this troubled region. It directs that no fiscal  year 2006 or prior year funding can be  used to support the Palestinian Authority or a successor entity until the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:38 Mar 16, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15MR7.052 H15MRPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

The only concern I have is that this  would take $20 million out of the defense health budget and move it basically to training. Now, this is a very  perspective, thoughtful idea. It needs  to be done. And the only concern is the  current needs of the defense health  budget.

Now you talk  about smoke and mirrors. For him to  say on our side that we are talking  about raising taxes is so disingenuous.  Nobody is talking about raising taxes.  We are talking about fiscal responsibility and pay-as-you-go  responsibilities.  We are saying that we do not want to  cut vital services to the American people and then go borrow more money  that we have to pay interest on. That,  in effect, when you put it altogether, if  anybody is talking about raising taxes,  it is the Republicans. Somebody has to  pay for this. You know who is going to  pay for it, our grandchildren and our  children based on their proposals.  No, sir, you are not going to be able  to depend on Democrats this night that  we are  talking about  raising  taxes.  Democrats are talking about keeping  our taxes low and bringing fiscal responsibility back to this House.  You talk about responsibility. When  Democrats were in control, when President Clinton was there, he left a several trillion dollar surplus. In just 5  years, this President and this Republican-led Congress has squandered that  surplus. So when you talk about who is  more  responsible  for  the  taxpayers’  money,  it  is Democrats, not Republicans. And the American people are  not going to be fooled by this smoke  and mirrors of consistently trying to  paint the Democrats as being for raising taxes and they for not. The Republicans are for raising taxes and raising  the debt ceiling.  Madam Speaker, I want to show this  chart. It is not as big as your chart,  but the Republicans have increased the  debt limit by $3 trillion. I have been  here 4 years, and this is the fourth  time that the Republicans have asked  to raise the debt ceiling so they can  borrow more money.  In June, 2002, they asked to raise the  debt ceiling by $452 billion. In May,  2003, they asked to raise the debt ceiling by $984 billion. In November of 2004,  they raised the debt ceiling by $800 billion, all of which we are borrowing  against, against the best national security interests of this country, against  the best financial security interests of  this country.

153,Senate,109,-0.382,114,2006-03-15,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Madam President, I rise to talk about an amendment Senator BYRDand I are offering  to adequately fund Amtrak. I understand there is an alternative that has  been offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania which, very frankly, I think  amounts to an empty gesture. It is an  amendment that looks as though it has  funding for the continuation of Amtrak’s operations but in fact it doesn’t  because  it doesn’t have a source of  funding that has any reliability to it.  The bottom line is if we want to fund  Amtrak, if we want to keep it going, a  vote has to be made for the Byrd-Lautenberg amendment.  President Bush proposed to initially  bankrupt Amtrak in last year’s budget.  The American people and the Democrats  and Republicans  in  Congress  stood up and said no. So this year, instead of trying to kill Amtrak outright, President Bush wants to put it  on a starvation diet.  This is no time for us to be looking  at trying to kill Amtrak because Amtrak in many cases is our only alternative to the crowded skies, to the  crowded highways, to be able to move  people in the event of emergencies, and  as a way to get to work and take care  of people’s needs. Amtrak and transit  in general offers one of the few options.  When we look back at what happened  on 9/11, the only transit transportation  facility that was available on that terrible  day was Amtrak. We  never  thought it could happen, but we shut  down aviation completely. Here we are,  and some of our friends on the other  side of the aisle think that eliminating  Amtrak might be a good idea.  What was proposed by our colleague  from Pennsylvania, the junior Senator,  was  that we  find a  funding  source  somewhere in magic land. The money  is not there. It is something called 920,  which is to hide behind the facts and  not tell the truth. But when I look at  what  is happening  in  the State of  Pennsylvania  in terms of Amtrak, I  frankly cannot  figure out what the  mission is here. Pennsylvania has over  4.9 million riders a year on Amtrak.  It is not just Philadelphia and New  York; it is not just Philadelphia and  Washington; it is places such as Harrisburg and other communities within the  State  of Pennsylvania  that  require  service. Instead, what they are getting  here today is a sleight of hand, saying,  Well, we want to put more money in  Amtrak, more money than has been  proposed in the budget by some $500  million. The fact is there is no money  there. There is a colloquialism that has  developed  in  America  which  says  ‘‘show me the money.’’ There  is no  ‘‘show’’ and there is no ‘‘dough.’’ That  is where we are.  Our  amendment  accounts  for  the  funding necessary by taking it from  corporate loopholes and tax shelters.  I hope people here will understand  how valuable Amtrak is to our country, how necessary it is, and vote for  the Byrd-Lautenberg amendment and  not the alternative that has been proposed.

This  tragic flooding has caused loss of life  and substantial property damage. The  people of Hawaii have shown exceptional resolve in assisting their fellow  citizens as emergency personnel and  other volunteers have rushed to provide assistance to people in need. We  continue to pray for those who are still  missing and for those who are working  tirelessly in search and rescue efforts  and in additional emergency response.  As many of you know, several islands  in my home State have been inundated  by severe rainstorms over the past few  weeks. Flooding has caused substantial  disruptions of life as schools and business have been  forced  to close and  many roads have been damaged or have  been washed out because of high water.  Property damage in cities and in rural  areas has been severe.  Hawaii’s Governor Lingle has called  upon the National Guard and many  State agencies to assist those who have  suffered losses and to respond to immediate  needs. However,  the  damage  caused by this flooding demonstrates  the need to prepare in advance for adverse conditions and to be vigilant in  examining vulnerable areas.  I stand ready to offer any assistance  to the State of Hawaii that I can, including  securing  emergency Federal  funding for the State.  Throughout this adversity, the people of Hawaii have shown the resolve  that they are known for in times of crisis.

156,Senate,109,0.109,142,2006-03-15,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to honor  the  life  of Robert  Maxcy of Waldoboro, ME, who passed  away this weekend at the age of 76. Bob  served 56 years in the Waldoboro Fire  Department, including the last 42 years  as its chief, and I would like to recognize his  lifelong devotion  to public  safety.  Chief Bob Maxcy was born on November 17, 1929, in Thomaston, ME, the son  of the late Earl and Ruth Maxcy. At  age 14 he began his service as a firefighter at the Thomaston Junior Fire  Department. This was the beginning of  his outstanding career  in service to  both Maine and the Nation.  Upon his graduation from Thomaston  High School, Chief Maxcy served honorably with the U.S. Air Force from  1947 to 1950. During his service, Chief  Maxcy attained the rank of gunnery  sergeant.  When he returned to Maine in 1950,  Chief Maxcy became a firefighter with  the Waldoboro Fire Department.  In  that same year, he married his loving  and devoted wife, Muriel. By 1964, Chief  Maxcy had established himself as a  leader in the department and was appointed chief of the Waldoboro Fire Department, a position in which he served  for 42 years.  Beyond his dedication to his department, Chief Maxcy also was a leader in  the community and the State, as evidenced through his participation in the  Waldoboro  Firemen’s  Association,  Knox County Firemen’s Association,  Maine  State  Federation  of  Firefighters, and the Lincoln County Fire  Chiefs.  Chief Maxcy was truly an honorable  Maine man. In addition to his success  as a community leader and firefighter,  he will be remembered for his love of  his family, the outdoors, and the Red  Sox. Chief Maxcy is survived by five  children, Deborah, Marcia, Marc, Dee,  and Daryl; his brother, Harlan; his sister, Marilyn; his grandchildren, great  grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.  Chief Bob Maxcy will be greatly  missed. I offer my sincere condolences  and prayers to Chief Maxcy’s family.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his  secretaries.

157,,109,-0.582,170,2006-03-15,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor and recognition of Norbert Magalski of  Parma, Ohio, a noble Good Samaritan and  Gulf War veteran who has  lent a hand  to  many.  Mr. Magalski, as a trained emergency medical  technician and  tow  truck operator has  helped  countless people on  the  roadside.  Even  in an age when people are  too overwhelmed with  their own priorities  to  lend a  helping hand to strangers, he has made it a  common practice in his life to help those who  are in need of assistance on the road.  Mr. Magalski was injured last Thursday by a  suspected drunk driver while helping a young  woman who had veered off I–76 and into a  guardrail. He suffered broken bones in his left  leg, left shoulder and face. It will be several  months before he fully recovers.  This man  is  truly one  to be honored and  emulated as he remains committed to lending  a helping hand when needed. He is a modest  and kind-hearted citizen who in spite of injury  will continue  to help strangers  in need. His  kindness and generosity is something that is  not often seen in today’s society. My thoughts  and prayers are with him and his family for his  quick recovery.  Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me  in honor and recognition of Norbert Magalski,  whose dedication and courage  in  lending a  hand to his fellow citizens has helped save the  lives of many.  f  A TRIBUTE TO HELEN HANCOCK  HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
158,,109,-0.348,170,2006-03-15,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor Ms. Helen Hancock, of Alhambra, California. Each year in March, in recognition of  Women’s History Month, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by  our nation’s women.  Helen Hancock was born in Indiana in 1922.  She attended Nursing School at Case Western Reserve University  in Ohio as well as  Redlands University in California. After completing her schooling, she served 2 years in  the Army Nurse Corps during World War II.  Ms. Hancock moved to California in 1953 and  began working at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. In 1959, she moved to Alhambra, California.  Less  than a year after her  retirement  in  1988 from a 35-year career in nursing administration at Huntington Hospital, and 8 years  as a Member of the State Board of Registered  Nursing, Helen Hancock plunged into community volunteer work. Since then she has used  her  extensive  nursing  and  administrative  knowledge and skills to make a significant difference in the health and well being of countless seniors and their families.  As a senior herself, Ms. Hancock desired to  help other senior citizens enjoy  their  retirement years and began volunteering at Huntington Senior Care Network (HSCN); a Huntington Hospital  community-based  program  that helps seniors maintain  their  independence. Her interview skills have added to the  success of a National Council on Aging project  of HSCN to enhance the health of frail seniors  through increased physical activity. Helen has  been a tireless advocate for seniors as a long-  term care ombudsman for the Department of  Aging for nearly 15 years. For nearly 25 years,  she has been a resource for caregivers of Alzheimer’s patients at a weekly support group,  and she continues to promote Alzheimer’s disease education, as well as senior services and  elder abuse education, through membership in  several community coalitions.  Helen  is a  faith community nurse coordinator for All Souls Catholic Church, as part of  a program sponsored by Methodist Hospital of  Southern California and All Souls Catholic  Church, to improve the health of the community. She and her team conduct events that include blood pressure screenings, blood donor  drives and health education presentations to  reach members of their parish.  Last year, Helen was among 26 older adults  honored as Outstanding California Senior Volunteer leaders by the University of California  Berkeley School of Public Health.  I ask all Members of Congress to join me  today  in honoring a  remarkable woman of  California’s 29th Congressional District, Helen  Hancock.  f  HONORING RONALD HUDSON  HON. RON LEWIS  OFKENTUCKY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
159,,109,0.418,170,2006-03-15,Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to pay tribute to the life of a remarkable  citizen from my congressional district. Ronald  Hudson, a  longtime  resident of Leitchfield,  Kentucky, passed away February 20th at age  65. Mr. Hudson was a colorful and widely respected  figure  in Grayson County, having  served on the Leitchfield Fire Department for  46 years, 31 of those as Chief.  In a  recent  feature story  in  the Grayson  County News-Gazette, Chief Hudson  described himself as  ‘‘not a poster boy  firefighter’’ when he first joined the department in  1959. With typical self deprecating humor, he  described himself as ‘‘too short and too skinny, with trouble taking anything serious for any  length of  time.’’ He credited  the  late Murrell  Conklin, then Chief Emeritus of the Leitchfield  Department for coaching him through his first  few years, helping to mold him into a serious  firefighter and public servant.  Ronald Hudson was named Chief after only  12 years of service on  the department. As  Chief, he was  responsible  for  training and  managing a diverse crew of firefighters, purchasing and maintaining  fire apparatus, and  perpetually pursuing sources of  funding  to  keep  the department running. Chief Hudson  was personally responsible for countless acts  of heroism throughout his four decades as a  firefighter. Yet he always humbled himself with  the tough reality of all emergency personnel:  You can go from hero to zero and back again  in a matter of seconds.  Chief Hudson’s contributions to his community, staring down danger time and time again  to save lives and protect the safety and comfort of his neighbors, has made Leitchfield a  fine place to live for many years. Ronald Hudson’s life, career, and especially his final years  fighting against his own declining health, was  the true epitome of courage and generosity of  spirit.  In addition to his position on the Fire Department, Chief Hudson also served as Grayson County Coroner and was a member of the  American Legion Post 81, the Leitchfield Masonic Lodge, and the Fraternal Order of Police. He was a veteran of the U.S. Army and  owned and operated a small business  from  1983 to 2002.  Ronald Hudson’s distinguished life of service to his community and his country, along  with his unwavering dedication  to his  family  and  fellow  firefighters,  is a portrait of outstanding citizenship worthy of our collective respect and appreciation. It is my great privilege  to honor his memory today before the entire  United States House of Representatives.  f  THE  FEDERAL  JUDGESHIP  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE  EFFICIENCY  ACT OF 2005  HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON  OFIDAHO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
160,,109,0.293,170,2006-03-15,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. Speaker, article III of the  Constitution states that ‘‘the judicial Power of  the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as  the Congress may  from  time  to  time ordain  and establish.’’ At times in our Nation’s history, Congress has found it necessary to realign the United States Courts of Appeals into  more efficient and manageable circuits. Once  again, it’s time for Congress to exercise its article III powers by realigning the Ninth Circuit  and creating a new Twelfth Circuit.  I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of  Judiciary Chairman SENSENBRENNER’s H.R.  4093, the Federal Judgeship and Administrative Efficiency Act of 2005. In addition to creating additional federal judgeships, this legislation would divide the Ninth into two circuits.  These would consist of a new Ninth made up  of California, Hawaii, Guam and the Northern  Marianas, and a new Twelfth with Alaska,  Washington, Oregon, Montana,  Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona.  Mr. Speaker,  this division makes sense.  Putting aside any political, historical or emotional  arguments,  the  numbers  speak  for  themselves. A split of the Ninth Circuit is necessary because it has become disproportionately  large and unwieldy  in  relation  to  the  other eleven regional circuits.  The Honorable John M. Roll, U.S. District  Judge for Arizona, has recently provided me  with updated statistics regarding the Ninth Circuit. This  is where  the Ninth Circuit stands  today:  The population of the Ninth Circuit is 58 million people. This is one-fifth of the population  of the United States. It is also 27 million more  people than reside in the next largest circuit.  The Ninth Circuit consists of 9 states (including the most populous state), a territory,  and a commonwealth. The other circuits average less than four states. No other circuit decides the law for 9 states.

161,,109,-0.514,177,2006-03-15,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  express my deep concern at reports of the apparent harmful  impact of  the marketing of  high-cost  refund-anticipation  loans, RALs,  to  underserved communities.  While RALs are advertised as giving consumers quicker access  to  their hard-earned  tax refund, it has been brought to my attention  that  tax refunds can be obtained almost as  fast by the taxpayer to whom the refund is due  as if taxpayers file online. It appears that not  only are refunds not delivered with any greater  expediency, but with interest rates between 40  to 700 percent and additional  fees,  these  loans are so excessively priced that they deny  the taxpayer full use of their money.  This issue is of particular interest to me as  some of my constituents seem to be feeling  the brunt of these loans, I have recently been  informed that one of the highest concentration  of refund loans in 2003 was made within the  15th Congressional District in my home community, central Harlem. Also as the Ranking  Member of the Ways and Means Committee,  I am concerned because according to a recent  study undertaken by  the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, one  quarter of New Yorkers who  claimed  the  Earned Income Tax Credit in 2003 paid large  amounts of  their wages  in  fees  related  to  RALs.  Low-income families need not be exploited  for the gains of corporate entities. According  to  the  IRS, 79 percent of RAL recipients  in  2003 had incomes of $35,000 or less. In contrast, as  the nation’s  largest  tax-preparation  chain, H&R Block experienced an 8.5 percent  increase in RAL revenue for Fiscal Year 2003.  While RALs are one of H&R Block’s products,  I expect the company to practice due diligence  not only in promoting these products equally  among your many locations but also in informing clients of their rights and product terms.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you during this tax season to lend your support in holding H&R Block  and other  tax-preparing companies  responsible to equitable targeting of these high-cost  loans and full disclosure of their terms.  f  TRIBUTE TO HARRY BROWNE  HON. RON PAUL  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
162,,109,0.863,177,2006-03-15,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Speaker, America  lost a  great champion of liberty when Harry Browne  passed away on March 1, at the age of 72.  Harry had a passion for liberty and knowledge  of a wide variety of subjects. His communication style, as he himself so marvelously put it,  focused on converting his opponents  rather  than winning  the argument. These attributes  helped make him one of  the most effective  proponents of the freedom philosophy I have  had the privilege of knowing. Harry’s numerous books and columns, his radio and Internet  broadcasts, and his speeches educated millions in sound economics and the benefits of  a free society. Harry motivated many people  to become activists  in  the movement  to restore American liberties.  Harry  first came  to public attention  in  the  1970 when he penned a best-selling  investment book, How You Can Profit From  the  Coming Devaluation, which foresaw President  Richard Nixon’s abandonment of  the gold  standard and the ways the American economy  would be damaged by the inevitable resulting  inflation. Harry’s book helped many Americans  survive, and even profit, during the economic  troubles of  the seventies.  It also  introduced  millions of people to the insights developed by  followers of the Austrian school of economics  regarding the dangers fiat currency poses to  both prosperity and liberty posed by fiat. How  You Can Profit From the Coming Devaluation  is generally recognized as the founding document of  the hard money movement, which  combined the insights of the Austrian economists with a practical investment strategy.  Harry’s  third book, You Can Profit  from a  Monetary Crisis, reached number one on the  New York Times bestseller list. Other popular  books by Harry include How I Found Freedom  in an Unfree World, The Great Libertarian  Offer, and Why Government Doesn’t Work. I  was pleased to write the foreword for one of  Harry’s  books,  Liberty  A–Z:  Libertarian  Soundbites You Can Use Right Now, a collection of direct, thought-provoking, and often humorous responses to the questions advocates  of the freedom philosophy face.  During  the nineties, Harry worked  to advance liberty as a presidential candidate, columnist, radio  talk-show host, and columnist.  He also hosted an  internet-based  talk show  and founded DownsizeDC, a grassroots advocacy  group  whose  goals  are  accurately  summed up in its title. Even while struggling  with Lou Gehrig’s disease, Harry maintained a  full schedule of writing, hosting his radio show,  and speaking around the country.  Harry’s efforts were not limited to the economic realm. He understood the threat to liberty and prosperity posed by global crusades  for democracy, as well as the importance of  opposing restrictions on civil liberties. Harry’s  outspoken defense of civil  liberties and  the  Framers’ foreign policy of nonintervention took  on added importance in the last years of his  life when  too many self-styled advocates of  liberty attempted to curry favor with the political establishment by focusing solely on issues  of economic liberty or combined advocacy of  low taxes and regulations with active support  for militarism and restrictions on personal liberty.  In all his educational, financial, and political  work Harry served as a model for everyone  who works for the free society. Harry was principled and uncompromising in message, while  temperate and respectful of differing opinions  in delivery. He avoided  the histrionics  too  common in our today’s talk show culture, and  he never personalized his arguments. Even  when an opponent resorted to ad hominem attacks, Harry always kept his presentation on  the high ground of  ideas and principles.  In  conclusion, Mr. Speaker,  I extend my sympathy  to Harry Browne’s wife, Pamela, and  daughter Auburn, as well as the many he befriend in his years in the freedom movement,  and I pay tribute to Harry Browne for his lifelong efforts on behalf of individual liberty.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN BURN  ASSOCIATION  HON. PHIL ENGLISH  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
163,,109,0.251,177,2006-03-15,Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues  the  immense  contributions by  the  American Burn Association, ABA, to the fields  of burn treatment, education and prevention.  Whether caused by accidents, natural disasters or potential terrorist attacks, the ABA has  been  integral  in shaping  the discussion on  how this nation’s burn centers should manage  burn injuries. In all cases, the American Burn  Association stands ready as the critical initial  line of first responders. They need our support.  The ABA has more than 3,500 members in  the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia and Latin  America. All of the members of the association  are burn care specialists. They include physicians, surgeons, nurses, occupation and physical  therapists,  researchers, social workers,  firefighters, emergency  response personnel,  and  the underpinning of burn  research and  care—hospitals with highly specialized burn  centers.  As an organization, the ABA sets the industry standards for quality care for both civilian  and military treatment of burn injuries. Its research into advanced treatment for burn injuries is the foundation for the high quality of  care available to our wounded soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq.

164,,109,-0.519,184,2006-03-15,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  recognition of Dr. Manana Petrov, a distinguished member of the Brooklyn community. I  am honored to pay tribute to this outstanding  leader and I hope my colleagues will join me  in  recognizing  her  impressive  accomplishments.  Dr. Manana Petrov was born in the former  Soviet Union during  the height of  the Cold  War. Upon graduation  from high school, Dr.  Petrov enrolled  in Rostov Medical  Institute.  When Dr. Petrov’s family was forced to move  to the Georgia Republic, she transferred and  graduated from the Tbilisi Medical Institute. Dr.  Petrov worked as a physician  in  the  former  Soviet Union until she, her husband and her  daughter  immigrated  to  the United States.  Driven by the need to put food on the table,  Dr. Petrov passed all of her medical exams  within a year of immigrating to the U.S. Following the completion of her medical exams,  Dr. Petrov began her residency at the Brooklyn Hospital working tirelessly to support her  family.  In 1997, Dr. Petrov successfully passed her  licensing exam and is currently Double-Board  Certified in Internal Medicine and Hospice and  Palliative Care. She has been serving as the  attending physician at Brooklyn Hospital  for  the last 9 years. During her time at Brooklyn  Hospital, Dr. Petrov has served as an outstanding role model for aspiring doctors and  was nominated as the ‘‘Best Teaching Attending.’’ Additionally, in 2000, she was appointed  Medical Director of Hospice of New York and  in 2003, she was named  the Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine at  the Brooklyn  Hospice Center. Also  in 2003, Dr. Petrov  opened her own practice in Brooklyn, NY and  is faithfully serving her patients to this day. Dr.  Petrov has also worked for the last 5 years as  an Associate Program Director in an Internal  Medicine Program and boasts two publications  in medical journals.  Dr. Manana Petrov is an inspiration to not  only  those  in  the medical profession, but  to  our entire community. She has overcome numerous obstacles to realize her dream of becoming a doctor. Dr. Manana Petrov encompasses the true identity of a role model in today’s society and for that I ask that we applaud her accomplishments and contribution to  our community.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that it is incumbent  on  this body  to  recognize  the accomplishments of Dr. Manana Petrov, as she offers her  talents and community services for the good  of our local communities.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Manana Petrov’s selfless  service has continuously demonstrated a level  of altruistic dedication  that makes her most  worthy of our recognition today.  Mr. Speaker, please join our community in  honoring Dr. Manana Petrov for her dedication  and outstanding service to our community.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF BRIAN J.  SCHOFF  HON.

165,,109,-0.205,184,2006-03-15,Mr. DAVIS of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to pay my  respects  to Corporal  Brian J. Schoff for his service to a grateful nation. Corporal Schoff may have given his life  in defense of his country, but his soul and  spirit will live on to the many who knew him.  During a  funeral procession  in Manchester,  Tennessee hundreds of people stood outside  their homes and along the road to honor their  fallen soldier.  Corporal Schoff, a member of 2nd Battalion,  506th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat  Team, 101st Airborne Division, was awarded a  posthumous  promotion  from  Private  First  Class to Corporal, a Purple Heart, the Bronze  Star, and Good Conduct Medal for his service.  While I didn’t know Corporal Schoff personally, I do know the quality of our soldiers serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the globe.  They are caring, patriotic, God-fearing men  and women. I wish to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Brian Schoff for his selfless sacrifice. May he live on in eternal happiness with  his Lord in heaven.  Corporal Schoff  is survived by his  father,  Brian L. Schoff; his mother, Cathy Odle; his  stepfather, Kenneth Odle; stepsisters, Alicia  Burgess  and  LaDawn Mauk;  stepmother,  Debra Schoff; and his half-sister, Brianna  Schoff.  f  A TRIBUTE TO ROBIN KELLY  SHEARES  HON.

He and I offer this together as a way to keep these five important projects alive for further discussion, and as he said, all the operation and maintenance will be picked  up at the local level. So I thank our  colleagues for their consideration this  morning, for giving us time to speak  about this important amendment, and  I yield the floor.  ",2006
175,,109,-0.473,88,2006-05-01,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, this week we  commemorate Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Martyrs’ and Heroes’ Remembrance Day. With  events in Israel, the United States and around  the world, communities have gathered to memorialize the six million Jews murdered during  World War II.  This year, by a coincidence of the calendar,  Yom Hashoah comes just days after the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide and days  before a rally planned in Washington to protest the genocide in Sudan. Each of these observances is a somber reminder that world inaction in the face of injustice leaves a tragic  precedent for other acts of senseless bloodshed.  The road from Armenia to Auschwitz was direct. If more attention had been paid to the innocent victims and those who perpetrated the  atrocities against  the Armenian people,  the  Holocaust might have been prevented. Perhaps  if 60 years hadn’t passed before  the  U.N.  formally commemorated  the Holocaust,  international consciousness of other genocides  like the massacres in Darfur could have been  awakened sooner.  While the U.N. General Assembly has finally  committed to observing Holocaust commemoration annually, there is still tremendous complacency about modern day anti-Semitism.  Many nations have stood idly by while Iranian  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attacks the  Holocaust as fiction and aggressively calls for  Israel’s destruction.  For example, Ukraine this year will mark the  65th anniversary of  the Nazi massacre of  more than 100,000 Jews at Babi Yar. Yet it  took  fierce pressure  from  the United States  and Israel to urge the Ukrainian government to  take a stand against MAUP, a local university  that openly praises Ahmadinejad’s anti-Israel  statements, hosts anti-Zionism conferences,  and actively distributes anti-Semitic propaganda across Europe.  Memorials become relics if they do not stir  our modern conscience. One of the reasons  that Yom Hashoah was chosen  to be commemorated on the anniversary of the Warsaw  ghetto uprising is to inspire in all of us a drive  to fight back against injustice and intolerance.  Today, let us not only pay tribute to those  who perished. Let us pledge  to stand up  against governments that persecute their own  people. Let us bear witness  to  the crimes  against humanity  that are occurring  in our  midst. And let us declare our commitment to  fight the reemergence of anti-Semitism so that  the cry ‘‘Never Again’’ rings true.  f  SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title  IV  of Senate Resolution  4,  agreed to by the Senate on February 4,  1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all  meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference.  This title requires all such committees  to notify the Office of the Senate Daily  Digest—designated by the Rules Committee—of the time, place, and purpose  of the meetings, when scheduled, and  any cancellations or changes  in the  meetings as they occur.

176,House,109,-0.338,4,2006-05-10,Mr. BISHOP of New York.," Mr. Speaker, is there any doubt today that this  administration’s  first  priority  continues to be tax cuts for the wealthiest  at the expense of education, health  care and homeland  security, all of  which are being cut to pay for these  tax cuts?  We have been promised that extending dividend and capital gains cuts will  create a rising tide that lifts all boats.  But American families know that it  takes so much more than a trickle-  down effect for tax cuts to deliver relief from rising gas prices, soaring tuition and skyrocketing health costs.  If the tax cuts had performed as our  friends on the other side of the aisle  promised, an exploding economy would  have offset these strains. Instead, we  are now burdened with $400 billion deficits, $3 trillion in new debt since 2001,  and deep cuts to hospitals, schools and  law enforcement.  How  can we  possibly  justify  tax  breaks  for millionaires worth more  than the entire amount President Bush  requested for the Department of Education and more than twice his budget  for the VA? The answer  is that we  can’t. We just can’t.  Instead, Americans who need  our  help the most must get in line and patiently wait for the Republicans’ tax  cuts  to make  any meaningful  difference, if they ever do, in their daily  struggle.  Mr. Speaker, middle-class Americans  deserve much better.  f  PRESCRIPTION  DRUG  SAVES MONEY  FOR  MEDICARE  PROGRAM  SENIORS  (Mrs. MYRICK asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2006
177,House,109,0.56,4,2006-05-10,Mrs. MYRICK.," Mr. Speaker, to date,  more than 30 million Americans have  signed up for the new Medicare prescription drug program, and that is because it saves them money. An AARP  survey found that almost 80 percent of  those enrolled  in the Medicare prescription drug plan say that the new  benefit is meeting or exceeding their  expectations. Seniors don’t have  to  choose between prescription drugs and  paying their bills or putting food on  the table anymore.  And there is still time for seniors  who are not currently enrolled to sign  up for the program. They have until  May 15th to sign up without any penalty.  They simply have to call 1–800–MEDICARE and ask about drug savings, and  there will be someone there who will  help to walk them through the process.  Again, the deadline to sign up with  no penalties is May 15, so call and save  today.  f  PROVIDE REAL TAX RELIEF FOR  CONSUMERS AND REPEAT  ENERGY TAX BREAKS  (Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
178,House,109,0.616,4,2006-05-10,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker, one  of my colleagues referenced the study  from the Law Library of Congress entitled ‘‘Immigration Law Sanctions and  Enforcement in Selected Foreign Countries.’’ It evaluates the policies and the  practices of Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, Sweden and Switzerland. The countries were selected specifically to provide a geographically and racially diverse group for comparison purposes.  What the study found is that strong  enforcement of  immigration  law and  tough sanctions can effectively reduce  illegal immigration.  Mr. Speaker, it is of concern to us  that we learned yesterday that the U.S.  Government  is releasing  information  on the Minutemen border patrols to  the Mexican Government. It  is very  frustrating that our government would  be both willing and able to release information to the Mexican Government  on these patrols, yet unable to adequately deter  illegal entry  into this  country.  Mr. Speaker, I want to see a border  wall or technology improvements that  will actually halt illegal border crossings. There  is  incredible  consensus  among Tennesseans  that  enough  is  enough on this issue. It is time for action.  f  DO-NOTHING CONGRESS REFUSING  TO ADDRESS NEEDS OF AMERICANS  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2006
179,House,109,-0.404,4,2006-05-10,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  today is the 130th day of 2006. Guess  how many of those days this House has  been in session to address the needs of  the American  people? Twenty-nine.  Twenty-nine. This is only the 29th voting day of the year here in the House of  Representatives.  No wonder, Mr. Speaker, the American people have lost confidence in this  Congress.  The Republican majority  would rather recess than tackle the  tough issues of our day.  Or could it be that the Republicans  are  simply  incapable  of  governing?  House Republicans have yet to pass a  budget for the upcoming fiscal year.  Before the April recess, the House Republican leadership brought a bill to  this floor, but was forced to pull it  from consideration after determining  that it would fail.  Regardless of whether or not Republicans are able to pick up enough Republican votes this week, the fact remains that they have presided over the  largest fiscal collapse in American history. Five years ago they  inherited  record budget surpluses, and they have  turned those into record deficits.  f  b1030  PORK BOOTLEGGERS  (Mr. MCHENRY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

180,House,109,0.518,11,2006-05-10,Mr. INGLIS of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.  Mr. Speaker,  first I would  like to  thank Mr. LIPINSKI for his cooperative  spirit and very helpful comments along  the way. Mr. LIPINSKI is our chief cosponsor and someone who has improved  the bill as  it has worked  its way  through the process. Perhaps that is  because of a pleasant personal relationship and also my respect for his expertise that made it easy for him to work  with us, and I appreciate the work that  he did to improve the bill.  Along the way we did make improvements through the committee process,  and I appreciate the cooperative way  that Mr. LIPINSKI and others on the  Democratic side of the aisle worked  with us in the committee. The result is  a better bill and I am very appreciative  of that.  Also, Mr. Speaker, I will introduce  for the RECORDletters in support of the  H-Prize  from the National Hydrogen  Association,  the Hydrogen Advisory  Council, the U.S. Fuel Cell Council,  SAE  International, Shell Hydrogen,  BMW, General Motors, Air Products  and Chemicals, Inc., Enertech Capital,  Ion America, Tiax LLC, Protium Energy Technologies, and professors from  USC Davis and Purdue.  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the great work of our folks on  the  committee,  particularly  David  Goldston was  extremely  helpful  in  making  all  this happen. He works  closely with Chairman BOEHLERT.  I  also want to thank Mr. GORDON and,  again, Mr. LIPINSKIand other members  of our staff that made it possible for us  to get this quickly to the House floor.  Let me close with this: We have an  opportunity to solve America’s challenge  in energy.  It  is a Republican  problem. It is a Democratic problem. It  is an American problem. The good news  is, it can have an American solution.  This is an opportunity for a triple  play. If we do this right, we can improve our national security by ending  our dependence on foreign oil. We will  still use foreign oil; of course, we will  use oil for a long time, but we can  move away from the dependent state  that we are  in now, dependent on  places that are very unstable. So it is  an opportunity to improve our national  security.  It is also, secondly, an opportunity to  create jobs and economic development,  because  if we can reinvent the car,  imagine the jobs we can create.  And then, third, for the third part of  the triple play is an opportunity to  clean the air. Because whether it is an  internal combustion engine, the way  that BMW intends to do it, or a fuel  cell, the way that General Motors intends to do it, the only emission out of  the back of the car is water. We want  to incentivize those breakthroughs.  There are some technological hurdles  ahead, but with an H-Prize, with the  incentive  from  the Federal Government and the support of the Federal  Government saying we are going to do  this, we are going to get there, I believe that we will summon the creativity of inventors and investors out  there in America and around the world  to try to win this prize, and in the  process, America will win with a triple  play.  Mr. Speaker, the letters I referred to  previously are as follows:  HYDROGENADVISORYCOUNCIL,  May 8, 2006.  Representative BOBINGLIS,  Cannon HOB,  Washington, DC.  DEARCONGRESSMAN INGLIS: On behalf of  the Hydrogen Advisory Council, I want to  congratulate you on the movement of H.R.  5143, the H-Prize Act of 2006, through the  House Science Committee. We look forward  to working with your office in the near future to move this crucial legislation to the  President’s desk.  As you know, the U.S. spent almost $250  billion on oil in 2005 and 25% of America’s  trade deficit currently comes from importing  oil. These staggering numbers combined with  growing instability in the world’s oil producing regions is very concerning, and the  need for a domestic solution to the nation’s  future energy needs has never been more apparent.  We believe that the solution is hydrogen.  Not only does hydrogen provide a clean and  renewable source of energy for the U.S., it  will help create thousands of new jobs and  enhance our national security.  The H-Prize will help move the nation towards this goal. By incentivizing key breakthroughs in hydrogen technology, storage,  production, and distribution, the H-Prize Act  of 2006 will help speed the hydrogen economy  to fruition. Furthermore, the H-Prize will do  this in a fiscally responsible way by only  awarding prize monies to technologies that  reach  set  performance metrics  and  by  leveraging a combination of federal dollars  and private-sector investment without impeding natural market forces.  The Hydrogen Advisory Council fully supports the H-Prize Act of 2006 and will do all  it can to assure its future passage and utilization. Thank you again for your continued  leadership on hydrogen policy.  Cordially,  Chairman, Hydrogen Advisory Council.  ROBERTS. WALKER,  THENATIONALHYDROGENASSOCIATION,  May 9, 2006.  Hon. BOBINGLIS,  House of Representatives, Cannon House Office  Building,  Washington, DC.  DEARREPRESENTATIVEINGLIS: On behalf of  the 102 members of the National Hydrogen  Association (NHA), I would like to extend  our hearty support for your H-Prize legislation, H.R. 5143. For over 17 years, we have  been an association dedicated to pursuing  the research, development and demonstration of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies,  leading to a firm basis for establishing and  growing a commercial Hydrogen Economy.  We believe that this latest version of the bill  will have an important affect upon how needed technical breakthroughs occur.  Your bill promises to generate the drama  and  excitement  of  genuine  technological  feats that might otherwise appear obscure.  Above and beyond the steady, devoted work  of those many scientists and engineers in our  strong RD&D programs, we need to build a  sense of excitement, of the high value of pursuing difficult tasks—something to dramatize our nation’s willingness to invest in this  future. Prizes motivate and inspire—if carefully  focused, they can truly move technology ahead.  This is something powerful that the federal  government can do together with industry,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:32 May 11, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10MY7.019 H10MYPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

182,House,109,0.478,18,2006-05-10,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, my friend  from Pasco understands this very well,  and he has done a great job of providing  leadership on these economic  growth issues.  Mr. Speaker, my friend from Rochester and my friend from Fort Lauderdale are two people for whom I have  the highest regard. I really do. I enjoy  working with them on the Rules Committee, and I just had the thrill of participating  in  the Canada-U.S.  Interparliamentary  Conference with my  friend  from Rochester, dealing with  areas of concern as it relates to our  neighbor to the north.  But I have to say, as I listen to the  arguments that are being propounded  by both of my friends from the other  side of the aisle, they represent little  more than what I describe as the ideological baggage of the past.  b1200  Now, my friend from Rochester has  just talked about the 1980s. It is true  that we saw a tremendous increase in  spending during the 1980s, a lot of increased spending  in the area of national defense. And we saw the demise  of the Soviet Union. The Cold War  came to an end.  During the 1980s, Mr. Speaker, because of the 1981 Economic Recovery  Tax Act, I think I am the only Member  on the floor now who was here at that  time, and I am very proud to have  voted  for  that. We  put  into  place  across-the-board tax rate reductions,  marginal  rate  reductions. And Mr.  Speaker, what happened? We  saw a  doubling of the flow of revenues to the  Federal Treasury during the 1980s.  People continue to try and rewrite  the history of the 1980s, somehow implying that we saw the U.S. economy  go right into the tank. We saw a surge  in economic growth and a doubling in  that flow of revenues to the Treasury.  And so I think that this notion of class  warfare, us versus them, is a tired, old,  failed one.  Now, my friend just referred to the  tax reduction that an American who is  earning $40,000 will get juxtaposed to  someone who is earning hundreds of  thousands of dollars a year, who will  get a $41,000 tax reduction. And he referred to the fact that someone will  earn $40,000 and get a very small tax  cut, and  that person  in  the upper  bracket will get a $41,000 tax cut.  I mean, I would ask my friend, does  he advocate that the person earning  $40,000 a year get a $41,000 tax cut?  ",2006

184,House,109,-0.268,25,2006-05-10,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Speaker, I was eating my  lunch downstairs, and as a  member of the committee I voted for  this bill in committee, as did Mr. SKELTON, and I support the bill.  However, Mr. HUNTER’s discussion of  the provision about Channel  Islands  National Park, Santa Rosa Island, I  thought was incomplete and gave an  inaccurate picture of what the situation is. I agree with ",2006
185,House,109,-0.389,25,2006-05-10,Mrs. CAPPS.," This is  a provision, section 1036(c) of the bill,  that should never be in the defense bill.  You read the one sentence. It has nothing to do with veterans. There is not  the word  ‘‘veterans’’  or  ‘‘military’’  anywhere in the provision. This should  have been a provision that was considered by the Resources Committee.  Having said that, this is the background on this situation. In 1902 a private family owned and took control of  the Channel Islands. In 1986 they sold it  to the National Park Service as part of  the Channel Islands National Park for  about $30 million and had an agreement that they could be on the island  managing their own private herd of elk  and deer for some period of time.  In the late 1990s there was litigation  brought by the National Parks and  Conservation Association, and a settlement was  reached between  the National Park Service, the family that  owns the deer and the elk, and the National Parks and Conservation Association. Everyone agreed to this settlement that has been going on now for  the last decade, that by December 31,  2011, there would be no more hunting  on this  island because the  island  is  shut down, about 90 percent of it, 4 to  5 months of the year.  But here is the key point. Number  one, this is a privately owned herd. It  is the same as if Mr. COLEor Mr. SKELTONhad a herd of cows. This herd of  deer and elk is owned not by the government, not by the National Park  Service, this herd is owned by a private  group. It is not the government’s business to decide what to do.  Second, there is not a plan, as was  described by the Armed Services Committee chairman, to exterminate the  herd. Here is what the plan is. And several months ago I talked to a member  of the  family. They  love this herd.  They have professionally managed this  herd for years. They have trophy hunts  on the island. Their intent is to move  this herd off the  island and  find a  place, they do not know where yet, I do  not think, but to move it off of the island.  According to the settlement that was  reached, it is what I call the Wiley  Rogue provision, if there are a few animals that are left that the company is  having trouble, that own it, they are  having trouble trapping those animals,  the National Park Service has agreed  to share in half of the expense of getting those last few animals, including  perhaps, perhaps, if necessary, the hiring of professional hunters or helicopters or  something  to get  them.  There is not a plan to exterminate this  private herd. This is a privately owned  herd. It is not up to the government to  exterminate it. This provision is only  to help this private company get these  last few animals. That is only if necessary. This provision should not have  been in the defense bill.  ",2006

188,House,109,-0.432,32,2006-05-10,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank Chairman HUNTERand Mr. SKELTON for the opportunity. I stand here  today in support of the bill moving forward, but I have a caveat that I hope  will be able to be addressed before we  come to a final conclusion.  As the chairman knows, my original  opposition was  to what  has  been  termed the ‘‘bridge fund’’; upon reconsideration, I have become a strong advocate of  it. For those not  familiar  with it, the bridge fund is a legitimate  methodology for the authorizing committee to deal with the actual cost of  deployments  of  our Armed  Forces  throughout the world.  Presently, the bridge fund will deal  only with approximately  6 months’  worth of costs associated, expenditures  associated, with these deployments. As  a result then we will have to take up  yet another supplemental budget, probably just after the first of the year,  within a month or so, and that will, in  turn,  find us dealing with other requests, other emergencies, that will be  included in this so-called supplemental  budget. It is not an emergency that we  need funding for for our deployments  overseas, but rather an admission and  an acknowledgment of the true costs of  these deployments overseas.  So, Mr. Chairman, I most certainly  urge that we move the bill along and,  at the same time, then take up this  question of being straightforward and  honest with the American people as to  what the true costs are of our deployments and to see to it that the military does not have to cannibalize the  existing budget and take us away from  what I consider 100 percent support of  the troops 50 percent of the time.  I believe, even though I am in opposition to much of what is the foundation  for support, the irony in this is that  those like myself who did not support  the effort in Iraq as undertaken and  have serious reservations about how  the war is being conducted, the military action is being conducted in Afghanistan, are actually being sustained  in our position; rather than  finding  support for those who originally were  for the war in Iraq or think that we are  doing the right thing in Afghanistan,  that position is being undermined because we are not being straightforward  with people as to what the true costs  are.  There  is a case of unease  in the  American public, I think, with regard  to our present policies in Iraq and Afghanistan because we do not have a  straightforward, honest approach with  the American people as to what the  costs are. I believe the American people will pay any costs to protect our security if they feel that we are being  honest and straightforward about it.  We need to do that. We need to bring  the bridge fund in our authorization up  to the actual cost, and not undermine  the good work that has been on this  bill this year.  Mr. Chairman, as the ranking minority member of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee  of the HASC, I am pleased to support H.R.  5122. I also want to commend my chairman  and partner on the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, Congressman KURTWELDON,  for  his nonpartisan approach  to our subcommittee’s portion’ of this bill.  The procurement and research portions of  this bill  that  the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee oversees strikes an effective balance between getting our  troops  the equipment they need, ensuring that the equipment  works, and ensuring that it is all acquired at a  price the Nation can afford. Striking this balance is always difficult, but given the pressure  on the DOD budget from the war in Iraq, this  was an especially  challenging  year.  I am  pleased  to support  the procurement and research aspects of this bill as a good-government approach  to making  tough decisions  when funds are limited.  This bill  is a significant  improvement over  the procurement and  research budget presented by the President in two critical ways.  First,  it  is a more straightforward document  that lays out what the committee decided the  military’s priorities should be, and what funding these priorities will actually cost. Second,  it shifts funding from programs that are simply  not working and moves  those  funds  to programs that are working and are delivering effective equipment  to  the  troops  in  the  field  today. With  troops  in combat  the Congress  has a non-negotiable obligation  to weigh  in  heavily on  the side of  immediate and near-  term needs of the military.  There are two programs that this bill takes  some significant  funding away  from, and  I  want to address the committee’s reasoning on  these reductions, because they were both difficult decisions. The first is the Army’s Future  Combat System, which this bill cuts by $325  million.  I want to be clear that this is not a move to  punish the Army. Everyone on this committee  recognizes that the Army is carrying the heaviest burden in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  in  terms  lives  lost and dollars spent. Every  member of this committee also wants to ensure we have an Army that is ready today and  prepared for the challenges of the future.

189,House,109,0.47,39,2006-05-10,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to  thank  the  gentleman who  just  spoke. I share his focus on IEDs, and  we will work together.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr. HAYES), who represents so many  great people in uniform in North Carolina and has spent so much time working  for their quality of  life and  for  their effectiveness on the battlefield,  and also for all of the people who work  in the defense industry so we can make  sure when the American taxpayer pays  for defense items, since we defend the  free world, that those items are made  by Americans and represent American  jobs.  ",2006
190,House,109,0.351,39,2006-05-10,Mr. HAYES.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  Chairman HUNTERand I thank the minority member, Mr. SKELTON,  for a  truly outstanding piece of bipartisan  work. This is all about the men and  women in uniform. It reflects the commitment, the dedication, the timing  and the absolute perseverance of two  fine leaders in our committee in wholeheartedly supporting the incredible effort that our men and women in uniform are putting forward in winning  the war on terrorism. I thank them for  their hard work and support and their  unanimous approval of this bill.  I am very proud to have Fort Bragg,  the epicenter of the universe, home of  Joint Special Operations Command, in  my home district.  As we are all aware, Special Operations Forces, SOF, are playing an increasingly essential role as we continue to fight and, more importantly,  win the war on terror. Due to their importance in winning this fight, the 2006  Quadrennial Defense Review called for  a 15 percent increase in Special Operations Forces beginning in fiscal year  2007. This would increase Army Special  Forces battalions by one-third, raise  SEAL team manning, and grow Civil  Affairs and Psychological Operations.  Some of the very best ways to begin  growing the SOF  force  is to retain  those highly  trained  individuals already serving under Special Operations  and attract like-minded warriors to the  command. That is why my provision  requiring a DOD study on improving  retention of special operators is so essential.  I would again like to thank Chairman HUNTERand Chairman SAXTONof  our subcommittee for their support and  for working with me on this, and supporting me by including it in the manager’s amendment.  The report will give us better data on  the cost and investment that goes into  training and maintaining a special operator. It will include cost of training  and how much has been invested in the  average SOF operator after two deployments. It will also speak financially to  the special operators who have accumulated over 48 months of hostile fire  pay and the percentage who have accumulated over 60.  I will soon introduce a bill to provide  a new retention incentive for Special  Forces soldiers, and look forward to  continuing  to work with Chairman  HUNTERand my colleagues on this critical national security issue.  As we look towards the future, winning the war on terror, securing the  freedom for America and other like-  minded folks around the world, I want  to emphasize this is about every man  and woman in uniform whom we are so  proud of and appreciate for their service, and for their families’ support, and  we will continue to say prayers  for  their continued safety and success.  As we look forward to freedom, the  shining city on the hill and the best  days of America lying ahead, it is the  men and women in uniform who protect, defend and make us proud  to  whom we should look and give thanks  every night.

191,House,109,-0.353,39,2006-05-10,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill. As a  relatively new member of the Armed  Services Committee, I am grateful to  the ranking member, Mr. SKELTON, and  Chairman HUNTERfor working with me  on parts of the bill that are particularly important for Colorado, including  report language about the importance  of the High Altitude Army Aviation  Training Site, which  is  located  in  Eagle,  Colorado,  and  its  need  for  enough aircraft to fulfill its mission.  I am also grateful for the chairman’s  support of a provision to name a housing facility at Fort Carson, Colorado,  in honor of Mr. HEFLEY, who as my colleagues know is retiring this year. During his 20 years of representing Colorado’s Fifth District, Mr. HEFLEYhas  served with integrity and honor, and he  has been a fair and effective lawmaker.  I have learned a great deal from Mr.  HEFLEY in my years in Congress, and  along with everyone else here, I will  miss him.  I am also pleased with many other  provisions in the bill, including the extension of TRICARE coverage to all  Reservists, the blocking of the proposed plan to raise certain TRICARE  fees, the authorization of additional active duty Army and Army National  Guard personnel, added funds for up-armored Humvees and IED jammers, and  the 2.7 percent pay increase for military  personnel,  among  other  provisions.  I hope that the Rules Committee will  allow  debate  on many  important  amendments not made in order in today’s rule,  including one I proposed  that will bring us further towards our  goal of energy independence, and therefore national security.  In conclusion, I think this is a good  bill, a carefully drafted and bipartisan  bill, and I urge its support.  ",2006

194,House,109,0.641,109,2006-05-10,Ms. FOXX.," I thank the gentleman  from Kansas.  Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Davis amendment. Military treatment centers, which are dedicated to healing, nurturing and saving  lives, should not be  forced  into the  business of ending lives. This amendment, plain and simple, turns these facilities into abortion clinics by repealing a prolife provision, a prolife provision which was  signed  into  law by  President Clinton as part of the National Defense Authorization Act  in  1996.  This amendment contradicts fundamental U.S. military values such as  honor, courage and taking responsibility for one’s own actions. We believe  that life begins at conception and that  it is sacred. As Members of Congress,  we should do all we can to protect life.  That is what our military hospitals are  doing.  Instead, while we stand here today,  opportunist pro-abortion Members are  once again belittling and devaluing the  sanctity of human life. If this inappropriate amendment were adopted, not  only would taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars be used to perform abortions on  demand on our military bases, but our  military medical personnel would be  forced  to perform abortions against  their will.  b1600  Instead of equipping our armed services personnel with the tools needed to  operate and treat wounded or ill troops  and defend America, this amendment  would mandate that our military personnel  perform  abortions  and  kill  human fetuses. This is unacceptable.  This amendment must be  rejected  today, just as it has been in the past  five Congresses. I urge my colleagues  to join me in protecting human life by  voting against the Davis amendment.  ",2006

196,House,109,-0.448,123,2006-05-10,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this ill-advised, ill-conceived, poorly calculated, and deeply regressive tax bill for the  same reasons that I rose to oppose the tax  cuts of 2001 and the yearly effort by this Congress  to make  them permanent every year  since their approval.  I oppose them for a host of reasons. I oppose them because they are leaving our children and grandchildren with trillions, I say that  again, trillions of dollars of liabilities owned by  the Chinese, the Saudis, the Indians, and the  Europeans. We are  literally mortgaging  the  prosperity of today’s children to the fickle nature of our competitors and rivals.  I oppose  them because  it has  forced our  military to go into battle without proper body  armor on our  troops—soldiers who  largely  come  from  families  that do not benefit  from  these tax cuts—and without blast shields on  our Humvees.  I oppose them because it shifts the tax burden from those who benefit the most from the  success of America,  to  those who are desperately  trying  to  realize  their  American  dream. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the poorest workers under  this  legislation will end up with a  total  tax savings of  two dollars while  those  who earn $1,000,000 or more will pocket a  generous $42,000.  But  this distribution  isn’t  just unfair  to  the  working poor; it is deeply unjust to the middle  class. Families who earn  from $75,000  to  $100,000 will only receive a dollar a day of tax  relief—not even close enough  to cancel out  the higher interest rates on credit cards and  student loans that are resulting because of our  persistent budget deficits.  Finally, I am opposed to this legislation because it excuses this Congress from the tough  decisions that a future Congress and a future  President are going to have to make. We all  know  that  the Alternative Minimum Tax  is  going to hit the middle class hard and to fix it  will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. But  rather than addressing it, we are asking the  Congress of 2012 to take care of our mess.  We know  that  the  retirement of  the Baby  Boomers  is going  to  force massive concessions in our budget, but again, our message is  to  leave  it  to  tomorrow. Let someone else  clean up our mess.  Well, I hate to say, with this Congress and  this President I am not surprised we are asking someone else to take responsibility for yet  another mess.  ",2006

ELIMINATION OF INEQUITY IN ELIGIBILITY AND PROVISION OF ASSIGNMENT INCENTIVE PAY.  (a) SENSEOFCONGRESS.—It is the sense of  Congress that the Secretary of the Army  should promptly correct the pay inequity in  the provision of assignment incentive pay  under section 307a of title 37, United States  Code, to members of the Army National  Guard and the Army Reserve serving on active duty in Afghanistan and Iraq that arose  from the disparite treatment between—  (1) those members who previously served  under a call or order to active duty under  section 12302 of title 10, United States Code,  and who are eligible for assignment incentive pay; and  (2) those members who previously served  under a call or order to active duty under  section 12304 of such title and who are currently  ineligible  for assignment  incentive  pay.  (b) REPORTREQUIRED.—Not later than 30  days after the date of the enactment of this  Act, the Secretary of the Army shall submit  to Congress a report—  (1) specifying the number of members of  the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve adversely affected by the disparate  treatment afforded  to members who previously served under a call or order to active  duty under section 12304 of title 10, United  States Code, in determining eligibility for  assignment incentive pay; and  (2) containing proposed remedies or courses  of action to correct this inequity, including  allowing time served during a call or order  to active duty under such section 12304 to  count toward the time needed to qualify for  assignment incentive pay.

200,House,109,0.54,137,2006-05-10,Mr. KINGSTON.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentlewoman  from Connecticut  for yielding  and  the  gentleman from Georgia for his leadership  on this issue.  I want to tell the story about Bennie  and Katheryn, real people in Vidalia,  Georgia. This is a couple who was paying $2,200 a month for their prescription drug bill. One of my staffers happened to be related to them and heard  about it, and he went over there and  sat down with them on all their drug  needs and went over the website. He  did not make a recommendation, but  he showed them the information and  they made their own choice. Now their  total drug cost has gone from $2,200 a  month to $104 a month, a 95 percent  savings.  When they saw stuff like that, they  did not believe it was possible, because  they too had heard some of the rhetoric, some of the angry, some of the  bitter rhetoric that comes out of Washington, D.C., and they thought, well,  there is no way. But, in fact they are  enjoying it now, and they need that  extra income just like so many other  millions of seniors do around the country.  Mr. Speaker,  I heard  former Secretary of Health and Human Services  Tommy  Thompson  say  that when  Gladys starts talking to Mabel, this  thing will really take hold. And, indeed, that is the truth. My office has  had 48 workshops helping people decide  which program works for them. Maybe  it doesn’t work for them, because I am  always quick to say, it might not be  the best thing for everybody. That is  part of what a public offering is. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.  But  it works  for most people. It  is  about a 50 percent to 60 percent savings  for most people. Bennie got a 95 percent savings. Not everybody is going to  get that.  But  the  interesting  thing  is  that  Gladys is talking to Mabel, because my  always quotes  Ronald Reagan in saying that markets  are more powerful than armies. In this  case we have an army of people saying  this is a horrible program that should  be thrown away, thrown out; it is bad,  it is wicked, it is the Republicans up to  no good.  But look at the market. In my district, with my 48 workshops, our market penetration  is about 70 percent  right now. The interesting thing is one  friend GILGUTKNECHT of my colleagues who is not in favor of  this bill has about the same penetration, and he hasn’t held one workshop.  That  is one  the  ironies  of  it.  I  thought I am going to go out as a  salesperson and really wave the flag  and tell everybody how great it is. I am  irrelevant. The market is more powerful than the army, the army for it or  the army against  it. The market  is  selling this thing, not the Republican  Party, not the Democrat Party, wherever they may stand on it at the moment.  The reality is the seniors like it, and  the reality is our seniors need it, because so many of them were having to  choose between food on their table and  prescription drugs.  My mom, who takes Tamoxifen from  now on for the rest of her life, and my  dad who has diabetes and their friends,  they have some choices. Not everybody  is going to sign up for it, but everybody  is aware that the program is out there.  I will close with a quote from my  good friend from Minnesota, who had  voted against this bill. He said he has  moved from being an atheist to an agnostic, but pretty soon he is going to  be a holy roller and a believer like everybody  else,  because markets  are  stronger than armies.  ",2006
201,House,109,-0.343,151,2006-05-10,Ms. SCHWARTZ of Pennsylvania.," It  was  interesting  in the Budget Committee when we talked about the principle that you are talking about, that  we should know where the revenues are  coming from if we are going to spend  money. That  is really what we are  talking about.  It is basically being unable to meet  their obligations. It is knowing where  that money is coming from. Of course,  we do budget not just for next year, but  we budget out 5 years. We used to  budget to 10 years. But we do see those  kinds of numbers so we can anticipate  what we think might be happening.  And what was interesting about that  discussion in the Budget Committee is  that there, in fact, is some interest, I  think, on the other side of the aisle in  doing this. They understand as well  that, I think some of them do know, of  course, they would not let that pass,  but in fact I think if we really, truly  could sit down in a bipartisan way and  say, look, we have a responsibility to  do this in a way that does not create a  debt we do not even have any way of  repaying at this point.  The Republicans  have,  of  course,  taken certain things off budget. That  means, of course, that let’s not really  consider what the cost to Katrina is,  for example; the real cost of the war in  Iraq and Afghanistan in which some estimates in the budget this year have  been $50 billion when we know that it  could well get up to $400 billion.  Well, if you know that, we have to be  straight with the American people. We  have to be able to say, this is what we  know it is going to cost us. How are we  going to have the revenues to support  that? Where is it going to come from?  Let’s have that as a serious discussion  and  let’s make the hard choices we  have to make.  We know we want to support our  troops. We want to make sure that  they have all the equipment they need.  That has been a discussion. Of course,  we will support the troops in that. But  let’s be real about what it will cost us  and let’s be honest with the American  people about how we will do that.  I think there is some interest on the  other side of the aisle, but in fact if we  do that, there is no way they could go  ahead with the kind of budget that we  will be faced with tomorrow because it  does not reveal all that we need to  know about what our obligations are.  And as you point out, for American  families who struggle every day to figure out how do they pay, we talk about  gasoline prices. That throws budgets  into a real problem when you have  budgeted really tight.  It is not a problem to budget really  tight if you do not have any contingency, if you are not really honest with  yourself that there will be an expense  next month. But in fact we are making  it harder on American families by not  being honest with them.  And we are making it harder on them  by not bringing down gasoline prices.  We are making it harder on them by  not helping their kids going to college.  We are making it harder on them by  not allowing ways for us to be sure  that their business can pay for health  insurance.  You can almost name any issue and  we are making it harder on American  families when in fact it does not have  to be that way.  ",2006

There are a couple of hundred of  them here—12 million employers,  80  million workers.  I would like for you to see the small  business organizations that are supporting the Durbin-Lincoln bill. Oh,  there are two. OK.  I want to share a letter from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners as well. They are writing in  response to our May 2 request for a review of S. 2510 Small Employers Health  Benefits Program sponsored by Senators DURBINand LINCOLN.  I ask unanimous consent the letter  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  MAY9, 2006.  Hon. MICHAELB. ENZI,  Chair, Committee on Health, Education, Labor  and Pensions, Washington, DC.  DEARCHAIRMANENZI: We are writing in response to your May 2, 2006, request for our  review of S.  2510,  the Small Employers  Health Benefits Program Act, sponsored by  Senators Durbin and Lincoln.  The authors of S. 2510 sought the input of  the NAIC when drafting their bill and we appreciate their willingness to work with and  consider the views of insurance regulators.  Like your bill, S. 1955, the Durbin/Lincoln  bill does not include the option of self-funded  association plans, instead requiring coverage  to be purchased from carriers that are licensed in and regulated by the states. This is  a significant improvement over association  health plan legislation, such as S. 406. The  bill would also preserve state rating rules  and  benefit mandates,  thus maintaining  state authority over health insurance regulatory policy.  We are concerned, however, about the practical impact this legislation would have. S.  2510 creates an unlevel playing field by requiring plans sold through the Small Employer Health Benefit Plan (SEHBP) to meet  different  rating  standards  than  those  required of plans not sold through the SEHBP.  By setting different rules for different carriers, S. 2510 could create an unworkable  market in some states.  For example, if state law allows carriers in  the general market to charge small employers with healthier, younger workers significantly less, and the federal law requires carriers in the SEHBP to have only a modest  variation in rates, the SEHBP carriers will  be selected against.  In  fact,  few carriers  would want to participate in this program in  states with such rating disparity.  S. 2510 does attempt to ameliorate this  problem by providing subsidies for those that  participate  in the SEHBP. We agree that  these subsidies will help, but they are not  sufficient. We believe that states are best  suited to establish rating rules for all carriers—creating two sets of rules would be  harmful to the workings of the small group  markets. This could also limit the ability of  states to develop innovative programs to address the growing health care crisis.  Finally, both S. 2510 and S. 1955 will not affect the underlying and primary causes of  skyrocketing health  care  costs  that are  making  health  insurance  increasingly  unaffordable for millions of Americans. However, we do applaud you and Senators Durbin  and Lincoln for your efforts and we hope our  dialogue will continue and yield real solutions.  Sincerely,  CATHERINEJ.  WEATHERFORD,  Executive Vice President and CEO;  ALESSANDROIUPPA,  Superintendent of Insurance,  State  of  Maine, NAIC President;  WALTERBELL,  Commissioner of Insurance, State of Alabama, NAIC President-Elect.

Scott Severns of the  South Bend Police Department was shot during an attempted robbery. He succumbed to  his wounds and passed early Sunday morning.  I have heard it said that at times like these,  we should not focus on how someone dies,  but on how they lived, but how Cpl. Severns  died was a testament to how he lived. When  two would-be robbers approached Cpl. Severns and a female companion, brandished a  gun, and  threatened  them, Cpl. Severns  instinctively stepped  in between  the gunman  and his friend. Character like this cannot be  taught through a police academy course, and  it  is not  issued  to every officer after  their  swearing in. This type of valor can only come  from an individual with the heart of a hero.  We oftentimes do not take enough time to  appreciate the sacrifice that law enforcement  officers make every single day so that we can  live in safety. It is easy for us to go about our  daily lives without a thought about those that  stand in between us and those that would try  to hurt us.  Cpl. Severns’s sacrifices from the moment  he first put on his uniform, until his tragic, premature end, exemplify  the best of American  law enforcement.

The Warriors totaled 150 points at Hart-Patterson Athletic Complex  in Waco, TX easily  winning  the TAPPS 5A crown over second-  place Midland Christian with 82.50.  After  the  first day’s  field events,  things  looked just as dark as the weather forecast for  Liberty, as the Warriors trailed Dallas Christian  by five points. With the weather holding despite the prediction of thunderstorms in Waco,  the Warriors came back strong on the track,  and dominated the medal stand, shattering the  state record of 3:24.45  in  the 4 x 440-yard  relay with 3:22.70 and also winning the 4 x  l00-meter relay in 43.49 and taking third in the  4 x 200 in 1:31.20.

Attending one of our nation’s military academies  is an invaluable experience that offers a world-  class education and demands  the very best  that  these young men and women have  to  offer.  James brings an enormous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming  class of West Point cadets. While attending  Bowling Green High School in Bowling Green,  Ohio, James attained a grade point average  which placed him near the top of his class.  While a gifted athlete, James has maintained  the highest standards of excellence in his academics, choosing  to enroll and excel  in Advanced Placement classes  throughout high  school. James has obtained the rank of Eagle  Scout, has been a delegate to Buckeye Boys’  State and president of his school’s Model  United Nations Club.  Outside  the classroom, James has distinguished himself as an accomplished student-  athlete by actively participating in fencing and  cycling. He has also remained active  in his  community by volunteering to assist his local  Meals on Wheels program. Upon completion  of high school, James continued his education  at Washington and Lee University  in Lexington, Virginia. I have no doubt that James  will employ the lessons of his student leadership as he excels among the leaders at West  Point.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating James D. McKinney on his  appointment  to  the United States Military  Academy at West Point. Our service academies offer the finest military training and education available anywhere in the world. I am  sure that James will do very well during his  career at West Point and I ask my colleagues  to join me in wishing him well as he begins his  service to the nation.  f  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL RICHARD  SIMCOCK  HON.

210,House,109,-0.277,4,2006-05-17,Mr. SALAZAR.," Mr. Speaker, 6 years  ago our Nation was in a secure financial position. We had a balanced budget, a pay-as-you-go system for funding  government programs, and a  record  surplus of $5.6 trillion.  Now after years of  imposing their  reckless fiscal policies on this country,  the administration and Congress have  squandered our reserves, and their policies have created a record $3.2 trillion  debt.  Not only that, but under this watch  the cost of living for average Americans has gone up significantly. In just  the  last  few years alone, gas prices  have reached $3 a gallon, fuel costs for  farmers have gone up 113 percent, and  the interest rate has risen more than 16  times.  But just when you think things cannot get any worse, the leaders of this  body put forward a shameful budget  resolution that makes no attempt to  bring our Nation’s finances back into  balance.  Instead,  their  irresponsible  fiscal  record  continues  full  steam  ahead. The proposed 2007 budget will  increase the deficit even further with  no plan to ever return to balance in the  future.  Mr. Speaker, this budget resolution  may be more of the same, but Americans know it is time for change.  f  IMMIGRATION REFORM  (Mr. MCHENRY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

211,House,109,-0.454,18,2006-05-17,Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself as much time  as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman,  I oppose H.R. 4200.  This  unnecessary  legislation waives  critical  conservation  laws,  compromises the public’s proven commitment to protecting roadless areas, and  ignores  the  body  of  peer-reviewed  science on the harmful impacts of salvage logging.  H.R. 4200 represents yet another attempt by the majority in this Congress  to dismantle our Nation’s most paramount conservation laws. As its core,  H.R. 4200 allows for environmental exemptions to expedite the removal of  timber after a catastrophic event on  Federal lands. These unnecessary environmental exemptions, however, come  at the expense of critical laws such as  the National Environmental Policy  Act, the Endangered Species Act, the  Clean Water Act, the National Historic  Preservation Act. Should Congress approve H.R. 4200, the result would be  weakening of existing laws meant to  protect public participation and provide for environmental protections.  Proponents of H.R. 4200 argue this  legislation complies with conservation  laws. This is simply not true. To be  clear, H.R.  4200 waives  the  requirements of four very critical conservation laws.  Mr. Chairman, in our discussion of  H.R. 4200 on the Forests and Forest  Health Subcommittee, it has become  apparent to me that the authorities  granted under H.R. 4200 for timber salvage are unnecessary. The argument  that there is an abundance of timber  salvage going to waste on our public  lands because of  the  length of  the  NEPA process is false. In reality, the  Forest Service and Bureau of Land  Management have an abundance of existing authorities that allow for timber  salvage to be completed on our public  lands with the appropriate checks and  balances.  Salvage logging already accounts for  35 percent of timber harvested on our  national forests. Also, one of the largest salvage logging projects in the history of the U.S. Forest Service, on the  Forest Service lands impacted by Hurricane Katrina,  is  being  completed  quickly under the authorities from the  Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003.  Furthermore, H.R. 4200  is not scientifically  sound.  The  underlying  premise of H.R. 4200 that post-disturbance  salvage  logging must be completed to recover a forest and improve  forest health is not supported by the  abundance of peer-reviewed science on  this issue to date. A study published by  Donato and others in a January 2006  edition of the well-respected  journal  Science, found that post-fire logging in  the wake of the 2002 Biscuit fire, reduced forest regeneration by 71 percent  and increased short-term fire risk. This  study adds to a substantial list of peer-  reviewed science that concludes that  salvage logging is contrary to the goal  of  improving  forest health.  169  scientists from around the country submitted a letter to Congress opposing  H.R. 4200 as salvage logging has been  found to  impede  forest regeneration,  damage riparian corridors, introduce or  spread invasive species, cause erosion  and degrade water quality.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 4200 is unnecessary legislation with significant negative  consequences.  I  urge my  colleagues to join me in voting ‘‘no’’ on  H.R. 4200.  I reserve the balance of my time.

214,House,109,0.559,18,2006-05-17,Mr. HAYWORTH.," Madam Chairman,  I thank my colleague from Oregon for  this time.  I rise in strong support of the Forest  Emergency Recovery and Research Act  and would like to highlight a few of the  more than 100 diverse groups that share  in my support of this legislation. While  these groups range in background and  represent  interests  from  across  the  country, they all strongly support the  timely restoration of our precious public lands.  A number of professional firefighting  groups support this act, including the  International  Association  of  Fire  Chiefs.

215,House,109,0.6,25,2006-05-17,Mr. DUNCAN.," Madam Chairman, I  am pleased that the gentleman from  Washington, who is a really good Member and a good friend of mine, that he  mentioned the small  logging companies. I remember in 1978, we had 157  small  coal  companies  in  east Tennessee, and then they opened up a Federal mining office and now there are  none of those small companies left.  When you overregulate anything, it  helps the big giants, but it first runs  the small companies out and then even  the medium-sized companies. And I am  told that is what is happening all over  the country to our small logging companies. And I remember, I was told  years ago that in the mid-eighties that  Congress passed a bill that the environmentalists wanted  that would  not  allow cutting of more than 80 percent  of the new growth in our national forests. Today, we are cutting less than  one-seventh of the new growth in our  national forests, and we have two or  three or four times as much dead and  dying  trees, and under  the present  rules we can’t even go in there and get  some of these dead and dying trees out.  Like he said earlier, I said this bill is  just another of many things that we  are trying to not only help the environment but to help the poor and the  lower income and the working people  by not driving up prices and not destroying jobs in the way that we have  been doing. But also this is a bill that  would help some of the small businesses, some of the small logging companies maybe to survive instead of all  having to go out.  H.R. 4200, this Forest Emergency Research and Recovery Act, would allow  land managers to move swiftly after a  disaster  to  stabilize  soils,  protect  streams and riparian areas and reforest  the land. The bill allows for the establishment of preapproved management  practices  and  emergency  procedures  that  could be  implemented quickly  after a fire or other catastrophic event.  This bill, H.R. 4200, allows for compliance with the Clean Water Act requirements to occur simultaneously with  the  implementation  of  these  preapproved management practices or  emergency procedures.  H.R. 4200 is essential, I think, to ensuring our national forests are forested  for future generations. This is a good  bill. It is good for the environment, it  is good for business, and it is good for  the  average  ordinary  citizen  who  doesn’t need for wood product prices to  just go out of sight. And so I urge passage.  ",2006
216,House,109,-0.349,25,2006-05-17,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous  consent to revise and extend my remarks.  Mr. Chairman, I want to voice my support  for H.R. 4200.  The catastrophic wildfires  that devastated  southern California in late 2003 are proof that  forest health and recovery are essential. We  must expand these tools however possible to  protect the lives and property of our constituents.  I only wish  the agency and administration  would have heeded our demands  from  then  Governor Davis, Senators BOXER and FEINSTEIN, and many others  including myself  for  emergency fuels reduction funding.  The  fact  is  that many  forests  in southern  California continue to be matches waiting to  set ablaze. Bark Beetle infestations have ravaged the San Bernardino National Forest and  many populated rural areas.  Either we learn the lessons of the past or  we are condemned to repeat those mistakes  in the future.  By the time the 14 major wildfires in southern California were extinguished in November  2003, 24 lives were lost, 3,710 homes were  destroyed, and 750,043 acres were blackened—70,000  of  those  acres  in  San  Bernardino County.  We must also remember the post-fire flooding in the erosion-prone mountain watersheds,  and how 17 lives were lost in San Bernardino  County alone. Sixteen of these lives were lost  on Christmas Day, including those of two constituents.  Mr. Chairman,  I completely agree  that recovery is essential, but I am also very interested  in ensuring  that  the contractors doing  this recovery are not engaging in criminal violations of health, safety and labor law.  At the December hearing on this bill in the  Agriculture Committee,  I  introduced  into  the  record an expose´by the Sacramento Bee on  the deplorable, and often criminal, conditions  to which  these H2B and other contract employees are subjected.  Some are not paid their full wage, denied  safety equipment, or made  to  live  in subhuman  conditions  because  of  their H2B  guestworker status.  Mr. Chairman, that is why I will be holding  a briefing tomorrow at 2 p.m. in the Science  Committee room on these forest workers and  how agencies can improve their oversight of  wage and workplace safety violations.  Mr. Chairman, I agree that we need to protect the lives and property of our constituents  by maintaining healthy forests and recovering  after disasters and pest  infestations. That  is  why I am voting in favor of this legislation. I  urge my colleagues to do the same.  ",2006
217,House,109,-0.515,25,2006-05-17,Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in favor of H.R. 4200, the Forest  Emergency  Recovery  and  Research  Act  (FERRA).  Many of you are supporting this bill because  of wild fires. My state and I have a different,  but just as important need. Hurricane Katrina  caused  the  largest single  forest and wildlife  habitat devastation in our Nation’s history—5  million acres—and it did not discriminate between public or private land or the rich, poor  or the middle class. She was an equal opportunity destroyer. By the way, this represents  19 billion board feet of timber with a value of  $5 billion. This  is enough  timber  to build  800,000 homes and make 25 million tons of  paper and paperboard.)  National Wildlife Refuges, National Parks  and National Forests were all severely damaged. The DeSoto National Forest was hit the  hardest. But besides trees, we had a diversity  of plants and animals  that  lost  their homes  too. In fact, the damage left by Katrina is the  largest single devastation of fish and wildlife  habitat since the Exxon Valdez.  I have witnessed the devastated, high quality forests of the DeSoto degrade to a point  that we must appropriate many millions  to  clean up  the debris and recover  this  forest.  That was not necessary.  By acting in a timely manner as FERRA will  allow, we can salvage valuable wood products  before  they deteriorate. This will generate  much needed dollars for rural schools and return more dollars to federal and state treasuries. It will also generate funds to restore the  homes of wildlife and  the citizens of places  like the Gulf Coast and New Orleans.  We don’t need to cut down live trees that  are valuable at producing oxygen, sequestering carbon dioxide and providing fish and  wildlife habitat when we can use ones that are  already damaged. It’s just common sense.  As the first member of my party to co-sponsor the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, I ask  you to vote in favor of H.R. 4200.  ",2006
218,House,109,-0.553,32,2006-05-17,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding, especially under these time constraints.  On July 4, 1999, a powerful storm, 100-  mile-an-hour winds, blew through the  boundary waters canoe area of the Superior National Forest in my district,  blew down 26 million trees over a huge  area. The  loss was estimated somewhere between $12 million and $18 million in timber value, but the problem  was cleanup.  The State, the county all were able  to get in and clean up their lands within weeks, but I had to take the supervisor of the Superior National Forest  out here to Washington, meet with the  Council  on  Environmental  Quality,  with the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, gentleman  from  Ohio, and work things out laboriously;  took us months to get that salvage operation by  the Federal Government  under way to protect the homes and  residences and resorts outside the wilderness area along the Gunflint Trail  to be protected against fire. This legislation will help us move that along.  Mr. Chairman, on July 4, 1999, a widespread convective windstorm called a ‘‘derecho’’ swept across  the arrowhead region of  northeastern Minnesota.  The  straight  line  winds reached 90 to 100 miles an hour, causing serious damage  to nearly 600 square  miles of  forest  in and around Minnesota’s  Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness  (BWCAW). The aftermath left 30 million toppled trees on the forest floor; in some areas  the downed trees were stacked 10 and 12 feet  high. This area approximately 30 miles  long  and 12 miles wide, or about a quarter million  acres, was leveled. The timber loss was estimated at 500,000  to 750,000 million cords,  valued between $12 and $18 million. The  State of Minnesota estimated the cost of other  damage and debris clearance  for Lake and  Cook counties at nearly $5 million.  This powerful storm created near perfect  conditions  for a major  forest  fire. Only  two  questions remain: When will the major forest  fire happen, and how destructive will  it be?  The blowdown quadrupled the amount of fuel  per acre that can readily burn and the fire risk  is expected  to  increase  in  the next several  years as the timber continues to dry out.  Under H.R. 4200,  the Forest Emergency  Recovery and Research Act, an expedited review process will be established to provide our  Federal  land managers  the  resources  they  need to complete a quick, thorough evaluation  of forest conditions after catastrophic events.

It applies the waiver  to any resolution reported on the legislative day of May 17, 2006, providing for  consideration of the concurrent resolution, H. Con.

Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we  pass this same-day rule. This resolution will prepare the ground so that  the House may complete its business  and pass a budget resolution. We are  working to moving this process along  toward the goal of setting the spending  priorities for the next fiscal year.  The House is prepared to begin consideration  of  several  appropriations  measures to fund our government’s activities, but we must pass this budget  first. We must set the priorities  in  funding levels before we proceed with  the appropriations process. The budget  is  our  congressional  spending  blueprint. We must complete its consideration to move on with the business of  the House.  The Committee on Rules will meet  later today to provide a rule for the  consideration of H. Con.

220,House,109,-0.499,53,2006-05-17,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, we are here today to observe  a surrender. Once again, our moderate  Republican colleagues will hand over  their  tin  swords  to  the Republican  leadership. They are very predictable,  and they are my friends, and it is nice  to have predictable friends. On every  important issue, the moderate Republicans have an unfailing three-step approach to the  issue:  ineffectual protests, abject surrender, and denial.  Now, they told us for a long time  that this budget did not have enough  funding  for  important domestic programs. Indeed, as part of this rule, we  have what  is called a self-executing  rule, which adopts a resolution to mollify the consciences of the Republican  moderates. Those are easily mollified.  My  colleague  from Massachusetts  said the gentleman from Florida said  facts are stubborn things. Facts are  very different from the moderate Republicans. They are the very opposite  of stubborn things. They are among the  most pliable thing known to man or  woman.  So they have a resolution which says,  in the summary, it recognizes the need  to increase the President’s Labor-HHS  appropriation by not less than $7 billion. It recognizes it. It does not do it.  It just recognizes it, and on the basis of  being  able  to  recognize what  they  claim is a defect, they are going to  vote for this, and that is the deal that  is made. Now, I would have liked to  have debated their resolution, but it is  self-executing.  People watching, I know we are not  supposed to refer to them, but we do  not address them directly, but we can  explain things to them. It gets a little  complicated.  People might  wonder  what do we mean by a self-executing  resolution. In this case, it allows the  moderate Republicans to execute their  own moral principles. That is what is  self-executing. It allows them to come  forward and say, we wish we had more  money for poor people, and we have a  resolution  that  says  there  is  not  enough money for poor people, and we  will vote for that budget that does not  have enough money for poor people because we said it does not have enough  money. On that, some people consider  themselves to have shown  independence.  If that was the spirit of independence  that motivated this country 250 years  ago, that would be the British flag up  there and  the  representative of  the  Crown. So I hope we defeat this sham,  and maybe the moderate Republicans  will grow some spines.  ",2006

224,Senate,109,0.496,67,2006-05-17,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, it looks  like we are beginning to make some  progress. About  4 weeks  ago,  this  amendment was introduced in its original form, and unfortunately debate was  derailed. We were unsuccessful in moving on for further amendments and debate. Fortunately, it looks as if things  have gotten back on track. We are  starting to see votes and debate on  amendments. I don’t necessarily like  the way all of the votes are turning  out, but this is the Senate and majority rules and I accept that.  All of us who are interested in comprehensive immigration reform want to  see this bill continue to move, to have  amendments laid down, debated, and  have them voted on. I am very pleased  that it appears that we are very close  to having, if not unanimous agreement,  at least majority support on a bipartisan basis  for the amendment that  Senator KYLand I laid down about a  month ago and which has now been  modified slightly to bring more people  on board.  This amendment, quite simply, is designed to make sure that convicted felons and people who have committed at  least three misdemeanors do not get  the benefit of the  legalization track  contained in the underlying bill, whatever it may be. There will be other  amendments  later  on  that  perhaps  won’t share the same sort of bipartisan  and majority support. But this one at  least seems to have gathered a solid  group of Senators to support it.  In addition to convicted felons, those  who have committed at  least  three  misdemeanors would not be given the  benefit of earned legalization under the  bill. It would also exclude absconders.  By that, I mean people who have actually had their day in court and have  been ordered deported from the country but have simply gone underground,  hunkered down in the hope they might  be able to stay.  There have been some motions made  regarding this amendment for waiver  by the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security  for extraordinary  circumstances. For example, if someone is able to establish that they didn’t  actually get notified, then as a matter  of fundamental due process considerations they ought to be able to revisit  that and to show that they did not get  notice of the removal proceedings. We  agreed that would be a fair basis to  waive this provision.  Finally,  it also appears  that  the  other basis for waiver would be if the  alien’s failure to appear was due to exceptional  circumstances  beyond  the  control of the alien—a very narrow exception; and, finally, if the alien’s departure from the United States would  result  in  extreme  hardship  to  the  alien’s spouse, parent, or child who is a  citizen of the United States or an alien  lawfully permitted to have permanent  status.  We move it in the right direction. It  is a fundamentally fair and commonsense amendment. I am pleased to support it and announce what appears to  be a growing consensus that it should  be accepted.  I reserve the remainder of our time.  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who  yields time?  ",2006

226,Senate,109,0.439,109,2006-05-17,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, I  rise today because, as you may know,  for several years now there have been  ongoing  negotiations  between  the  State of Israel and the Office of the  United States Trade Representative,  USTR, regarding Israel’s protections of  U.S.  intellectual  property  rights.  I  commend the USTR for so vigorously  protecting these very valuable assets  to the U.S. economy. However, what  has caused my colleagues and I concern  has been the treatment of Israel in this  process; a process that we hope will become more transparent. This year, I  was joined by Senators SCHUMER and  WYDEN on a letter to the U.S. Trade  Representative  expressing  our  hope  that  the  positive  steps  Israel  has  taken, particularly in the context of  how many of our other trading partners have acted, would be granted the  recognition it deserves. Unfortunately,  when this year’s Special 301 report was  released, Israel was put on par with  countries such as China and Russia  while other countries, which have little  or no intellectual property protections,  were given a much less egregious designation.  Ron Dermer, the  Israel Embassy’s  Minister for Economic Affairs, recently  stated that ‘‘countries with a record of  much more severe breaches of intellectual property than those attributed to  Israel, are not included in these lists.’’  I do look forward to continuing our  work with the Office of the USTR on  this issue and to make sure that those  countries that are working towards our  mutual goals are met with the recognition and support from our government  they deserve.  f  AMERICAN UNIVERSITY  ",2006

Over  the  last 65 years, American Ballet  Theatre has elevated the artistry and talent of  classical dance in the United States, and has  brought a greater appreciation and understanding of the arts to countless people in all  50 States and around the world.  American Ballet Theatre has developed a  special relationship with Connecticut  through  the award-winning Make a Ballet Program.  Since 2002, ABT has been offering this program at The Waterside School, an  independent,  private  day  school  in Stamford,  which introduces low-income children to ballet.  ABT Teaching Artists come to the school twice  a week and provide a thorough introduction to  the arts and high-quality dance  instruction.  This long-term, in-depth exposure to the arts  leaves indelible impacts on the students, instilling a sense of confidence and accomplishment, and planting seeds that will reap appreciation for the arts for years to come.  American Ballet Theatre also holds a Ballet  for the Young Dancer program at the YWCA  in Greenwich each year, providing children between the ages of 5 and 12 with weekly ballet  classes with some of the finest dancers in the  world.

228,,109,0.414,158,2006-05-17,Mr. EVERETT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of  the nomination of Gen. Michael  Hayden as the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I have known Gen. Hayden  for years and believe he is the most qualified  candidate in the country for this critical position.  To further illustrate this point, I would like to  call your attention to a recent editorial by retired Gen. Charles Boyd that appeared in the  Wall Street Journal on May 11 which makes a  convincing case for the Hayden nomination.  Mr. Speaker, Gen. Boyd served 35 years in  the Air Force. As a combat pilot in Vietnam,  he was shot down on his 105th mission and  survived 2,488 days as a prisoner of war. The  only POW from that war to achieve the four-  star rank, General Boyd’s final military assignment was as deputy commander  in chief of  U.S.  forces  in Europe. Prior  to  this assignment, Gen. Boyd was the commander of Air  University at Maxwell Air Force Base, in my  congressional district.  With  that, Mr. Speaker,  I ask unanimous  consent  to place  in  the RECORD a copy of  Gen. Boyd’s editorial.  [From the Wall Street Journal, May 11, 2006]  A HAYDENSYMPHONYATTHECIA  (By Charles G. Boyd)  Our political disagreements are often obtuse for the simple reason that it is difficult  to discern motives. Do disputants put the interests of the country ahead of partisan and  personal concerns? Moreover, disagreements  about intelligence issues are doubly hard to  parse, since—despite leaks and rampant gossip—most of what goes on inside the Central  Intelligence Agency remains opaque even to  high-paid journalists and other Washington  sophisticates. And so, amid partisan positioning and an imposing ignorance, is the  scene set for the already dismaying dispute  over the president’s nomination of Michael  Hayden to be CIA director.  The arguments (to use a generous term)  being made against Gen. Hayden are so without merit or even serious content that one  cannot help but suspect partisan stratagems  at work. Of these, three are most common.

229,House,109,-0.161,2,2006-05-23,Mr. COOPER.," Mr. Speaker, my colleague from New Jersey who just spoke  is exactly right. This Congress, this  year,  this House of Representatives  will probably meet fewer days, fewer  hours than any Congress since 1948.  President Harry Truman called that  Congress the Do-Nothing Congress because it did almost nothing, and it only  tried to work for about 110 days out of  the whole year of 365 days. We will  meet for substantially fewer days than  the Do-Nothing Congress. So how do  you do less than nothing? Sadly, the  American public is about to find out.  Now, how does the schedule happen?  Well, in the House of Representatives,  it is set by the majority party. They  can choose. They can make us work a  long year or a short year, or a very  short year as they have decided to do  this year.  Now, why are we meeting for so few  days? Well, it is not because taxpayers  back home aren’t paying us a full-time,  full-year salary. We are making the  same pay. But yet we are able to spend  9 or 10 months of the year back home  in our districts. And I love that.

Now, Arizona is one of the most irrigated States in the country. You are  draining water that is never going to  come back. And yet I look at our part  of the country that has to fight for  such a small part of the market right  now. I would just ask the gentleman, I  would love to look at the type of subsidies that attend to your agriculture  in Arizona  from major  government  agencies that do not come to Ohio  farmers.  b1945  We are trying to maintain a very  small market share. Hydroponic production is one of the ways in which we  are successfully doing it, but I would  just beg for the gentleman to take a  look at what has really happened to  the movement  of  agriculture. One  State in the Union now produces over  half the fruits and vegetables in the  country, most of it irrigated. Ohioans  have a right to compete in this market.  ",2006

247,,109,-0.306,247,2006-05-23,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, for decades this  Nation has been researching, debating, drafting, and redrafting national energy policy. Unfortunately,  the  long gas  lines of  the 1970’s  that motivated  the kind of original  thought  needed to end our dependency on foreign oil  slipped  from our memories as supplies  increased and prices dropped. Today, we are  punished with oil prices floating in the range of  $75 a barrel, record prices at the pump, and  an unstable world market for the foreseeable  future.  At the same time, according to the Department of Energy, $35–$45 a barrel oil is attainable from a source within our borders. It is our  most abundant domestic energy  resource—  coal. With  technology  that has been around  for decades, coal can be liquefied and turned  into a liquid fuel, and eventually sold for approximately half of what we are paying now  per barrel.  The true value of coal is misunderstood and  many ignore its potential to free us from foreign oil at our own peril. We risk stepping into  the same trap that has caught so many promising energy policy advances by the ankle for  decades.  Research has brought us a long, long way  from the days of smokestacks and gray skies.  True, there remain many less efficient, older  generation power plants  in  this Nation, but  largely because, while the Government draped  oil companies  in rich  tax advantages,  it devoted mere dribbles of money to providing incentives for clean burning coal plants.  Thirty years of government and private-sector research and development has created a  product, according to the Department of Energy, that is cleaner than required under EPA  Tier II fuel standards. And with this Nation’s  refinery capacity operating on all cylinders,  these fuels would fit right into our energy mix  as  they would  require very  little additional  processing. Coal-to-liquids can curb our appetite for foreign fuel.  Dtsturbingly, however, for all of our Nation’s  pride  in our competitiveness and  innovation,  we stand behind a number of other countries  in  liquefying coal  to end our  foreign oil dependence.  For  instance,  these  fuels  represent about  one-third of the consumption in South Africa,  which began  its production and use  in  the  1950’s using the Fischer-Tropsch process developed during the 1920’s by two German researchers. China, India, and Indonesia, recognizing  the problems of  relying on  foreign  sources of oil, are all aggressively pursuing  coal liquefaction as key components of their  energy production. For the U.S., our continued  myopia about coal  liquefaction  is particularly  numb-headed, since coal  is our most abundant natural energy resource.  In order to catch up to the rest of the world,  a position to which the U.S. is unaccustomed,  we must  invest  in our  future and Congress  began to travel down this road with the reauthorization of  the Nation’s surface  transportation laws last year by including two new excise tax credits aimed at promoting the use of  alternative transportation fuels, including liquid  fuel derived from coal.  While a helpful first step, due to the restrictive nature of  the existing  tax credit,  I am  pleased  to  join my colleague JOHNSHIMKUS  and others in introducing legislation aimed at  helping  far-sighted  firms better afford  their  foray into coal liquefaction. Our bill would reduce some of  the risk  that  these  firms and  their investors take as they try to lead our Nation into a new energy frontier.  Simply put, our legislation would extend until  2020 the 50 cents per gallon tax credit for liquid fuel derived from coal that is set to expire  in 2009. The  legislation does not address  other alternative transportation fuels, just coal-  to-liquids.  The aim is to provide a level of predictability  for a number of years to those willing to put  money into coal-to-liquids production. It would  help  to smooth out some of  the ups and  downs associated with  fluctuating oil prices  and the gamble investors make in the financing of these high-tech energy ventures.  Unfortunately,  while  other  governments  have been footing the bill for this kind of research and development  for decades, our  Government has been  ‘‘playing  footsie’’ with  Big Oil.  In comparison  to  the big  tax giveaways enjoyed by  the oil  industry, precious  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:29 May 24, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A23MY8.015 E23MYPT1 S K R A M E R M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

This  is one of  the most extensive  educational programs  in  the country developed specifically to educate young men and  women about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of  Rights. The program  is administered by  the  Center for Civic Education and funded by the  U.S. Department of Education. It is my distinct  pleasure to announce the competition’s Unit 5  Award winner: Grace King High School from  Metairie, LA.  The national  finals are an arduous 3-day  academic competition  that simulates a congressional hearing in which the students testify  before a panel of judges on constitutional topics. Students from many schools demonstrate  their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as  they evaluate,  take, and  defend positions on  relevant historical and  contemporary  issues.  This  year’s  winner,  Grace King High School, is an educational institution known for high standards of academic  achievement that has produced many talented  students. The winners of this competition have  proven through their hard work and meticulous  study of our Constitution that they are no exception.  Mr. Speaker,  the  names  of  these  outstanding  students  from Grace King High  School are as follows:  Aaron Baer-Harsha, Patrick Berrigan, Jaime  Bruno,  Lily Chen, Caitlyn Clarke, Paulius  Donauskas, Janice Fan, Rebecca Felix, Jeremy Finnegan, Alice Ho, Tony Huang, Thomas Lambert, Krysten Le, Donald Leverson, Ali  Mahbod, Elise Murphy-Mejia, Jacob O’Neil,  Sean Olsen, Veronica Oro, Anna Plaksiy,  Rachelle Ross, Olivia Saito, Sara Sands, and  Murielle Telio.  I also wish to commend Jamie Staub, the  teacher who was responsible for preparing the  student class for the national finals competition. Also worthy of special recognition is John  Alexander,  the State  coordinator, who  is  among those responsible for implementing the  program in my district.

Let me talk a little bit about the history of how we got to this situation.  Mr. LATOURETTEhas also spoken to the  increases that the air traffic controllers have received  from 1998 to  last  year. They did receive some 75 percent,  and maybe there was need to adjust the  salaries. That translates into about 10  percent per year. But that contract did  expire last year, and the air traffic controllers were required and FAA also  began negotiations for a new contract.  Unfortunately,  that  drug  out  for  some time, and by the terms of the existing contracts and agreement, as long  as no contract was in place, the terms  of  the old  contract prevailed, with  some pretty hefty increases in place.  What has taken place in fact is an  impasse occurred. Under existing law,  when that  impasse was declared by  FAA, the matter was sent to Congress.  That has all taken place. That is all  history. For some 60 days, Congress  had an opportunity to overturn that.  And it is true that there was legislation with many Republican cosponsors  sympathetic with changing some of the  procedures. However, that bill was not  retroactive, like the LaTourette proposal. This is a reach-back provision,  and it also takes Congress completely  out of the process, as opposed to the  bill that others had cosponsored.  So, this is a bill, again, H.R. 5449,  that, if enacted, will change the rules  of the game at the bottom of the ninth  inning just because one of the teams  does not like the outcome of fair negotiations, a legislative process that has  already been completed, and, again, we  take Congress out of the process.  The Constitution provides in Article  I that all bills relating to funding and  appropriations come out of the House  of Representatives,  emanate  in  the  House of Representatives. This legislation, again, reaches back and changes  the rules of the game. It allows a panel  that is not confirmed by Congress, by  the Senate, again, a panel of seven, to  make appropriations and also authorization decisions that are left to the  Congress.  So, I have great concern about this  procedure. I think it sets a horrible  precedent.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
255,House,109,-0.317,31,2006-06-06,Mr. COSTELLO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 5449, legislation that will send  the FAA and the air traffic controllers  back to the bargaining table. H.R. 5449  seeks to ensure a fair process to resolve  impasses that arise during collective  bargaining negotiations with the FAA  instead of the current one-sided process.  The FAA and NATCA started contract negotiations in July of 2005. The  FAA declared an impasse on April 5  and promptly sent the contract to Congress just days before we went out on  our April district work period. The 60-  day clock expired yesterday, June 5,  with the FAA imposing its last offer  immediately.  I believe the best way to get a fair  contract between the two sides is for  Members to sign Discharge Petition  No. 13 to bring H.R. 4755, a bipartisan  bill with 265 cosponsors, including 75  Republicans, to the House floor for a  vote. Congresswoman SUEKELLYand I  introduced H.R. 4755 which would insist  on binding arbitration, ensuring an end  to the dispute, protecting collective  bargaining rights and to promote good  faith, fair negotiations. One hundred  ninety-five Members, all Democrats,  signed the Costello discharge petition  to bring H.R. 4755 to the floor.  Because I  filed the discharge petition, the Republican leadership has decided to bring up H.R. 5449, introduced  by my good friend, Mr. LATOURETTE, to  the House  floor  today  for consideration. While I would have preferred to  see H.R. 4755 on the floor today, I support H.R. 5449, the legislation before  us, as a means of reversing the current  one-sided process that does not promote good faith negotiations.  I want to remind my colleagues as we  hear a lot about salaries and working  conditions and other issues that this  bill is about process only, plain and  simple. There are no mandates concerning salaries, benefits or anything  concerning working  conditions with  the air traffic controllers. It simply  gets both sides back to the bargaining  table.  Today’s debate really comes down to  whether Members support the rights of  workers and the rights of collective  bargaining. Anytime one side comes to  the bargaining table knowing that they  will get what they want at the end of  the day, which is exactly what the current law does, it gives the FAA what  they want, their last proposal at the  end of the day, then there is no incentive to reach an agreement.  The current law is grossly unfair and  needs to be permanently changed. If  you  truly believe  in collective bargaining, you will send both sides back  to the bargaining table by supporting  H.R. 5449.  I urge all Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
256,House,109,0.366,38,2006-06-06,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in strong objection to H.R. 5449, a bill  to modify bargaining  requirements  for proposed changes to the personnel management  system of the Federal Aviation Administration.  I currently serve as the Chairman of the Appropriations Sub-Committee on Transportation,  Treasury, HUD and other agencies. This legislation today would put an enormous strain on  my committee’s resources and force all programs under my jurisdiction into greater budgetary peril.  Simply put, a ‘‘yes’’ vote on H.R. 5449 could  cost  the FAA $1.9 billion over  the next 5  years. The FAA would be  forced  to divert  funds from critical safety initiatives—such as  air traffic control modernization—to cover the  cost of sky-rocketing controller salaries.  I understand that air-traffic controllers provide a valuable service to the flying public and  that they work hard to ensure safety and security. I also understand that due to the unique  ability of  their union—an ability  that  is not  available  to every other  federal employee  union—they have negotiated  some of  the  highest wages in federal service.  The  average  air-traffic  controller  earns  $173,000 per year, and  their salaries have  gone up 75 percent in the past 8 years. The  top 100 NATCA union members earn an average salary of $197,000.  How does this compare with other federal  employees? Well, quite well  I would  say.  These controllers make more than Members  of Congress ($165,200), Cabinet Secretaries  ($180,100), and almost as much as Supreme  Court Justices ($199,200) and the Vice President of the United States ($208,700).  The comparison is even more striking when  we weigh their salary levels against other critical safety, security, and health professions.  In my home area of Detroit, an average  NATCA member makes $118,490. Compare  that to the average firefighter ($42,100), police  officer  ($48,770),  or  registered  nurse  ($59,380). And, this kind of pay disparity is not  unique  to my home area, but  is consistent  across the Nation.  At a  time when our  federal workforce  is  stretched at home and abroad to protect our  Nation,  there  is no  justification  for air  traffic  controllers to enjoy unparalleled salary hikes,  especially when our military personnel, homeland security officials,  first  responders, and  other government employees do not receive  the same treatment.  Some may try to indicate that a ‘‘yes’’ vote  on H.R. 5449 would be a ‘‘free’’ vote to give  to the unions. However, nothing could be further from the truth.  If H.R. 5449  is enacted,  it will effectively  render the new FAA/NATCA control null and  void, and cause FAA costs and salaries to spiral out of control. The new NATCA/FAA contract would be superseded by  the previous  contract, reached between the Clinton Administration and NATCA in 1998, and the continuation of the 1998 contract would cost tax-payers $1.9 billion in the short-term, and $3.8 billion in the long-term.  It should be obvious that a cost of $3.8 billion tax-payer dollars is far from ‘‘free.’’  A vote  for  this bill  is not about protecting  workers wages and stopping  the FAA  from  slashing controllers’ salaries. To be crystal  clear: the FAA has offered to protect the compensation of each and every current controller.  A new contract would only apply to new hires,  and not affect the salaries of existing controllers.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 5449—  a bill that would ban the FAA from reigning in  out-of-control controllers’ salaries and cost tax-  payers and my committee billions of dollars. I  strongly urge a  ‘‘no’’ vote on  this  financially  reckless legislation that will set a dangerous  precedent for years to come.  ",2006
257,House,109,0.202,38,2006-06-06,Mr. FITZPATRICK of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5449;  legislation that will strengthen the negotiation  process between unions and the federal governments. As many of my colleagues know,  the Federal Aviation Administration  recently  declared a deadlock in negotiations with the  National Air Traffic Controllers Association  (NATCA). The issue is simple; on one hand,  the air  traffic controllers unions want  to  increase the pay package for their employees  and on the other, the FAA wants to cut the  pay package. On June 5, 2006, the 60 day  period  for Congress  to  take action on  the  FAA’s contract offer  to  the NATCA officially  expired. Under current law the FAA would now  be able to unilaterally impose the contract because Congress has not acted.  The  legislation  being  considered  tonight  would provide air traffic controllers with a fair  negotiation process. H.R. 5449 would break  the current impasse by sending negotiators to  the Federal Service Impasse Panel (FSIP), a  neutral third party, for a final resolution instead  of keeping them bound to the FAA.  Mr. Speaker, American workers must be  provided with the opportunity to participate in  a fair bargaining process. Contracts should be  the result of a fair deliberate process that ensures that the rights of workers are protected  through a  full hearing of  their grievances  in  front of a neutral third party. Congressional inaction and the forced acceptance of one sided  contracts are not  the way  to settle employment disputes.  There has been a lot of talk about this bill  interfering with the FAA’s ability to budget its  compensation packages. Opponents say that  this  legislation will cost  the FAA $1.9 billion  over the next 5 years. This bill does none of  these things.  H.R. 5449 does nothing to modify or manipulate the compensation scheme of air traffic  controllers. It only deals directly with the bargaining process itself by reaffirming the meaning of good faith bargaining by requiring the  parties to submit their impasses to the Federal  Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) for final resolution—the natural course for employment disagreements and negotiations at  the  federal  level.  I call on my colleagues to cut through the  clutter that this issue has created. The ability  for American workers to fairly negotiate with  the federal government is at stake here and  Congress has a chance to stand up for our Air  Traffic Controllers. I call on my colleagues to  support and pass H.R. 5449.  ",2006
258,House,109,0.311,45,2006-06-06,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  offer my support for House Resolution 729, a  bill that I and Mr. FARR introduced recognizing  the 23rd Annual National Tourism Week.  First established by Congress in 1983, this  annual event gives us an opportunity to recognize the significant importance the Travel and  Tourism Industry has on our economy.  The travel and tourism industry is the lifeblood of many states around the country—including Florida, California, New York and Nevada,  to name a  few. Every Congressional  District is impacted—that is every district with  a  restaurant, hotel, museum, national park,  stadium, theater, campgrounds and beaches.  Domestic travel and tourism-related spending has reached $1 trillion a year. There are  over 8 million people in the food service, hospitality and travel-related industries that rely on  America’s vibrant and thriving travel industry.  As America’s third-largest retail sales industry, nearly $100 billion dollars was generated  in tax revenue for our local, state and federal  governments in 2004.  In addition, international travel to the United  States is now the largest service export with a  generated  trade surplus  for 16 consecutive  years.  For example, in my district there are visitors  from all over the world who are drawn to our  beautiful beaches, recreational  lakes, habitat  wildlife preserves and golf courses. In 2005,  Florida collected over $3 billion in tourism and  recreational sales, a reflection of $62 billion  that went into the state’s economy during the  year.  So as some of us begin our summer travel,  let us remember the tremendous impact the  travel and tourism industry makes on all of our  lives.  ",2006

As a member of the Government Reform Committee, I am pleased to join  my colleague in consideration of H.R.  5245, legislation naming the postal facility at 1 Marble Street in Fair Haven,  Vermont, after Matthew Lyon. This  bill, which was  sponsored  by Representative  of  Vermont, was unanimously reported by  our committee on May 4, 2006.  Matthew Lyon was born in County  Wicklow, Ireland, and in 1764, at the  age of  14, emigrated  to  the United  States as an indentured servant. It was  not long before he was a free man and  fighting  alongside Ethan Allen  and  others in the famous battle of Ticonderoga. Lyon went on  to  settle  in  Vermont, founding the village of Fair  Haven and later representing Vermont  in Congress for two terms.  Lyon was a fierce Jeffersonian Republican and a staunch opponent of the  Sedition Act. Lyon’s public opposition  to the Sedition Act led him to be the  first person arrested under the guise of  the act. A dubious honor to some, perhaps, was a badge of honor to this protector of free speech and liberty. Lyon  would serve a 4-month prison sentence  and become a champion of the movement opposed to the Sedition Act.

Tobias and her colleagues designed a sustainable  facility  for  research, housing, and  community  space. The building  forges  together practical functionality while eliminating  carbon emissions, closing the water cycle, and  optimizing material resources.  This  national  competition,  sponsored  by  EPA’s Office of Research and Development,  enables college students to research, develop  and design scientific, technical, and policy solutions  to sustainability challenges. Sustainable solutions are environmentally friendly, efficiently use natural resources and are economically competitive. The P3 award includes  funding up to $75,000 that gives the students  an opportunity to further develop their designs  and move them to the marketplace.  I commend Jennifer and her colleagues for  their  innovative project design, and  I hope  they continue their important research and development on sustainable solutions to human  endeavors. Jennifer and her colleagues are  role-models who demonstrate  that environmental  and  economical  interests  can  be  brought together in tomorrow’s designs.  f  CELEBRATING  THE  140TH  ANNIVERSARY OF THE SANTA BARBARA SCHOOL DISTRICTS  HON. LOIS CAPPS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 6, 2006  ",2006
262,,109,-0.389,143,2006-06-06,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  honor the Santa Barbara School Districts as  we celebrate  the 140th anniversary of  their  founding on June 6, 1866.  Santa Barbara’s educational tradition is one  of the oldest in the state. This tradition is rooted in the 18th century Spanish era where historical records indicate that in 1795 Santa Barbara had the second school in Alta, California  (San Jose had  the  first, which was opened  one year earlier). Santa Barbara’s first school  was located at the Presidio where the teacher  was paid $125 per year, with each soldier of  the Presidio paying a tribute of one dollar toward the teacher’s salary.  When  the Santa Barbara School District  was  formed  in 1866, County Superintendent  Alpheus B. Thompson  reported  that  there  were three school districts in Santa Barbara  County: San Buenaventura, Montecito and  Santa Barbara. By 1866,  the schools had  moved from county control to control by the  electorate of the city.  The three school districts had two schools  each and  together  there were a  total of six  teachers. By 1867, the three districts served  340 students, with 243 of them in the Santa  Barbara district. The average salary  in  the  county was $70 per month for male teachers  and $62 per month for female teachers and  the length of the school year varied from 3 to  5 months.  In 1870 a new school house was built on  Cota Street and the first playground was established  in  the city. The playground was  turned over to the school by the city council  after  the school  trustees agreed  to plant at  least 20 shade trees and care for their growth.  Voters decided, in April of 1870, to impose a  tax to construct Lincoln School. In 1884, Eugene Fawcett sold a tract of land to the school  district for the construction of Franklin School.  The school district paid $1,000 for the property  where Parma School is located.  As a former school nurse in the Santa Barbara school district, I am absolutely delighted  to celebrate  the 140 years of strong public  education that the district has provided. I am  proud of the district for its vision and dedication to quality over the years and I look forward to the continued success of the district  and  its many programs. Congratulations on  140 years well done!  f  TALL AFAR MAYOR AND TROOP  BRAVERY  HON.

Mr.  Speaker, I rise this evening to commend one  of the bravest acts of personal courage that I  have seen in many years.  In the face of deadly car bombings, suicide  attacks and assassination attempts, there are  some Iraqi leaders who are willing to tell the  truth about  the successes of our American  troops in Iraq and to share the stories of their  generosity and courage.  Earlier this month, one of my constituents  named Roger Hattersley sent me a letter written by the mayor of Tall Afar, Iraq. Roger’s  son is an enlisted soldier serving in Iraq as  part of  the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment,  and had sent his father a copy of this letter.  Having personally visited Tall Afar just this  winter on a CODEL with the Government Reform Committee, I was very interested to read  what the mayor had to say.  Mr. Speaker, I am going to read the letter  here on the House floor so that all Americans  can hear the bravery and courage of Mayor  Najim Abdullah Abid Al-Jibouri and also  the  good works of our young men and women in  uniform.

I would also  like  to  take  this  time  to  congratulate Christine Jaszlics of Lakewood  High School and Jeffrey Hathcote of Grandview High School on their appointment to the  United States Merchant Marine Academy, as  well  as  Madison  Stumpp  and  Richard  Shreffler, both of Eaglecrest High School, on  achieving appointments  to  the United States  Naval Academy.

These young men and women have exhibited tremendous commitment and dedication in  making  it  through  the  rigorous nomination  process and I wish them all the best in their  future endeavors as they embark on their careers with  the United States Military. They  have excelled both  in and out of  the classroom, and I have no doubt they will represent  Colorado with distinction at these prestigious  academies.  f  HONORING KEN HAAS OF HAYS,  KANSAS  HON.

264,,109,0.414,150,2006-06-06,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Ken Haas of Hays, Kansas for  his years of service to this community through  his diverse career in education.  Mr. Haas began teaching in 1964 at Kennedy Middle School as an industrial arts and  physical education  instructor. He also  influenced countless students by serving as  the  school’s guidance counselor. In 1999, after 35  years of work in the Hays school district, Ken  was approached by Father Mike Scully and  asked  to assume  the  role as principal of  Thomas More Prep-Marian High School, a private Christian high school in the Catholic tradition.  Ken was nearing the point of possible retirement in his current position and awaiting him  was  the well-deserved  free  time  that one  earns after working so long in a challenging  vocation. After a weekend of prayer and consideration, Ken decided that it was the Lord’s  desire for him to accept the position.  That was 7 years ago. After improving the  school’s  leadership structure, balancing  the  school’s budget, and sustaining enrollment,  Mr. Haas has chosen to retire from his current  position. Even in retirement Ken plans to be  involved where  he’s  needed  around  the  school.  Mr. Haas is a committed professional who is  well-regarded among his peers and students.  He  is known  for attending athletic events,  even the ones that don’t generate the largest  crowds. He still surprises many former pupils  with his unique ability to greet them by name  after not seeing them for many years. Just another sign of how much he cares.  Mr. Haas has served Hays students and  their parents well for over 40 years, and that  is why Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor him today.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  CITY  OF  LIGHTHOUSE POINT  HON.

265,,109,-0.658,157,2006-06-06,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the  Senate Republican leadership renewed debate  on whether  the Constitution of  the United  States should  limit marriage and any civil  union to one man and one woman.  It is distressing to me that we live in an age  in which we still must fight to protect our civil  rights as Americans,  in which a hate crime  perpetrated against someone based their sexual orientation can go unpunished, and  in  which discrimination is being written into our  laws.  If this amendment were to pass, we would  rewrite discrimination into the Constitution, a  practice I thought we had done away with in  1868,  when  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  erased  the Constitution’s  reference  to  ‘‘the  whole number of free persons.’’ It appears that  some would condemn us to repeating history.  The only saving grace for this measure is  that it is doomed to failure, and the President  knows that. This amendment is being considered merely to throw red meat at conservative  voters in an election year. Just over a month  before the 2004 election, when his poll numbers were slipping,  the President stated his  support  for  this discriminatory measure. He  knew the amendment could not pass in Congress and that there was minimal public support for it. Republicans moved this discriminatory bill for the sole purpose of dividing voters  and inciting anti-gay sentiment in a hotly-contested election year.  Two years later, the Republicans are drowning in corruption and losing public support on  a mass scale. The White House wants to drive  its conservative base  to  the polls and has  asked the Senate Majority Leader to bring this  issue before the full Senate. Make no mistake  about it, we will win this fight again.  Then, hopefully we can turn to the issues  that  the American people want  the government to address. We have yet to investigate  the Administration’s  failed policy  in  Iraq  that  has led to the deaths of over 2,000 American  soldiers. We need  to know why  there has  been a steep rise in gas prices during a time  of record oil industry profits. We need to craft  a prescription drug bill for seniors that works  instead of keeping one that confuses seniors  and rewards large pharmaceutical companies.  We need to stop borrowing money from foreign countries, cease deficit spending, and return our economy  to  the surpluses  it had  under President Clinton.  With so many critical issues that need the  immediate attention of the Congress, Republicans need to reevaluate their priorities. It is  my hope that in the coming months we can  focus our energies on  the many  important  issues facing our country rather than on divisive and unproductive distractions.  f  HONORING THE GREEN ALBANY  PROJECT  HON.

The Foundation was created in 1986 to provide a lasting  source of charitable funding by enabling donors and organizations  to effectively support  the causes that matter most to Delaware’s citizens.  In  the publication of  its  first newsletter  in  1990,  the Foundation noted  that  through  its  first grant making program it awarded roughly  $60,000 in grants to six agencies for use in  addressing homelessness. Other inaugural accomplishments included the creation of 8 new  charitable funds, and a total fund balance of  just over $6 million. Today,  the Foundation  manages nearly 600 charitable  funds, gives  from a total asset balance of more than $200  million, and has awarded more than $54 million in grants in its short 20-year history. This  exceptional growth stands as a testament to  the  important work done by  the Delaware  Community Foundation and how much  it  is  truly needed.  Through  its strong community  leadership,  and  both  competitive  and  non-competitive  grant programs, the Foundation is now able to  adapt to the needs of the community as they  emerge and evolve.

267,House,109,-0.508,3,2006-06-15,Ms. SOLIS.," Mr. Speaker, next week  the House will have its first vote to increase the minimum wage in over 10  years. This is good news for the more  than 7 million hardworking Americans  who today only make $5.15 an hour. It  could also be good news for millions of  middle class workers who could see  their hourly wage increase as a result  of the higher minimum wage.  Despite repeated efforts by the House  Democrats to expand economic opportunity for millions of Americans over  the last 9 years, the House Republican  leadership has  refused  to allow  the  floor vote on increasing the minimum  wage. Next week they have no choice,  however. Thanks  to  action  in  the  House Appropriations Committee on  Wednesday,  the committee voted  to  gradually increase the minimum wage  from $5.15 to $7.25.  The American people should not be  surprised that the out-of-touch House  Republican leadership is also voicing  strong opposition to the wage hike and  vows to kill it next week.

268,House,109,-0.491,3,2006-06-15,Ms. KILPATRICK of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, today is an important day in  the United States Congress. Beginning  around noon this afternoon, the House  will debate for 10 hours the Iraq war.  The question will be should we continue on  the course  that President  Bush and the administration has set or  should we have a new plan? We will  have 10 hours of debate.  Consider, over 2,500 young men and  women killed, over  30,000 amputees,  blinded and the like, hundreds of thousands who will have mental health deficiencies when they return. Retired generals have spoken. We need a new direction. The  troops  should be  redeployed. They should be brought home  at the most practical time with a plan  that we don’t now have under this administration.  So, America, listen and look. Should  we stay the course, or should we have  a plan of redeployment to protect our  troops and to protect America?  f  DEBATING THE GLOBAL WAR ON  TERRORISM  IN THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)

269,House,109,-0.402,10,2006-06-15,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, this war  was  launched without an  imminent  threat to our  families. It endangers  them more every day, creating new  generations  of  terrorists.  Radical  ‘‘know it all’’ ideologues here in Washington  bent  facts,  distorted  intelligence, and perpetrated lies designed  to mislead the American people into  believing that a third rate thug had a  hand in the 9/11 tragedy and was soon  to unleash a mushroom cloud.  From  the  start, House Democrats  overwhelmingly voted against this war.  But radical ideologues rushed headlong  anyway, ignoring professional military  advice about the number of troops and  equipment needed. One general after  another has indicted this Administration  for  its misjudgment  and mismanagement.  But now, almost 3,000 Americans lie  dead, with about another 20,000 seriously injured. Every day, every single  day, American taxpayers are forced to  spend $229 million in Iraq, and they pay  again every time they go to the gas  pump. All that is in sight is an endless,  civil war quagmire.  Today’s resolution pins these Administration failures on the coattails of  our courageous servicemen and women.  Administration ineptness is falsely attached to a resolution honoring our  troops.  Americans are increasingly realizing  there  is a better way to honor our  troops than by sending more of them  off to be killed. Would that there were  more than a little of our troops’ courage  right here  in Washington  from  those, who refuse to challenge this Administration’s  arrogant, myth-based  policies and who choose instead to cut  and run from their responsibilities.  Instead of  staying  the course, we  need to chart a smarter course. It is  not weakness or retreat to recognize  the Administration offers us only an  endless ‘‘spend and bleed’’ policy.  When this talkathon ends, reject this  fraudulent resolution, which cannot be  amended or changed, to alter this Administration’s  deadly  pursuit  of  a  desert mirage. Neither paper resolutions, nor more Administration arrogance will defeat terrorism.  The harm from this Administration’s  disastrous decision to invade Iraq was  apparent  from  the  beginning.  The  warnings of many, as noted  in my  speeches, including those given on the  floor on September 22, 2002 (H6410), October 9, 2002 (H7328), and October 10,  2002 (H7772), and the contemporaneous  editorial below, went unheeded.  [From the Austin American-Statesman, Oct.  13, 2002]  OURVOICESMUSTWORKTOAVERTAN  INVASION  (By Rep. Lloyd Doggett, U.S. House of  Representatives)  I recently voted against what is really an  authorization for launching a massive land  invasion and military occupation of Iraq.  More  important  than  speaking with one  voice, the votes of 133 Congress members  against this rush to war underscored the importance of our continuing to speak as one  democracy.  I sought to give voice to the thousands of  Central Texans who  communicated  their  concerns about making the terrible weapon  of war a predominant instrument in our foreign policy.  With this grave decision on war and peace  though, I knew I would have to answer to  more than those  I am privileged to represent—I would have to answer to myself,  my children and to history.  War now would only increase the danger to  American  families.  The  house-to-house  urban combat that would likely result from  a land invasion in Iraq would kill thousands,  divert precious resources from our ongoing  war on terrorism and expose our families to  more terrorism from among the many who  would perceive this as a crusade against  Islam. From the  information provided to  Congress, I do have some insight into issues  about which so many are understandably uncertain and fearful. No evidence has been  shared to connect Iraq to the Sept. 11 tragedy, nor to show that Iraq now poses an imminent threat to American families.  As former National Security Adviser Brent  Scowcroft said, ‘‘Saddam Hussein is probably  on Osama bin Laden’s hit list.’’ From Central Intelligence Agency reports, secret until  last week, we know that the unfinished job  of overcoming al Qaida represents the real  threat. The CIA concluded that invading Iraq  is more likely to drive our now separate enemies  together against us and  certainly  more likely to make Saddam Hussein use  any weapons of mass destruction that he  may possess.  In addition to the cost in lives, the costs of  war, to differing degrees, will touch us all.  President Bush’s top economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, estimated that the cost of  waging this war may rise as high as $200 billion.

270,House,109,-0.265,24,2006-06-15,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I believe we send them  a message when we vote on the armed  services bill. Very  few people voted  against it. I believe we voted, in the defense subcommittee of appropriations,  only 15 or 16 people voted against it.  But Theodore Roosevelt said, ‘‘If you  disagree with a policy and you do not  say anything, you are actually treasonous.’’  I disagree with the policy. I do not  disagree with supporting the troops.  There  is no one  that  supports  the  troops better than the Members of this  Congress. And that is shown by the few  people that vote against the bill.  One other thing: I think the gentleman made a mistake when he said  we are for the war, against the war on  terror. We are actually fighting for the  war on terror is what we are doing. But  I appreciate what the gentleman is saying.  I appreciate the fact that he and I  both asked  for more  troops at one  point. He was the lead sponsor at that  particular time.  I recognize the gentleman from California for 13 minutes.  ",2006
271,House,109,-0.465,31,2006-06-15,Mr. CLYBURN.," I thank Mr. MURTHA  for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, last Saturday I visited  the Johnson VA Medical Center  in  Charleston, South Carolina. That medical center is named for a young man  who is the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor because just out  of high school he went off to fight in  Vietnam and he threw himself on a grenade to save the others in the foxhole  with him.  I went to the hospital last Saturday  to visit one of my heroes, Joseph Henry  Washington. Joseph Washington was  on the USS Arizona on that fateful day  at Pearl Harbor. I went because I wanted to report to Joseph Henry Washington on my recent trip to Iraq because he questioned the wisdom of my  going there.  I said to Joe that I was very pleased  with what I had found militarily in  Iraq. I told him that I thought that our  military  forces were doing an admirable  job, and  I thought they were  meeting with significant success.  But I said to him, Uncle Joe, I am  very, very disappointed in what I have  found on the domestic front. We are  not going to win the hearts and minds  of the people of Iraq until we can give  them a police force that believes and is  committed to law and order, not one  that is 80 percent corrupt.  I said to him that I did not think  that we were going to be successful in  Iraq until we involved the Iraqi people  in the reconstruction efforts. We see $9  billion that we can’t account for. We  see construction going on up in the  northern part of the country. But in  Baghdad, in and around that part of  the country, we see a  failed policy.  That is what is causing the problem in  Iraq. We must begin to  involve the  Iraqi people in the reconstruction of  their country.  Eighty-five percent of the country is  without electricity. Almost 60 percent  of  the country  is without drinking  water. We are never going to be successful until we tackle these problems,  and that is where we are failing because there is no accountability on the  domestic front in Iraq.  Mr. Speaker, I go back to Charleston  the day after tomorrow because we are  going to bury Uncle Joe. He stayed  alive long enough for me to make my  report to him. And for over 45 years in  my consultations with him, he never  wanted to talk about his experiences  on the USS Arizona or his experiences  after returning home. Why? Because he  was never sufficiently included in the  building of this great Nation. And the  people of Iraq are not being sufficiently  included  in  the  rebuilding of  their  country. Until we do  that, we will  never be successful with this policy.  ",2006
272,House,109,0.516,31,2006-06-15,Mr. HOEKSTRA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  3 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. TIAHRT), my colleague from  the committee.  ",2006
273,House,109,0.39,38,2006-06-15,Ms. HART.," Thank you Mr. Chairman,  for yielding me a few moments today  to speak with our colleagues and with  the American people.  As I traveled with seven colleagues  earlier this year to visit our troops in  the Middle East and Central Asia, I  learned a great deal about the American spirit, the spirit of our volunteer  servicemen and women and what drives  them to risk it all. It is the defense of  freedom. It is the understanding that  vigilance  and  sacrifice  are  requirements for our Nation’s security.  Back home in the comfort of their  living rooms though, many Americans  lack  that  focus. They  forgot about  Iraq’s violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and the mounting incidence of attacks on our Nation leading  up to 9/11. They began to loudly dissent  and doubt and distract from our mission in Iraq.  One of the generals who I spoke with  while I was in Kuwait took the opportunity in a quiet conversation to ask a  very  pointed  question. He  said,  is  America fighting this war, or is it just  our military who is fighting this war?  We today, together with all Americans, must  answer  that  general’s  thoughtful question. We must answer  it for him, for ourselves, for the rest of  the world, but especially for our enemies, so they know America is truly  committed to liberty and the victory of  civility and opportunity  for all who  love freedom and support democracy.  These enemies have long been committed to robbing the world of liberty.  The United States and others have  been targets of these terrorists many  times leading up to 9/11 because of our  commitment to the ideal of freedom.  These enemies include regimes which  harbor terrorists, but most especially  those loosely connected terrorist organizations operating outside a national  framework who share an ideology of  oppression, tyranny, control, hatred resentment. They value no life, no man,  no woman, no child.  We Americans cannot continue to be  free  if we spend all our time questioning our mission. Many Americans  want to debate the validity of prewar  intelligence or weapons of mass destruction. Whether one nation or another supported al Qaeda, how many  troops do we need? Americans have to  look beyond the tactical challenges.  We must do as Tony Blair did. The  people who are  fighting us, he said,  know what is at stake. The question is,  do we?  b1545  ",2006
274,House,109,0.627,59,2006-06-15,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," It is good that  the American people are able to hear  this debate and judge for themselves  who should be making the policies and  which policies are best for our country.  I have been through this before. I  worked in the White House with Ronald Reagan for 7 years, and I heard  some of the same shrill voices that we  hear today in those days. I heard the  same gutting of the President of the  United States  for political purposes,  but also for idealistic reasons during  those days.  I heard Ronald Reagan  called a warmonger. I heard all of the  charges that we hear today aimed at  our President aimed at Ronald Reagan,  and by some of the same people,  I  might add.  We have voices who are idealistically  opposed to war and are in fact affected  in their heart, perhaps more than others, when war does come, as it comes to  all  free  people  because  without  strength of purpose and willingness to  fight there will be no freedom in this  world.  But when we  fought  communism, President Reagan stood firm  when the shrill voices of defeatism and  retreat attacked him personally and  attacked our effort and tried to undermine that effort in the same way our  effort today  is being undermined by  nitpicking, backbiting, and defeatism.  Yet, he stood firm and, guess what?  The world was amazed when the evil of  communism collapsed.  Well, today we are in a war with radical Islam, which is every bit as much  a threat and hates Western democracy  every bit as much as the Communists  did. We have made a stand in Iraq, and  I would hope that people understand  that had Ronald Reagan backed down,  we would still be in the middle of the  Cold War. And if we back down today,  as is being advocated, what I consider  to be a cowardly retreat, it will have  consequences. It will not end the war.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I  yield to Mr. BUYER for the purposes of  a unanimous consent request.  (Mr. BUYER asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
275,House,109,0.435,59,2006-06-15,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the resolution.  Immediately  following  the attacks on September 11, 2001, this Nation’s focus was on  countering the fundamental ideals of terrorism  that spawned  the attack on our homeland.  Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network,  Saddam Hussein, and the Taliban, connected  together through the terror they inflicted, had  shared ambitions  to destroy our way of  life.  Five  years  later, we have witnessed  successes of historical proportions. Saddam—imprisoned and on trial for acts against humanity; Osama is on the run and we captured his  number two; the Taliban no longer exists—for  the first time in Afghanistan, their citizens are  free to hope and dream; women are receiving  an education. Al Qaeda is demonstrating what  comes from the crushing pains of defeat, left  only with cowardly acts of desperation  in a  weakening effort to survive the blows that we  have dealt it.  Today in Iraq we are on the verge of the  blossoming of a successful new republic, accomplished by the perseverance of its citizens,  and the sacrifices of many. Yet, some of our  own countrymen are showing a dangerous  tendency to waiver, their faith shaken by the  drive-through mentality of our society. They  are verbalizing their doubts at a time when we  need them to stand strong. The peace-doves  who turned hawks of circumstance after September 11 were predicted to not have the intestinal fortitude to see this fight through to its  necessary  resolution. They are  living up  to  that prediction despite the threat of terrorism  still lurking around the world.  We cannot forget that the goals of Al Qaeda  and Osama bin Laden are to destroy western  culture in all of its forms and manifestations.  All across America, our constituents live their  lives—take  their kids  to school, go  to work,  earn a living—and this is the strength of our  Nation. However, we still live in the shadow of  a real and looming threat to our way of life.  We must  remain vigilant of  that  threat and  stand firm in our vow to dismantle it. While we  have not been attacked on our own soil since  September 11, we cannot afford the ramifications of complacency. The  recent arrest of  bomb-building  terrorists across  the border  in  Canada  is clear evidence of  that. We have  forced the terrorists into making this an ‘‘away  game,’’ the battlefield pushed from our homeland, but nonetheless the outcome must be in  our favor. Yes, the victories in this battle are  many, but we must have the resolve and determination to defeat terrorism here at home  and abroad. To succeed we must be absolute  and have constancy of purpose.  For decades Saddam Hussein  ruled  Iraq  with an iron fist of repression. In the midst of  that oppression was  the  intense yearning of  the Iraqi people to taste freedom. They were  forced to keep their hopes hidden, wrapped in  a cocoon that they could one day blossom into  the living principles from which they could rebuild  their nation. They have emerged  from  that cocoon and are attempting to fly. The elements that were forming in it have manifested  themselves in the formation of their new government,  two  successful national elections,  and a successful national constitutional  referendum.  Iraq cannot continue to succeed in the transition from war to building their Nation without  our continued help. The people of Iraq have  appealed to us in this critically important period. We have pledged our commitment  to  them and we need to see it through. The Iraqi  people are proud of  their accomplishments  thus  far, but  they have asked  for a steady  hand of reassurance  from us  to help guide  them in this transition.  The pride and motivation that the Iraqi population has demonstrated to this point are key  elements to making their young government a  success. We must continue  to nurture  their  growth of confidence so that they can effectively govern, defend, and sustain themselves.  The motivation to man a completely volunteer  Iraqi army is one point of evidence that these  people have pride and faith in their new republic. We cannot fail the security of our own  Nation and the people of Iraq in a time of such  dire need. The consequences of walking away  at this point are too great to fathom. We must  maintain our resolve to follow through with our  commitment to the people of Iraq and in the  global fight to free ourselves from the grip and  fear of terrorism.

276,House,109,-0.283,66,2006-06-15,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, this debate on this resolution,  and the resolution itself, continues two  very dangerous patterns that have sort  of governed all of our actions in Iraq  for far, far too long.  First of all, there are no specifics, as  Congressman  said  quite  articulately, as to how we are going to  achieve this victory.  When this debate was billed, we were  told this was going to be the floor of  the House, the People’s House talking  about how to deal with the very tough  challenges  that  now  present  themselves in Iraq. Even the President admits that things have not gone the way  we had planned, and we need to step up  and figure out how to fix the problems.  And yet, this resolution doesn’t say a  thing about that. It says, terrorism is  bad, our troops are good, and we want  to win.  This House is failing in its mission  with such an open statement that does  not get at the how of winning. How are  we going to deal with an open-ended  commitment to Iraq? How are we going  to pay the price for that? Is it even in  the best interest of our goal of a stable  and peaceful  Iraq  to  say  that our  troops will stay there for as long as is  necessary?  SNYDER Those questions are not answered.  Unless we in this House are willing to  step up and put policy  forward, we  shouldn’t say that this  is a debate  about the future of Iraq. It is not. We  have many hard questions that need to  be answered. This resolution does not  do that.  And the second dangerous trend is  the pattern of the President and the  majority in this Congress to say anyone who disagrees with them is somehow unpatriotic and defeatist, which to  my mind means that we all need a refresher course on why democracy is important. We are all very good at saying  that it is important. It is important so  that we hear all the voices, not just  those who disagree with us. That way  we can learn from our mistakes, which  we desperately need to do in Iraq.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in disappointment—  though I must say, not in surprise—about the  exercise the House is engaged in today. This  is not a true debate about our policy in Iraq.  A real debate on Iraq would allow us to consider alternative proposals and vote on meaningful amendments that could help us improve  the very difficult situation  there.  Instead we  have before us an un-amendable, rhetorical  document about  the war on  terrorism  that  barely  focuses on  Iraq  itself, and certainly  doesn’t deal with the real challenges we face  there. This process is an offense to our democracy.  What is even more troubling, Mr. Speaker,  is that this kind of undemocratic approach is  precisely what led to the Bush administration’s  many costly mistakes in Iraq. Americans have  seen how the administration’s stubborn single-  mindedness and refusal to consider alternative  views and dissenting opinions have cost us  dearly  in  Iraq. The  facts  are  all-too-well-  known:  When General Shinseki said that far more  troops would be needed to secure the peace  in Iraq, he was ignored and soon retired—and  the result was  that  the  troops we did send  struggled unnecessarily to prevent and control  a massive insurgency.  When advisors warned  the administration  not to de-Baathify and disband the Iraqi military and security forces, they were ignored. As  Prime Minister Tony Blair has publicly admitted, this was a grave mistake that effectively  pushed  thousands  of  military-trained,  disempowered Sunnis into the streets, fueling  the post-war insurgency.  And the administration’s refusal to heed dissenting views on Iraq continues to this day.  Now  that  the Special  Inspector General  for  Iraq Reconstruction has brought to light massive amounts of waste,  fraud, and abuse  in  the  reconstruction contracting,  I understand  that the administration and the Republicans in  Congress are  trying  to prematurely end his  mandate.  This is a clear pattern, Mr. Speaker, and the  consequences of this arrogant, undemocratic  approach are real.  It has cost us dearly  in  American lives and resources, undermined our  efforts to build peace and stability in Iraq, and  delayed our departure from the country.  Mr. Speaker,  I supported  the use-of-force  authorization in October 2002 in order to give  the President  the  leverage  to hold Saddam  Hussein accountable  for his  threatening behavior and refusal to submit to weapons inspections. And that is what makes it all the  more  frustrating  that  the President misused  that authority by rushing to war and committing so many grave and costly mistakes  in  Iraq.  So no, Mr. Speaker, this is not a real debate. A real debate would allow us to consider  the important questions in Iraq: Can we afford  to make an open-ended commitment to staying  in  Iraq? Has our  troop presence  there  reached the point where it is inhibiting a successful transition to full Iraqi sovereignty? Can  our strained military and ballooning national  deficit handle it?  How can we accelerate  the  transition  to  Iraqi sovereignty and  responsibility  for  their  own country? How best can we engage  in  more robust diplomacy with our allies and key  regional players who can help bolster the new  Iraqi government and contribute to its reconstruction?  How can we  improve Congressional oversight so that we can identify and rectify the  enormous mistakes  the  administration  has  made in Iraq?  These are the questions we should be debating, Mr. Speaker, because they directly affect our ability to achieve success in Iraq. We  owe it to our brave men and women in uniform and to the American people to ask these  questions. But instead, we have a resolution  before us  today  that  is basically  irrelevant  when  it comes  to  the real  issues  in  Iraq.  It  says, essentially, that we support fighting terrorism and that we are committed to achieving  success  in  Iraq.  I agree with  that, but  that  doesn’t say anything about how we get there.  That is the important question.  Mr. Speaker, today Congress is continuing  to utterly abdicate its oversight responsibility.  Since the outbreak of war, this Congress has  done little more than endorse the administration’s policy  in  Iraq,  instead of asking  the  tough questions and scrutinizing that policy, as  the Constitution requires us to do.  Mr. Speaker, I hope, despite this Congress’  refusal to conduct oversight, that we can be  honest today as we look ahead in Iraq. We all  want to see an Iraq that is stable, secure, and  free. Our troops are doing an outstanding job,  and they deserve our full support and respect.  But the fact is that success or failure in Iraq  increasingly depends on the decisions of Iraqi  leaders, and  they must understand  that.  In  order to achieve success in Iraq we must accelerate the transition to Iraqi sovereignty.  I believe that significantly reducing our military footprint is critical for making that happen.  While we cannot simply abandon Iraq at this  point, drawing down our forces levels in a responsible way in the coming months will force  the Iraqis to take greater responsibility for their  own security and reduce their dependence on  U.S.  forces.  It will also send an  important  message  to  the  Iraqi people  that Americans  are not there to occupy the country, but rather  seek to begin leaving as Iraqis take control of  their own country.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, as we move forward in  Iraq, both the future and the past matter. We  must make the best of a difficult situation by  working diligently  to help  Iraqis  take  full responsibility  for running  their country so  that  our overburdened troops can come home. And  we must do so in a manner that does not give  the violent Islamic terrorists in the world any  greater strength. Yet we must also be willing  to acknowledge and learn from our mistakes  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:41 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H15JN6.REC H15JN6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2006
277,House,109,-0.386,73,2006-06-15,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker,  instead of finding, capturing or killing  the man who viciously attacked our  country almost 5 years ago, the administration misled our country and sent  150,000 troops to war with a country  without any credible link to 9/11.  Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us  mentions Iraq 18 times, but it does not  mention Osama bin Laden even once.  Not only can we not find bin Laden in  Afghanistan, we cannot  find him  in  this resolution.  If the other side of the aisle is serious  about a resolution on the global war on  terror, they would be better served to  get their target correct.  ",2006
278,House,109,-0.376,73,2006-06-15,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, our country is at war.  Men and women of the U.S. Armed  Forces, Republicans and Democrats,  are making the ultimate sacrifice in  Iraq to defend our freedom with 2,500  men and women having lost their lives  in Iraq alone. They deserve our respect,  our gratitude and our admiration, but  we do not honor them with this debate  today.  Instead of discussing ideas and long  overdue  course  corrections, we  are  being confronted with slogans. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle  would like this country to believe that  their party will stay the course in Iraq,  while we want to cut and run. That  kind of gross distortion may resonate  on right-wing talk radio, but nothing  could be further from the truth. We  need to make sure the job is done right  in Iraq and leave as soon as possible.  Our men and women in uniform are  striving, sometimes without the necessary troop strength and without adequate equipment to make the effort in  Iraq a success. Here the House majority  is  undermining  the  democratic  process and the very principles that  these brave  servicemen and women  have gone abroad to defend.  b1915  The actions of the Republican leadership in the run-up to today would make  the Kremlin blush. Having made a decision to conduct a debate, the majority  should have enabled full participation,  allowing amendments to the proposed  resolution on  the House  floor, and  Democrats should have been afforded  the opportunity to offer a substitute  resolution.  Instead, the resolution before us is a  shameless, one-party manifesto. If the  debate  today were  about  substance  rather than this one-party manifesto,  we would focus on what staying the  course means. The misguided and mistake-ridden effort in Iraq up to now is  absolutely not the course to follow.  I am deeply disturbed by critical  issues concerning our efforts in Iraq  that this resolution does not address:  human  rights  violations;  appalling  shortcomings in planning for the post-  conflict period; pathetically weak congressional oversight.  Just consider the waste, fraud and  abuse of reconstruction efforts in Iraq.  The Special Inspector General for Iraq  Reconstruction, Mr. Stuart Bowen, testified before our committee last week.  I would like to pay tribute to the exceptional work that Mr. Bowen has  done in this area. After serving as a  senior member of George Bush’s gubernatorial campaign  team, as general  counsel to then-Governor Bush, deputy  counsel to the Bush transition team in  2000, and then associate counsel in the  Bush White House, he left for the private sector, only to be brought back  into service by the White House to  oversee  an  investigation  into mismanagement of funds in Iraq.  The facts from the President’s handpicked special Inspector General, Mr.  Bowen, are shocking. Billions of U.S.  taxpayer dollars have been wasted in  Iraq.

279,House,109,0.628,80,2006-06-15,Mr. NEUGEBAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I  have been amused at some of the rhetoric tonight, but one of the questions  that has been asked  is what  is our  strategy?  We have a strategy. The strategy is  to win. The strategy is to keep America safe.  We are winning the war on terrorism.  We have gotten Saddam Hussein. We  have gotten Zarqawi. But the problem  is  are  there  other Saddams,  other  Zarqawis out there that would threaten the very fabric of the life that we  live in America?  We have a choice. We can fight that  war  on  terrorism  in  other  places  around the world or we can fight it  here in America. The right choice is to  fight those terrorists where they are,  where they are beginning to thrive, and  keep them contained where they are.  If we get out too quickly, what are  we going to tell those families of those  young soldiers that paid the ultimate  price for the freedom and democracy  that we are sewing the seeds for in Iraq  today? What are we going to tell the  young men and women that are over  there today that have volunteered, I  repeat, volunteered, to come and serve  a noble purpose?  I got a letter from a young marine  named Kevin Hester. And Kevin enlisted, Mr. Speaker. He knew exactly  what he was getting into when he enlisted in the Marines. And Kevin is in  Iraq today. And Kevin wrote me a letter the other day, and he said, The  Iraqi people trust us, and they trust us  now and they are trying to help us help  them by telling us who the bad guys  are in their country.  We have been fighting the cause for  America and keeping America safe for  over 230 years coming this July 4. This  is a war on terrorism. This is a different war than we have fought before.  This is like the war on drugs. This is  like the war on crime. The war on terrorism is a war that we will be fighting  for many years to come, but it is a war  that we cannot afford to lose. We cannot disgrace  those young men and  women that are representing and defending our country so greatly.  And so, Mr. Speaker,  I encourage  people to support this resolution  in  order to say to the young men and  women around the world that are defending  freedom and democracy, we  love you, we appreciate you.  God bless them and God bless America.  ",2006

282,House,109,0.425,87,2006-06-15,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank my colleague on the Judiciary  Committee, the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. COBLE) and the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism  and Homeland Security,  for  yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this  global war on terror resolution. The  war on terror is being fought on two  fronts, both abroad and here at home.  We applaud the diplomatic and military achievements overseas, but we  also need to remain vigilant here in  our own country.  Until  the  terrorists  are  defeated,  Americans will continue to be their  targets as long as we stand for freedom  and democracy.  One of our weapons in the war on terror is the USA PATRIOT Act. That  bill, which originated in the Judiciary  Committee, gives law enforcement officials and intelligence officials the ability to cooperate during investigations.  More than 250 people in the United  States have been charged with crimes  tied to  international terrorist  investigations and have been convicted or  have pled guilty because of the USA  PATRIOT Act.  In response to the events of September 11, 2001, we also passed legislation that created a Director of National Intelligence so that all of our intelligence capabilities would be coordinated by one official.  We passed the REAL ID Act which  contains several antiterrorism provisions, including one that makes certain  foreign nationals deportable because of  their ties to terrorism.  We must continue to pass legislation  that makes it more difficult for terrorists to enter the United States. That  means enacting meaningful border security legislation like the bill that the  House passed last December.  Those who would do us harm, Mr.  Speaker, respect no borders. Potential  terrorists and thousands of others continue to enter our country  illegally  every day.  In America, we are blessed to have  the  freedom that others only dream  about, but  freedom  is never  free. It  must be nurtured and protected, sometimes at great cost in lives; but we will  not surrender to terrorists. That only  empowers them. We will  fight them  today so we can enjoy a better tomorrow. Any other course only resigns us  to an uncertain future.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me pay  tribute to the brave men and women of  the  21st  Congressional  District  of  Texas who are fighting this war overseas. The most difficult action I have  ever taken as an elected official is to  call the families of the 14 servicemembers from my district who have made  the ultimate sacrifice. Their families’  patriotism and love of country is almost indescribable. Their faith is great  because they know our cause is great.  Mr. Speaker, I am glad this resolution has been brought to the floor, and  I urge my colleagues to support it.  ",2006
283,House,109,-0.341,94,2006-06-15,Mr. PRICE of North Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, the American people are increasingly aware of where things stand  in Iraq, despite the glib assurances and  political spin we get from sources like  the whereas clauses of the resolution  before us and the Pentagon’s most recent quarterly report, which has been  so  devastatingly  refuted  by Middle  East expert Anthony Cordesman of the  Center for Strategic and International  Studies.  The real question before us and the  question most Americans are asking is,  how long must our troops stay in Iraq?  Our military’s  valiant  efforts  have  clearly  facilitated  such  important  steps as such as the formation of a  democratically elected government in  Iraq. But the troubling reality is that  our continued presence also makes success more elusive. It serves as a disincentive for Iraqi military and political leaders to take courageous risks to  stabilize their country and assume responsibility  for  their  government.  Equally important, our presence is a  magnet for international terrorism and  an incitement for the insurgency.  In order to jump-start progress, our  troops must begin to come home. We  must leave in a way that maximizes  Iraq’s chances to govern and defend  itself. At the same time, we cannot become hostages to the failures of administration policy, prolonging or staying  in a situation where our very presence  is a continuing provocation. How we  leave does matter, but we must leave.  That  is why Representative BRAD  MILLERand I introduced a resolution  last fall, H.J. Res. 70, which would require the President to deliver an exit  strategy for Iraq. Tonight I am renewing that call. Let me explain briefly in  clear terms what a responsible exit  strategy means.  First, we need to hear that the President has a plan for reducing our presence in Iraq within a reasonable time  frame. ‘‘As they stand up, we will stand  down’’ is not a strategy. It is a slogan.  Secondly, we need to hear that such a  plan would begin with an initial near-  term drawdown of U.S. forces to send a  clear message to the Iraqis that our  presence is coming to an end. We also  need to hear a pledge from the President that we will not establish long-  term bases on Iraqi soil.  And, finally, we need to hear that  there is a plan for filling the void left  behind when our troops depart, to mobilize  resources  within  the  international community, to ensure that  Iraq’s neighbors do not interfere in internal Iraqi affairs, and to support the  ongoing development of the Iraqi Government and security forces.  These are the elements of a responsible exit strategy. This is the type of  leadership that the President owes our  troops and the American people.  ",2006

285,House,109,0.426,101,2006-06-15,Mr. TERRY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of the resolution to affirm the United  States of America will ultimately achieve victory in the Global War on Terror.  On September 11, 2001, 3,000 of our fellow  Americans were brutally killed by Islamic terrorists under  the  leadership of Osama bin  Laden. President Bush responded by declaring war against terrorism and its strongholds  throughout the world. He said we would fight  the enemy on their ground to prevent terrorists  from once again attacking our citizens on U.S.  soil.  The Bush Doctrine stated: ‘‘Any nation that  continues to harbor or support terrorism will be  regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.’’ U.S. and Coalition forces have verified  his words with  irrefutable action. The state-  sponsored ‘‘safe harbor’’ Al Qaeda enjoyed in  Afghanistan ended when U.S. and Northern  Alliance forces routed the Taliban in a decisive  military victory.  Afghanistan now has a newly elected parliament,  a market  economy,  equality  for  women, and millions of  children attending  school  for  the  first  time. We still  face challenges in this nation, but it is on its way to becoming a stable and secure democracy, freed  from the oppression of the Taliban extremists.  Most importantly, Al Qaeda can no longer use  this nation as a launching ground from which  to attack the United States.  In Iraq, Saddam Hussein repeatedly refused  to comply with U.N. weapons inspection. Sovereignty was turned over to Iraqis a year and  a half ago; a Constitution was drafted  last  summer and ratified  in October; and a new  government is being established. The seeds of  democracy are beginning to take root, and a  major  threat  of  state-sponsored  terrorism  against the U.S. was removed.  Despite the danger of violent retaliation from  radical extremists, 59 percent of Iraqi citizens  exercised their right to vote in January, and  approximately 70 percent in December. Iraq is  on its way to fully assuming responsibility for  its own security and governance.  The challenges we face are undeniable and  difficult. President Bush was correct when he  said  this war would come at great cost  in  blood and treasure. However, the cost would  be much higher—intolerably high—had we not  decisively acted to protect the security and interests of the United States.  Who can forget the cheering of Iraqi citizens  in the streets as Baghdad was liberated and  the statue of Saddam Hussein toppled to the  ground? Who can forget the courage of the  Iraqi’s who proudly displayed the purple ink on  their index finger after exercising their right to  vote? Who can  forget  the sight of Saddam  Hussein cowering  like a cornered  rat when  U.S. soldiers forced him from hiding? Above  all, who can forget the sight of the North and  South Towers of the World Trade Center collapsing, the burning embers of the attack on  the Pentagon, or the scorched field in Pennsylvania that will forever stand as a testament  to heroism and self-sacrifice. Our successes in  the Global War on Terror have prevented additional horrifying  images  from  filling our TV  screens,  saving  untold  innocent American  lives.  We may never  know what  catastrophes  have been averted by the dedication and vigilance of U.S. servicemen and women. Nearly  2,500 Americans have nobly given their lives  in exchange for the peace that we have enjoyed here at home these past four and one-  half years. The very fact that we have not endured another  terrorist attack on U.S. soil  proves their lives were not given in vain. We  have not seen additional attacks such as  those in London and Madrid, or experienced  the fear Israelis face on a daily basis. We owe  our safety and security to the soldiers who are  giving their all to protect our families, communities, lives and liberties.  Al Qaeda remains a persistent danger to the  United States. This terrorist network operates  in over 60 countries around the world. It brainwashes men and women into becoming suicide bombers; destroys religious sites; bombs  and beheads innocent civilians; and seeks the  destruction and overthrow of America, our values, our people, our freedoms and our way of  life.  We cannot allow Al Qaeda the opportunity  to establish a permanent base  in  Iraq  from  which  to attack  the United States. The collapse of  Iraq’s new democratic government  would be a huge victory for Al Qaeda, drawing  additional recruits for bin Laden’s brand of terrorism from the ranks of young Muslims. It is  well-known  that bin Laden  seeks nuclear,  chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction  to  inflict severe casualties on  the  United States and allied countries.  Al Qaeda  conducted poison gas experiments on dogs in Afghanistan, and the governments of Britain, France, and Jordan have  each foiled plans by Al Qaeda to use chemical  weapons. U.S. intelligence sources have documented repeated attempts by Al Qaeda  to  purchase nuclear material, including weapons  grade uranium. Nations such as  Iran and  North Korea are a potential risk for transferring  nuclear capabilities to terrorist insurgents.  We must not fall into a sense of complacency.

286,House,109,0.3,115,2006-06-15,Mr. FORTENBERRY.," Mr. Speaker,  on June 6 we commemorated D Day,  the day that American military forces  stormed the coast of France 62 years  ago to turn the tide in one of the most  brutal conflicts  the world has ever  known. The United States sustained  6,603 casualties that day, yet the final  victory over the forces of fascism remained nearly a year away.  Rows of silent graves at the American Military Cemetery in Normandy  bear witness to the high price of freedom. They solemnly remind us that  there is no substitute for perseverance  and sacrifice if we are to prevail over  the threats which challenge this Nation and the world today.  The global war on terror is a different war from the wars of the past.  This is not a war of uniformed armies  on clearly defined battlefields. It is a  war that  invades tranquil space and  time without warning, carried out by  those who hide among and behind civilian populations, seeking to exploit the  vulnerable for ruthless purposes.  While we have endured the sacrifice  of global wars during the past, we have  never waged  a war  in  an  age  of  globalization,  in an age when  technology eviscerates the concept of distance, magnifies our losses, trivializes  our accomplishments, and places our  adversaries in a far better position to  leverage the freedoms of our society  against us.  In seeking to prevent another 9/11,  the President and the United States  Congress would have been utterly irresponsible to ignore the threat posed by  Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It is important to note that  in 1998 President  Clinton ordered U.S. Armed Forces to  strike military and security targets in  Iraq because Iraq’s nuclear, chemical  and biological weapons programs posed  a credible and serious threat.  But I am not here to argue the case  for war today. The United States and  our coalition partners made judgments  to enter Iraq based upon the best available evidence, and now the commitment is ours to complete. We are all in  this together, and the successful progression of our commitment in Iraq,  from which I remain convinced that an  abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops would  do more harm than good, is vital to  achieving national security for America, stability and hope for all peoples of  the Middle East, and establishing the  prospects for civil reforms and long-  term  peace  throughout  the  entire  world.  While our mission continues to be  dangerous and costly, it continues to  make strong progress as well. The recent establishment of democratic institutions in Iraq is without cultural or  historical precedent. This  fact, combined with rapid progress in the deployment of Iraqi security forces, gives  us realistic hope of diminishing conflict and a stable foundation for the  prospects of long-term peace.  As we proceed with our obligation,  may each one of us endeavor to discharge our responsibilities in a manner  that is worthy of the sacrifices of the  United States Armed Forces.  And may each of us recall that this  obligation is ultimately connected to  the mantle of leadership that has fallen  to the United States, not only for our  own welfare, but for the welfare of the  entire world.  f  IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION  ",2006

291,,109,-0.465,213,2006-06-15,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to the historic Mount Pisgah Baptist  Church  in Orangeburg, South Carolina as  it  celebrates its 153rd anniversary on June 25,  2006. Mount Pisgah has been a beacon  in  times of  joy and sorrow  for  the Orangeburg  community, and  I congratulate Reverend D.  Edward Chaney and his congregation on this  significant milestone in the life of the church.  Mount Pisgah Baptist Church began as a  gathering of a small group of Christian slaves  in 1863. Two years later, this group broke off  from the First Baptist Church in Orangeburg.  They called their new church Sunny Side Baptist. By 1868, the congregation had grown to  fifty members,  and  two  years  later  they  changed  the name  to Mount Pisgah Baptist  Church. The renamed church began to grow  in size and its ministry. By 1877, Mount Pisgah boasted a congregation of 283 members.  The 20th century was momentous in the life  of Mount Pisgah. Remarkably from 1901 until  2000, the church had only three pastors. Reverend Nelson Nix presided over the congregation from 1900–1945. During his ministry, the  first church building burned in 1902. However,  Reverend Nix and the congregation rebuilt the  structure that is still in use today.  Reverend John D. Rhodes served as Mount  Pisgah’s pastor from 1945–1968, and was followed by Reverend F.G.S. Everett who led the  congregation  from 1969–2001. During Reverend Everett’s distinguished service, Mount  Pisgah was listed on the Registry of Historical  Places.  Today, Reverend Chaney presides over a  dynamic church  that  is among  the oldest  in  Orangeburg and South Carolina. The church  has added a multipurpose education complex,  and more property has been acquired for future expansion. Due to the enormous growth  in the church, Reverend Chaney has initiated  a Million Dollar Capital Campaign for church  improvements and new construction.  Mount Pisgah currently has 17 ministries  that include an outreach radio broadcast that  reaches  far beyond Orangeburg County  into  neighboring  Calhoun,  Colleton,  and  Dorchester counties. The church is also renowned  for  its music ministry  that performs  inspired  Christmas and Easter concerts.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating Mount Pisgah  Baptist Church on its 153rd anniversary. This  vibrant church has contributed to the rich history of Orangeburg and South Carolina, and I  offer my congratulations and wish Mount Pisgah continued success and Godspeed!  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE STEEL  FINANCING FAIRNESS ACT  HON.

During its 50 years of existence, the department has employed a total of seven chiefs, a  testament to its sterling reputation.  In 1994, Thomas J. Costanza was promoted  to chief, a position he holds today. To support  him, the department has 15 full-time officers.

J. RANDY FORBES  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 26, 2006  ",2006
296,,109,0.407,69,2006-06-26,Mr. FORBES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  introduce an article written by Rabbi  Israel  Zoberman, spiritual  leader of Congregation  Beth Chaverim in Virginia Beach, VA. The article by Rabbi Zoberman reads as follows:  Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s successful  first official visit recently to the United  States was an expected formality between  the leaders of two close and long-standing allies. It was also an essential opportunity for  the Israeli Prime Minister to extend the intimate bond between his predecessor Ariel  Sharon and President Bush, which Sharon  learned to carefully cultivate, to his own  budding relationship with a mighty and necessary friend.  Olmert, a skilled politician who has been  moving away from a somewhat abrasive demeanor, did find the right words of gratitude, deference and shared sentiment. In his  granted appearance as a special guest before  a joint session of Congress, he received no  less  than  17  standing ovations  reflecting  America’s genuine sympathy for the Jewish  state which transcends those who happen to  be in power on either side at a given time.  In fact, the vital alliance born of common  values and interest between the senior and  junior partners, has assumed a heightened  relevancy  following 9/11 with the complex  war on terrorism and the costly thrust to  bring democracy’s freedoms to the Middle  East and beyond. Who more than the ever beleaguered State of  Israel has experienced  what terrorizing onslaught on innocent civilians and a cherished way of life is all about?  The President gave his approving nod to  the Prime Minister’s unilateral plan of the  ‘‘realignment’’ (the latest term) of Israel’s  future borders in the absence of a peace partner. The Palestinian Hamas-led government  even rejects Israel’s right to exist and is  locked in a deadly struggle of a civil war nature with Fatah over running the Palestinian Authority. When will the Palestinians  stop the tragic cycle of never missing an opportunity to miss an opportunity? Olmert  voiced support for the seemingly moribund  Road Map which Bush welcomed, as  the  President reiterated his embrace of Israel’s  determination to hold onto its large settlement blocks on the West Bank while relinquishing control over sparsely populated territory to allow for the creation of a Palestinian state.  The Prime Minister, a former Mayor of  challenge-laden Jerusalem, is yet to be tested in Israel’s hot political crucible in his  country’s top position. It is doubtless that he  was given an extraordinary historic opportunity to affect Israel’s destiny and fully implement the vision of Sharon who was so  suddenly incapacitated at the height of his  popularity and on the threshold of fateful decisions having accomplished the controversial Gaza disengagement. But  likely  the  highlight of Olmert’s visit to the capital of  the world’s only remaining superpower was  the stern warning he poignantly delivered  concerning the impending threat from Iran,  and his revelation that the terror sponsoring  radical Muslim regime ghoulishly calling for  Israel’s elimination while denying the Holocaust is almost within reach, closer than anticipated of developing a nuclear capability.  One wonders if the Prime Minister personally presented  the priceless gift of  supporting intelligence reports, thus nailing the  unavoidable response that the United States  and the West are saddled with at this very  hour. The risks of hesitant inaction though  far outweighs those of resolute action, sending  a  powerful message  that  tyrannical  blackmail is unacceptable and that the resolve  of  free  nations  to  prevail  is  unshakeable. An ambiguous response invites  further aggression with rising costs. Iran’s  mullahs’ genocidal design on Israel, with Europe as a potential target as well while seeking hegemony in a critical region, ought to  alarm us enough. What should however be  clear is that Israel’s only option is to survive, it simply can not afford to absorb a  first nuclear strike. Have we not internalized  by now History’s painful  lessons, are we  doomed to forever repeat the past? I pray  not.  Rabbi  Israel Zoberman, spiritual  leader of  Congregation  Beth  Chaverim  in  Virginia  Beach, was born to Polish Holocaust survivors  in Chu, Kazakhstan,  in 1945 and  raised  in  Haifa, Israel.

The purpose of Best Friends Weekend was  to remind all of us how animals enrich our  lives  through  their companionship,  friendship  and  love. Best Friends Animal Society believes that dedicating one weekend each year  to promoting kind acts  towards animals can  make our communities and our world a better  place.  Cruelty to animals often leads to cruelty to  people. I’ve been a strong and outspoken supporter of animal welfare issues since first coming to Congress, and I’ve authored legislation  to help protect animals and promote their welfare. Organizations like Best Friends serve as  a conscience to lawmakers and the country in  these matters and remind us that our first duty  is to protect the most vulnerable and innocent  among us.  This past weekend’s activities of kindness  inspired by Best Friends should serve as a reminder to all of us, that in this increasing fragmented society we need to be ever more compassionate about  the animals  in our world,  whether they are companion pets, service animals such as seeing-eye dogs,  livestock, or  nature’s wildlife. It also serves as a reminder  that the bond between humans and animals is  a vital one and is capable of bringing joy and  healing to people of all ages. Finally, it serves  to remind us  to be more kind and compassionate to our fellow man. We coexist in this  world—human  to human and human  to animal—and  those bonds must be maintained  and kept strong.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

299,,109,-0.41,76,2006-06-26,Mr. CROWLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  wish a very special New Yorker, Mrs. Ozia  Mae Sturgis, a very happy 80th birthday. Mrs.  Sturgis commemorated this occasion with family members and friends at a birthday tea at  the William Hodson Senior Center. I would like  to join them in celebrating her life, her contributions, and her career of community service.  The eldest of 12 children, she was born  Ozia Mae Hammond on June 21, 1926, in Augusta, Georgia, and moved to New York City  in  the 1940s, where she met and married  Jimmie Sturgis.  Mrs. Sturgis and her husband raised seven  children  in  their Bronx home, where she  instilled in them the importance of education, a  strong work ethic, and  the value of  family.  Their children and seven grandchildren all still  reside in the New York Metropolitan Area.  She  is very active  in her church and her  community, serving as a past president and  current Board Member of the William Hodson  Senior Center  in  the Bronx. Last year, she  was the proud recipient of the Center’s ‘‘Mother of the Year’’ award.  On the occasion of Ozia Mae Sturgis’s 80th  birthday, I am pleased to join her family and  friends  in wishing her many happy years  to  come.

302,House,109,-0.302,37,2006-07-11,Ms. BERKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I absolutely am flabbergasted by the  righteous indignation being displayed  on the other side of the aisle, and it  shocks my conscience hearing what I  am hearing.  If the gentleman from Virginia is so  intent on banning  Internet gaming,  well, then he should be supporting my  amendment. Better yet, I should not  have had to introduce an amendment.  It should have been  included  in his  original legislation.  If we are serious about banning gaming, then we should ban all forms of  gaming, and I can’t possibly imagine  why he would be opposed to that. When  he says it is a poison pill, why, because  the horse racing association told him  they would fight this if he brought in  legislation that had this included and  didn’t make an exemption out of it?  I am absolutely astounded also by  the other gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  WOLF), whom I don’t think would be offended if I said that he was opposed to  gaming of any form. But I find it incomprehensible that in the year 2000  Congress approved a provision allowing  online betting on horse racing, and  during consideration of the bill on the  floor, Mr. WOLFmade a statement in  which he said, ‘‘This provision deeply  troubles me, and would expand gambling at a time when men and women  are becoming addicted to this process.’’  Now he seems to be okay with the  Leach-Goodlatte  amendment  which  specifically exempts the activity made  legal by this 2000 provision.  Now, if we want to let the States retain control of this issue, we should  not be voting on doing this bill at all.  It makes no sense. I would say that we  are interfering with the States’ rights,  not helping them out.  And if you are arguing that the bill is  neutral on horse racing, then why is it  even mentioned in this bill? And why  does the Thoroughbred Horse Racing  Association think they have an exemption?  Is Mr. GOODLATTE willing  to  stand up here and make a statement  for the record that the Thoroughbred  Horse Racing Association and horse  racing is exempt and the Department  of Justice can go after them and shut  them down? I don’t think so.  And if you had an opportunity to go  online, as  I did  just yesterday, and  looked at the horse racing  Internet  sites, it is page after page after page.  Anybody  can  log on. Anybody  can  place a bet. And I don’t see any way to  prevent children, and I don’t see any  way of keeping people from spending  their hard-earned money on that.  This creates a huge exemption which  we will have no control of, and totally,  in my opinion, undermines the bill and  makes a mockery and a farce of what  we are doing here today, or supposed to  be doing here today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
303,House,109,-0.265,37,2006-07-11,Mr. BOUCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from Wisconsin  for  yielding to me, and I do rise in opposition to this amendment.  The underlying bill contains a carefully negotiated balance which reflects  existing laws that allow States to control gambling activities within their  borders. The  gentlewoman’s  amendment strikes that carefully negotiated  balance. Its adoption would doom the  bill. To those who support passage of  the bill and a ban on Internet gambling,  I urge a  ‘‘no’’ vote on  this  amendment.  Forty-eight of  50 State attorneys  general have announced support for a  ban on Internet gambling. But if the  amendment that is offered by the gentlewoman passes and States lose the  authority over gambling within their  borders, the bill will fail because State  support for it will be withdrawn.  The bill is very clear on what authorities States will  retain. States  have traditionally been empowered to  prohibit or allow gambling within their  borders. The bill  continues  to give  States that right while imposing strict  safeguards  to assure  that gambling  stays within a State’s border and does  not extend to other States.  Those  safeguards  require  that  the  bettor,  the business  conducting  the  gambling operation, any services that  support the wagerers and other support  services must be  in the authorizing  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:41 Jul 12, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11JY7.060 H11JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006

I had forgotten that he had identical twins and is  very familiar with this, not just as a  physician but as a father.  I want to close with a note that a  very  fortuitous  thing has happened,  and let me put the next chart up that  simply is a page from this White Paper  that refers to this technique and that  credits me with this proposal early in  this process.  After I suggested this to the President, a very interesting thing had happened after that with a dialogue between Karl Rove and the White House,  and they were, in effect, carrying out  simultaneous monologues and thought  they were dialoguing. And that very  frequently happens, one of our big  problems in this world, which is why, I  guess, we have a State Department, because sometimes people think they are  dialoguing and they really are carrying  on simultaneous monologues.  But during this 5 years this technology has developed to the point that  the  British  now  are  doing  this  preimplantation genetic diagnosis. And  I am sure he won’t mind if I mention  his name. Richard Doerflinger made  one of the greatest contributions to  this dialogue of anybody when he suggested,  ‘‘Roscoe, the first thing that  you need to do with that cell that you  take from this eight-cell stage is to establish a repair kit for the baby.’’  Now, we are kind of trying to do that  with freezing cord blood. That is the  reason you freeze cord blood, because  later you may need it. That, by the  way, is not embryonic stem cell; those  are the adult stem cells. The baby’s is  an adult when it is born. As a matter of  fact, the day you are born, you start to  die. You are an adult when you are  born. The embryonic is when you are  first starting to develop; it is not an  embryo, it is a fetus at that time. And  the tissues are really in terms of the  genetic development; they are adult  tissues.  But if now the first thing that a parent does with that cell that is taken is  to establish a repair kit and take a second cell, because the six cells that were  implanted do just as well as the seven  that were implanted, with the second  cell, do a preimplantation genetic diagnosis,  if they wish.

308,,109,-0.432,163,2006-07-11,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to commend the Hawaii State Legislature  for  increasing penalties  for adults who  supply alcohol  to persons under  the  legal  drinking age of 21. I believe this is one important step  toward attacking  the supply chain  that  fuels  the national problem of underage  drinking.  According  to authorities, adults are by  far  the main source of alcohol for underage drinkers. A  report  to Congress by  the National  Academy of Sciences  identified  friends and  adult purchasers as the most frequent sources  of alcohol among college students and older  adolescents. Family members were cited as  the most frequent source for younger adolescents. The Century Council, a not-for-profit  educational organization dedicated to fighting  drunk driving and underage drinking,  found  that 65 percent of underage drinkers get their  alcohol from family and adult friends.  Hawaii’s new law is among 7 bills that have  passed into law and nearly 20 that have been  introduced in States throughout our great Nation that link underage drinking and providing  alcohol to those under 21 with a penalty relating to the revocation of driving privileges for  the offender. Diageo, a large beverage alcohol  company, in an example of enlightened corporate citizenship,  is among  the  firms  that  have led the effort to move this type of legislation in state legislatures throughout the country. As such, many have referred to bills like  Hawaii’s new law as a ‘‘Diageo Bill.’’  The American Legislative Exchange Council  has made the ‘‘Diageo Bill’’ one of their model  pieces of legislation for 2006. I urge all States  to pass this type of measure.  While only one piece of this important puzzle, the State of Hawaii along with the people  at Diageo and  those of similarly committed  companies should be commended for being a  leader in the fight against underage drinking.  f  TEXAS RANGER DREW CARTER—  TEXAS LAWMAN  HON. TED POE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 11, 2006  ",2006
309,,109,0.593,163,2006-07-11,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker, it was a scene out  of an old western movie: The villainous outlaw, realizing his defeat, surrenders in the hot  sun to the valiant lawman. For Texas Ranger  Drew Carter however, there was no mistaking  that  this scenario was not some Hollywood  fantasy, but a dangerous reality. On July 13,  1999, Ranger Carter was waiting, with a knot  in the pit of this stomach, at the center of a  bridge connecting El Paso, TX to Mexico. He  was waiting for true evil to show his face.  This tale begins 2 years earlier when a series of brutal murders occurred  in homes  along  the  railroad  tracks  in Texas. Texans  were paralyzed with  fear by a serial killer  dubbed  the  ‘‘Railroad Killer.’’ He baffled  law  enforcement because it seemed as if he randomly chose his victims and the times of the  attacks, making it impossible to know who and  when he would strike next. He used any  weapon available: a pickax, a sledgehammer,  a tire iron, a shotgun. The only common factor  was that each victim lived by railroad tracks.  Slowly, through cooperation of local, State,  and federal agencies, Angel Resendez Ramirez, an  illegal Mexican  immigrant would be  wanted for the brutal slayings. He was elusive,  slipping back and forth across the U.S./Mexican border more  than a dozen  times, and  evading several FBI arrest traps. It would finally  take  the unyielding efforts of Texas  Ranger Drew Cater to end Ramirez’s violent  reign.  The Texas Rangers are  the most well-  known and respected law enforcement officers  in the WorId, more famous than Scotland Yard  itself. Established in 1823 by Stephen F. Austin, the Rangers were the protectors of new  settlers in the untamed Spanish Province, of  what  is now Texas. They have done battle  with horse  thieves, bank robbers,  ‘‘Indians,’’  outlaws, and were even  instrumental  in  the  U.S.’ success in the Mexican-American War.  Over the next 150 years, the responsibilities of  Texas Rangers grew to include investigations,  fugitive apprehension, and assisting other law  enforcement across the State. They are elite;  there are only 118 commissioned Rangers,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:08 Jul 12, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A11JY8.023 E11JYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o y r r e h c y         ",2006

You have had control  of the House of Representatives, you  control the Supreme Court, you control the United States Senate, you control the White House. What are you  going to do?  Seven million people in America are  unemployed.  There are 46 million Americans that  don’t have health insurance.  The minimum wage hasn’t been increased in nearly a decade. The gap between people who are wealthy and people who are poor is getting wider and  wider.  We have a war in Iraq that has killed  2,500 Americans, 20,000 Americans have  been seriously  injured, and a policy  going in the wrong direction.  You have a failed prescription drug  plan, written by the prescription drug  industry behind closed doors, that is  confusing seniors. It is going to cost  taxpayers $700 billion.  Gasoline is $3 a gallon at the pump.  b1200  Global warming  is threatening our  environment and our health. What are  you going to do? Let’s have a debate  about gay marriage again on the floor  of the House.  We are not going to debate an exit  strategy in Iraq. We don’t have a plan  to lower the cost of gasoline. We don’t  have a plan to provide health care or to  give American seniors the ability to  buy prescription drugs at a low cost in  bulk. Oh, no.

313,House,109,0.523,24,2006-07-18,Mr. BEAUPREZ.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman and thank him  for bringing this amendment to the  floor and managing the time. I also  would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge  the leadership of my colleague from  Colorado  (Mrs. MUSGRAVE)  on  this  issue. She has been a true champion,  not only a champion inside this Chamber, but a champion for the values that  I think a vast majority of Americans  hold dear. For that she has paid what  has already been recognized as a significant personal price. Again, I applaud her and I certainly admire her  character and her tenacity.  Mr. Speaker, this debate seems to be  framed by talking about what we are  against. I think what we ought to be  talking about, frankly, is what we are  for. Too often  in society, especially  these days, it seems like we are against  the very institutions that made this  Nation great.  I see above your head, Mr. Speaker,  the words ‘‘in God we trust,’’ and directly opposite you over my left shoulder is the medallion of the very first  law giver, Moses. We all know where  those laws came from, the very hand of  God.  I think very often about the fact that  we proudly profess that we are founded  on Judeo-Christian principles. I think  it  is  indisputable where those principles come from and what the origin  of those principles is.  I believe that in the very beginning  He created us, yes, all equal. The distinguished minority leader mentioned  that a little bit ago, that we celebrate  the fact that we were all created equal  by our Creator, equal but different, and  for a purpose. He showed us that purpose in the Garden of Eden, Adam and  Eve. He showed us once again, and  blessed that difference, at Cana, as my  friend and colleague from Missouri just  referenced, by Jesus performing his  first miracle by blessing that wedding  feast between a man and a woman.  I think there is a reason why marriage has always been such a sacred institution. I believe some things, some  definitions in our society are absolute.  Up  isn’t down, dark  isn’t daylight,  black isn’t white, fish isn’t fowl, and  marriage, since the beginning of time,  as close as I can tell, has been between  a man and a woman. If it was, indeed,  good enough for our Creator, and it was  indeed our Creator’s plan, that we were  created different for an absolute divine  purpose, I think we best not be messing  with His plan today.  It is important, I will disagree with  my colleague from Missouri in this regard, it is very important that when a  nation is, indeed, founded upon Judeo-  Christian principles that we are willing  to stand and define what we are for,  lest we forget what we are about.  I strongly encourage the adoption of  this amendment.  ",2006

315,House,109,-0.481,45,2006-07-18,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, students are at a much  greater  risk while  traveling  to and  from school than at any other time  during their school day. During the  1997–98 school year, about 800 children  from the ages of 5 through 18 were  killed during normal school transportation hours, while traveling by passenger car, foot, bicycle, public transportation  or  school  bus. Although  school buses are the safest  form of  highway transportation, they are not  fail-safe.  The most  dangerous  part  of  the  school bus ride is getting on and off the  school bus. Fatalities that occur when  students board and exit school buses  account for approximately three times  as many school bus-related fatalities  than for fatalities that occur when the  school buses are occupied. The area  around the bus when the bus is loading  and unloading  is  called  the danger  zone. The danger zone is comprised of  the areas outside of the bus where the  children are in the most danger of not  being seen by the driver. It is the 10  feet in front of the bus where the driver  is too high to see a child, 10-foot-long  blind spots that run along both sides of  the bus, and the area behind the school  bus.  The goal of National School Bus  Safety Week is to ensure safe, efficient,  economical and high-quality transportation for school children on their trips  to and from school and school-related  activities. This is certainly a goal we  all can support, and I urge my colleagues to do so.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
316,House,109,-0.429,59,2006-07-18,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in strong support of this bill, and yield  myself 11⁄2minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I would  first  like to  thank the gentlewoman from Florida  for all of her efforts. I want to especially single out the hard work of my  good friend and colleague from Texas,  SILVESTREREYES, for his steadfast efforts  to help  the Clint  Independent  School District improve the quality of  education for its students.  Mr. Speaker, this bill seeks to correct a technical error  in  legislation  which the 105th Congress passed. That  legislation  should have  relinquished  the Federal Government’s reversionary  interest in a tract of land that is owned  by the Clint Independent School District.  Unfortunately,  the wrong  coordinates for the land were included in the  bill. This bill, H.R. 860, completes the  transfer  of  property  rights  for  the  school district so that it can proceed  with a planned sale of the land.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support H.R. 860.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the author of the bill,  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. REYES).  ",2006
317,House,109,-0.321,59,2006-07-18,Mr. REYES.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my  good friend from New York for yielding  me time, and my good  friend  from  Florida, the gentlewoman, for her support in this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 860, a bill to provide for the  conveyance of reversionary interests of  the United States in certain lands in  my district of El Paso County, Texas  to the Clint Independent School District.  The passage of H.R. 860 comes on the  heels of an interesting footnote in our  history.  In  1940, Clint  Independent  School District received 20 acres of  land that the United States Government  had  obtained  from  Mexico  through the Convention of February 1,  1933.  In the treaty, the two governments  agreed to cooperate in the construction  and maintenance of the Rio Grande  Rectification  Project,  which  ultimately straightened and reinforced 155  miles  of  river  boundary  flowing  through the increasingly developed El  Paso, Texas-Juarez, Chihuahua area.  In addition to helping provide a more  stable  international  boundary,  the  project also helped occasional flooding  in that region. After giving the land to  the school district, the Department of  State retained reversionary interest in  the parcel.  In  1957 Federal  statutes  gave Clint Independent School District  the ability to trade that piece of land  for another, which it did, acquiring a  separate parcel  in which the United  States had also retained reversionary  interest.  Today, Clint Independent School District still owns that one piece of land.  Unfortunately,  because  the  land  in  question lies outside of Clint’s boundaries, district regulations prevent the  school district from developing it.  H.R. 860 will allow Clint to sell its  land in order to buy property within its  own district boundaries. All proceeds  from such a sale must and will be used  for public educational purposes. This  legislation has been approved by the  State Department and reported favorably by the House International Relations Committee. Of the nine school  districts in El Paso County, Clint is  the largest in square mileage, encompassing a diverse area in the fast-growing east El Paso County.  The district itself is one of the most  rapidly expanding in Texas, with an estimated  student population of  9,000-  plus, a figure that is expected to double  within the next 5 years.  All together, the district has 12 campuses, three high schools, two middle  schools, one junior high school and six  elementary schools. This bill will afford Clint the ability to help keep pace  with its growth and help the district  provide its students a high-quality educational experience.  I would like to thank the chairman  and  ranking member of  the House  International  Relations  Committee,  Mr. HYDEof Illinois and Mr. LANTOSof  California, as well as my friend from  New York and my friend from Florida,  for reporting this beneficial piece of  legislation out of their committee.  Mr. Speaker, I would also  like to  thank our leader, Ms. PELOSI, and minority whip, Mr. HOYER for their support and assistance in bringing this bill  to the floor.

318,House,109,0.467,66,2006-07-18,Mrs. SCHMIDT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of S. 3504, the Fetus  Farming Prohibition Act. As my colleagues know, researchers have already  published studies in which cloned animals were grown in utero to harvest  fetal tissue. Some researchers have indicated  that  cells  or  tissues  from  human fetuses are more desirable than  embryonic stem cells.  It is morally shocking to think that  someone would  engage  in  so-called  ‘‘fetus farming’’ of a human embryonic  embryo. It is essential that Congress  act today and pass the Fetus Farming  Prohibition Act to prevent and prohibit such gruesome research from ever  being  performed  on  a  developing  human child.  Congress has a moral obligation to  protect women and the unborn, and I  urge my colleagues to support S. 3504  to do just that.  ",2006
319,House,109,0.299,73,2006-07-18,Mr. OSBORNE.," Mr. Speaker, many of  us have been impacted, directly or indirectly, by diseases like juvenile diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Lou  Gehrig’s disease, and so on.  I have  friends, as many people here do, who  have had these diseases, and my heart  goes out to these families. And on the  other hand, many oppose embryonic  stem cell research because they see the  embryo as a human life, which I do as  well.  So where do we go with this? I mean  on the one hand we are going to create  a huge problem for those who believe in  life beginning at conception, and we  have a desire to also help people who  need the stem cell research that think  that these are the solutions. So I would  differ with some of my friends here, in  that the British have done more than  2,000 replications where they have extracted stem cells without destroying  the embryo. It has been done. This is  not something that has never occurred  before. This is not pie in the sky. This  is a very real possibility to resolve this  dilemma: Are you going to try to preserve human life, as many of us who  are pro-life see it, and also have stem  cell research? The Senate saw it 100–0.  So why over here now, in order to pass  a particular bill, are we trying to destroy this bill? It makes no sense to  me.  So with that, I certainly urge passage of Senate 2754.  ",2006
320,House,109,0.402,80,2006-07-18,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  with my  colleagues  from Arkansas  today. The State of Arkansas has lost  one of its greatest citizens and role  models this week. Lieutenant Governor  Win Rockefeller dedicated his life to  public service and to the people of our  State.  As Lieutenant Governor, Governor  Rockefeller focused on economic development, education and literacy. Let me  give you just an example of the many  great  contributions  that Lieutenant  Governor Rockefeller made, not just as  an elected official, but as a citizen. The  Lieutenant Governor created a program  called  ‘‘Books  in  the Attic’’  where Boy Scouts collected used children’s books  to distribute  to needy  families. This was a little thing, but  Lieutenant Governor Rockefeller was  always willing to use his resources to  do  good,  but more  importantly he  wanted to get other people involved in  doing good as well.  The passing of Lieutenant Governor  Rockefeller is a great loss for the State  of Arkansas. We will all be grateful  that he chose to make Arkansas his  home. Our hearts and prayers go out to  his family and friends who loved him so  much.  f  HONORING WIN ROCKEFELLER  (Mr. BERRY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

324,House,109,0.223,15,2006-07-25,Mr. REICHERT.," Mr. Speaker, I am  proud to rise in support as a sponsor of  H.R. 5852, the 21st Century Emergency  Communications Act of 2006. Although  I appreciate the comments from the  gentleman from Michigan, I would like  to first address before I get into my  formal  statement  some of his comments.  There have been  several hearings,  four hearings and a joint hearing, held  on the  issue of  interoperability and  operability under the umbrella of the  Homeland Security Committee  and,  more specifically, through the Emergency  Preparedness  Subcommittee  that I chair.  I have only been  in Congress  18  months. I was a police officer for 33  years. The last 8 years of that I was the  sheriff. So I know a little bit about  interoperability.  I know a  little bit  about the inability for police officers  to communicate. I know a little bit  about life and death, and the ability to  be in touch with your communications  center or not to be in touch with your  communications center, or not to have  a partner present, or wait for a partner  when you are facing someone with a  gun. And I understand, too, the gentleman from Michigan has some experience in law enforcement and hopefully  understands  the  importance of  this  bill.  I would also like to point out that between 2003 and 2005, $2 billion have  been spent by the Federal Government  across this Nation for interoperability  without any national plan, without any  national standards. And that is what  this bill addresses today, and that is  why  it  is so  important  for  first responders across this country.  So there have been hearings. And not  only have  there been hearings, but  these hearings have been held with people in attendance like firefighters, police officers, emergency management,  people on the ground, people doing the  job. We are not just hearing from politicians and mayors and CEOs of police  departments and sheriff’s offices, we  are hearing from cops and firefighters,  and they are supporting this bill 110  percent.  So,  I would  like  to  thank Mr.  PASCRELL, my ranking member on my  subcommittee, and  I would  like  to  thank Mr. THOMPSON,  the  ranking  member of the full committee, and all  those who serve on both committees,  the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Science and Technology and  the  full  Homeland  Security  Committee, who supported this bill.  When people look at Congress, they  say what are we doing? Why are we not  working together? On this particular  issue, we did work together. This was a  combined effort, this was a team effort,  and it was congenial and it was an effort that was well respected by every  member and every staff member on  both the subcommittee and the committee.  Protecting our Nation should never  be an issue where Democrats and Republicans cannot come together and  recognize the need for our cooperation,  especially on behalf of our  first responders to ensure that our communities stay safe.

325,House,109,-0.334,71,2006-07-25,Mr. ISRAEL.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Promoting Transparency in  Financial Reporting Act, and I want to  thank my very good friend from Kentucky (Mr. DAVIS) for introducing this  important measure. I was pleased to  cosponsor it and I am very pleased to  work with him on the bill.  I also want to thank the chairman  and ranking member of the Financial  Services Committee, Mr. OXLEY and  Mr. FRANK, for bringing this bipartisan  legislation to the floor today.  H.R.  5024  requires  that  the chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange  Commission, the Financial Accounting  Standards Board, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board provide oral testimony to the Committee  on Financial Services on their efforts  to reduce the complexity in financial  reporting to provide more accurate and  clear  financial  information to  investors. These  appearances  before  the  committee would begin in 2007 and continue annually for 5 years.  Madam Speaker, the ability of America’s investors to make informed decisions is severely compromised when financial reporting is inaccurate, when  it is incomplete, when it is unclear. We  saw the consequences of bad financial  reporting years ago during the corporate  accountability  scandals  at  Enron and WorldCom, among others.  Those bankruptcies not only revealed  weaknesses in many aspects of our financial reporting system, but showed  the devastating financial impact when  their financial statements are not held  to the highest standards.  In many cases, the complexity of financial  reporting  requirements  has  made it very difficult to detect purposeful violations of those standards.  Congress, regulators, and the industry  assessed these financial reporting failures and reacted with efforts aimed at  strengthening the financial reporting  system. Sarbanes-Oxley made very important initial strides to this end; however, more needs to be done.  This measure is an important next  step. By calling on the SEC, PCAOB,  and FASB to testify each year on the  steps they are taking to improve financial disclosures, Congress is ensuring  that it can and will effectively carry  out  its oversight  function. We  can  gather the necessary  information to  ensure that, should we need to act legislatively, we are doing it in a sober,  thoughtful manner based on data rather than in haste as we respond to the  latest news cycle.  Madam Speaker, this legislation will  help us as we work with the FEC,  FASB and the PCAOB to improve our  financial reporting system. It is important that we maintain a consistent  focus on this issue. And, to that end, I  urge all of my colleagues to support  the measure. Again, I was pleased to  work closely with the gentleman from  Kentucky.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2006

327,House,109,0.277,71,2006-07-25,Mr. KUHL of New York.," Madam  Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5013) to amend  the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief  and Emergency Assistance Act to prohibit the confiscation of firearms during certain national emergencies, as  amended.  The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 5013  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006’’.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  Congress finds the following:  (1) The Second Amendment to the Constitution states that a ‘‘well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free  State, the right of the people to keep and  bear arms, shall not be infringed’’, and Congress has  repeatedly  recognized  this  language as protecting an individual right.  (2) In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, State  and local law enforcement and public safety  service organizations were overwhelmed and  could not fulfill the safety needs of the citizens of the State of Louisiana.  (3) In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the  safety of these citizens, and of their homes  and property, was threatened by instances of  criminal activity.  (4) Many of these citizens lawfully kept  firearms for the safety of themselves, their  loved ones, their businesses, and their property, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment, and used their firearms, individually  or in concert with their neighbors, for protection against crime.  (5) In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, certain agencies confiscated the  firearms of  these citizens in contravention of the Second  Amendment, depriving these citizens of the  right to keep and bear arms and rendering  them helpless against criminal activity.  (6) These confiscations were carried out at  gunpoint by nonconsensual entries into private homes, by traffic checkpoints, by stoppage of boats, and otherwise by force.  (7) The citizens from whom firearms were  confiscated were either in their own homes  or attempting to flee the flooding and devastation by means of motor vehicle or boat,  and were accosted, stopped, and arbitrarily  deprived of their private property and means  of protection.  (8) The means by which the confiscations  were carried out, which included intrusion  into the home, temporary detention of persons, and seizures of property, constituted  unreasonable searches and seizures and deprived these citizens of liberty and property  without due process of law in violation of  fundamental rights under the Constitution.  (9) Many citizens who took temporary refuge in emergency housing were prohibited  from storing firearms on the premises, and  were thus treated as second-class citizens  who had forfeited their constitutional right  to keep and bear arms.  (10) At least one highly-qualified search  and rescue team was prevented from joining  in relief efforts because the team included  individuals with firearms, although these individuals had been deputized as Federal law  enforcement officers.  (11) These confiscations and prohibitions,  and the means by which they were carried  out, deprived the citizens of Louisiana not  only of their right to keep and bear arms,  but also of their rights to personal security,  personal liberty, and private property, all in  violation of the Constitution and laws of the  United States.  SEC.  3. PROHIBITION ON CONFISCATION OF  FIREARMS  DURING  CERTAIN  NATIONAL EMERGENCIES.  Title VII of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster  Relief and Emergency Assistance Act  (42  U.S.C. 5201) is amended by adding at the end  the following:  ‘‘SEC. 706.

The Clerk read as follows:  H. CON. RES. 145  Whereas there are over 57 million adult cyclists in the United States;  Whereas it is estimated that 100 million  United States citizens of all ages cycle each  year;  Whereas 5 million United States citizens  commute by bicycle to work;  Whereas  the bicycle  industry generates  more than $5 billion dollars a year and is an  important part of the economy of the United  States;  Whereas recreational cycling is a safe, low-  impact, aerobic activity for all ages;  Whereas when an individual cycles as a  form of regular exercise, the health of the individual may be increased;  Whereas a national bike month would provide an opportunity to educate United States  citizens about  the  importance of bicycle  safety and the health benefits of cycling;  Whereas most communities in the United  States officially recognize May 20th as Bike  to Work Day; and  Whereas the month of May has officially  been celebrated as National Bike Month by  the League of American Bicyclists and the  majority of the international cycling community since 1956: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved by the House of Representatives (the  Senate concurring), That it is the sense of  Congress that—  (1) United States citizens should observe a  national bike month to educate citizens of  the United States about the importance of  bicycle  safety and  the health,  transportation, recreational, and environmental benefits derived from cycling;  (2) health and transportation professionals  and organizations should promote bicycle  safety and the benefits of cycling; and  (3) United States citizens should salute the  more than 57 million cyclists in the United  States and the national and community organizations, individuals, volunteers, and professionals associated with cycling for promoting bicycle safety and the benefits of cycling.

330,House,109,0.103,85,2006-07-25,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, I have  to start with a confession. And here is  the confession: Bob Feller is one of my  heroes.  I say that unabashedly. It is not because to me as the ultimate baseball  junkie I appreciate the great game and  the great players; it is not just because  baseball’s mecca, the Baseball Hall of  Fame, is the epicenter of my district.  No, I appreciate and applaud Bob Feller  for all the things he has done on the diamond, but he is one of my heroes because of the person that he is, the guy  inside.  I have been privileged to get to know  Bob Feller quite well over the last several years. As a matter of fact, Memorial Day 2002, when the Baseball Hall of  Fame announced the policy that forevermore all veterans would be admitted free into that shrine, the mecca of  baseball, they had a special ceremony  to recognize the greats of the game  who served in the military when the  Nation needed them most. And it was  my high honor to present Bob Feller’s  submission.  b1615  There is there in the Hall of Fame  this plaque, a great big plaque with  some of the greats of the game, Ralph  Kiner, Warren Spahn, Phil Rizzuto, all  people who served in time of the Nation’s need. But the one that got the  most attention was Bob Feller. And I  will tell you this, think about the dynamics. In 1941, 23-year-old ace of the  Cleveland Indian staff, he won 23 games  that year. His record was 23–15. What  would that command in today’s market? He would have 14 agents and he  would have a gillion dollars’ worth of  offers  from every club  in the major  leagues because pitching is such a premium. So this ace, this admittedly acknowledged one of the best in the business anywhere, 2 days after Pearl Harbor, became the first member of Major  League Baseball to pack his belongings  and sign up  for his Nation. And he  served with great distinction all during  the war, World War  II,  in the U.S.  Navy. And when he came back, he resumed his career. You know the rest of  the story, so many of my colleagues  have said it so well. He was just absolutely a breathtaking talent on the  mound.  Mr. GINGREY reported on his father-  in-law mesmerized by what he saw. He  was just wonderful. But that typifies  the inner man. He is wonderful every  single day of his life, in his personal  life, and I am privileged to salute Bob  Feller and his very fine partner, his  wife Ann. They are truly great Americans.  ",2006
331,House,109,0.141,85,2006-07-25,Mr. LEACH.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding, and I thank the  gentleman particularly for bringing a  resolution about this son of Iowa.  I might  just mention, Bob Feller  comes from a small county west of Des  Moines called Dallas County. My family was originally  from this county.  This county produced a series of very  fine athletes in a given era. One was  our State’s great hero, a Heisman trophy winner  by  the  name  of Nile  Kinnick who lost his life in World War  II. Another was a first cousin of Bob  Feller’s named Hal Manders. Hal also  pitched major league baseball.  A number of years ago, Bob and Hal  visited me here in Washington, and Hal  gave me a small gift that I will treasure for the rest of my life. It was a picture of Bob Feller and Hal as ballplayers at about the age of 12, and they  were oversized kids on a small team,  and across the uniform was marked, I  believe, the Braves. And I asked Bob  Feller, what was the background of  this little league team? And Bob said,  you know, we lived kind of in the country, we didn’t have a team, so our two  fathers who were brothers-in-law started this team. And I said to Bob, well,  what would have happened if your father and your uncle didn’t start this  team? And he said, well, I never would  have pitched ball again.  And it is kind of a beautiful story for  all of us, because what he was saying  was that Bob Feller would not be Bob  Feller if he didn’t have a father who  dedicated some time to starting a little  league baseball team. And that is really the American system, the American  dream, the American family. I think  we give honor to Bob because we give  honor not just to a great athlete, but  to the idea of sport and to the idea and  the  ideals of American competition,  which he has always reflected the best  of. I thank you, Steve, for this moment.  ",2006
332,House,109,-0.297,127,2006-07-25,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my friend for yielding. I rise in support  of his motion.  I want to try to explain, Mr. Speaker,  to our  colleagues what one of  the  issues in Mr. MILLER’s motion has to  do with.  Let’s assume that we have a pension  plan that is only 75 percent funded;  that is to say, it has $75 for every $100  that it needs to meet its pension obligations. Under the bill that passed the  House, the people that run that plan  could say the following: The CEO of the  company could continue to get 100 percent of the benefits that he was entitled to under the plan, the wealthiest  person in the company. But the person  who cleans his office at night could  have her pension cut.  Let me say this again. If the plan had  $75 for every $100 that it needs, under  the provision the House passed, the  CEO of the company gets every nickel  that he is entitled to. No cut at all.  But the custodian who cleans his office  at night, or the clerk who types his letters, or the person who delivers his  documents, could have their pension  cut considerably.  Now, this is not right. This is not  right. If some employees are going to  take a cut in their pension, then it  seems fair that everyone should share  equally in that punishment.  One of the great principles of the  American economy is that a rising tide  lifts all boats. When a company prospers, so does everyone in the rank and  file, so does every shareholder, so does  every investor, one would hope. And  lots of decisions are predicated upon  that principle.  We want the executives to flourish  and prosper, because if they do, they  will make better decisions for the people who clean the offices and type the  letters and deliver the documents.  But the corollary to that principle is,  if the boat is sinking, then some people  can’t jump off the boat into a life boat  while everybody else stands there as  the ship goes down. That seems rather  fair.  One might call this the Titanic principle, you know, where the people who  were in the luxury compartments got  to the life boats first, but the people  locked in steerage sank to the bottom  of the Atlantic Ocean.  The Senate has a very different provision. Ninety-seven senators voted in  favor of this provision; and it said, very  simply, the same rule that applies to  the lady who cleans the office at night  should apply to the CEO who sits in the  office all day long. Ninety-Seven senators voted in favor of that provision.  Two voted against it.  Mr. MILLER’s motion wisely says that  this House should go on record as saying that is the provision we ought to  adopt. Vote ‘‘yes.’’  ",2006

On  May  15,  the State Department designated Venezuela as not cooperating  fully with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts.  Mr. Speaker, from what we heard from  the Department officials, it is not that  Venezuela is not cooperating fully; it is  that Venezuela is not cooperating at  all.  Disconcerting was the testimony we  heard from the State Department that  Venezuelan passports  can be  forged  with child-like ease, and that the U.S.  is detaining at our borders an increasing number of third-country aliens carrying false Venezuelan documents. According to a 2003 U.S. News report,  thousands of Venezuelan identity documents are being distributed  to  foreigners from Middle Eastern nations,  including Syria, Pakistan, Egypt and  Lebanon.  We know that travel documents are  as important as weapons for terrorists.

I found what you just went  over with your numbers very  interesting, because in coming here tonight  to talk about the economy and the  very good news of what America is facing with the growth in our economy because of the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, I  wanted to share with you that there  was an excellent article in The Wall  Street Journal today, and it went right  along the same path of what you just  said.  That article started out by saying  that John F. Kennedy believed that an  economy hampered by restrictive tax  rates will never produce enough revenue to balance our budget, just as it  will never  produce  enough  jobs  or  enough profits.  In those days, when the Kennedy tax  cuts were passed, 80 percent of Democratic Senators and Representatives  voted for those Kennedy tax cuts. But  the article goes on to point out that in  2003, when these most recent tax cuts  were passed, only 7 of 205 Democrat  Representatives voted  for  those  tax  cuts. And, more than that, the editorials across the Nation went on to  call the tax cuts economically unsound  and claimed they would increase the  deficits by hundreds of billions of dollars and said they were unlikely to  stimulate the wallowing economy.  What we have seen is absolutely the  opposite of that.

337,Senate,109,0.508,197,2006-07-25,Mr. ENSIGN.," Mr. President, the Senator from California said twice today  that this bill protects a  father who  commits incest with his daughter. In  other words, he can commit a crime  and still take her across State lines to  get an abortion.  That  argument  is  illogical. Obviously, a father is a parent. In a State  with a parental consent law, he is a  parent with rights under State law. If  he wants his daughter to have an abortion, to cover up his own crime, he can  freely give his consent to allow his  daughter to have the abortion in their  State of residence. That father doesn’t  have to take his daughter across State  lines. As a result, this bill does not affect such an outcome one way or the  other. His abuse of his daughter in that  situation is not only morally wrong, it  is illegal. This bill doesn’t affect that  situation one way or another. So to say  we are protecting a father’s right to go  across State lines—it is an argument,  frankly, that just doesn’t hold water. It  just doesn’t. This bill doesn’t have anything to do with what the Senator was  saying.  Let’s just talk about what the bill  does.

338,Senate,109,0.494,218,2006-07-25,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President.  I  rise  today  in support of  legislation protecting the most important relationship of all: that of parents and their  children. The  family  is  the  fundamental,  crucial  and  indispensable  building block of our civilization, and  parents are at its center. Yet, when it  comes to one of the most important decisions in life, children are being kept  from the guidance of their parents. I  am talking, of course, about the decision whether or not to have an abortion.  The American people believe  that  parents should be involved in deciding  whether their daughter should undergo  an  abortion. Statistics  consistently  show this, and the Supreme Court has  upheld this. As the Court noted in the  decision of H.L. v. Matheson: ‘‘the medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious  and can be lasting; this is particularly  so when the patient is immature.’’ In  the case of Parham V. J.R. the Court  said ‘‘[t]he law’s concept of the family  rests on a presumption that parents  possess what a child lacks in maturity,  experience, and capacity for judgment  required for making life’s difficult decisions.’’  Convinced of the soundness of this  reasoning, at least 48 States have enacted laws requiring consent of or notification to at least one parent, or authorization by a judge, before a minor  can obtain an abortion. Unfortunately,  this wise policy is being undermined.  Thousands of children every year are  taken across State  lines by people  other than their parents to secure secret abortions. As we speak, abortion  providers across the Nation, operating  in States with no parental consent or  notification laws, are taking out advertisements in phonebooks outside of the  State where they operate in order to  attract underage patients  in neighboring States with different laws. They  are doing this in my home State of  Idaho. They are doing this in Pennsylvania, blatantly trumpeting the  fact  that their clinics, outside of Pennsylvania, do not require parental notification as Pennsylvania does. In essence,  these abortion providers are encouraging people to circumvent one State’s  parental notification law by crossing  the border into another for a secret  abortion.  The tragedy is that thousands of non-  related  adults  take  this  suggestion  every year in successful attempts to  circumvent the law. In one highly publicized case, a 12-year-old girl living in  a State with a constitutionally upheld  parental notification law became pregnant by an 18-year-old man. The man’s  mother took her for an abortion in a  neighboring State with no parental notification requirement. The mother’s  actions were discovered, and she was  convicted of interfering with the custody  of  a  child.  A  prominent  proabortion legal defense organization  appealed the conviction on the grounds  that she merely ‘‘assisted a woman to  exercise her constitutional rights’’ and  as  such was herself protected  from  prosecution by the Constitution. This  reasoning cannot stand.  To say that, because the Court in Roe  v. Wade declared most abortions constitutionally protected during the first  trimester, that therefore minors have  an absolute right to abortion without  so much as notifying their parents, and  that third parties—whatever their motives—have the right to transport them  across State lines for a secret abortion,  is to stand constitutional protections  on their head. It is to strip children of  the natural protection of their parents.  There is hardly another circumstance  warranting the need for parental guidance and judgment more than when a  young daughter becomes pregnant and  is considering an abortion. For  the  sake of our children and our families,  this must stop. As a Nation, we loosen  our precious family ties at our peril.  I must also note that Idaho is unable  to enforce parental notification and  consent  laws  that have passed  the  State legislature and have been signed  into law by the Governor. Nearly 20  other States are in the same situation.  These laws are all enjoined due to lawsuits brought by organizations intent  on  imposing  their  flawed  understanding of the United States Constitutional protections on  the American  people, and judges willing to support it.  It is my hope that this litigation will  be resolved and that the right of elected officials to make and enforce laws  under their jurisdiction will be upheld.  I strongly support and am cosponsoring the Child Custody Protection  Act. Children must  receive parental  consent for even minor surgical procedures. Children must receive parental  consent to take an asprin from their  school nurse. I want to make it a Federal offense to transport a minor across  State lines with intent to avoid the application of a State law requiring parental involvement in a minor’s abortion, or judicial waiver of such a requirement.

As  we honor the 53rd anniversary of the  Korean War Armistice, I am proud to  reintroduce this legislation recognizing  Korean War Armistice Day. The Korean War Veterans Recognition Act of  2006 would  include National Korean  War Veterans Armistice Day among  the  days when  the American  flag  should especially be displayed. Earlier  this year, Representative SUEKELLY  reintroduced  similar  legislation  into  the House.  National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day is July 27, which recognizes  that negotiators signed an armistice  agreement at Panmunjom on July 27,  1953. This led to North Korea’s withdrawal across the 38th parallel and allowed the Republic of South Korea to  be free from attempts to force communism upon its people.  This year, as we commemorate the  53rd anniversary of the signing of the  Korean War Armistice, it is important  that we take a moment to reflect upon  the sacrifices our men and women of  the U.S. Armed Forces have made in  brave service to our Nation since its inception. I am pleased to introduce this  legislation to respectfully honor and  pay tribute to the tremendous courage  and sacrifice demonstrated by the men  and women who served in the Korean  war. As U.S. soldiers continue to fight  for freedom around the world, we must  remember the sacrifice and valor of  their brethren who helped protect and  promote American values on the Korean peninsula over a half century ago.  f  CELEBRATE AMERICA CREATIVE  WRITING CONTEST  ",2006

341,,109,-0.53,246,2006-07-25,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the University of Wisconsin, the  Political Science Department, and the student  participants on the creation and completion of  the first annual UW Summer Washington Program. This  invaluable opportunity was made  possible by the generous support of many UW  alumni.  The 15 undergraduate students were selected through a competitive application process and are  interning  in various offices on  Capitol Hill. They are gaining experience  in  legislative offices, lobbying firms, the Department of Justice, and several foreign policy offices, while also participating  in a Political  Science course. Guest speakers and hosts, all  of whom are UW alumni, have been in attendance at each class session offering priceless  and practical advice to the students.  This program would not have been possible  without  the support of  the Wisconsin alumni  who have helped in funding, organizing social  events, and speaking  to  the class. The UW  Foundation, in collaboration with the Department of Political Science, has worked with  alumni to get this program off the ground in  hopes that it will be available to future undergraduate students. The goal of this program is  to establish a permanent presence for the University of Wisconsin in Washington, DC.  I am proud to rise today to pay tribute to the  establishment of this exceptional opportunity.  It is truly an honor for me to represent the students, the alumni, and the University of Wisconsin on  this occasion, and wish  them  the  best of luck in the successful continuation of  this important program.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE GRAND CANYON  CHAPTER  OF  THE  AMERICAN  RED CROSS  HON.

342,,109,0.559,246,2006-07-25,Mr. HAYWORTH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in honor and recognition of the Grand Canyon  Chapter of the American Red Cross as they  celebrate 90 years of service in Arizona.  Since 1916, the American Red Cross Grand  Canyon Chapter, headquartered in Phoenix, is  where the people of Arizona come together to  help one another. The passionate volunteers  and staff who make up  the Grand Canyon  Chapter provide care, comfort and lifesaving  skills to millions of people in Arizona. Volunteers serve their neighbors throughout the 10  counties in the northern two-thirds of Arizona,  a population of 4.5 million.  Arizonans benefit  from programs  that provide meaningful assistance and lift the spirit of  individuals and  families  throughout our communities. The chapter  is a  leader  in water  safety  instruction.  I am particularly proud of  their ‘‘Water Whiz Kids’’ program, which teaches backyard pool safety to children and also  provides infant and child CPR training to their  parents.  Within my district, the Grand Canyon Chapter is there when a disaster strikes thousands,  and when it strikes only one. In May of this  year,  in  the wake of  the Tradewinds Apartment fire in Mesa, Red Cross volunteers assisted 34 families, served 400 meals, and distributed 125 comfort kits. Another local emergency response was the Cave Creek Complex  Fire last year where 36 Red Cross volunteers  opened a shelter and provided 23 residents  with meals and comfort kits.  The American Red Cross Grand Canyon  Chapter has also played an instrumental role  in assisting after national disasters outside Arizona, including Hurricane Katrina. Last year,  over 100 Red Cross volunteers from Arizona  deployed to the gulf voast to help with the disaster response. The Grand Canyon Chapter  also operated a national call center  for disaster victims throughout the country. Impressively, with only 30 hours advance notice, the  Chapter organized ‘‘Operation Good Neighbor  Shelter’’ at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, helping more  than 1,000 Hurricane  Katrina evacuees in our State last year. These  evacuees were displaced and relocated from  the gulf coast, suddenly  finding  themselves  hundreds of miles from their homes, yet upon  their arrival,  they were  the recipients of  the  warm ‘‘compassion in action’’ that exemplifies  the Red Cross volunteer and the spirit of Arizonans: good neighbors helping new neighbors during drastic times.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me  to honor and  recognize  the American Red  Cross Grand Canyon Chapter on  its 90th  birthday. With congratulations and gratitude for  the excellent work they do to enrich our lives,  I am pleased to recognize their service to our  communities throughout the great State of Arizona.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

347,,109,-0.631,267,2006-07-25,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, it gives me great  pleasure to introduce the AmeriCare Health Insurance Act of 2006. I am joined by the AFL-  CIO, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the  American Nurses Association, the Center for  Medicare Advocacy, Consumers’ Union, Families USA, SEIU, the Universal Health Care Action Network, and the National Association of  Community Health Centers in supporting this  common sense solution to achieve universal  health insurance coverage.  In my tenure in the House, I have been involved in many discussions about how to reform our health system. These debates tend  to occur every 10  to 15 years when health  costs rise to a level that attracts our attention.  Unfortunately, the minor tweaks and threats of  reform we have made in the past have not resulted in lasting change. As a result, we are  spending more—and getting  less—than any  industrialized nation.  If history is any guide, we are nearing yet  another health reform discussion in this country. This time, we need to get it right. To that  end I offer AmeriCare—a practical proposal to  ensure that everyone has affordable health insurance.  AmeriCare  is based on  the principles  that  the U.S. health system should cover everyone,  be affordable, and be meaningful.  Eighty percent of  the people who  file  for  bankruptcy because of medical bills have  health  insurance, but  their benefits do not  meet  their  needs.  Policies  that  are  unaffordable,  that  discourage  people  from  seeking care, or that do not cover necessary  benefits are empty solutions.  AmeriCare builds on what works—both employer coverage and Medicare—in an effort to  dramatically expand coverage with minimal  disruption to the current system. It addresses  the broader issues in our health system overall, and provides an important marker for a renewed discussion on health reform.  For the past four decades since it was enacted,  the stability and affordability of Medicare have helped millions of seniors and people with disabilities live longer, healthier lives.  Because of Medicare, families have been able  to save  for  their children’s education  rather  than having  to pay  for  their parents’ health  care.  Since  the program began, Medicare’s per  capita costs have grown at a slower rate than  private health  insurance or  the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.  Providers,  too, have benefited  from Medicare. Without Medicare as a consistent payer,  providers would not be able to offer the top  quality care  they deliver  today.  Indeed, uncompensated care  for people who are uninsured or underinsured is pushing some providers toward the breaking point. Meaningful  coverage for all makes good business sense  for providers.  AmeriCare also  recognizes  the  important  role that job-based benefits play in our current  health  system.  Under  AmeriCare,  people  would  continue  to  obtain  health  coverage  through  their employer—as most of us currently do—or they would be covered under the  new AmeriCare system. Expanding insurance  coverage to all will end the cost shifting that  results from the high number of uninsured we  have today. This could reduce premiums for  job-based insurance by as much as $1,000 for  family coverage, according to the Institute of  Medicine.  Expanding coverage to all will also strengthen the economy and improve our competitiveness. General Motors  recently admitted  it  spends more on health care  than on steel;  Starbucks spends more on health  insurance  than on coffee. The need to address health reform is more urgent than ever before.  AmeriCare is a sensible solution for our Nation’s employers—many of whom are already  meeting the challenge of providing coverage  for their employees. I plan to reach out to the  business community to begin a dialogue about  how we might move forward with AmeriCare.  AmeriCare creates a new Title XXII in the  Social Security Act. It uses Medicare’s existing  administrative  infrastructure,  but  improves  upon Medicare’s benefits to address some of  the current gaps in coverage, such as mental  health parity, coverage for children, and family  planning and pregnancy-related services  for  women. State Medicaid programs would  remain  responsible  for  long-term  care,  but  AmeriCare would now cover low-income children, women, and others who currently  receive non-long term care services under Medicaid.  AmeriCare  is  financed  through premiums,  paid 20 percent by  individuals and  families  and 80 percent by employers, general revenues, and state  funds. People with  incomes  under 200 percent of poverty would be fully  subsidized, and premiums and cost-sharing  would be phased in for those with incomes between 200–300 percent of poverty.  There  is also a  limitation on out-of-pocket  spending to ensure that no one spends a disproportionate share of their income on health  care. Employers could continue to offer their  own coverage, so long as it is equivalent to  AmeriCare. Payment of premiums would be  reconciled at the annual tax filing in April.  Everyone in the room should be aware that  there  is an effort underway  to  reform our  health system, but not in the way we would  like. Republicans have been pursuing stealth  reform for the past decade in their dogged determination  to dismantle  the employer-based  system and force everyone into high deductible health plans, regardless of whether they  open or benefit  from a Health Savings Account.  Their rhetoric makes it sound like you ‘‘own’’  your health care. But what they really mean is  that you are on your own. It’s not just that you  have  to  fend  for yourself when purchasing  health care, it’s that for most people—especially the currently uninsured—the Health Savings Account is purely theoretical. Employers  don’t have  to contribute  to  these accounts,  and most don’t.  The Republican agenda expands the class  of people who are underinsured, putting both  patients and providers at greater risk. More  and more doctors and hospitals are being  forced to act as bill collectors rather than care  providers, and patients are saddled with debt  and even bankruptcy because their insurance  benefits are  inadequate. For example, many  high deductible policies do not cover maternity  benefits. The situation will only get worse if we  continue to allow high-deductible health plans  to take hold.  Without  the security of a universal health  plan  that covers everyone, each of us  is at  risk. For years we have accepted that people  fall through the cracks in our health system.  No parent should ever have to deny their child  a lifesaving treatment because they cannot afford  the cost. No  family should ever  lose a  parent because their condition was treated too  late.  We need a strong alternative vision  for  health  reform. That  is why  I  am  putting  AmeriCare forward today. This proposal promotes shared risk and responsibility, not individual  risk  and  greater  fragmentation.  AmeriCare offers an alternative vision that is  simple and straightforward, fair and manageable.  Our Nation is at a crossroads. Our legacy  should be a future where our children are not  saddled with debt, where they do not fear financial  ruin due  to an  illness. Whether we  build a healthy future for our children or not  depends upon the decisions we make today.  True compassion means offering  real solutions, not empty promises.  Working together, applying common sense  approaches that build on what works, we can  ensure that no-one risks the loss of insurance  coverage. All we need is the will to do it.

As Rudy’s close friends  have noted: ‘‘He truly personified the  American Dream.’’ Having grown up in  an orphanage without any formation  education, Rudy decided at an early  age to chase his dream of owning and  operating his own restaurant a dream  that went hand in hand with his great  love of cooking.  At the age of 21, he opened his first  establishment, Garcia’s Casita on the  West Side of the city, becoming St.  Paul’s  first  Latino  businessowner.  Through a combination of Rudy’s personality  and  commonsense  business  practices, he was able to grow Garcia’s  Casita into a string of six different St.  Paul eating establishments during the  1990s. From steakhouses to nightclubs,  Rudy’s  perseverance  continually  led  him to success even in the face of several failures and a St. Paul that was  still on the edge of revitalization.  Rick Aguilar, a St. Paul businessman  and longtime friend, described Rudy as  ‘‘a man with a million ideas’’ whose energy helped him roll with the punches  and make his dreams a reality. Rudy  continued to stay the course as both he  and St. Paul grew alongside each other  through the years. In 1994, while serving as the mayor of St. Paul, I had the  distinct privilege of proclaiming a day  in his honor. While the St. Paul community mourns Rudy’s  passing, we  can’t help but celebrate his life that  should serve as a model for not only  Latinos, but all Americans who are  looking to make their dreams a reality.  The St. Paul area and I will sincerely  miss Garcia’s great commitment to our  community. Whether it was his work  in the restaurant business or his participation in the early 1960s band the  Jaymars a popular area band  that  played a mix of jazz, rock ‘n’ roll and  blues—Garcia’s impact on St. Paul is  immeasurable.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO LYN MCCLELLAND  ∑",2006

Rabbi Rader’s historic prayer,  the  second  opening prayer led by a female Rabbi in the  history of  the House of Representative represents a significant moment for the American  Jewish community. Rabbi Rader, an Associate  Rabbi at Temple B’nai Torah in Boca Raton is  a prominent and proud member of the South  Florida Jewish community. Whether directing  the B’nai Mitzvah Program, or coordinating the  Judaic curriculum of the Early Childhood Center, Rabbi Rader’s dedication to her congregation and community makes her an extremely  worthy choice to lead this morning’s prayer.  Rabbi Rader enjoys increased prominence  in the Conservative movement and was a recipient of the prestigious Rabbi Simon Greenberg Rabbinic Leadership Award by the Jewish Theological Seminary. She was admitted  to the innovative rabbinic leadership development program, Professional Education and Excellence for Rabbis, which is sponsored by the  Synagogue Transformation and Renewal.  Rabbi Rader studied at the Schechter Institute of Judaic Studies in Jerusalem and the  University of Judaism in Los Angeles, and was  ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary  of America in New York City in 1999. Rabbi  Rader also serve as the rabbi for the Lakeland  Hills Jewish Center in Ringwood, New Jersey,  was a fellow at the National Jewish Healing  Center  in New York City, and was  the  first  Jewish chaplain at Methodist Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota, her hometown.  I am pleased  to recognize Rabbi Rader’s  husband, Kevin, and their four children: Caleb,  Ruby, Yael and Ezra.

352,,109,-0.395,19,2006-09-15,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of the Humboldt Bay  Municipal Water District. Since 1955, residents  and businesses of the Humboldt Bay and beyond have benefited from this well-organized  and superbly run service that has grown and  developed  to meet  the needs of Humboldt  County.  The Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District  has emphasized close and positive relationships with  the municipal customers who deliver water to residents of the Humboldt Bay,  and with industrial customers in the area. By  concentrating  on  these  relationships,  they  have  consistently delivered a highly-valued  standard of service to my constituents.  Mr. Speaker,  the Humboldt Bay Municipal  Water District was founded on the basis of an  elective  referendum on March 13, 1956.  It  began operations in 1961 with services to the  Cities of Eureka and Arcata, and to the Georgia Pacific Lumber Mill, still  in operation as  Evergreen Pulp, Inc. Over the following decade, 5 other municipal services districts joined  the HBMWD. The presence of a steady supply  of water  facilitated  the development of  the  pulp  industry  in Humboldt County and has  made possible  the productive use of wood  waste generated by the lumber industry.  Mr. Speaker, many people have been important to the long-term success of the Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District, but none  have matched  the vital contributions of Mr.  John Winzler. Mr. Winzler has worked on the  project since 1961, and as District Engineer  has guided the development and maintenance  of this important infrastructure.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is appropriate at  this  time  that we commend the Humboldt Bay Municipal  Water District on  its 50th year  in operation,  and recognize  the  importance of  the District  for the quality of life and economic vitality of  the Humboldt Bay region.  f  TRIBUTE TO ROBERTA  HOLLOWELL  HON.

353,,109,-0.556,19,2006-09-15,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, we rise today  to honor Roberta Hollowell of Santa Rosa,  California, who passed away on August 10,  2006, after a two-year battle with cancer. We  know  that,  though she has  left  this earthly  plane, she will be continuing her work as a  feminist activist elsewhere. Hers is the kind of  voice that will never be silenced, and her spirit  lives on in the many she inspired.  Born 77 years ago in Brooklyn, NY, Roberta  moved to California as a teenager when her  father  took an engineering  job  in  the Bay  Area.  She  graduated  from UC  Berkeley  (where she met her husband Ellis Hollowell)  and later earned a master’s degree from Mills  College. The couple had three children before  divorcing in 1962.  In 1962 Roberta and the children moved to  Sebastopol and later to Santa Rosa. At that  time, Roberta  began  teaching English  at  Healdsburg High School, a position she held  for 23 years.  As an activist, Roberta was a  leader and  member in many organizations, and as a retired teacher, education was one of her passions. She was active in the California Teachers Association (CTA), National Education Association  (NEA),  the Sonoma County Educators Council,  and  the Healdsburg Area  Teachers Association. Other  affiliations  included National Organization for Women, Sierra Club, NAACP, Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women, and California  State Democratic Central Committee.  Her union work and liberal politics probably  started as a family trait, but Roberta blazed  her own path and was a mainstay of  the  Sonoma County Democratic Party. She was  active till the end in a host of issues that benefited from her skills and contacts.  But it is Roberta’s personal contacts and example  that we  remember  the most. Stories  told at her funeral attest to her unique ability  in bringing others into the fold. She insisted  that since we all have voices we should use  them. Her humor and warmth as well as her  determination, leadership, and sense of organization were all key to her success. And fond  nicknames,  like The General and La Jefa,  were also marks of respect.  Roberta was very proud of her wonderful  family. She is survived by her daughter Mardi,  her  son  Tom,  grandchildren  Ryan  and  Danielle,  and  great-granddaughter Melody  Ann. Her son David preceded her in death in  1995.  Mr. Speaker, we are honored to have been  counted  among Roberta Hollowell’s many  friends. We will miss her support and inspiration and will carry her legacy with us.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

354,House,109,-0.396,3,2006-09-27,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker, the Bush  administration and Republicans in this  House enjoy a cozy relationship with  big oil companies, one that is paying  off for oil but is hurting American consumers.  For 5 years now, the President has  stacked his administration with former  energy executives, friends and former  colleagues of his and the Vice President’s. It is no wonder then that now  the Nation’s three largest oil companies have been posting record profits.  They are benefiting from the Republican policies that allow them to price  gouge and receive huge tax subsidies.  But when it comes to offering assistance or solutions to the American consumer, the Republicans in the Bush administration come up short. No money  for home heating assistance, no money  for consumer price relief, no money to  invest in finding alternative fuels. Of  course not, it is all going to the oil  companies. There is just not enough  left to help the average American.  Democrats demand action on  issue  before Republicans  take  House into yet another recess.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent  to bring up H.R. 4479, which repeals the  oil company tax subsidies and allows  us to find real solutions to the energy  crisis.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  DUNCAN). Under  the  Speaker’s  announced guidelines, the Chair is constrained not to entertain such a request in the absence of express clearances by bipartisan  committee and  floor leadership.  this  this  f  NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE  ESTIMATE AND WAR ON TERROR  (Mr. GINGREY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
355,House,109,0.672,10,2006-09-27,Mr. WESTMORELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  over the last year, House Republicans  have focused on common sense energy  solutions to help lower gas prices, create jobs for American workers, and reduce America’s reliance on foreign energy sources. And what have the Democrats done? Democrats voted against  the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act,  which would create thousands of family wage American jobs and allow more  of our energy resources to be produced  in  the deep  seas while empowering  States to protect their coastlines.  Democrats voted against the Refinery  Permit  Process  Schedule Act,  which would encourage new refinery  capacity in order to increase gasoline  supplies and drive down high prices.  Democrats voted against the American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act,  authorizing environmentally safe energy production in ANWR, creating 1  million family wage jobs and increasing the supply of American-made energy to lower gasoline prices.  Mr. Speaker, I keep hearing from the  other side of the aisle this refrain of  the ‘‘do-nothing Congress.’’ I would say  it is more the ‘‘do-nothing Democrats.’’  Republicans have a strong record  in  passing commonsense energy solutions,  something Democrats can’t claim.  It is time for the other side to quit  whining and start working.  f  CONGRESS  SHOULD MAKE  COLLEGE  MORE  AFFORDABLE  TODAY BY PASSING LABOR-HHS  BILL  (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
356,House,109,-0.491,17,2006-09-27,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, as I always remind my colleagues, I am a  mother of five children and I have five  grandchildren going on six in October.  Their personal safety is of paramount  importance to me, as it is to every parent of their children and grandchildren  in our country.  As elected officials, our primary responsibility is to protect and defend  our country, to provide for the common defense. It is in the Constitution  of the United States.  So to come to this floor on this very  important debate and to hear the Representative  from Georgia,  to  imply  that this issue of punishing those who  do harm or could do harm to our country is not a priority for every Member  of this body is a disservice to this debate and dishonors our Constitution.  How dare you come to this floor and  imply that we think that these people  are being tried for chewing gum. They  have committed the most heinous acts  that we have witnessed in our lives.  Every American wants  them  prosecuted and punished. Every American  wants them prosecuted and punished.  I will not yield. You had your time.  You demeaned this debate by implying  that we think they were being tried for  chewing gum. That is what you said.  The RECORDwill show it.  But it isn’t just you. It isn’t just you.  It  is the condescension and the disrespect for something that we should  expect every Member of this body on  both sides of the aisle to take very,  very seriously: To provide for the common defense.  b1215  We have that officially as our responsibility. It is our first responsibility because, unless our people are safe, nothing else really matters. And as a mother, as a parent, as a mother of five and  a grandmother of five going on six, as  I constantly remind you all, I identify  with the concerns of all of America’s  families for safety in their neighborhoods while these Republicans are cutting the Community Policing program,  Cops on the Beat program. So it just is  very pervasive.  But, again, we all want a safe home,  a safe community, a safe neighborhood,  homeland security, and to be able to  protect our country wherever our interests are threatened  in the world.  And  the ability  to anticipate what  those dangers may be is a very important one as well.  It is 5 years since 9/11. Not one person  who has been directly responsible for 9/  11 has been prosecuted and punished.  There  is something wrong with this  picture. And  this bill  that  is here  today, because it does violence to the  Constitution of the United States, also,  as Mr. SKELTONsaid, will produce convictions that may well be overturned  because the bill does not heed the instructions from the Supreme Court, a  Supreme Court friendly to this administration, which has directed it to go  back to the drawing board.  Democrats bring to this debate an  unshakeable commitment, as do Republicans, to the proposition that terrorists who attack Americans must be  caught, convicted, and punished in a  judicial process that will withstand the  scrutiny of  the Supreme Court. We  want them in jail. We want them punished, whatever that punishment is. We  don’t want it overturned. And that is  what this debate is about today.  The American people want those who  perpetrated and are responsible for 9/11  to be prosecuted without further delay.  It is 5 years later, and they want convictions to stick so that justice will  not be further postponed. It is inexplicable. How do you explain to people  that 5 years later this has not happened, and not one single planner has  even been brought to trial?  The bill does not help us achieve the  goal of bringing anyone to trial. It is  badly flawed. It threatens the safety of  our troops, our ability to prosecute terrorists effectively, our ability to protect the American people, and to honor  our oath of office to protect and defend  the Constitution. Rather  than welcoming suggestions for improvements,  Republicans refuse to hear them at all.  The only one recourse that we have  is to defeat this rule so that we can  offer amendments to address some of  the bill’s most glaring deficiencies in  the areas of, one, habeas corpus; two,  Geneva Conventions standards; and the  appeals process. If we do not, I believe,  as I have said, that we will be headed  for a repeat of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, a  Supreme Court defeat for the President  and a decision that sends us back to  square one in terms of bringing those  responsible for 9/11 to trial.  By seeking to strip Federal courts of  habeas corpus review, this bill is practically begging to be overturned by the  courts. Habeas corpus  is one of the  hallmarks of our legal system and our  democracy. It is the last line of defense  against arbitrary executive power. And  on that subject, we had a rule that was  proposed by ",2006
357,House,109,0.238,38,2006-09-27,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 6166.  Ladies and gentleman, this is not an  ordinary bill. This is an urgently needed measure to fill a gaping hole in our  legal system, both  in our ability to  bring criminals of 9/11 to justice, the  bombings of  the USS Cole and  the  American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to  justice, and to protect our  American troops and agents from frivolous prosecutions and lawsuits. It is no  exaggeration to say that this is the  most important measure to come before this body in this Congress.  Without this bill, the mastermind of  9/11, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who deliberated  and  cold-bloodedly  plotted  the death of thousands of Americans,  would go unpunished  for his crimes  upon humanity.  Yes, we are a nation of laws. The Supreme Court has called upon the Congress to act, and that is what we will  do.  We have produced an extraordinarily  fair criminal process here to adjudicate  the fate of these terrorists. Those who  would find the court procedures laid  out in this bill wanting will never be  satisfied until we are reading Miranda  rights on the battlefield. We have carefully narrowed and crafted the provisions of this bill to enable the United  States to prosecute the perpetrators of  the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the 2000  attack on the USS Cole, and other  crimes that have been committed.  Yes, these were suicide attacks and  the men who delivered the explosives  were killed, along with innocent victims, but the planner, logisticians, and  financiers of those operations remain  at large.  Importantly, this bill allows, as all  Americans believe it should, the criminal prosecutions of those who purposefully and materially supported these  criminal activities. And, of course, the  measure covers those responsible for 9/  11 as well.  Mr. Speaker, I can think of no reason  that  this measure  should not  pass  unanimously. It outlaws torture.

358,House,109,-0.272,38,2006-09-27,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Speaker, each and  every Member of this House is equally  concerned with bringing terrorists to  justice and punishing them for attacking the United States because they  have committed horrible crimes.  But I have a lot of questions to ask.  I want to be sure that I do the right  thing. Why are we rushing into this? I  know we have to comply with the law,  but we should not be in a hurry. I think  we need to do what is right.  b1400  You know, I have some questions.  When  the Geneva Conventions  convened back in 1949, there were at least  200 countries who agreed in what came  out of this convention. Are we prepared  for other nations’ leaders, such as Iran,  Syria, and others, to selectively interpret the Conventions’ article 3 in a way  that we are comfortable with?

359,House,109,-0.631,59,2006-09-27,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to defend  American values.  The Military Commissions Act—H.R. 6166—  continues Republicans’ despotic assault on  the Constitution.  It  denies  detainees  held  abroad the fundamental right of habeas corpus, which has for centuries protected against  unjust government imprisonment. It limits protections against detainee mistreatment, sanctioning  ‘‘alternative procedures’’ of  interrogation that amount to cruel and unusual punishment. It denies people the opportunity to confront the evidence used against them—even if  that evidence is obtained through coercive and  inhumane practices. It strips our courts of the  jurisdiction  to  review cases—including  those  already pending—concerning detainee abuse.  Some call this legislation a ‘‘compromise.’’ I  call it a capitulation. No sooner had the ink  dried on this deal than the Bush administration  declared that the CIA’s program of secret detention and interrogation could and would continue. That  should  come  as  no  surprise.  Though this bill does not explicitly redefine our  obligations under the Geneva Conventions, it  permits the President to ‘‘interpret the meaning and application’’ of our historic commitment  to  the  international  community—and  theirs to us.  Make no mistake, our disregard  for  international law imperils the safety and security of  our men and women in uniform. Our denial of  due process to detainees invites foreign states  and organizations to indefinitely imprison and  interrogate our soldiers. Our insistence on defining  detainees  as  ‘‘enemy  combatants’’  undeserving of  legal protections encourages  our adversaries to deny these very same protections  to American prisoners. Provided, of  course, we haven’t already done so ourselves:  This legislation allows the Government to declare not only  foreigners, but also U.S. citizens,  ‘‘enemy combatants’’ and arrest and  hold them indefinitely.  This legislation further confirms that Republicans in Congress are no more interested in  fundamental human  rights  than  is President  Bush and his administration.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’  ",2006
360,House,109,-0.267,66,2006-09-27,Mr. MOORE of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from  Florida  (Ms.  WASSERMAN  MOORE SCHULTZ).  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.  Speaker, as an original cosponsor of  this bill,  I  commend  the Financial  Services and Judiciary Committees for  working together in a bipartisan spirit  to move it forward. I especially want to  thank Ranking Member CONYERS and  Ranking Member  and  you,  Chairman OXLEY, for your support and  leadership.  This bill provides much needed relief  to Florida’s commercial firms, which  are experiencing severe increases, and I  mean thousands of percent increases in  insurance premiums.  This is not endemic to Florida. It is  really happening across  the Nation.  FRANK Surplus lines are a safety valve on traditional  insurance markets. In some  cases, they are the only way firms can  get insurance when regulated lines fail.  Market perception of unsustainable  increases in catastrophic risk has resulted in the precipitous decline of insurance coverage availability at astronomical cost to consumers.  This bill expands market capacity to  provide  surplus  lines  coverage.  It  eliminates hundreds of billions of dollars in administrative costs and duplicative filing fees, which are passed on  to consumers. Maintaining the status  quo means higher costs for commercial  firms, consumers, and ultimately our  economy.  I encourage my colleagues to support  this bill because it ensures that companies  are  able  to  obtain  insurance,  meaning they can stay in our communities, provide much needed jobs and  keep our economies strong. Companies  in my home State are literally closing  their doors or  leaving Florida altogether because they cannot get insurance.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.  ",2006
361,House,109,0.423,66,2006-09-27,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. Speaker, I certainly  want to start by acknowledging the focused work of our chairman who has  worked diligently on many aspects of  reform, and the bill now pending is one  small piece of a larger puzzle which has  been constructed by the committee in  an effort to facilitate provision of insurance of all sorts, but particularly  focusing on the needs of homeowners.  And a word of  special appreciation  from those of us in Louisiana as a result of the debacles of Katrina and  Rita. We are experiencing a similar circumstance to that of our colleagues in  the State of Florida.  The remedy posed under the pending  bill is an important one. In one small  area, it enables someone to have direct  access to surplus lines policies which  currently  is not  facilitated. Current  rules require you to apply to at least  three separate companies and be denied  coverage before you can approach a  surplus lines company to acquire the  needed insurance. The proposed reform  would enable certain qualifying purchasers of product, whether it be business owners or individuals, to have direct access. And  in the case of the  Katrina-Rita impact areas, this is of  extreme importance in facilitating access  to  insurance which  otherwise  would not be made available.  I also want to speak to those members of the committee who worked diligently on this subject matter. As the  ranking member  indicated,  this has  been a bipartisan effort, and certainly  Mr.  and  Ms.  SCHULTZon their side are to be commended  for  their contributions. Ms.  WASSERMAN  MOORE BROWN-WAITEand Mr. FITZPATRICKand  others on our side have worked diligently as well.  I think the product we now have  pending before the House is a very important step, but should be viewed only  as that, a first step. There is much  work yet to be done to facilitate regulatory commonsense oversight of the  insurance industry, and hopefully provide for enhanced product development  and competitiveness in markets where  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:29 Nov 18, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H27SE6.REC H27SE6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006

364,House,109,0.471,115,2006-09-27,Mr. PEARCE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of the Esther Martinez Native American Languages Preservation Act of 2006 (H.R. 4766).  I would like to congratulate my colleague from  New Mexico, Mrs. WILSON,  for bringing  this  issue forward.  This is important legislation to preserve the  culture and increase fluency in Native American society. Sadly, all across America, Native  American languages are in rapid decline; estimates are that there may be only 20 Native  American  languages  remaining by  the year  2050. These  languages are unique  to our  country and unique to our history. If we do not  preserve them, they will disappear forever.  This bill will establish a series of grants to  help preserve the language and culture of our  Native American people. This will help create  programs that will teach our young people of  the  importance of  learning  the  language of  their ancestors and continuing to preserve the  history and culture of their people.  Finally,  the  language programs created  in  this bill are  locally based educational programs  that will help both children  learn and  preserve languages in households all across  America.  My constituent Dr. Christine Sims, a professor of language at the University of New  Mexico, and Pueblo of Acoma tribal member  says, ‘‘The future of America’s first languages,  those that are indigenous to this country hang  in the balance of what we do as a Nation to  help tribal communities preserve them. Much  has been given up by countless generations of  Native people in the wake of this country’s expansion and growth into the great nation that  it is today. It is only right and just that Congress  consider  the  tremendous  price  that  America’s first people paid in terms of losing  so much throughout the course of this nation’s  history, including the loss of native languages.  Among America’s Native  language communities  remaining  today,  the hopes and  the  dreams that Native elders, parents and tribes  hold for their children are those which include  the maintenance and  revitalization of  tribal  heritage languages. We can do no less in this  country,  therefore,  than  to ensure  that  tribal  communities have  the opportunity and  the  funding resources  that will help make  these  hopes and dreams for their children a reality.  ‘‘Today’s education for the American Indian  student must open the doors for youngsters to  have more opportunities to learn their own languages as provided in the provisions of H.R.  4766. This bill, so aptly named for one of New  Mexico’s  tribal elders, Mrs. Esther Martinez  from San Juan Pueblo ( who tragically died in  a car accident this past week), would not only  honor  the memory of  this  renowned Native  language advocate and  leader, but as well,  demonstrate the commitment that Congress is  WILSON willing  to make  in support of  the  intent and  purpose of the Native Languages Preservation  Act.’’.  Again, I want to thank my New Mexico colleague, Mrs. WILSON, for bringing this bill forward, her hard work and dedication are a  credit to her and she is a credit to our State.  ",2006

I also thank the gentleman from Wisconsin this evening for  being here in support of H.R. 4750. As  has been indicated, this is a very important  issue  for many  in both the  State of Nebraska and the State of  Kansas. I particularly want to express  my appreciation to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. OSBORNE) and really the  cooperation that has existed on very  difficult issues between the State of  Nebraska and the State of Kansas.  Water is a huge issue in the midwest.  It always has been, probably always  will be. But it is especially exacerbated  by the fact of inadequate rainfall for  now, four, five and six years in much of  Kansas and much of Nebraska.  An agreement was reached, compact  litigation ensued. Ultimately a settlement of that litigation was reached.  And that settlement provides for the  State of Nebraska and the State of  Kansas to come together, provide some  money, share with the Federal Government.  The Department of  Interior would  then conduct a study. The State of  Kansas, and I believe the State of Nebraska has appropriated this money for  the fiscal year. That is why this legislation is so important to be timely considered and timely approved. All that  now remains is for the Federal Government to meet its obligation under the  settlement agreement.  The feasibility study is desperately  needed  to  increase  the water availability to find out how we do that, and  to encourage its efficient use and conservation within our delivery system.  Madam Speaker, the feasibility study  authorized by 4750  is not only necessary to ensure the State remains in  compliance with that agreement, but  to make certain that the economic, agriculture and personal use of water is  done in a very efficient and effective  way.  I urge Members of Congress to approve this legislation.  ",2006

Palomar College is one of the most comprehensive community colleges in the United  States, offering North County, San Diego residents more  than 300 degree and certificate  programs for transfer to four-year universities,  job training, and personal enrichment. Its commitment to lifelong learning and its status as a  cultural center for northern San Diego County  make Palomar College a  tremendous educational asset to California and the Nation.  Palomar began with only 100 students; the  first classes were held on September 23,  1946, on the campus of Vista High School in  Vista, California. It has since grown to become  one of our State’s largest community colleges.  Palomar College now has an enrollment of  over 30,000 students and is widely respected  for its excellent programs, faculty, administration, the success of its students, and the service it provides to the communities of northern  San Diego County.  Mr. Speaker, because of Palomar College’s  dedication to education and the improvement  of individuals, I want to recognize and honor  this institution of higher learning. I congratulate  and applaud Palomar College upon  the observance of its 60th anniversary and for the  valuable contribution it makes to our society  and to the future of its students.  f  A TRIBUTE TO PRIVATE ERIC M.

377,,109,-0.296,311,2006-09-27,Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  before you today to honor the life of a Maryland soldier who died honorably serving his  country in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Private Eric M. Kavanagh from Glen Burnie,  Maryland was a dedicated and loyal serviceman. His courage enabled him to be a leader  among his peers.  The 20-year-old private was  trained as a  Bradley tank driver. He was assigned to the  1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat  team,  1st  Infantry Division,  Schweinfurt, Germany. After his  training, he  was stationed in Iraq for 5 weeks.  I commend Private Kavanagh for his courage to serve our country and to fight for freedom in an unsettled world. Without doubt, his  bravery  gives  his  parents, Mr. Kelvin  T.  Kavanagh and Ms. Rhonda Kavanagh great  pride. Private Kavanagh was  the oldest of  three children. He  is remembered  for being  not only a magnanimous and compassionate  soldier but also an incredible brother and son.  Prior to joining the Army, Private Kavanagh  worked for a weekly shopping publication, the  Pennysaver. Co-workers said he was always  happy  and  smiling.  He  attended  Folger  McKinsey Elementary School, Severna Park  Middle School, and Chesapeake High School.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that you  join with me  today to honor the patriotism of Private Eric M.  Kavanagh. His love of country and willingness  to serve his country will  forever  last  in our  hearts and minds. He made the ultimate sacrifice for the United States of America and he  will always be remembered as a hero  from  Maryland.  f  IN HONOR OF DAN ALBERT  HON.

(Ted)  Gundlach of Belleville, Illinois.  Ted Gundlach was born, along with his twin  brother,  Joseph, on  January 11, 1924,  in  Belleville, Illinois. Ted’s father, T.J. Gundlach  had, the year before, opened a small machine  shop to provide tools and equipment for the  local mines and factories.  After college, where he earned a degree in  mechanical engineering, Ted accepted an appointment to the U.S. Naval Reserves in 1943  and served for the duration of World War II.  He was discharged in 1946 with the rank of  Lieutenant J.G.  Returning home  to Belleville, Ted entered  the  family business, T.J. Gundlach Machine  Co. and J.M.J.  Industries,  Inc. Starting as  General Manager, Ted would become President and CEO and expand the Gundlach Machine Co. market reach to six continents.  As much as Ted poured his energy into his  business, he also found time to be personally  involved in his community. Ted has served on  16 different boards of directors, been a member of numerous fraternal, business and civic  organizations and helped to steer many community and charitable projects. He has  received a number of awards  from business,  professional, educational and civic organizations, recognizing his contributions and leadership.  While Ted built his company into a position  of international leadership in their marketplace  and has performed outstanding service to his  community, he has always been devoted  to  his family. Ted and his wife, Patricia, live in  Belleville, Illinois and have two children, Mary  Barbara Compton and Laurie Ann Frillman.  They have three grandchildren, Amanda, Molly  and Lucas.

Jonathan  Rojas, 27 years old, died on October 3  after being struck by a sniper bullet  while on patrol in Baghdad. Jonathan  risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts,  in a land halfway around the world.  Jonathan spent several years in the  workforce after graduating from Hammond High School before enlisting. He  had been due to return home to Indiana  2 months before he was killed but  agreed to stay longer, promising his  family in Hammond that he would be  home in time for Christmas. Jonathan  was remembered by his brother William as playful and warm hearted,  when he said, ‘‘We’re going to miss him  being himself, doing stupid things, his  company, having a brother, someone to  talk to.’’  Jonathan was killed, while serving  his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, 172nd  Stryker Brigde Combat Team. This  brave soldier leaves behind wife Tasha  Rojas, parents Jose and Catalina Rojas,  brother William  Rojas,  and  sister  Isaura Rojas.  Today, I join Jonathan’s family and  friends in mourning his death. While  we struggle to bear our sorrow over  this loss, we can also take pride in the  example he  set, bravely  fighting  to  make the world a safer place. It is his  courage and strength of character that  people will remember when they think  of Jonathan, a memory that will burn  brightly during these continuing days  of conflict and grief.  Jonathan was known for his dedication to his family and his love of country. He was looking forward to civilian  life and starting a family with his wife  Tasha. Today and always, Jonathan  will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a  true American hero, and we honor the  sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.  As I search for words to do justice in  honoring Jonathan’s sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln’s remarks  as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ‘‘We cannot  dedicate, we  cannot  consecrate, we  cannot hallow this ground. The brave  men, living and dead, who struggled  here, have consecrated it, far above our  poor power  to add or detract. The  world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never  forget what they did here.’’ This statement is just as true today as it was  nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain  that the impact of Jonathan’s actions  will live on far longer than any record  of these words.  It is my sad duty to enter the name  of  Jonathan Rojas  in  the  official  RECORDof the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound  commitment to  freedom, democracy,  and peace.

390,Senate,109,-0.314,51,2006-11-15,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to pay special tribute to the  General Federation of Women’s Clubs  and their recent work to fight domestic  violence. The organization  is a gem  among our midst. Founded  in April  1890, it is one of the world’s oldest and  largest women’s volunteer organizations. More than 150,000 women members in 5,000 local and 20 international  clubs volunteer over 13 million hours  and contribute approximately $35 million through more than 160,000 club  projects.  I can’t underestimate how  powerful and influential this corps of  volunteers is to the health of our Nation.  I am particularly proud that this  year the international president, Jacqueline Pierce, has adopted ‘‘Domestic  Violence Awareness and Prevention’’  as her President’s Special Project for  2006–2008. Nannette White, a member  from Louisiana, serves as the national  chairperson of the President’s Special  Project, and with the support of a national committee of women, promotes  participation in this project. All across  the Nation,  local women’s clubs are  adopting  battered women’s  shelters  and donating needed goods  such as  food,  linens, health care  items, and  more. In Nevada, members sponsored a  public service campaign on radio stations to promote important messages  about  violence  prevention.  In Mississippi, members distributed 2,000 fliers with information on the National  Domestic Violence Hotline and helped  raise funds for the Mississippi State  Coalition Against Domestic Violence.  This is just a small sampling of the  good works being done.

391,,109,-0.434,72,2006-11-15,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor an organization with a distinguished history of community service to the Sacramento  capital region. Legal Services of Northern California is celebrating 50 years of providing free  legal services to the low-income residents of  Sacramento County and 22 other counties in  Northern California. As  the staff and supporters of Legal Services of Northern California gather  to  celebrate  this momentous  milestone, I ask all my colleagues to join me  in saluting one of Sacramento’s most important and respected organizations.  In 1956, Legal Services of Northern California, then known as the Legal Aid Society of  Sacramento County, was born out of the insight  of  prominent members  of  the Sacramento Bar Association and a budget of  $12,000. With the assistance of volunteer pro  bono attorneys and a staff consisting of one  part-time attorney and one social worker, the  Legal Aid Society of Sacramento County finished its first year having provided assistance  to nearly 2,900 low-income clients.  From  these humble beginnings 50 years  ago, the Legal Aid Society has grown significantly. In 1967, the organization began to expand its services beyond Sacramento County  and opened offices in Yolo County. By the late  1970s, the Legal Aid Society of Sacramento  County had acquired a state-wide reputation  for resolute and effective advocacy on behalf  of the poor and disabled, and had won significant victories on behalf of its clients. To reflect  its expanding geographic reach, the organization changed its name in 1979 to Legal Services of Northern California, which today operates offices serving 23 counties, with a budget  of over $7 million and a staff of over 120 employees and 1,000 volunteers.  Legal Services of Northern California has  also greatly expanded  its scope of services  beyond providing traditional legal assistance to  low-income individuals. The organization now  operates the Senior Legal Hotline, the Health  Rights  Hotline,  Ombudsman  Services  of  Northern California, and the Disability Employment Rights Advocacy Program, As a testament  to  its  far-reaching services,  the Senior  Legal Hotline  fields almost 9,000 calls each  year from seniors all over California. Also notable was in early 2006 when Legal Services  of Northern California acquired the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program,  an organization that advises thousands of seniors on  the different prescription drug plans  available to them under Medicare.  Mr. Speaker,  for 50 years  the good men  and women of Legal Services of Northern  California have dedicated countless hours to  identifying and defeating the causes of poverty  and injustice. As the staff and volunteer attorneys gather to reflect upon a half century of  exemplary service  to  the community,  I am  proud to recognize such a reputable organization. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Legal Services of Northern California and wishing them many more years of  continued success.  TRIBUTE TO MR. ELMO LOPEZ, SR.  HON.

393,,109,-0.386,79,2006-11-15,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  honor the work of one of the leaders of the  modern-day  abolitionist movement, Ambassador John R. Miller, who has announced he  will step down as Director of the U.S. Department of State’s Office to Monitor and Combat  Trafficking in Persons.  He will be greatly missed.  As Ambassador Miller has often reminded  us, trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery. With that conviction, he has led his office,  and the whole of U.S. government, on a mission to settle for nothing short of the abolition  of this terrible international crime.  Under Ambassador Miller’s  leadership,  the  U.S. government has grown  in  its commitment—both  at  home  and  abroad—against  modern-day  slavery. His work has helped  spotlight the issue of slavery around the world,  through the annual Secretary of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report, diplomatic engagement, speeches and multiple prosecution, protection, and prevention programs around the  world.  Earlier this year, New York Times columnist  Nicholas D. Kristof praised the U.S. commitment to abolishing modern-day slavery, noting:  [T]he heaviest lifting has been done by the  State Department’s  tiny  office  on  trafficking—for my money, one of the most effective units in the U.S. government. The office, led by a former Republican congressman, John Miller . . . puts out an annual report that shames and bullies foreign governments  into  taking action against  forced  labor of all kinds.  The 2006 Trafficking in Persons Report is  the most comprehensive worldwide report on  the efforts of governments to combat severe  forms of trafficking in persons. Along with previous editions, its findings have raised global  awareness and compelled countries to take effective actions  to counter human  trafficking.  Under Ambassador Miller’s direction, the Report has steadily increased its country assessment total each year—from 124 governments  reviewed in 2003 to 158 countries assessed in  the 2006 TIP Report.  During  that  time, Ambassador Miller also  oversaw crucial refinements to the Report, elevating  the annual compendium  to a  level of  sophistication rarely enjoyed by a publication  of its kind: the Trafficking in Persons Report  has become the gold standard on which governments and  the media are able  to weigh  progress on the global effort to fight human  trafficking.  Annual release of the report has also generated  increasing media  coverage, helping  raise global consciousness of  the existence  and widespread problem of modern-day slavery. Release of the 2006 Report, for example,  produced widespread coverage by national  and international print, broadcast, and Internet  media, reaching, for the second year in a row,  more  than 400 million people across  the  globe. Media coverage was particularly  intense in many of the Tier 3 and Tier 2 Watch  List countries, such as Saudi Arabia and India.  Today, the TIP Report is the essential reference for global benchmarks that challenge  all governments to join the 21st century abolitionist movement. The annual Trafficking  in  Persons Report serves as the primary diplomatic tool through which the U.S. Government  encourages partnership and increased determination in the fight against forced labor, sexual exploitation, and modern-day slavery.  ‘‘In our  judgment,’’ declared Dr. Mohamed  Mattar, Executive Director of  the Protection  Project, ‘‘this report constitutes the primary reference and main source of information on efforts made by foreign governments to combat  trafficking in persons.’’  Armed with  the report, Ambassador Miller  has engaged with governments from Japan to  Jamaica, from Belize to Bangladesh, to bring  about improved law enforcement, victim protection, and prevention of  this odious crime.  Worldwide, Ambassador Miller’s  diplomatic  leadership helped spur new or improved anti-  human trafficking legislation in 41 countries in  2005, along with the establishment of dozens  of new survivor shelters. That effort paid huge  dividends:  anti-trafficking  convictions worldwide increased from several hundred, before  Ambassador Miller arrived at the State Department, to over 4,700 in 2005. Last year’s figure—an increase from about 3,000 the year  before—was especially dramatic among countries in Africa (from 29 TIP convictions in 2004  to 58 in 2005) and East Asia and Pacific nations  (from 348 TIP convictions  in 2004  to  2,347 in 2005).  Specifically, Ambassador Miller’s diplomatic  efforts helped persuade Japan  to vastly  reduce the number of TIP-exploitable ‘‘entertainment visas’’ Japan issued for young women  from  the Philippines—to  fewer  than 5,000,  from a high of 80,000 a year. In addition, Ambassador Miller has carefully honed  the  report’s system of tier rankings to cultivate global anti-TIP efforts. This year, for example, Malawi rose from Tier 2 to Tier 1 on the TIP Report, while Ecuador rose from Tier 3 to Tier 2.  Over  the  last 2 years, Ambassador Miller  helped enhance  the U.S. government’s anti-  trafficking efforts  to  include a greater  focus  against child sex  tourism (CST), a crime  in  which people travel from their own country to  developing countries, such as Laos or Cambodia,  looking  for anonymity and  the availability of children in prostitution. Ambassador  Miller’s  leadership against CST has netted  success,  as  Time magazine  recently  observed:  Those working to protect children in Cambodia agree that the police force has recently  shown a far stronger commitment to targeting pedophiles. But it’s not just law and  order that is doing the trick. A new political  will to root them out is the result of diplomatic incentives and pressures, both the carrots of international donors and the stick of  the U.S. State Department, say child protection workers. . . . But the stick came in 2005  when the U.S. State Department, fed up with  the  impunity enjoyed by traffickers here,  relegated Cambodia to it lowest tier three  rating on its global trafficking report. Cambodia was lumped in with Burma, Cuba and  North Korea, and Washington  threatened  sanctions against Phnom Penh for its inability to comply with ‘minimum standards’ to  combat human trafficking and convict officials involved.  In part because of Ambassador Miller’s efforts, since 2003 over 30 American pedophiles  have been extradited back  to  the U.S. and  sent to jail.  With Ambassador Miller’s  prodding,  the  United States last December became an official party to the U.N. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, also known as  the Palermo Protocol. The Trafficking in Persons  (TIP) Protocol, which supplements  the  U.N. Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, is an important multilateral component of the worldwide effort to combat modern-day slavery. It seeks to prevent trafficking,  protect victims, and promote anti-trafficking cooperation among nations.  As chairman of the interagency Senior Policy Operating Group, Ambassador Miller has  improved coordination among U.S. agencies,  helping to make the panel a decision-making  body whose participants have  furthered  the  U.S. effort against trafficking in person both at  home and abroad. For example, the Department of Justice (DOJ), in 2005 charged 116  individuals with human trafficking, almost doubling  the number charged  in FY 2004. Approximately 80 percent of  those defendants  were charged under  the  federal Trafficking  Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000. Forty-  five  traffickers were convicted, of which 35  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:54 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15NO8.042 E15NOPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2006

Kresge and Lee  W. Eckert,  founders of Quad Three Group,  Inc. in Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  Quad Three Group is a full service architectural, engineering and environmental science  firm that has grown from a single proprietorship in 1967 to a firm employing 70 people  today  in Wilkes-Barre, Scranton and Pittsburgh, PA.  From 1967 through 1987, the company was  a multidiscipline professional engineering firm  known as Utility Engineers which served a  large number of architectural firms, commercial and industrial clients and municipalities. A  large part of the firm’s growth came from contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense.  In 1987, Utility Engineers, which had employed 35 people, merged with the largest architectural design  firm  in  the Wilkes-Barre/  Scranton area, Pyros and Sanderson, which  employed 15 people,  to  form Quad Three  Group, Inc.  Noteworthy regional projects they completed  included Blue Cross Blue Shield of Northeastern Pennsylvania headquarters, Luzerne  County Community College Technology Building, Penn State University Wilkes-Barre and  Hazleton campuses, Martz Trailways Office  Building,  InterMetro  Industries  Corporate  Headquarters Building, the environmental impact study for the Francis E. Walter Dam Hydroelectric Project, Newport, Rhode Island and  Lakehurst, New Jersey Naval Base Utility System Upgrade and the $85 million Steamtown  Mall project in downtown Scranton.  They also completed the Philadelphia Naval  Shipyard Base Re-Alignment  and Closure  project, ten major K–12 and higher education  projects,  the $45 million Wachovia Arena at  Casey Plaza and the $30 million Mount Laurel  Center for the Performing Arts.  Mr. Churnetski  received his bachelor of  science in mechanical engineering from Notre  Dame University. Mr. Kresge  received his  bachelor of electrical engineering  from Penn  State University and Mr. Eckert received his  bachelor of science in civil engineering from  Penn State University. Between  the  three  founders,  they have 127 years of combined  engineering experience.

395,,109,0.259,86,2006-11-15,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate and honor one of my constituents, Charleston firefighter Phil Pfister on becoming the World’s Strongest Man.  This award was bestowed after a long and  arduous competition amongst 25 athletes from  around  the world. The  ten day contest  in  Sanya, China  included events such as bus  pulls, car pushes, stone lifts, and tire turns.  Mr. Pfister, is the first American to win this  competition  in 24 years. After  trailing  in  the  early events, Mr. Pfister focused his strength,  discipline, and determination to win the final  five events leading him to the title. His hard  work and dedication during  training certainly  paid off.  Nonetheless, after all his glory of winning  this prestigious competition, Mr. Pfister  returned to West Virginia a few days later and  promptly resumed his daily work of protecting  our wonderful city of Charleston as a  firefighter.  I am proud to honor Mr. Pfister for his accomplishments in the World’s Strongest Man  competition and his dedication to the Charleston community through his service as a fireman. West Virginia is truly fortunate to have  him as a Mountaineer.  f  CONGRATULATING KEN SMITH ON  HIS  RETIREMENT  FROM  THE  SANTA ROSA  COUNTY  SCHOOL  BOARD  HON.

396,,109,0.633,86,2006-11-15,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to congratulate and pay tribute to Ken  Smith, who  is retiring  from  the Santa Rosa  County School Board after 28 years of service. Mr. Smith’s dedication to his community  and the education of its children is profound  and commendable.  Mr. Smith was born in Bagdad, Florida. He  first got active in the school system in Santa  Rosa County when he volunteered at his children’s schools as a PTA member. After serving as PTA President at Oakhurst Elementary,  he was elected to his first term on the Santa  Rosa County School Board in 1978. He is currently  the  second  longest  serving School  Board member in the State of Florida, having  served with 17 Board Members and 3 Superintendents. He has held the positions of Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board 7 times  each.  Through the years, Mr. Smith has served on  several Board committees, most notably  the  Vocational Committee, working with the State  to acquire  the Locklin Technical Center,  the  first and only vocational center  located  in  Santa Rosa County. He has also been active  in the Lions Club, Optimist Club, and the Ferris Hill Baptist Church.  Mr. Smith’s effort  to better Santa Rosa  County schools is admirable. His devotion to  the education of the children of his community  is inspirational. I congratulate him on his accomplishments and his retirement.  f  PAYING  TRIBUTE  TO  PRIVATE  FIRST CLASS PHILLIP B. WILLIAMS  HON. JON C.

397,,109,0.219,8,2006-12-27,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, it has  been an honor and a privilege to work  with Senator BILLFRISTfor the past 12  years. BILLhas been a solid leader for  our party and he has served the people  of Tennessee with distinction.  Senator  came  to  politics  through  a  nontraditional  route—  through the operating room. BILLgot  involved in politics because he believed  he could do even more  for his patients—and the people of Tennessee—in  the Senate. And he was right. BILL’s  meticulous approach to this job is exactly what you would expect of a person with his training. He never gave up  on his goals and worked tirelessly to  see them into law.  I became President Pro Tempore of  the Senate close to the time when BILL  became our majority leader. I enjoyed  working by his side and thank Leader  for including me—as President  Pro Tempore—in all leadership meetings. Senator FRISTalso traveled with  us to China for U.S. Interparliamentary Group meetings. Once our meetings were finished, he continued on to  Africa for medical mission work.  As majority leader, BILLcarried the  administration’s message. He  fought  hard for the President’s judicial nominees. And as we saw yesterday during  his  farewell address, BILL leaves us  with great honor and recognition. Our  leader will now return to where,  in  some ways, his heart has always been—  FRIST Senate  the practice of medicine. But deep in  my heart, I feel that public service will  again call BILLto give of his time and  talents to help preserve our democracy  and our freedoms. Catherine and I will  miss being with BILLand Karyn.  RICKSANTORUM  Mr. President, yesterday I was moved  by the emotional farewell of Senator  RICKSANTORUM. He said he still feels  the thrill of coming to work in this  building every day. The energy he put  toward his work in this Chamber, I will  remember  as  one  of  Senator  SANTORUM’s most striking qualities.  Senator SANTORUM’s enthusiastic direction of the Republican conference  rallied our majority. I believe he jeopardized his own future in Pennsylvania  by urging us to think and act for the  national good. Pennsylvania has been  served well during his time in Congress  and so has our Nation.  RICK’s energy has been of great benefit  to many charities, and he has  taken a  special  interest  in helping  those affected by autism. His efforts on  behalf of each of these causes have  been exceptional. And despite his many  commitments, RICK’s dedication to his  family and personal convictions never  wavered. Catherine and I wish RICKand  his family well.  GEORGEALLEN  Mr.  President,  Senator  ALLENhas served the Commonwealth  of Virginia with honor and integrity.  is a principled person,  folGEORGE  GEORGE lowing bedrock beliefs gained growing  up in a strong family.  These principles have led GEORGE to  promote and defend  freedom  in this  country and around the world. His legislative accomplishments are aligned  with this philosophy.  Senator ALLEN’s major accomplishments include the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, the 21st Century  Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, increased benefits for the  families of fallen troops, funding to upgrade telecommunications  infrastructure for minority-serving institutions,  and greater protections for intellectual  property.  In all of this, Senator ALLENhas not  forgotten who his  real boss  is:  the  American people. He has always, and  will continue, to put the interests of  this country above his own. That is a  true mark of a  leader, ald all Virginians can be proud to have been represented  by  a man with  Senator  ALLEN’s character.  As many of his constituents, colleagues,  and  friends know, Senator  ALLENclosed much of his correspondence with the words ‘‘keep winning.’’  Just like his dad, a Hall of Fame coach  who reached great heights and suffered  tough losses on the gridiron, we know  GEORGEwon’t let this setback define  him. We all expect him to ‘‘keep winning’’ for Virginia.  Catherine and I wish him and Susan  the very best.

398,,109,-0.53,15,2006-12-27,Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to pay tribute to my constituent, Mr.  George Paz Martin, a longtime activist, community  leader and cherished  friend who  is  being honored  this month with  the Lifetime  Peacemaker Award by the Wisconsin Network  for Peace and Justice. I can think of no more  appropriate recipient for this award. Throughout his life, Mr. Martin has exhibited tireless  activism, a limitless command of skills and approaches, and a relentless pursuit of  justice  and peace.  There is scarcely a social justice issue on  which George Martin has not served a crucial  leadership  role. Coming of age  in  the civil  rights movement, he  fought  for equality and  desegregation in housing, education, and employment, among other things. He has served  numerous organizations that provide community development and services  for housing,  healthcare, and economic development. An  internationally  renowned peace activist and  Green Party leader, he is also extremely involved in local efforts to address the needs of  the veterans’ community.  Not only do his social justice interests know  no bounds, but his combination of skills and  approaches to the pursuit of justice make him  a relentless champion. Having worked in the  corporate world, he understands the utility of  marketing and promotions  in broadening  the  peace movement. He has built local, national  and  international coalitions against violence  within neighborhoods and among nations. He  is a highly sought-after public speaker, who  has participated in nearly every major peace  rally since the invasion of Iraq. He has traveled  throughout  the world building  relationships with other peace movements, and serving as a witness to the devastation caused by  war and violence.  Finally, Mr. Martin demonstrates seemingly  limitless personal commitment. He brings care  and compassion  to every struggle.  It  is  the  hallmark of his style  that he has crafted a  movement against the Iraq war that takes account of  the humanity of everyone  involved,  including  those  involved  in  the  fighting,  the  policymakers,  the peace  leaders and  those  who support the war.  I am indebted to George for his expertise,  his friendship, and the example of his leadership and I am honored to have this opportunity  to  thank him  for his  lifelong commitment  to  equality, peace, non-violence and justice.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

BETTY McCOLLUM  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 27, 2006  Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to commend Chairman HENRY  HYDEon a remarkable career and to congratulate him on his retirement from the U.S. Congress.  Chairman HYDE has honorably served  the  citizens of Illinois’ 6th District since 1975. He  has an impressive record of legislative accomplishments, has led two powerful committees  and has been conferred 8 honorary degrees.  I have had the honor to serve under Chairman HYDE on  the House  International Relations Committee for the past four years. During a time of growing international pressures,  he has led this committee with skill and dignity. His commitment  to  the  integrity of  the  House has taught me a great deal about the  legislative process. His respect for the minority, interest in listening to all voices and his  common-sense leadership has been critical in  ensuring civil debate and productive solutions  to extremely difficult problems.  This leadership was evident during the successful passage of the President’s Emergency  Plan  for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, which has  helped to bring needed urgency and attention  to this global crisis. Mr. HYDEand his committee staff enabled me, as a first term member,  to ensure  that my amendment  to set  aside 10 percent of funding for orphans and  vulnerable children was passed as part of this  bill. The enactment of this legislation is a testament  to Mr. HYDE’s ability  to bring people  and ideas together to make a real difference  for families around the world.  In March of 2005, I had the pleasure of traveling with a congressional delegation  led by  Chairman HYDE to Mexico and Panama. We  had  the opportunity  to meet with President  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.
