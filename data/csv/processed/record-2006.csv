0,6,2006-01-25,Mr.  SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  thank my distinguished colleague for  those comments.  There is no doubt about the suffering  of those who are afflicted with mesothelioma and asbestosis and other ailments. There is also no doubt about  the tremendous impact it has on the  economy of the United States. It has  been estimated that there could be a  bigger boost than any kind of tax cuts  you could have or any sort of economic  recovery program you could have to be  able to deal with the more than 75 companies that have gone into bankruptcy  and others where bankruptcy is threatened.  The amount of work that the Senator  from Vermont has specified has been  gigantic. It has been 3 years in process.  Senator HATCHtook the lead with the  trust fund concept where the manufacturers and the insurers have agreed to  put up some $140 billion into the trust  fund with no government payments  and not coming out of the pockets of  the taxpayers.  The meetings which have been held  and  the efforts and  the momentum  which we have had can’t be recaptured.  I think it is fair to say, certainly during my tenure here of 25 years, that I  have never seen legislation worked on  to the extent this legislation has been,  with the complexity of the problem and  the involvement of Senators and staff  and so-called stakeholders. If it is not  now, it is never.  ",2006
1,6,2006-01-25,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I support the nomination by President Bush  of Circuit Court Judge Samuel A.  Alito, Jr., to the Supreme Court of the  United States because he is qualified.  In coming to my conclusion, my staff  and I have undertaken an extensive review of Judge Alito’s record and of his  some 361 opinions in total. We have  categorized 238 of those as major decisions while serving on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. We have reviewed 49 of the cases that Judge Alito  handled during his tenure as U.S. attorney. We have made an analysis of 43  speeches and articles Judge Alito authorized and evaluations of 38 formal  opinions, petitions, and Supreme Court  briefs which Judge Alito wrote while  serving in the Department of Justice.  Additionally,  the  Judiciary  Committee heard  testimony of  some  30  hours and 20 minutes where we had 17  hours and 45 minutes of questioning of  Judge Alito and testimony from 33 outside witnesses.  It is on the basis of that voluminous  record that it is my personal view that  Judge Alito ought to be confirmed.  He has a background from a father  who was an immigrant from Italy, not  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:00 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S25JA6.REC S25JA6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006

4,13,2006-01-25,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I appreciate the compliment of the Senator  from Alabama. I have spent 31 years in  the Senate. I take my role in the Senate very seriously. I believe we should  be the conscience of the Nation. As I  have said many times, only 18 people  get to publicly ask questions of the Supreme Court nominees. They are the 18  Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. We are asking those questions  on behalf of almost 300 million Americans, and then 100 of us get a chance to  vote on it.  While the Senator from Alabama is  still on the floor, I note that there  seem to be talking points going around  that the Democratic  leader, Senator  REID, has been lobbying to make this a  party-line vote.  I don’t know where  those talking points came from. I have  heard them  in different places. The  Democratic  leader was asked about  that yesterday by the press in open session. He said it is absolutely not so. I  am the ranking member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee. Just as nobody  from leadership has lobbied me on now-  Chief Justice Roberts when I voted for  him, nobody has lobbied me on Judge  Alito; nor have I lobbied anybody else,  and nor have I heard of anybody who  has been lobbied.  What the distinguished senior Senator  from Nevada,  the Democratic  leader, has said over and over again is  that this is a vote of conscience. Every  Senator has to search his or her own  conscience.  In  fact,  I was also concerned when the distinguished Republican leader opened the debate on this  nomination by complaining that those  opposing Judge Alito are smearing a  decent and honorable man. Mr. President, again, out of almost 300 million  Americans, only 100 of us get a chance  to say whether this man will go on the  Supreme Court, where he can sit there  for years, decades even, and where he is  supposed to be the ultimate check and  balance and guardian of our rights. To  say that by opposing him is smearing  him, that is not so.  Senator SPECTERand I held a fair and  open hearing on him. Democrats had  substantive and probing questions to  try to learn more about Judge Alito,  and some Republicans did the same.  These complaints about the treatment  of Judge Alito ring hollow after President Bush was forced by an extreme  faction of his own Republican Party to  withdraw his first choice for the vacancy, Harriet Miers. It was a humiliation of the President by an extreme  faction in his party. Within hours of  the  time he nominated her, many  groups on the far right criticized the  nomination, and a number of Republican Senators raised serious concerns  calling for a thorough hearing and a  probing inquiry in light of their concerns about her record.  The same groups on the right immediately embraced Samuel Alito after  they had forced Harriet Miers to be  withdrawn. The same Republican Senators who said they needed to learn  more about Harriet Miers’ judicial philosophy before they could vote to confirm her are now doing an about face  and criticizing Democrats  for saying  they want to do the same type of inquiry for Judge Alito. President Bush  buckled to pressure and withdrew the  nomination for Harriet Miers because  she didn’t pass the litmus test and because there were those who said they  were not sure how they would vote.  The  third  nomination—Judge  Alito’s—people  applauded,  implying  that here we have somebody who we  know how he will vote, so he is fine.  Democratic Senators are taking their  constitutional  duties  seriously. We  have a single  fundamental question:  Will the Senate serve its constitutional  role and preserve the Supreme Court as  a constitutional check on the expansion of presidential power?  A  nominee’s  views  on Executive  power and  the checks and balances  built by the Founders into our constitutional  framework should always  weigh heavily  in hearings  for those  nominated to the Supreme Court. Executive power  issues were  the  first  issues I raised with Chief Justice Roberts at his confirmation hearing, and  they were the first issues I raised with  Judge Alito.  The reason presidential power issues  have come to dominate this confirmation process is that we have clearly arrived now at a crucial juncture in our  Nation, and on our highest court, over  the question of whether a President of  the United States is above the law. The  Framers knew that unchecked power  leads to abuses and corruption, and the  Supreme Court is the ultimate check  and balance  in our system. Vibrant  checks and balances are instruments in  protecting both the security and the  liberty of the American people.  This  is a nomination  that  I  fear  threatens the fundamental rights and  liberties of all Americans, now and for  generations to come. One need only  look to the White House to see the  practical effects of such an erosion of  those rights and liberties. This President is prone to unilateralism and assertions of Executive power that extend all the way to illegal spying on  Americans.  This President is in the midst of a  radical realignment of the powers of  the Government and its intrusiveness  into the private lives of all Americans,  Republicans and Democrats. Frankly,  this nomination is part of that plan for  the intrusion into our private lives. I  am concerned that if we confirm this  nominee, it will further erode checks  and balances that have protected our  constitutional rights for more than 200  years. It is not overstating the case to  say this is a critical nomination. It is  one that can tip the balance on the Supreme Court radically away from the  constitutional checks and balances and  the protection of Americans’  fundamental rights.  This past week, I introduced a resolution to clarify what we all know, that  the congressional authorization for the  use of military force against Osama bin  Laden did not authorize warrantless  spying on Americans, as the administration has now claimed. I thought—we  all thought—that when we as Democrats joined in the bipartisan authorization  of military  action  against  Osama bin Laden more than 4 years  ago, our action would have been more  effective and that we would have by  now succeeded in ridding the world of  that  terrorist  leader. We  gave  the  President all the authority he needed  to go after Osama bin Laden, and we  thought with the great power of this  country he would have gone out and  caught him. He didn’t. They averted  our special forces out of Afghanistan  and into Iraq before we even announced  we were going to go to war against  Iraq. We lost the opportunity to catch  Osama bin Laden, the man who did  order the attacks on America.  Now we find the administration, instead of saying sorry we didn’t catch  Osama bin Laden, even though you  gave us the authority, we now want to  use that authority as legal justification for a covert, illegal spying program on Americans.  As  Justice  O’Connor  underscored  very recently, even war ‘‘is not a blank  check for the President when it comes  to the rights of the Nation’s citizens.’’  Now that the illegal spying on Americans has become public, the Bush administration’s lawyers are contending  that Congress authorized it. The September 2001 authorization to use military force did no such thing. It did not  authorize illegal spying on Americans.  Republican Senators know it, and some  have been courageous to say so publicly. The fact is, we all know it. The  liberties and rights that define us as  Americans and the system of checks  and balances that serve to preserve  them  should  not  be  sacrificed  to  threats of terrorism or to the expanding power of the Government. Security  and liberty are not mutually exclusive  values  in America. We  should have  both, and we can have both, so long as  we have adequate checks and balances  and with the extra effort it takes to  chart the right course to preserve our  liberties as we preserve our security.  We are constantly reminded of what  Benjamin Franklin said: People who  give up their liberties for security deserve neither.

11,27,2006-01-25,Mr. BUNNING.," Mr. President, I rise  to speak in support of Samuel Alito’s  nomination to the United States Supreme Court.  Judge Alito is supremely qualified.  He has a record of fairness and judicial restraint. He will do a fine job on  the Supreme Court.  I will vote for his nomination and  any procedural measures necessary to  confirm him on the Senate floor.  Confirmation of a Supreme Court  Justice is one of the most import jobs  we have as Senators.  This will be  the  second Supreme  Court nominee I will have considered  since coming to the Senate.  I take this responsibility very seriously.  I have spent time with Judge Alito  and I have studied his background and  record.  I closely  followed his confirmation  hearings in the Judiciary Committee. I  can  say without  question  that  he  should be confirmed.  I don’t find myself agreeing with the  Washington Post or the Louisville Courier-Journal newspapers very often.  But even  those papers agree  that  Judge Alito should be confirmed.  I first met Judge Alito this past fall.  I did not know much about him when  his  nomination was  announced  by  President Bush.  I reserved judgment about his nomination until I had a chance to meet  with him.  From that meeting it became clear  that I could support his nomination.  And his performance at his confirmation hearing further solidified my support for his nomination.  We are all familiar with the basics of  Judge Alito’s background.  He has been on the Third Circuit  Court of Appeals for 15 years.  He has participated in several thousand cases and written several hundred  opinions.  He attended top schools for both college and  law  school—Princeton and  Yale.  I gather all of my colleagues would  agree that those things are important  and impressive—but they do not alone  qualify him for the job.  There is a lot more to being qualified  for the Supreme Court than pedigree  and judicial experience.  Judicial philosophy and one’s approach to judging and the law are most  important.  All these factors and more must be  looked at and weighed before deciding  if a nominee is qualified.  I have done so and it is clear to me  that Judge Alito should be confirmed.  A good place to begin is with Judge  Alito’s  record on  the Third Circuit  Court of Appeals.  He has participated  in over  3,000  cases and written over 300 opinions.  His record in those cases shows that  he is fair and impartial. And that he  understands the law and the judicial  process.  His opinions are written clearly and  provide clear guidance to the  lower  courts.  Clarity  is  something we certainly  need on the Supreme Court.  The clarity and  fairness of Judge  Alito’s opinions speak well to his qualifications.  But what speaks volumes is that his  critics have been unable to find a single case he participated in to show that  he is unqualified as a judge.  That is not to say that his critics  have not tried. But to use any case  against him—critics have had to distort the record or confuse the issue.  Judge Alito’s opponents are trying to  stop his nomination.  They are concerned he will be a vote  for the rule of law and the Constitution. And not a  judicial activist to  their liking on the Supreme Court.  The framers of the Constitution created a system of government where the  peoples’ voices are  to be  expressed  through their elected representatives.  All  Senators  and Representatives  stand for election and are responsible  to the people of their States or districts.  The President is accountable to the  entire Nation and must face the people  in every State.  The Justices of the Supreme Court  never have to face voters.  That is why the framers gave the legislative powers to the Congress.  And that is why they gave the administrative powers to the President.  We—who make policy decisions—are  accountable to the voters.  The Justices of the Supreme Court  are not.  At  its  simplest—that  is what  is  meant by the rule of law. We are a Nation of laws—starting with the most  basic law, the Constitution.  The Constitution spells out the roles  of the branches of Government.  It sets out the role to the courts—  which is to settle legal disputes between parties, and not to set national  policy.  The Supreme Court is also to be a  last check on the legislative and executive branches when they clearly violate  the Constitution—but not to override  policy decisions when the Constitution  is silent.  Judge Alito  has  a  demonstrated  record of respecting the rule of law and  the will of the people through their  elected representatives.  That disturbs some who belong to  this body.  It bothers  them  to know  that  if  Judge Alito and others like him are on  the Supreme Court—then the steady  advance of courts acting as a policy-  making branch of government will be  halted.  Judge Alito has shown respect for the  rule of law throughout his career on  the bench—and even before that when  serving in the Reagan Administration.  He understands that each branch of  government has a unique role to play.  And he understands that only two are  accountable to the people.  I take great comfort in Judge Alito’s  understanding that there is a place in  our system of government for policy  making—and that the place is not the  courts.  Many  of Judge Alito’s  opponents  view the courts as just another policy  making branch of government.  In other countries that may be true.  But in the United States it is not.  Our judges are insulated from public  pressure.  It is this way so that they can make  impartial  and  fair  judgments  on  cases—no matter how popular or unpopular the result.

13,48,2006-01-25,Mr. REED.," Mr. President, before I  comment on the nomination, I would  like to recognize and thank several  people who have been very helpful in  preparing my comments: Kara Stein,  Justin Florence, and Sharon Rapport.  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the RECORD  a series of letters from national organizations with respect to issues of church  and state separation and the nomination of Judge Alito.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  AMERICANSUNITEDFORSEPARATION  OFCHURCHANDSTATE,  Washington, DC, January 10, 2006.  Hon. ARLENSPECTER,  Chairman, Committee on  the Judiciary, U.S.  Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington,  DC.  Hon. PATRICKLEAHY,  Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,  U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.  AND RANKING  DEAR CHAIRMAN SPECTER MEMBERLEAHY: Americans United for Separation of Church and State urges you to oppose the confirmation of Judge Samuel A.  Alito, Jr. to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Americans  United for Separation of Church and State  represents more than 75,000 individual members and 9,500 clergy nationwide, as well as  cooperating houses of worship and other religious bodies committed to the preservation  of religious liberty. We oppose the confirmation of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court because his record demonstrates that he would  fundamentally alter First Amendment law  and immediately put at risk many of the  crucial protections for religious minorities  that the Supreme Court has recognized and  consistently enforced over the past sixty  years.  Legal scholars have understood the First  Amendment’s religion clauses as striking a  balance between the religious and political  rights of individuals and groups within our  society. There  is a necessary tension between the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause, which serves to balance  the sometimes competing interests of individuals’ freedom of conscience against the  requirement that the state be neutral with  respect  to  religious  viewpoints.  Justice  O’Connor has been successful  in ensuring  that public expression did not turn into government favoritism or state coercion of religious beliefs.  During his  fifteen year  tenure on  the  United States Court of Appeals for the Third  Circuit, however, Judge Alito has  shown  himself to have a view of the First Amendment,  particularly  of  the Establishment  Clause, that differs dramatically from both  Justice O’Connor’s judicial philosophy and  the settled understanding of fundamental Establishment Clause principles that has guided the Supreme Court’s decisions for at least  six decades. Indeed, early on, Judge Alito acknowledged his disagreement with the Supreme Court on its Establishment Clause jurisprudence. When applying for a position in  the Reagan Administration Department of  Justice, Judge Alito declared that his ‘‘deep  interest  in constitutional  law  [was] motivated in large part by disagreement with the  Warren Court decisions, particularly in areas  [such as] the Establishment Clause. . . .’’ As  evidenced by his longstanding appeals court  record, we remain concerned that such a motivation taints his view today.  There is much at stake for the future of religious liberty as a result of Justice O’Connor’s retirement and Judge Alito’s nomination to take her place on the Supreme Court.  As Justice O’Connor has recognized,  it  is  vital that our longstanding Establishment  Clause protections remain in place:  ‘‘At a time when we see around the world  the violent consequences of the assumption  of religious authority by government, Americans may count themselves fortunate: Our  regard for constitutional boundaries has protected us from similar travails, while allowing private religious exercise to flourish. . .  Those who would renegotiate the boundaries  between church and state must therefore answer a difficult question: Why would we  trade a system that has served us so well for  one  that has  served  others  so  poorly?’’  (McCreary County, Kentucky v. ACLU of  Kentucky, 125 S. Ct. 2722, 2746 (O’Connor, J.,  concurring)).  In the Establishment Clause area, replacing Justice O’Connor with Judge Alito likely  would have a profound effect on the religious  freedoms that our dual constitutional commitments to free exercise and separation of  church and state have long ensured. Both the  straightforward holdings and the underlying  tenor of Judge Alito’s decisions in Establishment Clause cases contrast sharply with Justice O’Connor’s views. Throughout her career  on the Court, Justice O’Connor has been  keenly attuned to the plight of religious minorities in society as a whole, and most especially  in  the public  schools. But Judge  Alito’s focus has been elsewhere: on religious  majorities’ ability to express their views  through governmental instrumentalities, at  government owned facilities, and in government-organized enterprises like the public  schools. Judge Alito has given broad license  to religious majorities to use the public  schools and other official settings to broadcast their religious messages without regard  for the competing rights and interests of religious minorities.  Because Judge Alito has not extended the  same protections to all Americans that he  has granted to politically powerful religious  majorities, the Senate should decline to confirm his appointment as an associate justice  of the U.S. Supreme Court.

14,55,2006-01-25,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Washington is recognized.  ,2006
15,55,2006-01-25,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, I rise  this evening to discuss my vote on the  confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito,  Jr., to the U.S. Supreme Court. After  meeting with Judge Alito and studying  his record and comparing his answers  to my criteria for judicial nominees, I  have  decided  to  vote  against  confirming Judge Samuel Alito, Jr., as an  Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme  Court.  The next Justice will have the power  to change the Court, change the country, and change our rights for generations. Judge Alito has a very troubling  record. In his hearing and in our private meeting he did not show that he  will be an independent judge who will  uphold the rights and liberties of all  Americans. With our rights and freedoms on the line, I will not take a  chance on Judge Alito because I have  serious questions about his independence and his commitment to protecting  our rights and our liberties.  As with past nominees, I have evaluated this nominee based on my longstanding criteria, which ask:  Is the  nominee qualified, ethical, and honest?  Will the nominee be fair, evenhanded,  and independent? And will the nominee  uphold the rights and liberties of all  Americans?  Personally, I got involved in politics  because  of  another Supreme Court  nomination, that of Clarence Thomas.  At the time, I was frustrated that average Americans didn’t have a voice in  the process that affects them so much.  I have worked to be the voice of working families in my State, and I have  asked the questions they would ask. I  am voting to protect their interests.  I recognize the significance of a seat  on the U.S. Supreme Court. The Constitution directs Senators to provide  advice  and  consent  on  all  judicial  nominees, and the people of my home  State of Washington have trusted me  to be their advocate to safeguard their  rights as I vote on judicial nominees.  I take that responsibility very seriously. That  is why I have reviewed  Judge Alito’s past writings, studied his  answers to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and asked to meet with him in  my office.  A lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is a tremendous grant of  unchecked power. If the Supreme Court  rules incorrectly, there is no option for  appeal. There is no backstop. Any seat  on the Supreme Court can affect our  rights for generations. But there are  three  factors  involved  in  this  particular nomination that make it even  more significant. Those factors are the  times, the seat, and the process.  First, I am well aware that we are  living in historic times. Each day, it  seems that the rights of the individuals  and the power of government are being  tested. We are at war overseas, we face  threats from terrorism here at home,  and the current administration is pushing the bounds of governmental power  in remarkable ways.  The Bush  administration  has  arrested U.S.  citizens and held  them  without access to the courts. It has run  secret prisons around the world. It has  expressed views on torture that put our  own troops at risk. As we recently  learned, the administration has been  spying on American citizens without  prior approval from a court. These are  grave issues which will likely come before  the Supreme Court. How  that  Court rules will affect the rights of our  citizens, the balance of power between  the branches of our Government, and  the balance of power between our citizens and Government.  So as I make my decision on this  nominee, I am very mindful of the historic times we are living in and the serious questions  this Supreme Court  will address in the coming years.  Secondly, I am very mindful of the  seat that is open on the Supreme Court  and  its  significance. Justice Sandra  Day O’Connor was a pioneer in the field  of law, and her decisions will shape the  lives of the American people for generations to come.  As I said when she announced her resignation, we live in a better America  due to her 24 years of service on the  Court. Justice O’Connor was often a  swing vote on those critical decisions.  Her successor could easily change the  balance of power on the Court, which  could dramatically shift the Court’s  ruling on so many issues. Because this  is a  swing  seat  that could  tip  the  Court’s balance of power, we need to  make sure that the person we confirm  is someone who will protect our rights  and liberties.  Some have suggested that I should  just go along and support the President’s nominee. That is not the way I  make decisions. I have criteria that I  use to evaluate all judicial nominees,  and Judge Alito is no different.  Third, I am also well aware of how  Judge Alito came to be the President’s  nominee. The President, as we all remember, had nominated his counsel,  Harriet Miers, to the High Court, but  Ms. Miers was not acceptable to the  rightwing of the President’s party. I  found it very interesting that before  her nomination, Republicans were demanding an up-or-down vote on the  Senate floor for anyone the President  nominated. But when President Bush  nominated Ms. Miers,  suddenly we  stopped hearing that urgent call for an  up-or-down vote. In  fact, Ms. Miers’  nomination was killed by the President’s own party, apparently because  she did not meet the ideological test of  the extreme right.  I recount this history tonight not to  diminish Judge Alito but to point out  that his nomination comes before the  Senate in the context of an ideological  battle that has been created by the  rightwing. When the President nominated  Judge  Alito,  the  rightwing  cheered, confident that he would vote  their way. That  reaction gives me  pause as to whether this nominee can  keep an open mind on the issues that  come before him. If the rightwing is so  confident that he is going to vote their  way, how can all of us be confident  that he will put our country’s needs  first? That alone does not suggest that  Judge Alito cannot be fair, but it did  lead me to explore those questions diligently.  Given the importance of the Supreme  Court and the background of the times  and the seat and the process, I began to  evaluate how Judge Alito measured up  to my standards for judicial nominees.  Judge Alito’s record contains some disturbing statements, rulings, and pronouncements that require detailed explanations. Does he still hold some of  those views? In many cases, we don’t  know.  I wish Judge Alito had been  more forthcoming during his hearing.  At the same time, many of the things  he said and refused to say spoke volumes.  As I noted earlier, my standards are  simple: Is the nominee qualified, ethical, and honest? Will the nominee be  fair and evenhanded and independent?  And will the nominee uphold the rights  and liberties of all Americans?  I am very comfortable that Judge  Alito is qualified, he is honest, and he  is ethical. But whether he will be fair  and evenhanded  is another question.  And, as was discussed at his hearing, he  does have a troubling record for fighting for the government and corporations and against individuals. He seems  to favor the entrenched power over the  little guy. His record does not give me  the  confidence  that  everyone who  comes before the Court will be treated  fairly.  I am also deeply concerned about  Judge Alito’s independence. We rely on  our courts as a critical check and balance against government abuse. That  independent check helps to protect our  rights. This  is especially  important  today because of the growing questions  of the expansion of Executive power.  The Supreme Court will need  to  evaluate whether recent Executive actions are constitutional. Here Judge  Alito’s unbalanced minority view of  the scope of Executive power tells me  he does not have the independence to  be an adequate check on the Government’s abuse of our rights.

16,62,2006-01-25,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached editorial by the Arizona Republic, dated  January 24, be printed in the RECORDof  this debate on  the  confirmation of  Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court. The editors’ support for  Judge Alito  is welcome,  and  their  statement that ‘‘Judge Alito is a superior candidate for the high court regardless of his political leanings’’ is absolutely true.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Arizona Republic, Jan. 24, 2006]  ALITO: WISEINTHEWAYSOF‘‘WHYS’’  If America is not on pins and needles over  today’s Senate Judiciary Committee vote on  Samuel Alito for the U.S. Supreme Court,  perhaps this Web site headline on Monday  helps provide an explanation:  ‘‘Feingold unsure of Alito’’—WSAW–TV,  Wausau, Wis.  If one of the Senate’s most solidly liberal  members, Sen. Russ Feingold, D–Wis., remains  uncertain  about President Bush’s  nominee one day prior to his scheduled Judiciary vote, prospects for derailing the nomination in the full Senate would seem dim.  We’ll see how the votes pan out. Still, it is  worth wondering: Where did the drama go?  The most obvious answer among many is  that Alito is a superior candidate for the  high  court  regardless  of  his  political  leanings. After 15 years on the bench, Alito  has established a lengthy track record as a  fair jurist who has struck a proper balance  between his own constitutional interpretations and those of other courts.  Even his obvious discomfort at the beginning of his Judiciary hearings worked to  Alito’s favor. The candidate is bookish and  uncomfortable in the limelight? All the better for a position on the nation’s most deliberative, most cerebral panel.  Many commentators have noted that the  even-keeled Alito presents himself far differently from Robert Bork, the famously rejected conservative nominee of 1987.  Well, yes. Alito was not combative in the  face of relentless grilling, as Bork was. And  he wears no wicked-looking beard.  But it would seem that Alito’s imminent  success is less a matter of televised theatrics, facial adornment or even judicial philosophy than it is a reflection of the public’s  expectations of a jurist.  Unquestionably, the public wants jurists to  be fair, and it seems to believe that Alito  will  live up to that standard. The public  wants a jurist who respects the judgment of  other courts, but it also wants one who understands that Job 1 is to interpret the Constitution.  Sometimes, Supreme Court  judges have  found those two directives in conflict. The  public, and most of the senators who represent it, seems to believe Alito will find his  way through those conflicts fairly and intelligently.  But most of all, Alito appears to have won  over converts because he has demonstrated  the trait that increasingly seems to distinguish great  jurists  from mediocre-to-good  ones: He can explain why.  We all wish to know why. With all due respect to President Bush’s previous nominee,  Harriet Miers, it was not enough that—wink,  wink—her vote on the ‘‘right’’ issues was ensured.  Indeed,  that constituted  the most  damning argument against her.  Alito, by contrast, has won support because senators believe that his decisions will  be grounded and argued in the facts of the  law, not in some predisposed political prejudice that is unsupported by the case before  him.  And that is a powerful argument for Alito  all by itself.  ",2006
17,62,2006-01-25,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I rise in support of Judge Alito’s nomination to the  Supreme Court and urge my colleagues  to quickly confirm him.  I begin by observing that the party-  line vote in the Judiciary Committee  yesterday raises a troubling question  for the full Senate, and it is basic to  our deliberations. What is the proper  test for determining whether to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court?  Until very recently, the Senate has  evaluated whether  the nominee was  qualified—that is, whether he or she  possessed the requisite experience, integrity, and temperament to serve. But  a new test has been proposed by Judiciary Committee Democrats: will  the  nominee provide assurances that he or  she will rule a particular way on cases  sure to come before the Court?  Before I discuss the ramifications of  that  troubling  question,  though,  I  would  like  to apply  the  traditional  test—the proper test—to the nominee  before us.  A Supreme Court Justice should be  an experienced judge. Samuel Alito has  more Federal judicial experience than  all but one nominee in U.S. history,  Horace Lurton, who was nominated by  President Taft. In 15 years of service,  Judge Alito has authored more than 360  opinions and participated in more than  4,800  decisions.  It  is  an  extensive  record.  A Supreme Court Justice should be  deeply  familiar with American constitutional law. Judge Alito has spent  his entire professional  life grappling  with  constitutional  jurisprudence—  serving as a Federal prosecutor at both  the trial and appellate  level, as the  government’s  lawyer before  the Supreme Court, and as a constitutional  lawyer in the Justice Department before becoming a  judge. Nobody who  watched Judge Alito’s testimony would  deny that he is a brilliant legal thinker  with  a  deep  and  textured  understanding of our Nation’s jurisprudence.  A Supreme Court Justice should have  unassailable integrity. Here, I look to  those who know him best.  First, the American Bar Association,  in  finding him unanimously  ‘‘well-  qualified’’  to  serve, conducted more  than 300 interviews with people who  know Judge Alito on a professional and  personal basis. They have reported that  the high praise for Judge Alito’s integrity was  ‘‘consistent  and  virtually  unanimous.’’ I repeat, it was ‘‘unanimous.’’  Second, let’s look at what the judges  of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Third Circuit had to say. Seven current  and former judges testified on Judge  Alito’s behalf—judges who were nominated by Presidents Johnson, Nixon,  Reagan, the first President Bush, and  Clinton. Collectively, they have served  with Judge Alito  for more  than  75  years. They praised his fairness, his integrity, his open-mindedness, his temperament, his intellect, and his devotion to the rule of law.  Finally, a Supreme Court Justice  must know the difference between the  judicial role and the legislative or executive function. This qualification is  sometimes difficult to decipher, but  there are several clues that can guide  us.  First, a long judicial record helps,  and Judge Alito gives us that. There is  not a trace of judicial activism in his  record.  Second, a judge cannot have a policy  agenda. He or she must defer to the political branches on policy questions.  Judge Alito agreed,  testifying,  ‘‘We  [judges] are not policymakers and we  shouldn’t be implementing any sort of  policy agenda or policy preferences  that we have.’’ Judge Alito’s colleagues  on the Third Circuit appeals court confirmed  this.  For  example,  Judge  Aldisert testified that ‘‘at no time during the 15 years that Judge Alito has  served with me and with our colleagues  on the court, and the countless number  of times that we have sat together in  private conference after hearing oral  argument, has he ever expressed anything that could be described as an  agenda.’’  Third, a judge must not twist statutes or constitutional provisions  to  reach a result he favors. As Judge Alito  testified,  ‘‘Judges don’t have the authority  to change  the Constitution.  The whole theory of  judicial review  . . .  is contrary to that notion.’’ In  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:00 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S25JA6.REC S25JA6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006
18,76,2006-01-25,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor an heroic American  who has fallen while serving his country in Operation Enduring Freedom in  Afghanistan. First  Sergeant Tobias  Meister died December 28, 2005, when a  bomb was detonated near his humvee  just south of Asadabad, Afghanistan.  First Sergeant Meister was part of the  Sand Springs based 486th Civil Affairs  Battalion  and was  assigned  to  the  Army Reserve’s 321st Civil Affairs Brigade based in San Antonio, TX. My  deepest sympathies go out to his wife  Alicia, his 1 year old son Will, his parents David and Judy, his brother and  many more family and friends.  First Sergeant Meister was born in  Kingsley,  IA  and  graduated  from  Remsen-Union High School in 1994. He  was employed by Horizon Natural Resources, an oil and gas firm, after he  had successfully completed a business  administration  degree with  a  concentration  in  international  business  from the University of Texas at San  Antonio.  Tobias Meister joined the Iowa National Guard in 1992 and served as an  infantryman before transferring to the  U.S. Army Reserve  in 1998. He was  named Drill Sergeant of the Year in  2002, the award for the Nation’s top  Army Reserve drill sergeant. He will be  remembered for his patriotism, his love  for his country and his fellow soldiers.  As written by comrades on his website,  he had ‘‘so much passion for what he  was doing, so much patriotism it was a  privilege and an honor to work with  him.’’ I urge all of my colleagues here  and all Americans to extend their prayers to the  family of a truly heroic  American, First Sergeant Tobias Meister.

19,76,2006-01-25,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I rise  today to pay tribute to Roland Carroll  Barvels who died in Iraq on January 18,  2006.  Roland  was  employed  with  DynCorp  International  and was  assigned to the Civilian Police Advisory  Training Team in Iraq. He was helping  to train and equip a 350,000-member  Iraqi  security  force. Sadly, he was  killed when a roadside bomb struck his  convoy near Basra.  Prior to joining DynCorp in November 2005, Barvels answered his Nation’s  call to duty to protect and defend this  great  country. After  serving  for  12  years in the military, he became a police officer. Beginning his career  in  Minnesota, Barvels eventually served  in law enforcement for nearly 20 years  including his most recent position with  the Aberdeen Police Department.  Friends and former co-workers at the  Aberdeen Police Department remember  Roland with deep admiration. One colleague remarked, ‘‘During his time at  the police department, he diligently  patrolled the streets of our city providing safety and security to the citizens in our community. Roland possessed an incredible ability to talk to  people and [to] make anyone he talked  to feel at ease.’’  Roland Barvels bravely served our  country in so many ways. His wife and  children are in the thoughts and prayers of my family during this difficult  time. It is my sincere hope that they  will take comfort knowing Ronald’s  long and distinguished career of protecting those most in need is truly admirable, and his dedication to helping  others is an inspiration to us all.  I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the  family and friends of Roland Barvels.  He will be missed, but his service to  our Nation will never be forgotten.

20,76,2006-01-25,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today with a heavy heart and deep  sense of gratitude to honor the life of a  brave young man from Lafayette. Matthew Frantz, 23 years old, died on January 20 when an improvised explosive  device detonated near his vehicle during a patrol near Al Huwijah in Iraq.  With his entire life before him, Matthew risked everything to fight for the  values Americans hold close  to our  hearts, in a land halfway around the  world.  Following in the family tradition of  service, Matthew had been committed  to joining the military since he was in  the second grade. A 2001 graduate of  Lafayette Jefferson High School, his  teachers recalled how eager he was to  join the service, as well as what a decent and friendly student he was. One  of his teachers told a local news outlet,  ‘‘Matt was very excited about being  part of the military. It was what he  wanted to do. He was just a young man  that wanted  to  serve his country.’’  Matthew had been in the military for  nearly 2 years, but this was his first deployment to Iraq. He arrived there only  4 months ago as a counterintelligence  specialist.  Matthew was killed while serving his  country  in Operation Iraqi Freedom.  He was a member of the 1st Special  Troops Battalion in the 101st Airborne  Division based at Fort Campbell, KT.  This brave young soldier leaves behind  his  father  and mother, James  and  Marilyn Frantz; his brothers, Chris and  Eric, who also serve in the military;  and his fiance, Amalia Cerbin.  Today, I join Matthew’s family and  friends in mourning his death. While  we struggle to bear our sorrow over  this loss, we can also take pride in the  example he  set, bravely  fighting  to  make the world a safer place. It is his  courage and strength of character that  people will remember when they think  of Matthew, a memory that will burn  brightly during these continuing days  of conflict and grief.  Matthew was known for his dedication to his family and his love of country. Today and always, Matthew will  be  remembered by  family members,  friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true  American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving  his country.  As I search for words to do justice in  honoring Matthew’s sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln’s remarks  as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ‘‘We cannot  dedicate, we  cannot  consecrate, we  cannot hallow this ground. The brave  men, living and dead, who struggled  here, have consecrated it, far above our  poor power  to add or detract. The  world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never  forget what they did here.’’ This statement is just as true today as it was  nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain  that the impact of Matthew’s actions  will live on far longer that any record  of these words.  It is my sad duty to enter the name  of Matthew C. Frantz in the official  record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound  commitment to  freedom, democracy,  and peace. When I think about this just  cause in which we are engaged and the  unfortunate pain that comes with the  loss of our heroes, I hope that families  like Matthew’s can find comfort in the  words of the prophet Isaiah who said,  ‘‘He will swallow up death in victory;  and the Lord God will wipe away tears  from off all faces.’’  May God grant strength and peace to  those who mourn, and may God be with  all of you, as I know He is with Matthew.

The Cathedral Choir School of Delaware has been chosen to perform on  January 25, 2006, for an audience at the  White House that will  include First  Lady Laura Bush. They will also be  presented with the Coming Up Taller  Award. This award  is  the Nation’s  highest honor for afterschool and out-  of-school programs that use arts and  humanities to enrich the lives of children. Created in 1998, this awards program is a project of the President’s  Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in partnership with Institute  of Museum and Library Services, the  National Endowment for the Arts and  the National Endowment for the Humanities.  Cathedral Choir School has had an  enormous positive impact on the lives  of the students who pass through its  halls. The more than 50 students, ranging in age from 7 to 17, who attend the  school are encouraged to learn the enduring values of discipline, responsibility, leadership and teamwork.  With more than 800 alumni since its  inception in 1883, the Cathedral choir  school has had a positive impact on  both the lives of the students who have  had the privilege of participating  in  this choir school and the lives of those  around them. By training Delaware’s  young people in life skills and community involvement, the Cathedral Choir  School has consistently enhanced the  lives of all that it touches.  I would like to acknowledge the hard  work and dedication that the paid staff  and volunteers of the Cathedral Choir  School have demonstrated over  the  years. Under the direction today of Dr.  Darryl Roland,  these dedicated men  and women have helped the lives of  countless children. During his time of  overseeing the Cathedral Choir School,  Dr. Roland has served as a shining example of what is possible when good  and caring adults decide to make a  positive difference in the lives of children.  I would especially like to acknowledge the commitment and enthusiasm  that the  individual members of the  choir have shown during their time  with  the  choir. These  outstanding  young people have made a personal  commitment  to  themselves  and  to  their communities to challenge themselves and try their best to live up to  the high standards of the Cathedral  Choir School. The rehearsals and afterschool music training are done with a  sense of love for artistic expression. It  takes a special type of person to share  that gift with the rest of us.  The faculty and students of the Cathedral Choir School are to be commended and applauded  for their extraordinary efforts. Their dedication  and love of music continues to serve as  an example of what is possible when  young people are given the opportunity  to follow their dreams. All of Delaware  is proud of them.∑  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF MAURICE  GUERRY  ∑",2006

Maurice was a sheep rancher from  Three Creek, ID, who was known for  his ready smile, charm and unequivocal  love for his wife, family and the land  on which he made his livelihood. I had  the distinct privilege of working with  him a number of times on collaborative  land management endeavors and remember well that he made an extraordinary effort to get those who thought  themselves at odds to  find common  ground and work together. He saw the  wisdom and value of this approach and  was respected for it.  With his sheep dog keeping a sharp  eye from the back of his truck, Maurice diligently cared for his land and  was known to carry candy with him to  share in case he met someone on one of  the remote roads near his ranch. He  and his wife, Marlene, would put together a dinner party for dozens at the  drop of a hat, welcoming  strangers  with open arms. He was  especially  close to his fellow Basque friends.  Maurice had a soul of generosity,  gentleness, and wisdom and knew the  value of hard, honest work. This legacy  is his gift and it lives on in his family  and friends. My prayers are with them  during this difficult time.∑  TRIBUTE TO DOUGLAS W. BOOK  ∑",2006

Doug Book began his career as a full-  time patrolman  in 1968 and quickly  rose amongst the ranks of his department until he was appointed chief of  police in 1973. He served faithfully in  this capacity until his passing. In addition to his dedicated service to his  community, Doug also served Iowa as  the head of the North Central Iowa  Narcotics Task Force for the past 10  years. Doug also served as chairman of  the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy  Board and as president of the Iowa Association of Chiefs of Police and Peace  Officers.  Doug’s constant support and guidance for his fellow officers did not stop  at Iowa’s borders but spilled over to  other departments in New York City.  Chief Book joined a group of Iowa police officers as part of a critical incident  stress management  team  that  helped New York City police officers  cope with the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  One of Doug’s colleagues described  him simply as a ‘‘good guy, a good cop,  and a good  friend.’’ His  friends and  family should be very proud of what he  has done  for so many people.

26,97,2006-01-25,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  am pleased to join with Senators LAUTENBERG, SNOWE, SCHUMER, COLEMAN  and many others to introduce legislation to reimburse States for prescription drug expenses they have incurred  for their residents who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. States  have had no other option but to step in  and ensure seniors can still get their  drugs because the implementation of  the new Medicare drug benefit has been  so poorly handled by the Bush administration.  The  faulty  implementation of  the  new drug benefit has caused a major  health  emergency  in California and  States across the country, particularly  for seniors with chronic and debilitating diseases who rely on multiple  medications every day to keep them  alive.  It  is  incomprehensible to me that  with all the money and time given to  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services, CMS, to implement this new  drug benefit, stories emerge every day  of  seniors  and  disabled  individuals  being hospitalized because  they are  being told they have to pay hundreds of  dollars  for  their medications which  they cannot afford and thus don’t take.  Because of  severe glitches  in  the  database run by CMS, these individuals  are leaving pharmacies without their  medications or are making undue sacrifices to pay for costs they should not  have incurred in the first place.  So far, more than 24 States and the  District of Columbia have stepped in to  say they will cover the cost of prescription drugs for their residents who are  dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and who cannot access lifesaving  and life sustaining drugs as a result of  Federal incompetence.  Earlier this week, the Governor of  California and California’s State legislative  leaders announced a plan  to  make $150 million available for 30 days  to cover drug costs for dual eligible individuals who have fallen through the  system. In California, these individuals  account for more than 1 million of the  State’s 4 million total Medicare recipients.  Problems with the Bush administration’s implementation of the drug benefit have cost California $5.5 million to  fill 63,000 prescriptions, as of January  18. I have no doubt these costs are just  the beginning.  Unless these significant implementation errors are fixed immediately, the  new drug benefit amounts to a massive  unfunded mandate. The Bush administration must reimburse States, in full,  for the drug costs they have absorbed  as a result of major implementation errors that occurred on their watch.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  today  with  Senators  SNOWE, SCHUMERand COLEMANwill ensure that States are repaid in full by  the Federal Government for all costs  associated with prescription drugs for  dual eligible  individuals. The States  did not create the crisis felt by our Nation’s poorest and most vulnerable seniors and disabled and the States should  not be responsible for costs associated  with a Federal program that was intended  to provide  these  individuals  with comprehensive prescription drug  coverage at little or no cost.  It  is  simply unacceptable  for  the  Bush administration to tell States and  the Congress not to worry because the  private health insurance plans will reimburse States for the costs they’ve incurred. States should not be made to  wait to be reimbursed because of implementation foul-ups caused by CMS.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.∑  LAUTENBERG,  By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. REID, Mrs. MURRAY,  Mr. BINGAMAN, Mrs. LINCOLN,  Mr. KENNEDY, Mrs. CLINTON,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:00 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00097 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S25JA6.REC S25JA6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006
27,104,2006-01-25,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, what  is past is prologue. Today, we see history repeating itself. In 1978, President  Carter signed into law the ‘‘Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,’’ successfully concluding years of debate on the  power of the President to conduct national security wiretapping.  As a result of lengthy hearings and  consultation, Congress  enacted  that  law with broad bipartisan support. Its  purpose was clear—to put a check on  the power of the President to use wiretaps in the name of national security.  One of the clear purposes of that law  was to require the government to obtain a  judicial warrant  for all electronic  surveillance  in  the  United  States  in which  communications of  U.S. citizens might be intercepted. The  Act established a secret court, the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court,  to review wiretapping applications and  guarantee that any such electronic surveillance  followed  the  rule  of  law.  Since 1979, the special court has approved nearly 19,000 applications and  denied only 4. Last year, the Administration reached an all-time-high with  the number of applications granted.  In the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Congress established the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance could be conducted  in the  United States  for national  security  purposes. One of the principal goals of  the legislation was to ensure that information obtained from illegal wiretaps could not be used to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. We even made sure  that there would be criminal penalties  for anyone who failed to comply with  these rules.  The PATRIOT Act did not give the  President the authority to spy on anyone without impartial judicial review—  and neither did the Joint Resolution,  enacted in 2001, authorizing the use of  force against those responsible for the  attacks of September 11th.  The President seemed to agree. In  2004, in Buffalo he stated categorically  that  ‘‘any  time  that you hear  the  United States talking about a wiretap,  it requires a court order.’’ He said that  ‘‘Nothing  had  changed—when we’re  talking about chasing down terrorists,  we’re talking about getting a court  order before we do so.’’  Now, however, the President and the  administration claim they do not have  to comply with the law. Just yesterday, the administration again asserted  its constitutional authority to eavesdrop on any person within the United  States—without judicial or legislative  oversight and it claims that the Congress implicitly granted such power in  the Joint Resolution of 2001.  But that Joint Resolution says nothing about domestic electronic surveillance. As Justice O’Connor has said, ‘‘A  state of war is not a blank check for  the president when  it comes to the  rights of the nation’s citizens.’’  The bipartisan 9/11 Commission made  clear that the Executive Branch has  the burden of proof to justify why a  particular governmental power should  be retained—and Congress has the responsibility to see that adequate guidelines and oversight are made available.  The Executive Branch has failed to  meet the 9/11 Commissioners’ burden of  proof. The American people are not  convinced  that  these  surveillance  methods achieve the right balance between our national security and protection of our civil liberties.  These issues go to the heart of what  it means to have a  free society.  If  President Bush can make his own rules  for domestic surveillance, Big Brother  has run amok. If the President believes  that winning the war on terror requires  new surveillance capabilities, he has a  responsibility to work with Congress to  make appropriate changes in existing  law. He is not above the law.  Congress and the American people  deserve full and honest answers about  the Administration’s  domestic  electronic surveillance activities. On December 22, 2005, I asked the President  to provide us with answers before the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  began  hearings on Judge Alito’s nomination  to the Supreme Court. We got no response. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin separate  hearings on February 6 on the President’s actions. Instead of providing us  with the documents the Administration relied upon, the Justice Department continues to circulate summaries  and  ‘‘white papers’’ on the legal authorities it purports to have to ignore  the law. It now appears that the President did so on at least thirty occasions  after September 11. There is no legitimate purpose  in denying access by  Members of Congress to all of the legal  thought and analysis that the President relied upon when he authorized  these activities.  Every 45 days, the President ordered  these activities to be reviewed by the  Attorney General,  the White House  Counsel and the Inspector General of  the National Security Agency. That’s  not good enough. These are all executive branch appointees who report directly to the President.  Congress spent seven years considering and enacting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It was not a  hastily conceived idea.

28,6,2006-01-31,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself as much time as I may consume.  Today we mourn the loss of a dignified and peaceful woman who showed  us by example how to pursue change in  the world, despite the costs of that  struggle.  My friends in the Congress, I have  known Coretta King since I went south  during the civil rights movement as a  lawyer. She was a vibrant, consistent,  totally dedicated partner with her husband. She helped him stay strong, especially in the beginning when there were  so many threats and challenges to the  revolutionary idea that we would start  a civil rights movement in the South  itself. Many people tried to dissuade  Martin from that course. As a child of  the segregated South, she agreed that  the movement should begin at the seat  of Jim Crow.  When faced with the loss of her husband, Coretta remained able to advance  their vision of a free and equal America. She continued her husband’s legacy by devoting her life to advancing  racial and economic justice and for the  rights of women, children, the poor,  and the homeless. She also fought for  employment, education and health care  opportunities  for all. Most notably,  this woman  stood  for  equality and  peace, the very virtues to which her  husband had dedicated his life.  It was with Coretta’s approval that 4  days after Martin’s assassination on  April 4, 1968, that I introduced a bill to  name a holiday in his honor. Coretta  was at the heart of this effort, as well  as were many others to continue the  life and work of King. In 1969, I joined  Coretta at the King Center in Atlanta  to kick off the campaign for a national  holiday. She orchestrated a national  grassroots movement that urged passage of this legislation and would come  to Congress in 1979 and 1980 and 1981  and 1982 and 1983 to testify before the  Congress and urge support of the King  holiday. It was with her diligence and  perseverance that that holiday bill was  passed in 1983 and first observed in 1986.  Today, upon the passing of Mrs. King,  we will pledge to continue the King  legacy as she has for the past 37 years.  As  the  life and work of  the Kings  touched millions during their lifetime  in this country and around the world,  we here in Congress must ensure that  their lives continue to impact millions  more in the coming years, and that is  why I am so proud to join the rest of us  in supporting and urging passage of the  King resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I would now yield to the  gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr.  WATT), the distinguished chairman of  the Congressional Black Caucus.  ",2006
29,6,2006-01-31,Mr. WATT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in  support of the resolution honoring the  life and memory of Mrs. Coretta Scott  King and would like to pull up some information  from the resolution  itself  that other people may not focus on because we are  tempted  sometime  to  think  of Mrs. King  as  simply  the  spouse, the wife of Dr. Martin Luther  King, and I think it would be a grave,  grave mistake for people to do that.  So I first point to the part of the resolution that says, Whereas Mrs. King  received honorary doctorates from over  60 colleges and universities and authored three books. That  in and of  itself is something that, aside from her  commitment to the civil rights movement and her companionship and partnership with Dr. Martin Luther King,  would in and of itself be deserving of  particular note.  Second, I pull up the fact that, as has  been pointed out by my colleague, Representative JOHNLEWIS, Coretta Scott  came of age in the segregated South  and  took an active  interest  in  the  emerging civil rights movement. This  coming of age in the segregated South  is something that I think we should  not allow to go unnoticed because either, in many ways like slavery or the  movement itself, either segregation or  slavery  tramped down people or  it  made them stand up and raise their  shoulders and raise their sights. And  when you find somebody like a John  Lewis and a Coretta Scott King who  fall into the latter category, it is important to take note of that fact.  So then I go to the first paragraph of  the resolution, and when I first read  the resolution, I kind of pushed back  from the  first paragraph because  it  says Whereas Coretta Scott King was  an inspirational figure and a woman of  great strength, grace and dignity,  I  think most of us focus primarily, if we  knew Coretta Scott King, on the grace  and dignity part of that, and had I kind  of an off the top of the head reaction  would be I would put grace first and I  would put dignity second and then I  would put the word  ‘‘strength.’’ But  when you note that she grew up in the  segregated South, it is really appropriate the way this has been drafted to  put the strength part of that three-part  prong equation first.  b1630  I think it is something that says here  is a woman that is strong and willing  to fight and yet still has grace and dignity.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would just  like to read, on behalf of the members  of the Congressional Black Caucus, the  press release and make a final point. It  says: ‘‘The Congressional Black Caucus  released the following statement: ‘The  Congressional Black Caucus extends its  sincere condolences to the family of  Coretta Scott King, the First Lady of  the Civil Rights Movement. Mrs. King,  who became a symbol of strength and  resolve during the life of Dr. Martin  Luther King, after his death was an inspiration to millions of people around  the world who  sought  justice  and  equality. She has remained the carrier  of the  freedom  flame  for almost 38  years since Dr. King’s death.’’’  And then the following paragraph is  what I want to focus on. It says: ‘‘‘Mrs.  King’s death marks the end of an era,  but certainly not the end of the continued struggle that she was such an integral part of and that African Americans face daily for equity and parity in  education, health care, and employment security.’’’  I do not think we should lose sight of  that last part because the struggle goes  on and we would honor Coretta Scott  King’s memory by keeping that struggle alive until we reach full equality.  As we approach the State of the Union  address tonight, let us not miss the  point that this lady fought and lived  and died for the struggle for equality.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",2006
30,6,2006-01-31,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, it is my  privilege now to yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the honorable  Democratic whip of the House, who I  happen  to know worked with Rosa  Parks. And  I am delighted that he  came to several of her farewell memorial tributes and that he is with us on  the floor today for the resolution for  the late Coretta Scott King.  ",2006
31,6,2006-01-31,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my friend for yielding me the time.  And  I thank the chairman and the  ranking member for bringing this resolution to the floor.  I was honored to stand many a time  on the west wing of the Capitol of the  United States as Mr. CONYERS led the  effort to ensure that America recognized the extraordinary contributions  of one of America’s greatest sons, Martin Luther King, Jr., and that we set a  day aside to recognize not only his contributions but to recommit ourselves  to the objectives that he lived for and  died for. And I want to congratulate  and thank him for the  contributions that he has made to live  out that commitment of Dr. King’s.  Our Nation has  lost a  true hero.  Coretta Scott King was one of the most  eloquent and determined civil rights  activists in our history, both as a partner to her husband, Dr. King, in the  fight for equality and justice in the  United States and as a keeper of his  legacy after his assassination in Memphis on April 4.  Mrs. King’s grace, of which Mr. WATT  spoke  and  of which  the  resolution  speaks, was experienced by all who met  her. Her tenacity ensured that the civil  rights movement that she helped to  pioneer has continued to stay in the  Mr. CONYERS VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:15 Feb 01, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K31JA7.015 H31JAPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

(Applause, the Members rising.)  f  THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES  ",2006
33,13,2006-01-31,The PRESIDENT.," Mr. Speaker, Vice  President CHENEY, Members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court  and Diplomatic Corps, distinguished  guests and fellow citizens:  Today our Nation  lost a beloved,  graceful, courageous woman who called  America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. Tonight we are  comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken  from her so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott  King.  Every time I am invited to this rostrum, I am humbled by the privilege,  and mindful of the history we have  seen together. We have gathered under  this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement. We have served America through  one of the most consequential periods  of our history, and  it has been my  honor to serve with you.  In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there  will always be differences and debate.  But even tough debates can be conducted  in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden  into  anger. To  confront  the  great  issues before us, we must act in a spirit  of good will and respect for one another, and I will do my part. Tonight  the state of our Union is strong, and  together we will make it stronger.  In this decisive year, you and I will  make choices that determine both the  future and the character of our country. We will choose to act confidently  in pursuing the enemies of freedom, or  retreat from our duties in the hope of  an easier life. We will choose to build  our prosperity by  leading the world  economy, or shut ourselves off  from  trade and opportunity. In a complex  and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem  broad and inviting, yet it ends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people, the only way to secure  the peace, the only way to control our  destiny  is by our  leadership, so the  United States of America will continue  to lead.  Abroad, our Nation is committed to a  historic, long-term goal. We seek the  end of tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism.  In reality, the future security of America depends on it. On September 11,  2001, we  found  that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state  7,000 miles away could bring murder  and destruction to our country. Dictatorships shelter terrorists, feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons  of mass destruction. Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect  the rights of their citizens and their  neighbors, and join the fight against  terror. Every step toward freedom in  the world makes our country safer, and  so we will act boldly  in  freedom’s  cause.  Far from being a hopeless dream, the  advance of freedom is the great story  of our time. In 1945, there were about  two dozen lonely democracies in the  world. Today, there are 122. And we are  writing a new chapter in the story of  self-government, with women lining up  to vote in Afghanistan, and millions of  Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and women from Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of  individuals and the necessity of freedom. At the start of 2006, more than  half the people of our world live in  democratic nations. And we do not forget the other half, in places like Syria,  Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and  Iran, because the demands of justice,  and the peace of this world, require  their freedom as well.  No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and  fight  against it. And one of the main sources  of reaction and opposition is radical  Islam, the perversion by a  few of a  noble faith into an ideology of terror  and death. Terrorists like bin Laden  are serious about mass murder, and all  of us must take their declared intentions seriously. They seek to impose a  heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East and  arm themselves with weapons of mass  murder. Their aim is to seize power in  Iraq and use  it as a safe haven to  launch attacks against America and  the  world.  Lacking  the  military  strength to challenge us directly, the  terrorists have chosen the weapon of  fear. When they murder children at a  school  in Beslan, or blow up commuters in London, or behead a bound  captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the  violent to inherit the Earth. But they  have miscalculated: we love our freedom, and we will fight to keep it.

I don’t know  what Senators Reid and Frist  said.  They have  the  time  set  for an  11  o’clock vote. So I am inclined to object  unless——  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is objection. The Senator  from Illinois is recognized.  ",2006

39,27,2006-01-31,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. President, in a  few minutes, we will vote on the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the  Supreme Court. In a few hours, we will  hear the President tell us about his  view of the state of the Union. Without  doubt, Judge Alito today has the votes  to win confirmation. Without doubt,  the President tonight will boast of his  nominee’s victory in this vote. But I  must say that I wish the President  were in a position to do more than  claim partisan victory  tonight. The  Union would be better and stronger and  more unified if we were confirming a  different  nominee—a  nominee  who  would have united us more than divided us. Had he chosen such a person,  the President could have taken the lectern  this  evening  and  rightfully  claimed the mantle of leadership in the  United States of America. Instead, this  is not a day of triumph for anybody except  the conservative minority who  caused the President to capitulate to  their demands when Harriet Miers was  not to their liking. There will be more  votes against this nominee than on any  since Clarence Thomas, who was hardly  a unifying figure.  Tonight, when  the President  announces, to applause, the fact of Judge  Alito’s confirmation, what he should  really hear, because of the partisan nature of his choice, is the sound of one  hand clapping. While some may rejoice  at Judge Alito’s success, millions of  Americans will come to know that the  lasting legacy of this day will be ever  more power for the President and less  autonomy for the individual.  While some may exalt at the packing  of the Court with yet another reliable,  extreme voice in the mold of Scalia  and Thomas, millions of Americans  will be at risk of losing their day in  court when they suffer the yoke of discrimination. Some may celebrate the  elevation of a Judge Alito to the Supreme Court, but millions of Americans will suffer the consequences of a  jurisprudence  that would  strip Congress of the power to make their lives  better in countless ways.  Why, then, with so many Americans  at risk, so many rights at jeopardy,  will Judge Alito win  confirmation?  What does his confirmation mean for  the  future of the Supreme Court? I  have been thinking about this long and  hard. It is an important question, and I  don’t have an easy answer, but I believe several things are clear.  For one thing, even though Judge  Alito has demonstrated a  record of  being well out of the mainstream on a  host of issues, my friends from across  the aisle dutifully march in rigid lockstep when the President nominates one  of their choosing but oppose those who  do not share their values and visions.  Republican Senators should be aghast  at Judge Alito’s endorsement of vast  Executive power, and they should be  alarmed at his rejection of a woman’s  right to choose.  The hill will be steeper when a nominee evades, as Judge Alito did, answering questions about his core judicial  beliefs. All evidence points to the fact  that he will still hold his constitutional view that the right to choose is  not protected in the Constitution, that  he will still believe the Federal Government doesn’t have the power to regulate machine guns, and the evidence  supported the conclusion that he will  turn back the clock on civil rights. But  he was clever enough not to say so directly. So that, too, has been a factor.  In the end, there is one more thing at  work here. The American people have  grown accustomed to the umbrella of  protection they have under the Constitution. They are loathe to believe  that those rights could, with one nominee, evaporate into thin air. Who can  believe it? Who wants to believe it?  Even though no nominee since Robert  Bork has such a clear record of being  opposed to so many things the American  people  hold  dear,  the  public  doesn’t want  to believe  that Judge  Alito will remove those protections,  even when the record  is clear. Who  wants to believe that after 40 years, a  single nominee to the Supreme Court  could eviscerate title VII? Yet that is  just what his colleagues on the Third  Circuit accused him of attempting to  do. Who wants to believe that a single  nominee, one so seemingly soft-spoken  and erudite, would, with the stroke of a  pen, take average Americans’ rights  away and not give them their day in  court?  People naturally don’t want to believe the worst. Perhaps people think  of Earl Warren and David Souter, who  defied  their President  and  did not  stroke as hard a line as their benefactors might have hoped. But I say to  the American people, the days of Warren and Souter are over. The days of  stealth nominees whose views may not  match the President are over. That is  clear when a small minority pushed the  President to withdraw Harriet Miers.  In the coming months and years, we  will be watching the Court. We will be  watching the votes. We will be watching our two newest Justices. And make  no mistake, we will make sure the  American people understand the implication of these votes today. Elections  do have consequences. But votes such  as these also have consequences on future elections, and I believe that when  the American people see the actual  Court decisions which are rendered by  the new Court, they will have a strong  and countervailing reaction.  Again, I wish President Bush could  tonight claim to lead a united country,  but with this nominee and with this  vote, sadly, he cannot.  I yield the remainder of my time to  the Senator from Alabama.  ",2006
40,27,2006-01-31,Mr.  SESSIONS.," Mr. President,  thank the Senator.  Indeed, it has been most distressing  to me to see this nominee, the epitome  of a restrained, principled and highly  respected judge, be portrayed as some  sort of extremist. It is beyond my comprehension,  frankly. Questions have  been raised about different cases. Alito  answered each and every one of those  questions  in  front of  the Judiciary  committee. Senator SCHUMER and  I  serve on the committee. He was asked  about them repeatedly. He was asked  677 questions, and he answered a higher  percentage of them than perhaps any  judge in history—97.3 percent. A Clinton appointee, Justice Ginsburg, for example, was only asked 384 questions,  and she only answered 80 percent of  them. Justice Breyer, another Clinton  appointee, was asked 355 questions, and  he answered 82 percent.  So  Judge Alito was most  forthcoming. He was asked more questions  and grilled and grilled, and he answered them with skill, fairness, and  reasonableness. He was unflappable in  his testimony and so judicious in his  approach to every question. It was a  tour de force, a real model of how a  judge should perform.

41,34,2006-01-31,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, President Bush has nominated Judge Samuel Alito to replace Justice Sandra Day  O’Connor on the Supreme Court. Justice O’Connor has had a remarkable career of public service. Her strong and  moderate voice on the Supreme Court  will be missed. I was lucky to get to socialize with  her  and  her  husband  through mutual acquaintances and recommend her book about growing up on  a ranch in arid Arizona—The Lazy B.  She is an exceptional person.  As is the custom, Judge Alito sought  a meeting with any Senator so interested. For our meeting, I suggested the  Capitol steps and he agreed since it was  a warm sunny day. I thought it was appropriate to be visually connected to  two of the three branches of government as we talked about constitutional  issues. If confirmed, the decisions he  will make on the Supreme Court will  affect  the  lives  of Americans  profoundly.  Judge Alito has outstanding  legal  credentials and an inspiring life story.  However, I am greatly concerned about  his philosophy on some important constitutional issues. In particular, I carefully examined his record on executive  power, women’s reproductive freedoms  and the commerce clause of article 1,  section VIII of the Constitution.  On executive power, it is likely that  cases dealing with the fourth amendment will be heard by the Supreme  Court. The fourth amendment reads:  The right of the people to be secure in  their persons, houses, papers, and effects,  against unreasonable searches and seizures,  shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall  issue, but upon probable cause, supported by  Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the  persons or things to be seized.  To me this language is very clear  that a warrant is required for a search.  That premise is now being questioned  regarding warrantless wiretaps.  At the Judiciary Committee hearings, Judge Alito was asked a question  on executive powers and warrantless  wiretapping. He said he would have to  determine  ‘‘whether  the President’s  power,  inherent powers,  the powers  given to the President under article 2  are sufficient, even taking away congressional  authorization,  the  area  where  the President  is asserting a  power to do something in the face of  explicit congressional determination to  the contrary’’.  The only power  in article  2  that  Judge Alito could be referring to would  be:  The President shall be Commander in Chief  of  the Army  and Navy  of  the United  States. . . .  Judge Alito was also asked ‘‘. . . is it  possible under your construct that an  inherent Constitutional power of the  President could, under some analysis  or some case, override what people believe to be a Constitutional criminal  statue?’’ Judge Alito responded that  this was possible, noting a ‘‘possibility  that that might be justified’’.  How far do we want Commander in  Chief stretched? As Justice O’Connor  wrote in a recent case, ‘‘a state of war  is not a blank check for the President  when it comes to the rights of the Nation’s citizens’’.  On the issue of Roe v. Wade as with  other issues, I am less interested in  what Judge Alito wrote or said as a  lawyer for his client the Reagan Administration, than how he has ruled as  a  judge and how he testified at his  nomination hearing. As an appellate  court judge, Judge Alito was the lone  dissenter on Planned Parenthood v.  Casey,  a  court  case  reviewing  the  Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act.  The Supreme Court wrote on this  landmark affirmation of Roe v. Wade:  These matters,  involving the most  intimate and personal choices a person may  make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to  the  liberty protected by  the Fourteenth  Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the  right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the  mystery of human life. Beliefs about these  matters could not define the attributes of  personhood were they formed under compulsion of the state.  The  five majority  Justices, who  wrote that, were all Republican appointees: two Reagan appointees, one  each of Bush ‘‘41’’, Ford and Nixon.  An important standard of law is the  concept of stare decisis—it stands decided. At the hearing Chairman SPECTER asked Judge Alito to discuss his  view of stare decisis. He responded:  It’s not an inexorable command, but it is a  general presumption that courts are going to  follow prior precedents’’.  In the Supreme  Court dissent on Casey, the justices who arguably wanted  to overturn Roe v. Wade  wrote ‘‘stare decisis is not . . . a universal  inexorable command.  Not only did Judge Alito  rule  in  favor of  the Pennsylvania Abortion  Control Act as a lower court judge, he  used the same language as the high  court dissenters at his Supreme Court  nomination hearing. Stare decisis  is  not an inexorable command.  Additionally, at his nomination hearing Judge Roberts was willing to call  Roe v. Wade ‘‘settled law’’ but Judge  Alito refused to make a similar statement.  The last point I would like to make  concerning constitutional law is on the  commerce clause. As you know the  Constitution creates a Government of  limited  power—Congress  can  only  enact legislation in areas that are specifically set out under the Constitution. Congress is expressly prohibited  from  enacting  legislation  in  other  areas,  leaving this authority to the  States per the tenth amendment:  The powers not delegated to the United  States by the Constitution . . . are reserved  to the States respectively, or to the people.  Every law enacted by Congress must  be based on one of the powers enumerated in the Constitution. The Framers  of  the  Constitution  gave  Congress  broad power to regulate immigration,  national security and economic activity between the states, and left most  other power with the States.  However, section VIII of article 1  states that  ‘‘the Congress shall have  the power to regulate Commerce . . .  among the several states’’. This is the  commerce clause and it is the most  powerful provision in the Constitution  providing Congress the authority to  enact legislation in a host of areas—including environmental protection. A  key Supreme Court case regarding the  commerce clause was in 1942 when the  Supreme Court upheld legislation that  allowed USDA to set quotas on local  wheat growing. The Court noted that  while crops regulated may never actually enter  into  interstate commerce,  such local activity, coupled with similar activity in other States as an aggregate has a direct impact on interstate commerce. Since then using the  ‘‘aggregate effects test’’ or  ‘‘substantial effects test’’ Congress has passed  broad ranging environmental  legislation such as the Clean Air Act, Clean  Water Act and the Endangered Species  Act, all of which were signed into law  by Republican President Nixon.  While I agree there should be constitutional limits on legislative power,  Judge Alito seems to have agreed with  Justice Thomas who wrote:  I believe we must further reconsider our  substantial effects test with an eye toward  constructing a stand that reflects the text  and history of the Commerce Clause.  Indeed  in a dissent to a gun case  heard before his  court Judge Alito  wrote:  In sum, we are left with no appreciable empirical support for the proposition that the  purely  intrastate possessions of machine  guns, by facilitating the commission of certain crimes, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, and without such support I  do not see how the statutory provision at  issue here can be sustained.  What is noteworthy in this dissent is  that Judge Alito was alone with all  members of his appeals court ruling  the other way.  If ‘‘the aggregate or substantial effects tests’’ are overruled as Justice  VerDate Mar 15 2010  20:27 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S31JA6.REC S31JA6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006

44,41,2006-01-31,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Alabama.  ,2006
45,41,2006-01-31,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I rise  this morning in support of the nominations of Benjamin S. Bernanke to be a  member and the Chairman of the Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System.  In November of 2005, I chaired our  Banking Committee hearing regarding  this nomination, and we heard from Dr.  Bernanke on a wide range of economic  issues. In reporting this nomination to  the floor for consideration, I would reiterate that President Bush has made a  superb appointment  in selecting Dr.  Ben Bernanke for this position.  This nomination is of great importance to our Nation and our economy.  As the central bank, the Federal Reserve has the responsibility  for conducting monetary policy to maintain  maximum employment, stable prices,  and moderate long-term interest rates.  As the U.S. continues to lead the world  economy,  sound  stewardship  of  the  Federal Reserve also affects the global  marketplace.  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve  would certainly have a big enough job  to do if he were tasked only with serving as head of the central bank of the  United States. But his job also entails  the supervision and regulation of financial institutions, including some of the  largest financial entities in the world.  The Federal Reserve must ensure the  safety and soundness of these institutions and monitor any potential  for  systemic risk. The American consumer  also counts upon the Federal Reserve  to foster the fair and efficient delivery  of services to customers of financial institutions.  The Federal Reserve also plays a  major role in operating the Nation’s  payment system. Evolving technology  continues to change the way we pay for  goods and services. The Federal Reserve must oversee these innovations  and adaptations and make certain the  U.S. payment system is effective, reliable, and safe.  For nearly two decades, it has been  impossible to raise the topic of the  Federal Reserve without  also mentioning Alan Greenspan, and I will do  so briefly here today. Alan Greenspan  has been the face and the voice of the  Federal Reserve  for  over  18 years.  Today he is chairing his last session of  the Federal Open Market Committee.  Chairman Greenspan has made a big  impression on all of us—here in Congress, our Nation, and across the world.  During his tenure, the U.S. economy  and our financial system have withstood a number of significant shocks,  including the stock market crash of  1987, the Asian debt crisis which affected capital globally, and, of course,  the catastrophic effects of 9/11, which  hit the heart of the U.S. financial industry and which affected all of us and  our economy in many ways.  Chairman Greenspan  also  oversaw  the  longest  economic  expansion  in  American history. Because of our economic success, even in the face of great  challenges,  some  consider Chairman  Greenspan to be the greatest central  banker of all time. I commend Chairman Greenspan for his exemplary service and dedication to our country.  Now it is time for a transition at the  Federal Reserve System. As I noted,  this will be the first time in nearly two  decades that the Congress has had a  new nominee before us  for consideration.  Certainly  stepping  into Mr.  Greenspan’s shoes will be a tremendous  challenge.  While it may seem a daunting task to  follow as distinguished a chairman as  Alan Greenspan, we should be mindful  of two things.  First, in 1987, many observers wondered whether an  economist named  Alan Greenspan could successfully follow in the wake of the vaunted Paul  Volcker as Chairman of the Federal  Reserve. Each person who sits in the  Chairman’s seat has the opportunity to  make that position his own and to become a leader in his own right. That is  what has been done, in large part, due  to the caliber of the men who Presidents of the United States have chosen  for the task.  Second, I would also note that many  individuals who  hold  diverse  viewpoints on other topics are in agreement  that President Bush has selected the  best possible candidate to serve as the  next Federal Reserve Chairman.  Indeed, Dr. Ben Bernanke may well be  the finest monetary economist of his  generation. He has both a distinguished  career in academia as well as in the  policymaking arena.  The  list  of  his  experience  and  achievements is long. I do not have  enough time this morning to mention  all of them, but I want to mention  some of his most important qualifications because his nomination requires  someone with the rare expertise that  Dr. Bernanke has acquired.  As he moves on to become the Federal Reserve Chairman, Dr. Bernanke  will be completing his duties as Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers. During his service at  the CEA, Dr. Bernanke provided the  President and our Nation with sound  economic advice on a variety of significant policy issues. But before his service at the Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Bernanke served with great  distinction as a member of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2002 to 2005. This experience  gives him an inside knowledge of the  Federal Reserve and the financial markets.  Dr. Bernanke has earned the tremendous respect and confidence of policymakers  in  this country as well as  around the world. He previously served  as chair of the economics department  at Princeton University, and prior to  that tenure he was an associate professor of economics at the Graduate  School of Business at Stanford University. He also served as a visiting professor of economics at New York University and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was the director of the Monetary Economics Program of the National Bureau of Economic Research. In 1975, he received his  B.A. in economics from Harvard University, where he graduated with honors. In 1979, he received his Ph.D. in economics from MIT.  It will be difficult to follow the long  and successful tenure of Alan Greenspan. Dr. Bernanke  is an  excellent  choice  for  the  job. Few  individuals  have this mix of practical and academic experience, especially his prior  experience at the Federal Reserve. The  Banking  Committee  reviewed  this  nomination thoroughly, and we believe  Dr. Bernanke will serve this country  well at the helm of the Federal Reserve.  I urge my colleagues to support this  nomination.  I yield the floor.  ",2006

The  country is forever grateful for his service as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.  I had an opportunity to sit down and  visit with Dr. Bernanke.  I was  impressed not only with him personally  but also with the conversation we had  and his record. He is going to bring a  lot to the Fed.

66,48,2006-01-31,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, while  Senators talk about prebuttal and rebuttal speeches before the State of the  Union speech, I hear middle-class folks  saying ‘‘drop the buts and make our  lives easier.’’ I know because in January, when I was home, I held 21 community meetings. The big issues then  were those where the second word was  ‘‘bill’’—medical bills, gas bills, heating  bills, mortgage bills, college bills, and  especially tax bills.  It is not hard to see why those are  the issues. Middle-class folks in this  country are not keeping up. Even their  wages do not keep up with inflation.  And while they want a better life for  their kids—the way their parents wanted for them—they stay up nights worrying that they cannot make it happen.  So today I want to spend a few minutes discussing just two issues: taxes  and health care. I believe in each of  these two issues Congress could work  on a bipartisan basis for genuine relief  for the middle class. We may not hear  about it tonight, but as middle-class  folks begin pulling together their 1099s,  their W–2s,  their  schedule  this and  schedule that, and all of what they  have to do to comply with filling out  their tax forms, I simply wanted to  come to the floor and say it does not  have to be this way.  I brought, today, just part of what  constitutes the regulations and rules  for complying with taxes in America.  One of the experts in the field told me  there  have  been more  than  14,000  amendments to the Tax Code since the  last major overhaul in 1986. It comes to  almost three for every working day in  America.  This year, Americans are going to  spend $140 billion on tax compliance.  Americans are going to spend more  money complying with the tax rules  than the Federal government is spending on higher education in our country.  I have come to the floor today because I want to make it clear I do not  think it has to be that way. I have developed an alternative. My one-page  1040 form is just 30 lines long. Take  your income from all sources, subtract  your deductions,  take your  credits,  send it off to the IRS, and you can even  add a note: I’m done. Have a nice day.  I filled this out myself, and that in  and of itself is a little bit of a revolution because it has been a long time  since a member of the Senate Finance  Committee or someone  in the other  body on the Ways and Means Committee could  fill out their own tax  form.  What  happens  today? More  than  three million people, for example, have  to essentially fill out their taxes twice.  They have that alternative minimum  tax staring at them. Scores of families  are pulling together shoe boxes full of  receipts,  shouting across  the  living  room, ‘‘Honey, can you find that receipt  for the copier that we bought  months ago?’’ because part of it is for  business and part of it was used for the  family. I say it does not have to be this  way.  I have shown that you can have a  one-page 1040 form. The President’s advisory committee report that came out  in the fall had a similar form—I do not  happen to agree with all they did, but  their one-page form isn’t that much  longer than mine. For purposes of Government work, we could put the two of  VerDate Mar 15 2010  20:27 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S31JA6.REC S31JA6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006
67,55,2006-01-31,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, as a  known  sponsor of  international  terrorism, and in light of the president of  Iran’s  recent apocalyptic  statements  calling  for the destruction of Israel,  Iran must not be allowed to develop  nuclear weapons. The  international  community must respond quickly and  decisively to Iran’s gross disregard of  international treaties and obligations  and to its concerted and malicious efforts to develop the capability to create nuclear weapons.  The international community must  take concerted and decisive action to  prevent Iran from furthering its nuclear research and technology development. In its forthcoming meeting on  February  2,  2006,  the  International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board  of Governors should heed the calls by  Russia, China,  the European Union,  and the United States to reaffirm its  findings that Iran has blatantly violated its international obligations, recognize the grave nature of Iran’s recent  actions, and refer Iran to the United  Nations Security Council. The Security  Council should then speak with one  voice to condemn Iran’s actions and  send a clear signal that continued defiance of the international community  will not be tolerated.  It  is  essential  that  the Security  Council approve specific actions to prevent the furthering of Iran’s nuclear  capabilities. The Security Council specifically, and the  international community generally, must recognize the  potentially devastating  link between  the violent and defiant  rhetoric of  Iran’s president and his regime’s determined effort to undermine approved  and transparent methods of developing  civilian nuclear technology for energy  use.  Congress can also take steps to help  stop or slow Iran’s acquisition of nuclear  and  other WMD-related  technology, including adding teeth to export control  legislation such as the  Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act.  The  Iran Nonproliferation Enhancement Act, S.1976, that Senator KYLand  I introduced late last year would do  just that. It would toughen the ISNA  by requiring rather than merely authorizing  sanctions on proliferators,  extending sanctions to the parent companies, and  increasing  the  types of  sanctions that apply to proliferators.  By adopting this legislation, we would  be sending a crystal clear message to  would-be proliferators: if you choose to  assist  Iran  in developing nuclear or  other WMD-related  capabilities, you  are also choosing to forgo doing business with the United States.  History teaches us that we cannot ignore the stated intent of those who  seek to destroy nations. A nuclear-  armed Iran would pose a grave threat  to the region, to Israel, and to the entire international community. A concerted international effort is needed to  prevent Iran from procuring the technology and materiel needed to develop  a nuclear weapon. This effort must  begin now, and it must be comprehensive.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  IN RECOGNITION OF DR.  KATHERINE ESTERLY  ∑",2006

69,69,2006-01-31,Mr. ISAKSON.," Mr. President, I rise  on behalf of myself, all Georgians, and  I am sure all Americans, to express my  deepest sympathy and condolences to  the family of Coretta Scott King, the  wife of Dr. Martin Luther King. We  learned this morning that she passed  away  yesterday  at  the  age  of  78.  Coretta Scott King is known in history  for being the wife of Dr. Martin Luther  King, but she was far more than that.  As he wrote in his ‘‘Letter from the  Birmingham Jail’’  to  the concerned  clergy of Birmingham about his justification for coming to Birmingham  on behalf of the citizens who had been  discriminated against, Dr. King said:  I come because  injustice anywhere  threat to justice everywhere.  is a  As we all know from history, he took  his mission wherever it took him to  fight on behalf of justice for all Americans. He was able to do that in large  measure with the support and the partnership of his great partner  in  life,  Coretta Scott King. I had the privilege,  as a Georgian, of knowing her since my  days in the legislature. I saw her as an  equal with Dr. King in the movement.  I saw her as a loving mother in the  raising of their four children. And I  have seen her, since the loss of Dr.  King, as an untiring advocate on behalf  of ensuring that the legacy of Dr. King  and his movement  is perpetuated  in  American history.  A few months ago, the United States  of America and this Senate honored  the life of Rosa Parks as a significant  leader, the matriarch of the civil rights  movement. There is no question today,  as we pause in sympathy for the loss of  Dr. King’s wife, Coretta Scott King,  that she joins Rosa Parks as a great  woman in American history and as a  tireless advocate for equality for all  Americans.  On behalf of my State, myself, and  all those who love peace and justice, I  express our sympathy on the loss of  Coretta Scott King.  ",2006
70,69,2006-01-31,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to remember an extraordinary and courageous woman, Coretta  Scott King.  Coretta Scott King was one of the  most influential women leaders in our  world. She entered the public stage in  1955 as wife of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and as a leading participant  in  the American  civil  rights  movement.  Born  and  raised  in Marion, AL,  Coretta Scott graduated valedictorian  from Lincoln High School. She  received a B.A. in music and education  from  Antioch  College  in  Yellow  Springs, OH, and then went on to study  concert singing at Boston’s New England Conservatory of Music, where she  earned a degree in voice and violin.  While in Boston she met Martin Luther  King, Jr. who was then studying for his  doctorate  in systematic theology at  Boston University. They were married  on June 18, 1953, and in September 1954  took up residence in Montgomery, AL,  with Coretta Scott King assuming the  many functions of pastor’s wife at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.  During Dr. King’s career, Mrs. King  devoted most of her time to raising  their four children. However, she balanced mothering and work, speaking  before church, civic, college, fraternal  and peace groups. She conceived and  performed  a  series  of  favorably-reviewed Freedom Concerts which combined prose and poetry narration with  musical selections and  functioned as  fundraisers for the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, the direct action organization of which Dr. King  served as first president.  After Dr. King’s assassination in 1968,  Mrs. King devoted much of her energy  and attention to developing programs  and building the Atlanta-based Martin  Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent  Social Change as a living memorial to  her husband’s life and dream. For 27  years, Mrs. King devoted her life to developing the King Center. As founding  President, Chair, and Chief Executive  Officer, she dedicated herself to providing local, national and international  programs  that have  trained  tens of  thousands of people in Dr. King’s philosophy and methods; she guided the  creation and housing of the largest archives of documents  from  the civil  rights movement;  and,  perhaps her  greatest legacy after establishing the  King Center  itself, Mrs. King spearheaded  the massive educational and  lobbying  campaign  to  establish Dr.  King’s birthday as a national holiday.  In 1983, an act of Congress instituted  the Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal  Holiday Commission, which she chaired  for its duration. And in January 1986,  Mrs. King oversaw the first legal holiday in honor of her husband—a holiday  which has come to be celebrated by  millions of people world-wide and, in  some form, in over 100 countries.  Coretta Scott King carried the message of nonviolence around the world.  She  led goodwill missions  to many  countries in Africa, Latin America, Europe and Asia. She spoke at many of  history’s most massive peace and justice rallies. She was the first woman to  deliver the class day address at Harvard, and the first woman to preach at  a statutory service at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London.  In 1974 Mrs. King formed a broad association of over 100 religious, labor,  business, civil and women’s rights organizations dedicated to a national policy of full employment and equal economic opportunity, as co-chair of the  Full Employment Action Council. In  1983, she brought together more than  800 human rights organizations to form  the Coalition of Conscience, sponsors of  the 20th anniversary march on Washington, until  then  the  largest demonstration in our Nation’s capital. In  1988, she reconvened the Coalition of  Conscience for the 25th anniversary of  the March on Washington. In preparation for the Reagan-Gorbachev talks,  in 1988 she served as head of the U.S.  delegation of Women for a Meaningful  Summit in Athens, Greece; and in 1990,  as the USSR was redefining itself, Mrs.  King was coconvener of the Soviet-  American Women’s Summit in Washington, DC.  Mrs. King received honorary doctorates from over 60 colleges and universities; authored three books and a nationally-syndicated column; and served  on, and helped found, dozens of organizations,  including the Black Leadership Forum, the National Black Coalition for Voter Participation, and the  Black Leadership Roundtable.  On a very personal note, I had the  pleasure of meeting Mrs. King on a  number of occasions, both within my  great State of Georgia as well as outside of our State. Most notably, I have  been to a number of the Martin Luther  King, Jr., Day celebrations at Ebenezer  Baptist Church and was there last year,  which happened to be the  last time  that Ms. King was there. She was unable to be there this year.  She was a remarkable lady in that, in  spite of her high profile relative to the  civil rights movement, as well as since  Dr. King’s death, she remained a very  humble, a very personable, a very congenial lady who had a great sense of  humor. Certainly during the time of  the civil rights movement, this lady  was undoubtedly one of the most admired women in the world because of  what  she  saw  her  husband  going  through.  She was loyal and steadfast in the  support of her husband. She obviously  loved her husband. She loved her family until her death last night. Her legacy will live on for generations, generations and generations to come.  Coretta Scott King worked tirelessly  to make a better world. History will  judge that she did. We mourn her passing.

It was  a tumultuous year, and I recall sitting  in the library working for my class assignments when a law professor walked  in and said: I would like all of you students who are second- and third-year  law  students  to  come  outside. We  walked outside, and he said: We need to  ask for your help. The District of Columbia is in an uproar. With the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King,  there are riots all over our Nation’s  Capital and many cities across  the  country, and our legal system has broken down. They have arrested people  for a variety of charges and have filled  up the DC jails. They have no room for  them and no attorneys to represent  them.

72,83,2006-01-31,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to acknowledge a dear  friend and a  good citizen, Ms. Tina Arapkiles. Tina recently  ‘‘retired’’  from  the Rocky Mountain Regional  office of Sierra Club to spend more time with  her family and other pursuits. I have known  Tina for many years and have the highest regard  for her work on behalf of conservation  and the environment.  Tina’s reputation for gentle, but persuasive,  advocacy  is well known  in Colorado and  I  think  it  is  fair  to say  that she has admirers  from across the broad spectrum of public opinion, and not just from within the environmental  community.  Certainly,  her  reputation  with  members of the Colorado Congressional Delegation  (past and present)  from both parties  has been above reproach.  Advocacy in the public arena is all too often  characterized  by  angry  debate  and  an  unhealthy appetite  for making villains out of  those with whom one disagrees. This has  never been Tina’s way, and it is much to her  credit that she leaves her service at the Sierra  Club with  a well-deserved  reputation  for  thoughtfulness and respect for others. Her example of quiet, but determined and passionate  advocacy, is one I greatly admire.  For the last 20 years, she has been a consistent advocate  for protecting  the West’s  land, air, water, and wildlife. She began her  work on these matters with a lobbying trip to  Washington to help pass the Superfund law in  1985.  In 1989 and 1990, she worked with  Congress to revise the Clean Water Act and  Clean Air Act. She has worked to protect the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge since  the  inception of  the campaign and has been a  staunch supporter of Utah wilderness.  She also helped pass the California Desert  Protection Act and  the Colorado Wilderness  Act of 1993. In fact, Tina, some say, single-  handedly gained protections for the Wheeler  Peak area. She also worked  to designate  Colorado’s  first Wild and Scenic River—the  Cache  la Poudre along Colorado’s northern  Front Range  just north and east of Rocky  Mountain National Park.  Because  of  her work  on  environmental  issues and her reputation for thoughtful advocacy, Tina was invited to be a member of the  Denver Post’s Community Roundtable in 1995  to discuss international trade issues. She was  also appointed in 1992 to the Board of Editorial Contributors  for  the Rocky Mountain  News to offer regular perspectives on environmental policy.  In January of 2000, Tina directed the Southern Rockies Wolf Restoration Project, a coalition of groups and  individuals  that played a  strong  role  in  the Colorado Wolf Working  Group, which  pushed  the State  to  allow  wolves  to roam  freely  throughout  the State.  Her essay on wolves and camping with her  family appears in the recently published collection Comeback Wolves.  She highlights working with Sierra Club volunteers as one of the best memories of her  job, as well as attending  the signing of  the  Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993 in Colorado  by President Clinton.  In addition to her work in the public arena,  Tina has perhaps the more important distinction of successfully raising  two children. For  anyone who knows Tina, it is clear that her  passion for the natural world is directly related  to her interest in humanity. She cares deeply  about Mother Earth, not because  trees are  more important than people, but because people need trees and all the other wonders of  the natural world in order to be fully human.  Although she is leaving a distinguished career of service on behalf of the environment,  and will be missed at the Colorado State capitol and in the halls of Congress, I know she  will continue to be active in all the causes that  she believes in, and I ask my colleagues to  join me in wishing her the very best in her future endeavors.  f  TRIBUTE TO MR. JAMES REYOME  HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 31, 2006  ",2006
73,83,2006-01-31,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great honor  that  I congratulate Mr. James  Reyome on his retirement as Public Works Director  for  the Town of Griffith. James has  spent over 40 years of his life dedicated to the  interests of the residents of Griffith, Indiana.  His career in public service has allowed him  the opportunity to touch the lives of numerous  people.  James has accomplished many visionary  goals throughout his career. He started his career with  the Griffith Police Department  in  1962, where he worked until 1983, spending  the last 7 years as Chief of Police. James also  worked security at LTV Steel. He then became  Lake County Police Chief under then Sheriff  Bob Stiglich. In 1997, he was named Town of  Griffith Public Works Director, a position his  father held for 20 years. However, shortly before assuming the position of Public Works Director, James had a major stroke, followed by  2 milder strokes  in 2002 and August 2005,  which caused him to speed up his retirement  plans.  James’s family and friends should be proud  of his efforts, as his leadership has served as  a beacon of hope throughout the community.  His longstanding commitment to improving the  quality of life for the citizens in Griffith, Indiana  is  truly  inspirational  and  should  be  commended. Our community has certainly been  rewarded by the true service, uncompromising  dedication,  and  loyalty  displayed  by Mr.  Reyome.  While James has dedicated a considerable  amount of time and energy to his community,  he has never limited the time he gives to his  most important interest: his family. James and  his wife, Anna, have 3 children, 2 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and  my other distinguished colleagues join me in  congratulating Mr. James Reyome for his outstanding devotion to Indiana’s First Congressional District. His unselfish, lifelong dedication  to those in need is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent him in  Congress.  f  HONORING MARY UBER FOR HER  SUCCESSES  HON. BRIAN HIGGINS  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 31, 2006  ",2006
74,83,2006-01-31,Mr. HIGGINS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Mary Uber  for her success  in overcoming disabilities  to become a high quality  worker. Please insert the following article from  the Jamestown Post Journal of December 18,  2005 into the RECORD.  STATEAGENCYNAMESJAMESTOWNWOMAN  ‘‘OUTSTANDINGPERFORMER’’  Mary Uber of Jamestown recently was honored by the state as an ‘‘Outstanding Performer’’ for her success in overcoming disabilities to become a high-quality worker.  Ms. Uber was recognized by New York  State Industries for the Disabled as part of  its annual program to acknowledge exceptional job performance and personal success  by  people with  disabilities  employed  on  NYSID contracts. She has a job through The  Resource Center’s Environmental Services  division, which employs people with disabilities  in  janitorial  jobs  throughout Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties. Some of  its cleaning contracts come to The Resource  Center through NYSID.  Ms. Uber has overcome disabilities and a  history of short-term job experiences to become a successful member of the Environmental Services team. While lacking in self-  assurance at first, Ms. Uber, who now is in  her fifth year as a custodian, proved that she  had a desire to work and was willing to try  any job assigned to her. She has grown tremendously  in terms of personal maturity  and her ability on the job.  Due to hard work and personal growth, Ms.  Uber was promoted to the position of leader  of a three-person crew that cleans the Western New York Developmental Disabilities  Services Office in Little Valley. As the lead  member of the crew, she is responsible for  seeing that all cleaning tasks are completed  and supplies are on hand. She must also communicate with the customer as well as her  supervisor, who says of Ms. Uber, ‘‘She takes  charge, thinks on her feet and can lead others.’’  With the Resource Center’s assistance, Ms.  Uber has obtained her driver’s license, so she  now can transport her crew members and  cleaning supplies to Little Valley, and she  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:09 Feb 01, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A31JA8.019 E31JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 2 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2006
75,90,2006-01-31,Mr. COOPER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  salute  an  outstanding  group  of men  and  women—the  Tennessee  Army  National  Guard’s 168th Military Police Battalion of Lebanon, TN. On Sunday, February 5, the 168th  will receive the Valorous Unit Award at a special presentation at the Armory in Lebanon.  The Valorous Unit Award is one of the Nation’s most prestigious military awards.  It  is  presented to units of the Armed Forces of the  United States for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of  the United  States while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing force. To receive this award, a unit must have performed  with marked distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission  so as to set it apart from, and above, other  units participating  in  the same conflict.  Its  equivalent  in  individual awards  is  the Silver  Star.  I know all Tennesseans, and all Americans,  join with me  in  thanking  the 168th  for  their  bravery,  their commitment and  their selfless  service while in Iraq.  The 168th received its award for performance of duties  from May 20, 2003  through  January 31, 2004. While they performed many  duties, some of  their key accomplishments  during their service were to establish law and  order operations in all of east Baghdad, establish Iraqi police stations, train Iraqi police officers and establish an  Iraqi police academy.  The battalion coordinated numerous offensive  operations and patrols within its area of operations under very austere conditions. They  were  responsible  for confiscating numerous  weapons caches, counterfeit money, and ammunition. And they frequently provided escort  and security service to convoys in the region.  During their service, the 168th Battalion and  its subordinate units receive numerous Bronze  Stars, Purple Hearts, and Army Commendation Medals for Valor. Their service was one  that required heroism and courage on a daily  basis.  I am honored to serve as the Congressman  for Lebanon and privileged to represent these  men and women in Washington. We are all  blessed to live in the greatest country in the  history of the world. And we are particularly  blessed that men and women, like the members of Tennessee’s 168th Military Police Battalion, willingly put their lives on the line every  day so that we may continue to enjoy freedom  here at home.  Words cannot adequately  thank  the members of the 168th for their exceptional service.  But I want to take this moment, and this occasion of their Valorous Unit Award presentation,  to salute them on behalf of all Americans for  their heroic service to our country and to freedom around the world.  f  HONORING  ST. XAVIER UNIVERSITY ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 31, 2006  ",2006
76,90,2006-01-31,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor as a community St. Xavier University  and to celebrate its 50th Anniversary. St. Xavier is located in Chicago’s Mount Greenwood  neighborhood.  When  founded  in 1846 by  the Sisters of  Mercy, St. Xavier was a Catholic  institution  grounded in the tradition of the liberal arts. As  one of 18 colleges and universities sponsored  by  the Sisters  of Mercy, St. Xavier  has  evolved into an institution that seeks to provide its students with the meaning of scholarship, the support of the community, and the  spirit of moral and ethical sensibility.  Although a Catholic university of approximately 5,700 students, St. Xavier welcomes  students  of  all  faiths  and  religious  backgrounds. Because of  its  rich  traditions and  commitment to excellence St. Xavier has become one of Chicago’s premier collegiate institutions for students studying nursing, business, as well as education.  It is my honor to recognize this school and  its many achievements both academically and  athletically. In addition, I commend St. Xavier  University for fostering the intellectual and cultural growth of the administration, faculty and  students who all play a vital role in the success of  the university’s existence  in  today’s  society.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF GUADALUPE, ARIZONA ON THE 31ST  ANNIVERSARY OF ITS INCORPORATION  HON. ED PASTOR  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 31, 2006  ",2006
77,90,2006-01-31,Mr. PASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise before you  today to pay tribute to the Town of Guadalupe,  Arizona, a community  in my district which  I  proudly represent, on the occasion of the 31st  Anniversary of its incorporation. Named after  the patron saint of Mexico, the Virgin of Guadalupe, this culturally-rich community is home  to about 5,500 residents.  Guadalupe was  founded by Yaqui  Indians  around the turn of the century when they fled  their  traditional homeland along  the Yaqui  River in Sonora, Mexico to avoid persecution  and enslavement by the Mexican government  under Porfirio Diaz. When  the Yaqui people  fled as refugees, many were able  to  find a  home  in  the Salt River Valley’s agricultural  economy. One of  the villages was  in south  Tempe, just north of the present Guadalupe  site. A missionary Franciscan Friar, Lucius  Zittier, petitioned President Woodrow Wilson  for 40 acres of land so the Yaqui could permanently  settle.  The  site,  undesirable  as  uncultivable,  is  located  in  the center of  the  present community, known as ‘‘La Cuarenta,’’  or ‘‘The 40,’’ as some still call it today.  Guadalupe also became home to many Hispanic families over the years, and it has become a stopping point for Mexican immigrant  workers. As the community has grown, it has  demonstrated its resilience in the face of difficult economic times, poverty, and racism.  Many young men of Mexican and Yaqui descent answered  the call  for military service  and defended our country. Dozens of Guadalupe veterans’ names are on the rolls of those  who served, and many paid the ultimate sacrifice.  In the early 1960s, Guadalupe Organization,  Inc., was formed and it began to identify and  address  the community’s needs. Many services  taken  for granted  in other communities  were not provided in Guadalupe and residents  began to get organized. A new voting precinct  in Guadalupe was formed, and U.S. Sen. Carl  Hayden was  instrumental  in securing home  mail delivery for residents. As the Guadalupe  Organization advocated for community betterment  and  educated  residents  about  civil  awareness,  many  small  victories  were  achieved for the community. The organization  prevented a freeway from being built through  the center of Guadalupe, opened a dental clinic with volunteer dentists, fought discrimination  against Guadalupe students, and most notably, led the charge for incorporation.  Neighboring cities had mostly rebuffed Guadalupe and its residents until property values  soared. To stop annexation attempts and preserve their community’s rich culture, the Guadalupe Organization began  incorporation efforts and  the Citizens Committee  to  Incorporate Guadalupe was formed. It was led by  Mr. Andres ‘‘Andy’’ Jimenez, who served as  president of the group. Election results of Feb.  4, 1975, which showed an 83 percent voter  turnout, approved  the plan of  incorporation,  and the Town of Guadalupe was born.  Since  then,  the Town of Guadalupe has  been a leader in demonstrating concern for its  residents and passing progressive policies.  The Town Council was the first in Arizona to  ban smoking  in public places.  It declared a  paid Cesar Chavez Holiday  for Guadalupe  town employees. The town has also donated  land for construction of educational and recreational entities.  Maricopa County Community Colleges also  have established a branch of South Mountain  Community College in Guadalupe with its rental fee subsidized for many years by the Guadalupe Organization. Guadalupe had one college graduate in 1960 and one in 1967. Now  graduates at all  levels,  from high school  to  Ph.D., call Guadalupe their home.  As you can see, Guadalupe is a community  rich with the traditions of three cultures, deeply  devoted to the welfare of its residents, and the  prosperity of its community. As the former director of the Guadalupe Organization, I feel a  special bond to this community and take great  pride  in  its progress. This bond  is  felt by  many, as children follow in their parents’ footsteps, opting to make a home in Guadalupe  as they begin to make a life of their own. Ironically, the current Mayor of Guadalupe is Ms.  Bernadette  Jimenez, daughter of Andy  Jimenez, who led the Citizens Committee to Incorporate Guadalupe.  In honor of the success of this community  and  its  residents,  I ask my colleagues  to  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:09 Feb 01, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A31JA8.046 E31JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 2 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2006
78,97,2006-01-31,Mr. MOORE of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker, joined  today by my Kansas colleagues Todd Tiahrt,  Jim Ryun and Jerry Moran, I am introducing  legislation  that would designate  the United  States post office located at 110 North Chestnut Street  in Olathe as  the  ‘‘Governor John  Anderson, Jr. Post Office Building.’’  Governor Anderson was born near Olathe in  1917 and educated at Kansas State University  and  the University of Kansas, where he received a law degree in 1944. After serving on  the staff of U.S. District Court Judge Walter  Huxman  for  two years, John Anderson won  election as Johnson County Attorney in 1947,  where he served  for six years. He was a  member of  the Kansas State Senate  from  1953–1956, and was appointed Kansas Attorney General, serving from 1956–1961. Elected  Governor of Kansas in 1960 and 1962, he defeated incumbent Governor George Docking,  served as Governor during Kansas’ centennial  celebration, and appointed James B. Pearson  to the United States Senate upon the death of  Senator Andrew Schoeppel.  John Anderson’s  tenure as Kansas Governor was marked  by  numerous  achievements, including:  Revision of  the state’s pardon and parole  systems;  Creation of a combined state medical and  psychiatric hospital;  Restructuring of  the state’s public school  system into unified districts;  Increasing of the state’s per-pupil expenditure allowance;  Addition of the University of Wichita to the  state board of regents system;  Sanctioning of  fair employment practices  standards;  Approval of an advanced public employee  retirement system;  Advancements in highway construction;  Expansion of vocational-technical schools;  Authorization of a state library consultant;  Improvements in the public welfare system;  and  Reorganization of state agencies, commissions and boards.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation honoring an important Kansas leader is long overdue, and I  know that my delegation colleagues look forward with me to its speedy enactment.  f  IN  MEMORY  OF  FRANCIS  L.

79,97,2006-01-31,Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today with great sadness and tremendous gratitude to honor the life of Francis L.  Brannigan, who over  the years has helped  firefighters be more astute to the importance  of knowing building construction  to promote  firefighter safety. As a groundbreaking leader  in providing  for  firefighter safety, Frank was  one of  the  first  to  realize  that  the biggest  threat  to  firefighters were  the buildings  they  were working in. Throughout his career, Frank  provided constant focus on the issues associated with building construction and the fire environment. The safety of  firefighters was always the focus of his message and as a result, generations of  firefighters will be safer  because of his message. The knowledge that  he possessed, and generously shared, was  second to none.  Frank Brannigan devoted more than half of  his 63-year career to the safety of firefighters  in building fires. He was well known as the author of  ‘‘Building Construction  for  the Fire  Service,’’ and for his lectures and videotapes.  The first edition of his ‘‘Building Construction  for the Fire Service’’ was an instant success in  1971. Since  then,  it has  sold more  than  130,000 copies in three editions, the most recent of which was published  in 1992. Designated by Fire Chief as one of the 20 people  who most  influenced  the  fire service  in  the  20th century, Frank Brannigan was truly one  of the giants of the fire service.  Frank Brannigan was not a fire chief or an  engineer, but he became one of the most important influences in the fire service in the last  quarter of the 20th century. I am proud to say  I knew Frank Brannigan.  Mr. Speaker, the Fire Service has lost an  exceptional leader and guardian of firefighters  everywhere.  I wish Frank Brannigan’s wife  Maurine and family my heartfelt condolences  and may they find comfort in knowing that the  many people he  impacted deeply value his  dedication and generosity and the example of  his life and work. Frank Brannigan exemplified  the spirit of service that has made this country  great. As long as firefighters fight fires, the fire  service will be the beneficiary of Frank’s writing, scholarship, zeal and life-saving message.  f  TRIBUTE TO MARIA DE LOS  ANGELES OBREGON  HON.

80,97,2006-01-31,Mr. CUELLAR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the 100th birthday of Maria de los  Angeles Obregon Pen˜a who was born on the  23rd of December, 1905, in San Luis Potosi,  Mexico.  Maria de los Angeles Obregon Pen˜a moved  to Laredo, TX in 1910 with her two brothers  and widowed mother. Her  father, Gumaro  Obregon, was the youngest brother of President Alvaro Obregon and was assassinated  for political reasons. While  in Laredo, Maria  has memories of sitting on the rooftops in Laredo and listening to gun fire just across the  border in Nuevo Laredo during the 1910 Revolution.  Maria attended public school until the eighth  grade when she was forced to leave to help  the  family make enough money  to sustain  itself. Later, on July 10th, 1933, she married  Ramiro Santos Pen˜a in Laredo. Together, they  had  three children, Pauline P. Baclesse of  Mexico, MO, Ramiro A. Pen˜a of Holland, TX,  and Carlos D. Pen˜a of Clear Lake, TX.  Maria and Ramiro were both active members of  the Primera  Iglesia Bautista where  their children were baptized. Maria credits her  outlook on life and her faith in God for her longevity. Laredo is proud to have Maria as a citizen, and  is pleased  to celebrate her 100th  birthday.

The Prince William Regional Chamber’s  mission is to sustain the strong business climate and high quality of life that has made  Prince William one of the best places to live  in the Nation. It is an organization comprised  of more than 1,000 businesses and community groups  that work  together  to strengthen  the community and promote the region’s business development.  Prince William’s business community has  grown and diversified tremendously over the  Chamber’s 50 years of existence. In order to  effectively represent the range of member industries, the chamber is comprised of various  business councils to ensure all industry perspectives are represented as policies and programs are developed and implemented.  The Regional Chamber  is  integral  to promoting businesses’ profitability and effectiveness, but also serves as an  important  resource  for startup and existing businesses.  They provide valuable  information  for area  businesses and hold informative seminars on  everything  from developing successful business plans  to  creating effective marketing  strategies. In addition, the Chamber is active  in enhancing the community’s quality of life by  providing scholarships  for area high school  students, promoting the efforts of area not-for-  profit organizations and community help organizations, and each year honoring area  regional public safety professionals who have  preformed beyond the call of duty.  We have had the privilege to meet and work  with the members of the Chamber on various  occasions to discuss the issues that affect the  Prince William community and the Nation. The  Regional Chamber has maintained a relationship with policy makers at the Federal, State  and  local  level, and  they have worked  tirelessly  to ensure  that area businesses grow  and succeed.  Mr. Speaker,  in closing, we call upon our  colleagues  to  join us  in congratulating  the  Prince William County Regional Chamber of  Commerce on 50 years of success and wishing  the Chamber success  in  the years  to  come.  f  ARTICLE ON FOOD SAFETY  HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 31, 2006  ",2006
82,104,2006-01-31,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to call your attention to the following article on  food safety, which I submit for the RECORD,  written by my constituent, Richard Gilmore.  Mr. Gilmore is the President and CEO of the  GIC Group. Mr. Gilmore’s article addresses  the  issue of  food safety. While  I may not  agree with all of Mr. Gilmore’s proposals,  I  recommend this article to every citizen interested in the integrity of the food supply chain  and the safety of the food we consume every  day.  [From Barron’s Online, Nov. 7, 2005]  GETREADYFORHEALTHWARS  (By Rick Gilmore)  It’s not easy to fight a war when the weapons could be candy bars or milk, and if the  battlegrounds are in Halloween candy baskets or dairy farms. And if we ever do master  these theaters of warfare, we’ll have to prepare  for other modes of transmission  for  pathogens, such as fruit and vegetable juices,  canned foods, pastas and other grain-based  foods, chicken and fish.  As bad as the chances of a pandemic disease may be, the possibilities for a deliberate  attack on our food chain are endless. And  worse: They are likely because the weapons  are immediately accessible, require minimal  training, are cheap to produce and offer high  kill ratios of innocent citizenry.  Even before 9/11, our government had been  thinking about these ugly scenarios. Multiple scientific studies model and quantify  the human impact of the deliberate release  of a toxin at a dairy farm or a pathogen in  a major city. A theoretical study on milk  said a terrorist needs to add only 10 grams of  botulism toxin to a truck-full of milk to get  400,000 casualties. An aerosol-generated attack of anthrax sprayed with the prevailing  wind could affect as much as 35% of the nearby population within three days, with a case  fatality rate as high as 70%.  Governments and the private sector most  certainly are attempting to build their own  territorial defenses, sometimes more effectively than in others. The Australian method  of dealing with candy bars allegedly contaminated with a pesticide was to recall all  the affected Mars and Snickers bars, crush  them, and dispose of them with a deep burial. The U.K. government detected a carcinogenic food coloring in a Worcestershire sauce  ingredient, and  it notified consumers and  withdrew the product from the shelves. Unfortunately, it did not promptly notify other  states in the European Union, violating Eufor Food and  rope’s Rapid Alert System  Feed.  Such accidents are probably impossible to  stop. We also cannot eradicate avian flu if it  threatens us, but our combat strategy has  many weaknesses. President Bush outlined a  new plan to spend $7.1 billion to stockpile  medications  like Tamiflu and Relenza to  combat an outbreak. The country expects to  have four million doses on hand by Jan. 1,  but  the World Health Organization  recommends stockpiling doses for at least 25%  of the population—73 million Americans.  Whatever our country’s plans, problems  abound. Roche has made it clear that it is already back-ordered more than a year on  Tamiflu, and researchers are concerned that  there won’t be enough antiviral medicine  available to blunt the global onslaught of a  possible pandemic. A pandemic triggered by  a mutated H5N1 virus, moreover, may not be  affected by antiviral drugs or any of the vaccines currently in development. Bush belatedly supported efforts to develop cell-based  vaccines that can be produced much faster  than today’s vaccines, but discoveries don’t  come on timetables.  The BioShield Act of 2004 was passed to address just the kind of threat we face with  avian flu. It sets out to accomplish three  goals: speed the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of drugs and vaccines  to  counter a bioterror attack; create incentives  for  companies  to  develop  new  products  through  government-guaranteed  purchases  of pharmaceuticals and biologics; and secure  long-term stockpiles of such products in case  of an outbreak. Despite the fanfare of the  program, progress has been slow, primarily  because of underfunding and uncertainties  regarding  liability  insurance and  intellectual property protection.  When  it  comes  to our defense  system  against bioterrorism, the whole nation  is  still held hostage. Each leg of the stool—preparedness,  surveillance and protection—is  wobbly at the moment.  We’re planning for an attack within our  borders and have placed minimal attention  on what occurs outside them, despite the  internationalization  of  our  food  system.  Food ingredients are imported from around  the world and exported to consumers and  corporate affiliates worldwide. Kansas and  the Punjab are part of the same food chain.  Staple food items now travel a minimum  of 1,400 miles from farm to table. And yet, we  have a system in place under the FDA and  the U.S. Department of Agriculture that focuses on U.S. registrations, port notifications and reporting for American-based food  companies. Although we seek information on  foreign food companies selling and distributing to U.S. companies, the data do not go  back to the point of origin. Even here at  home we  exclude  farms,  including aquaculture,  from any reporting requirements,  though on-farm crops are the most likely  targets to serve as carriers  for the best-  known  pathogens—stem  rust  for  cereals,  Southern corn-leaf blight, rice blast, potato  blight  and  citrus  canker. The European  Union takes a more thorough approach to  traceability, including every link in the food  chain from farm to table.  By adhering to a territorial defense strategy, we are leaving ourselves and our trading  partners vulnerable when  it comes to exports. Right now, a contaminated food item  from the U.S. could be exported to another  country without our knowledge and without  warning to the foreign buyer. European export certification is compulsory unless specifically exempted by the importing country.  Another vulnerability: The pathogen itself.  Studying  likely pathogens that might be  used in an attack is somewhat like finding a  needle in a haystack.

83,20,2006-02-13,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, people  call Montana  the  ‘‘big  sky’’ State.  Standing on the top of Mount Sentinel—the backdrop of the University  of Montana—on a clear day, a person  can see nearly 50 miles in almost every  direction. I might say that at the top  of Lone Mountain in Big Sky, MT, you  can see the Tetons in Wyoming. Back  at Mount Sentinel, which many of us  climb from time to time, at the foot of  it a professor is studying a horizon that  stretches much farther than 50 miles.  Professor Dan Reisenfeld is one of the  key astrophysicists working on a mission to map and study the edge of the  solar system.  Professor Reisenfeld is busy playing  a part in the design of the interstellar  boundary explorer, or I-BEX, an instrument that uses a large-aperture camera  to detect high-energy particles coming  from the edge of the solar system.  What does this mean? If I-BEX is successful at gathering information about  the boundaries of the solar system, this  will help companies  that build  satellites orbiting the Earth to predict  solar storms. Solar storms can disrupt  a satellite’s operation and even cause  irreparable damage.  Here  on Earth,  that means  that  emergency communications equipment  would be able to function without the  fear of interruption. And global communications can be more seamless.

I  think it would do a lot of good for our  country. I would like to see that happen.  I rise today to offer a motion to instruct the conferees to extend the research credit permanently.  I understand one of the motions to instruct  filed by one of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle says we should  extend the research credit.  ",2006
86,34,2006-02-13,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I don’t  want to be too picky here, but don’t we  have to ask consent to put these motions aside? If that is proper, whatever  is the routine here, so we have some  consistency.  ",2006
87,34,2006-02-13,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator is correct. The Chair was not understanding that the Senator was offering a motion.  ,2006
88,34,2006-02-13,Mr. HATCH.," I wasn’t offering it, but  I will be happy to move to put it aside  when the time comes.  I understand one of the motions to  instruct, as I was saying, filed by one  of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle, says we should extend the research credit for an additional 2 years.  In concept, I certainly agree with this  idea. The research credit is vital to  America keeping its lead in world innovation. But if we are instructing the  conferees as to better tax policy, why  should we stop at a 2-year extension? If  the research credit is worthy of an extension of an additional 2 years, why is  it not worthy of a permanent extension?  Along with the distinguished Senator  from Montana, Senator BAUCUS, I have  been for many years an advocate of  making the research credit permanent.  As the lead Republican sponsor of legislation to provide for a permanent research credit, it seems I have come to  the floor nearly every year for the past  dozen years to either introduce a bill  to make the research credit permanent  or to offer an amendment to do the  same.  I might add that Senator BAUCUS, the  distinguished Senator from Montana,  has been my partner in this matter—or  should I say I have been his partner in  this body. We have worked together to  try and do this, along with a whole raft  of other Senators, usually almost 100  percent.  In 2001, the Senate overwhelmingly  passed an amendment to the Economic  Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation  Act to make the research credit permanent. Unfortunately,  the  permanent  credit was dropped  in conference  in  favor of yet another temporary extension. That amendment  in 2001, however, was not the only time the Senate  voted for a permanent extension of the  credit. It has happened several times. A  very  large majority of Senators has  voted in favor of a permanent tax credit.  My point is that practically every  Senator supports the research credit  being made permanent. Despite this  wide support, permanence has not yet  happened. Instead, we keep extending  the credit for a year or two at a time.  Why do we do this? The answer is  simple. The  artificial  budget  rules  under which we operate prevent us  from making the credit permanent because the cost of the permanent extension is determined to be far in excess of  the cost of an extension for a year or  two.  Another reason that we extend the  research credit for a year or two, rather than permanently,  is that we all  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:51 Feb 14, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G13FE6.064 S13FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006

102,48,2006-02-13,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, I rise to  honor the memory of the late LCDR  Frank Carl Wittwer. Lieutenant Commander Wittwer, a longtime Hanford  resident, perished when his F/A–18C  Hornet went down during a training  mission near Naval Air Facility El  Centro on January 18, 2006. He was 35  years old.  A 1994 graduate of the U.S. Naval  Academy,  Lieutenant  Commander  Wittwer was fondly remembered as a  friendly and active student who participated in a number of activities such  as music and youth ministries at his  church. Upon receiving his bachelor of  science degree in systems engineering,  he began his successful active-duty career as a surface warfare officer aboard  the  USS  California  and  the  USS  McFaul.  In recognition of his considerable talents, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer  was assigned to the Hornet Program  with VFA–137 in 2001. Subsequently, he  received postings at Strike Fighter  Wing Pacific Fleet as safety officer and  a follow-on assignment with the VFA–  97 Warhawks. Throughout his years of  service,  Lieutenant  Commander  Wittwer was known as a dedicated and  honorable  serviceman who embodied  the best qualities and ideals of the U.S.  Navy.  In his personal life, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer demonstrated a genuine  commitment  to  improving  the  lives of others. A popular figure in the  community and an elder in the First  Presbyterian Church  in Hanford, he  had a passion in working with kindergartners and grade school students. A  man of many talents, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer  recently  completed  the executive MBA program at  the  California State University, Fresno’s  Craig School of Business.  Lieutenant Commander Wittwer will  be remembered by those whose lives he  touched as a devoted family man, a  loyal friend and an outstanding member of the U.S. Navy. He is survived by  his wife Mendi; daughters Erin and  Abbie; son Jack; sister Patti; nephew  Josh; and his grandfather Hurdis Harris.  f  STOP COUNTERFEITING IN  MANUFACTURED GOODS ACT  ",2006
103,48,2006-02-13,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I will  to take a moment to speak about H.R.  32, the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005, sponsored by  Representative KNOLLENBERG and  59  House cosponsors. The counterfeiting  of goods bearing American held trademarks is an important problem that I  am committed to fighting, as reflected  by my sponsoring S. 1699, the Senate  companion bill to H.R. 32, earlier this  year with Senator LEAHYand Senators  BAYH,  DEWINE,  ALEXANDER,  BROWNBACK,  COBURN,  CORNYN,  DURBIN,  FEINGOLD,  FEINSTEIN,  HATCH,  LEVIN,  STABENOW,  VOINOVICH.  REED,  KYL,  and  H.R. 32, the Stop Counterfeiting in  Manufactured Goods Act of 2005, addresses a problem that has reached epidemic proportions as a result of a loophole in our Criminal Code: the trafficking in counterfeit labels. Criminal  law currently prohibits the trafficking  in counterfeit trademarks  ‘‘on or  in  connection with goods or  services.’’  However, it does not prohibit the trafficking in the counterfeit marks themselves. As such, there is nothing in current law to prohibit an individual from  selling counterfeit labels bearing otherwise  protected  trademarks within  the United States.  This  loophole was exposed by the  Tenth Circuit Court  of Appeals  in  United States v. Giles, 213 F.3d 1247,  10th Cir. 2000. In this case, the United  States prosecuted  the defendant  for  manufacturing and selling counterfeit  Dooney & Bourke labels that third parties could later affix to generic purses.  Examining title 18, section 2320, of the  United States Code, the Tenth Circuit  held that persons who sell counterfeit  trademarks that are not actually attached to any ‘‘goods or services’’ do  not violate the Federal criminal trademark infringement statute. Since the  defendant did not attach counterfeit  the marks to ‘‘goods or services,’’ the  court found that the defendant did not  run afoul of the criminal statute as a  matter of law. Thus, someone caught  redhanded with counterfeit trademarks  walked free.  H.R.  32  closes  this  loophole  by  amending title 18, section 2320 of the  United States Code to criminally prohibit the trafficking, or attempt to  traffic, in  ‘‘labels, patches, stickers’’  and generally any  item to which a  counterfeit mark has been applied. In  so doing, H.R. 32 provides U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors with the  means not only to prosecute individuals trafficking in counterfeit goods or  services  but  also  individuals  trafficking in labels, patches, and the like  that are later applied to goods.  Congress must act expeditiously to  protect U.S. held trademarks to the  fullest extent of the law. The recent 10-  count indictment of 4 Massachusetts  residents of conspiracy to traffic in approximately $1.4 million of counterfeit  luxury goods  in the case of U.S. v.  Luong et al., 2005 D. Mass., underscores  the need for this legislation. According  to the indictment, law enforcement officers raided self-storage units earlier  this year and found the units to hold  approximately 12,231 counterfeit handbags; 7,651 counterfeit wallets; more  than 17,000 generic handbags and wallets; and enough counterfeit labels and  medallions to turn more than 50,000 generic handbags and wallets into counterfeits. Although the U.S. Attorney’s  Office was able to pursue charges of  trafficking and attempting to traffic in  counterfeit handbags and wallets, they  could not able to bring charges for trafficking and attempting to traffic in the  more than 50,000 counterfeit labels and  medallions. As such, these defendants  will  escape  prosecution  that would  have otherwise been illegal if they had  only been attached to an otherwise generic bag. This simply does not make  sense and had the Stop Counterfeiting  in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005 been  in effect at the time of  indictment,  U.S. prosecutors would have been able  to bring charges against the defendants  for trafficking and attempting to traffic in not only counterfeit goods but  also counterfeit labels.  As Assistant Attorney General Alice  Fisher said, ‘‘Those who manufacture  and sell counterfeit goods steal business from honest merchants, confuse or  defraud honest consumers, and  illegally profit on the backs of honest  American workers and entrepreneurs.’’  This point is underscored by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection  estimate that trafficking in counterfeit goods costs the United States approximately $200–$250 million annually.  With each passing year, the United  States loses millions of dollars in tax  revenues  to  the  sale of  counterfeit  goods. Further, each counterfeit item  that is manufactured overseas and distributed  in  the United States costs  American workers tens of thousands of  jobs. With counterfeit goods making up  a growing 5 to 7 percent of world trade,  this is a problem that we can no longer  ignore.  To be sure, counterfeiting is not limited to the popular designer goods that  we have all seen sold on corners of just  about every major metropolitan city in  the United States. Counterfeiting has a  devastating impact on a broad range of  industries. In fact, for almost every legitimate  product manufactured  and  sold within the United States, there is  a parallel counterfeit product being  sold for no more than half the price.  These counterfeit products range from  children’s toys to clothing to Christmas tree lights. More frightening are  the  thousands  of  counterfeit  automobile parts, batteries, and electrical  equipment  that are being manufactured and placed into the stream of  commerce with each passing day. I am  told that the level of sophistication in  counterfeiting has reached the point  that you can no longer distinguish between the real and the counterfeit good  or label with the naked eye. However,  just because these products look the  same does not mean that they have the  same  quality  characteristics.  The  counterfeit products are not subject to  the same quality controls of legitimate  products, resulting in items that are  lower  in quality and  likely  to  fall  apart.  In  fact,  counterfeit  products  could  potentially  kill  unsuspecting  American consumers.  In addition to closing the ‘‘counterfeit label loophole,’’ the Stop Counterfeiting  in Manufactured Goods Act  strengthens the Criminal Code and provides heightened penalties  for those  trafficking in counterfeit marks. Current law does not provide for the seizure and forfeiture of counterfeit trademarks, whether they are attached to  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:51 Feb 14, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G13FE6.053 S13FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006

108,8,2006-02-17,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, our  country needs additional  funding  for  LIHEAP. Temperatures in rural Alaska  have reached 62 below zero. These temperatures have frozen heating systems  and water and sewer lines in many of  our villages. Alaskans are struggling  this winter and paying over $5 per gallon to heat their homes. In fact, the  mayor of a North Slope community  told me that at one point, a village  paid $8 per gallon.  While the home heating picture  is  not as bleak in other parts of our country, all Americans are feeling the effects of high energy prices.  In December, I tried to address this  situation  by  including  emergency  LIHEAP funding in the Defense Appropriations Bill. Our bill created a new  revenue stream by authorizing oil and  gas development in the Coastal Plain  of ANWR—and used this revenue to  provide  funding  for  several  emergencies. Our bill included $2 billion for  LIHEAP and funding for the hurricane  victims, first responders, and farmers.  The ANWR provision would have created a  long-term, dedicated  funding  stream for home energy assistance.  Most of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle successfully filibustered  consideration of  this package  under the guise of a Rule XXVIII violation. They then noted to remove the  ANWR provision and the funds it provided  from the bill,  including emergency funding for LIHEAP.  It was a sad display of good policy  dying a quick death at the hands of  partisan politics. It was a particularly  sad day for the people this funding was  designed to help.  Despite  this, Americans  still need  heating assistance this winter. I hoped  the Senate would put partisan politics  aside and create a long-term funding  stream for LIHEAP in December. I believe that would have been the best solution.  The measure before us today is the  only other solution available, and  I  urge my colleagues to pass emergency  LIHEAP assistance.  f  S.

110,22,2006-02-17,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to introduce a bill that will help  struggling  communities,  like Aroostook County  in my home State of  Maine, take full advantage of the special tax  incentives  for creating economic growth and community revitalization in empowerment zones. The bill  enables those economically depressed  communities, already  taking advantage of these incentives, to secure the  full 15 years of targeted growth originally granted to the areas first designated as empowerment zones.  I believe all empowerment zone communities need 15 years to reverse the  decades of decline that originally impacted their economies. I have  long  supported  empowerment  zone  incentives, and I believe that these targeted  tax incentives provide struggling communities the best chance for sustained,  long  lasting  economic  renewal.  In  Maine, I have seen first hand empowerment zones’ ability to revitalize faltering communities, with new jobs, and  the creation of the economic activity  needed  for vibrant and strong cities  and towns.  Empowerment zones are vital to the  health of rural Maine. The story of  Aroostook County demonstrates how  decades of decline can force people to  leave rural areas in order to find better, more stable, employment opportunities. Since the 1960s, difficult economic circumstances have caused a  continuous decline in Aroostook County’s population.  In  1994, Loring Air  Force Base closed, the major employer  in Aroostook County at the time, further  decimating  the  area’s  already  struggling economic base and population. The Pentagon wrote, in their  assessment of closure at Loring that,  ‘‘closing Loring Air Force Base would  result in a population loss of approximately 22,000 persons, (the) direct and  indirect  employment  loss of nearly  9,900 jobs, and regional income loss of  just over 92 million dollars.’’ Today,  over 11 years after the Air Force left  Aroostook County, the population hovers near a sparse 73,000 people with 14  percent of these households still living  in poverty.  In 1994, Congress designated the first  empowerment zones setting 2009, a 15-  year timeframe, as the date that these  tax incentives would expire. The 2009  expiration date of empowerment zone  status was held firm for Round II communities designated in 1997, and the  Round III communities designated in  2002; granting communities like Aroostook County, which was designated in  2002, as little as 7 years to use tax incentives to reverse decades of decline  and economic neglect.  Unfortunately, Aroostook’s economic  problems will not be fixed within the 7  short years this area qualifies for empowerment zone tax incentives. Instead  a long-term and lasting commitment of  at least 15 years is necessary to help  Aroostook  communities work  their  way to stronger economic prosperity.  Many  communities,  like Aroostook  County, that were unable to qualify for  empowerment zone status until 2002  are in need of the long-term 15-year  commitment in which to address their  stubborn causes of poverty.  Businesses  operating  within  empowerment zones receive a 20-percent  wage credit for the first $15,000 they  pay in wages to local residents. Other  tax  incentives encourage businesses,  and industries, to further commit to  these  communities. Companies with  businesses in empowerment zones are  eligible for an additional $35,000 worth  of  179  business  expensing—making  these  long-term business obligations  more attractive, affordable, and likely.  Empowerment zones are also eligible  for expanded tax exempt financing for  building  the  infrastructure  communities need to attract long-term developers and business partners.  To qualify  for empowerment  zone  status,  communities  develop  comprehensive strategic plans that depend  on these tax incentives to help them  transform their economies. Each community’s plan focuses on establishing  long-term partnerships between private  businesses, nonprofits, State, local, and  Federal Government agencies, to help  develop the local economy. Together  these  parties  use  the  community’s  strategic blueprint to implement interconnected projects  that address  the  factors creating the area’s economic  sickness. These types of projects focus  on building needed business and industrial infrastructure, developing an educated workforce and diversifying local  economies away from a reliance on one  employer or industry.  In 2002, Aroostook County was designated an empowerment zone based on  population loss, one of only two empowerment zones designated because of  population decline. The county formed  the Aroostook Partnership for Progress  to spearhead their empowerment zone  strategy,  initiatives,  and  projects.

Ever since that point  in  time, we  celebrate Washington’s  birthday with the reading of the 7,641-  word address, and the address has been  made available  to each of our colleagues. I have had the opportunity to  read that 7,641-word address. It means a  lot to be able to share those words  which have been so meaningful and  such a tremendous tradition for this  body and our heritage and, speaking  very directly to the future as well, the  tradition that we will continue to pass  on and respect.  f  ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT  ",2006

I  remember 25 years ago, a quarter of a  century ago, I gave the address and I  was awakened on that day to 25 inches  of snow. The only people who came to  the Congress that day were the Presiding Officer, a clerk, and myself to  deliver  that address.  I  remember  I  walked from my then-residence some 2  miles in the snow. There was a farmer’s  march here, and they were all in a tent  camp, and a tractor drove me up the  hill the final 3 or 4 blocks. It was one  of the few moments of any fame in my  life. I was picked by The New York  Times as the ‘‘Man of the Week’’ for  forging through the storm to give that  very important address. Since then, it  has all been downhill for me.  I wish to address the Senate with regard to these nominations for the Department of Defense. I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the RECORD  a brief biography of each of these distinguished  Americans  who  have  stepped forward to take on these responsibilities.

CUMMINGS  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 16, 2006  ",2006
118,43,2006-02-17,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to the life of Hattie McDaniel, a  woman of  firsts, whose career as an acclaimed singer and actress on film, television,  and radio inspired and illuminated the lives of  many. Her dynamic career afforded her  the  opportunity to break barriers in the entertainment industry, which allowed her to inevitably  create a path for other gifted and aspiring African-Americans in the arts to travel.  Ms. McDaniel was born on June 10, 1895 in  Wichita, KS, to Henry McDaniel, a Baptist minister and  freed slave and Susan Holbert, a  spiritual singer. She was  raised  in Denver,  CO, and was the 13th child of the family. Realizing her talents at an early age, her father  put her in the family performance troupe he  organized and managed.  Her experience aided her  in winning a  medal in dramatic art at age 15. However, in  1910, she dropped out of school and gained  employment as a band vocalist with Professor  George Morrison’s Negro Orchestra.  She  toured the country and in 1915 became the  first African-American to sing on network radio  in the United States.  Ms. McDaniel worked in minstrel vaudeville  shows until the Depression. During this time,  she moved to Milwaukee and worked as a domestic. In 1930, while working as a bathroom  attendant, her vocal abilities were discovered  by the club manager. Subsequently, she landed a job in the club singing for a year and  never looked back.  In 1931, Ms. McDaniel moved to Hollywood  in pursuit of a  film career, a  time  in which  many African-Americans were solely portrayed  as domestics and servants. These roles were  often deemed to be stereotypical and insulting  in the African-American community. However,  Ms. McDaniel did not share this belief, and instead of  turning her back on  the roles, she  worked against the stereotype from within the  system.  As a result, she was able to build a remarkable  three-decade career comprised of over  300 movies, and was able to accomplish what  many others would still consider unattainable.  She was praised for many of her roles including the role of Queenie in Show Boat in 1936;  however, her most memorable role and greatest achievement was through her portrayal of  Mammy in Gone with the Wind in 1939.  Similar to the characters she played in other  movies, she portrayed Mammy as a humble,  submissive, and trusted servant that also possessed an assertive and chastising attitude.  Her subservient yet stem demeanor gained  her immense respect both on and off the camera. In fact, her clever and brilliant performance in Gone with the Wind led her to becoming the first African-American Best Supporting  Actress nominee and winner at  the 1940  Academy Awards. She became the first African-American guest to be invited to the ceremony and was also the first and last recipient  of the prestigious honor for 25 years.  Unfortunately, Ms. McDaniel’s accomplishments were not  revered by everyone. Although heavily criticized by African-Americans,  some whites were  equally  condemnatory.  Many blacks protested at the movie premiere  describing Mammy as a symbolic reminder of  slavery. In fact, Ms. McDaniel had to make the  painful decision not to attend the Gone with  the Wind premiere in Atlanta because of the  highly charged racist climate in the South at  that time.  In response to critics of her career, she simply stated, ‘‘it’s better to get $7,000 a week for  playing a servant than $7 a week for being  one.’’ In fact, as her career progressed, Ms.  McDaniel was able to broaden her career and  shift  into  playing  more  dramatic,  less  stereotypical  roles which encapsulated  the  depth of her talents.  Ms. McDaniel was also an advocate for racial equity and integration. When Whites tried  to block her from moving into her Los Angeles  home, she  rallied her Black neighbors and  they took the case to the Supreme Court and  won. Additionally, she served as the chair of  the African-American sector of the Hollywood  Victory Committee, which provided entertainment for segregated black soldiers. She also  organized  fundraisers  for African-American  youth education.  In 1947, she was cast as a regular in The  Beulah Show radio show. In 1951, The Beulah  Show expanded to the small screen. Unfortunately, Ms. McDaniel appeared in only three  episodes before she lost her battle with breast  cancer and died in 1952.  Her dying wish was to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery on Santa Monica Boulevard  but because of her race, the owner at the time  refused. However,  in 1999,  the new owner  overturned the decision and asked that her remains be  transferred  to  the cemetery. The  family did not want to disturb her remains and  respectfully declined. Nevertheless, the cemetery was dedicated to honoring her wish and  as a result erected a cenotaph memorial on  the lawn overlooking the lake in her memory.  Ms. McDaniel was a  resilient, gifted, and  witty  figure  in American history and her accomplishments are merely the testimonies of  her diligence. She has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame—one for her contributions  to radio and one for her motion pictures contributions.  One of Hattie McDaniel’s favorite and most  famous sayings was, ‘‘Humble is the way.’’ Although she had an admirable career, she had  to travel an arduous path to attain it. However,  through her humility and determination, she  was able to carve her rightful place in American history. That is why I introduced legislation  in  the 108th Congress seeking  to have  her image memorialized on a postage stamp.  As a result, on January 26, 2006, the Postal  Service did indeed select to honor this great  woman by making her the 29th image to appear on  the Black Heritage commemorative  stamp series. I also congratulate fellow Marylander, Ms. Ethel Kessler of Bethesda, for designing the stunning image on the stamp.  Mr. Speaker, though her spirit is gone with  the wind, her  legacy will always  resonate  through her artistic works and thus will continue to live on forever.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF ATASCOSA COUNTY  HON.

119,43,2006-02-17,Mr. CUELLAR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the sesquicentennial of Atascosa County, which  is a county  in  the 28th district of  Texas and was  founded  in 1856. This year  marks the 150th anniversary of Atascosa’s beginnings and we will kick off a year long celebration at the annual Tux and Boots Ball on  Saturday, January 28, in Pleasanton, TX.  Mr. Speaker, Atascosa County is south of  San Antonio on the Rio Grande Plain region of  south central Texas. The first census taken in  Atascosa County was  in 1860 and counted  1,578 people. Today, Atascosa County’s population is at more than 43,000 residents.  The earliest schools  in Atascosa County  were organized around  the  time of  the Civil  War. By 1914, there were 37 schools in the  county. By the 1940s the school districts had  begun to consolidate. The total number of persons over the age of 25 who had completed  4 years of high school  rose  from 1,300  in  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:39 Feb 17, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A16FE8.020 E17FEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 2 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2006
120,50,2006-02-17,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the life of Lance Corporal Jonathan  Kyle Price who was recently killed  in action  fighting for freedom in Ramadi, Iraq.  Lance Cpl Price was a 19 year-old  from  Woodlawn,  Illinois and was assigned  to  the  3rd Battalion, 10th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division,  II Marine Expeditionary Force,  Camp  Lejeune, N.C. He  graduated  from  Woodlawn High School in Woodlawn, Ill.  Price paid the ultimate sacrifice for his country. He  is survived by his mother and stepfather, Cheryl Price Hunsell and John Hunsell  of Woodlawn; his father, David Price of Indianapolis,  Ind.; a brother, John R. Hunsell of  Woodlawn;  two sisters, Krystal Martin and  husband Eric of St. Louis and Rachel Hunsell  of Woodlawn; his  fiancee, Brea Tate of Mt.  Vernon and many other  family,  friends and  loved ones.  I am proud of  the service  this  young man gave to his country and the service his  fellow  troops perform everyday. Not  enough can be said about Lance Cpl Price. It  is soldiers like him that are risking their lives  day  in and day out  to ensure our  freedom  here at home and  to others  throughout  the  rest of the world. I salute him and my best  wishes go out to his family and all the troops  fighting  to ensure  freedom and democracy.  God bless  them and may God continue  to  bless America.  f  TRIBUTE TO MAYOR RICK ALLEN  HON. GREG WALDEN  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 16, 2006  ",2006
121,50,2006-02-17,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to pay  tribute  to a great American, a  dedicated Oregonian, an avid Oregon Duck  fan, and a good friend of mine, Mayor Rick  Allen. Throughout his career, Mayor Allen has  played a significant role in shaping the City of  Madras, while paving the way for future development and growth. Today, we thank him for  his years of public service and recognize the  numerous contributions he’s made during his  tenure in office.  Mr. Speaker, following graduation from Madras High School in 1975, Rick took over as  the manager of the local bowling ally. It was  there that he began learning the ways of the  business world. His hard work at the bowling  alley gave him the experience and knowledge  that led him to his next business endeavor as  the manager of the Tiger Mart. It didn’t take  long until Rick had purchased Tiger Mart and  turned it into a thriving gas station and mini  mart. Soon, he’d be on  to even bigger and  better endeavors.  First elected in 1982, at the young age of  25, Rick embarked into the world of politics as  a member of  the Madras City Council. His  business savvy brought efficiency and effectiveness to his elected post and to the operation of local government. Rick served 6 years  as a member of the city council, and served  as the mayor for the last 2 years. Following  his service on  the city council, Mayor Allen  went on to serve 8 years as a Jefferson County Commissioner, continuing his role of public  stewardship.  Mr. Speaker,  following a brief departure  from elected office, Rick’s dedication and devotion to his community called him back for a  second tour of duty. In 2000, the City of Madras faced great uncertainty with alleged scandals and wrongdoings within the city government. During  these  tumultuous  times, Rick  recognized  the need  for stability and consistent leadership, which encouraged and inspired him  to mount a write-in candidacy  to  once again return to serve as the Mayor of  Madras. He was overwhelmingly elected  in  2001, securing 80 percent of  the vote and  upon election immediately went to work to rebuild and restore trust within the community.  Mr. Speaker, those who know Rick best will  tell you that he’s not one to back down from  a challenge and he’s not afraid to make an  unpopular decision if he believes it is best for  the community. During his tenure, Rick tackled  challenges and controversy head on. He was  a visionary for growth, led the charge for expansion, and has been a champion for economic development  in  the region. Under his  leadership,  the city acquired  industrial  land  near  the airport while making significant  improvements and enhancements to the airport  property. Rick has been a strong advocate for  recreation and  rafters who  float along  the  lower Deschutes River. He was a key player  in East Madras Development Project, which  will establish 1,700 new homes, an 18-hole  golf course, over 60 acres of open space, and  20 acres set aside for the local schools.  Mr. Speaker, these illustrate just a few of  Mayor Allen’s accomplishments during a long  and distinguished career. I ask that my fellow  colleagues join me in congratulating this extraordinary man  and  great American. For  years to come the region will flourish and residents will benefit from the foundation and vision that Mayor Allen has pursued. I wish Rick  the best in future endeavors, and personally,  I would like to thank him for all he’s done for  the people of Jefferson County,  the Second  Congressional District, and the great state of  Oregon.  f  TRIBUTE TO CLOYCE DICKERSON  HON.

Cloyce will be honored at a reception on  Sunday by the membership of the Local.  The Walter Reuther Award is given to UAW  members, public officials and community leaders, in acknowledgement of their contributions  to  the advancement of working people and  their families. 41 years ago Cloyce Dickerson  began his career with General Motors Chevrolet Manufacturing Plant and started his lifelong commitment  to  improving conditions  for  his fellow workers.  He was employed with Chevrolet as a  skilled tradesman and a Building Repairman.

In addition he also was a founding member  of  the North End  ‘‘GOTV’’ Headquarters, a  member of Christ Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church,  former Vice-President and  life  member of the NAACP–Flint Branch, a board  member of Big Brother/Big Sisters, works with  Boys and Girls Club, and  the Democratic  Black Caucus. As  the  father of six and  the  grandfather of nine, Cloyce understands  the  importance of  instilling community values  in  our youth and was recently honored by  the  Flint Human Relations Commission with  the  Service to Youth Award.  Cloyce was inducted into the Afro-American  Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2005 the Bruin Club  of Flint gave him  the Athletic Alumni Award  because of his athletic prowess during his  high school and college years. Cloyce was an  All Conference and All State honoree basketball player during his years attending Central  High School. Attending Mott Community College, Cloyce was on  the school’s 1964 Regional Championship Basketball team.  Mr. Speaker, may  the members of  the  House of Representatives join me in honoring  a remarkable, committed, compassionate man,  Cloyce Dickerson, and he is recognized for his  lifelong contributions to the UAW and its members.  f  GIRL SCOUTS OF NASSAU COUNTY  FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF  GOOD SELF IMAGE FOR GIRLS  HON.

The Girl Scouts provide an extremely important service, always working to find new ways  to address  the key  issues  facing girls and  young women. Recently,  the Girl Scout Research Institute released a study which concluded that feeling acceptance and emotional  health are critical  toward achieving healthy  habits. The study was quite timely, released  just before National Eating Disorder Awareness Week, which  is February 27  through  March 3. The study brings everyday girls’  voices to the forefront of discussions on health  and self esteem issues.  The Girl Scouts of Nassau County offer a  range of healthy living activities that address  the girl as a whole rather than just the food  she eats, her weight and her exercise habits.  Dove, the beauty brand, made that point by  running a Superbowl commercial. The commercial aimed to widen the definition of beauty  and  inspire  healthy,  positive  self-images  among women.

If anyone is worthy of the title ‘‘Mr.  Fairfax,’’ Jack Herrity is that person.  A driven leader during his time with the Fairfax County Board, Jack was the guiding force  in setting the firm foundation for a growing and  developing  Fairfax County. His  leadership  brought us the Fairfax County Parkway, Interstate 66 inside the Beltway and the Dulles Access Road. The Virginia General Assembly  aptly named the Fairfax County Parkway in his  honor in 1995.  After attending Georgetown University as an  undergraduate and as a  law student, Jack  formed Jack Herrity and Associates, a pension  planning and  insurance business. But public  service was Jack’s forte. He quickly became  engaged in northern Virginia politics, serving  on  the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors  from 1971 to 1987. He was elected chairman  of the board in 1975 and served three terms.  He recognized the potential of Fairfax County  to become the largest jurisdiction in the Washington area and helped develop  the once  sleepy rural crossroads, Tysons Corner, into  the thriving commercial district it is today.  Jack Herrity carved a place which  is now  and will  forever be unmatched  in Fairfax  County history. We honor and remember Jack  for his countless accomplishments and unwavering dedication to the people of Fairfax County. We  insert  for  the RECORD a Washington  Post obituary  from February 2. Jack will be  deeply missed by the people of Fairfax County, and at home by his family.  [From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 2006]  (By Lisa Rein and Peter Baker)  John F. ‘‘Jack’’ Herrity, the former chairman of the Fairfax Board of Supervisors who  ushered in a development boom that transformed  the  county  from  sleepy bedroom  community to suburban colossus, died yesterday of heart failure. He was 74.  Herrity, whose scrappy battle with a weak  heart first endeared him to Fairfax voters in  the 1970s, succumbed to an aortic aneurysm  at Inova Fairfax Hospital, where he was admitted two weeks ago with chest pain. He  had a heart transplant 12 years ago.  In his heyday, Herrity dominated Northern  Virginia politics as few others have, commanding attention with his pugnacious style  and unabashedly pro-growth policies. His  was a classic rise-and-fall political story—  from his landslide victories as the Fairfax  economy soared to unprecedented heights to  his crushing defeat  in 1987 when the onslaught of new cars  finally overwhelmed  county roads and voter patience.  Herrity was engaged in county affairs until  the end. From his hospital bed last week, he  was asking former aides to help run his likely campaign for board chairman next year, a  race he lost in 2003 in a Republican primary.  He was busy fighting plans to extend Metrorail to Dulles International Airport, saying  the expense could not be justified. And, in an  about-face some local politicians saw as cynical, he had joined in recent months with  grass-roots activists—and the woman who  defeated him, slow-growth Democrat Audrey  Moore—to fight dense development planned  for the county’s last slivers of open space. He  was at meetings almost every night.  ‘‘To Jack’s credit, if he had a difference of  opinion [with the county’s leadership], he  never sat on his hands,’’ Eric Lundberg, the  Fairfax GOP chairman, said. ‘‘He was willing  to engage in the battle.’’  Herrity could be seen most mornings in a  floppy wide-brimmed hat walking his black  Labrador retriever, Raven, on the W & OD  trail near his Vienna home, where he lived  with his wife, JoAnn Spevacek-Herrity. They  married in November.  ‘‘He’s a piece of our history,’’ said Board  Chairman Gerald E. Connolly (D), who ordered county flags flown at half-staff yesterday. ‘‘He was a political adversary, but he  would do it more often than not with a certain twinkle in his eye. It was more the love  of the fight than the substance of the moment.’’  Herrity was the fourth person to serve as  countywide chairman but the first to hold  the job for a full term, let alone three. He defined the role as a quasi-mayoral position  even though it has no real executive power.  He played a major role in building what  was commonly referred to as the economic  engine of Virginia. By  fostering a superheated business environment, he helped lure  Fortune 500 companies such as what was  then known as the Mobil Corp. to Fairfax  and convert a suburban crossroads called  Tysons Corner  into a commercial center  larger than downtown Miami.  ‘‘Instead of jobs going out of the county,’’  Herrity wanted jobs to stay in the county,  Northern Virginia developer John T. ‘‘Til’’  Hazel said.  During  this  period  of  growth  under  Herrity, more than 1,000 people moved into  Fairfax every month. The county grew into  the largest jurisdiction in the Washington  area. From Herrity’s first election as chairman in 1975 to his ouster in 1987, the county’s  population  jumped by more than a third,  from 554,500 to 746,600—surpassing most U.S.  cities and even several states. Today, more  than 1 million people live in Fairfax.  He was an advocate  for  improving  the  county’s road network and pushed to widen  Interstate 66 inside the Capital Beltway. He  first opposed, then campaigned hard for a  major new road cutting through the county’s  midsection.  The General Assembly named the Fairfax  County Parkway in his honor in 1995.  It was  his  quick-witted,  never-say-die  brand of politics that earned him a loyal following during a crucial transition period in  Fairfax history.  With his burly build, balding pate and  ever-present U.S. flag lapel pin, Herrity became a familiar figure in political and civic  circles. Known simply as Jack, he crisscrossed the 399-square-mile county almost  every day in search of any gathering of two  or more people, often driving so fast that he  collected a glove compartment full of speeding tickets that became legendary.  Throughout his tenure, Herrity was notorious for his penchant for the outrageous,  shoot-from-the-hip statements.  When county officials were thinking about  building a major government center, he suggested that they instead ‘‘build a circus tent  and put the bureaucrats in it.’’ He called  Metro, which opened while he was in office,  a  ‘‘Mighty Expensive Transportation Rip  Off.’’  His tart tongue extended to his rivals as  well. In 1987, he derided Moore as a gadfly  with so little support on the board that, if  she made the motion, she ‘‘couldn’t get a  second to go to the bathroom.’’ Four years  later, he dismissed Rep. Thomas M. Davis III  (R-Fairfax) as a  ‘‘left-wing liberal’’ whose  support from a taxpayers group was ‘‘like  the chicken endorsing the fox.’’ His relationships with both had softened in recent years.  Herrity saw no reason to apologize for his  close alliance with the region’s powerful developers, who he said had helped create a  quality of life envied across the country—  high-paying jobs, good schools, low crime.  But his ties to the real estate industry became his political undoing.  His 1986 conviction on a misdemeanor conflict-of-interest charge for failing to disclose  a relationship with a builder only cemented  Herrity’s public image as a handmaiden of  developers. By then, voter support for the  breakneck pace of  construction had dissolved amid maddening traffic gridlock.

126,6,2006-02-28,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 5  minutes  to  the  gentlewoman  from  Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE).  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to  be able to thank my good friend from  New Jersey, Mr. PAYNE, for his eloquence in commenting on this very important site that will be established.  The site is a national historic treasure  and contains the world’s largest collections of materials related to Thomas  Edison.  As a member of the House Science  Committee,  clearly we  should  use  every opportunity to focus on America’s researchers and inventors and emphasize that Thomas Edison is one of  America’s greatest inventors, who has  shown not only his love for research  and  invention, but his  inexhaustible  energy and genius that produced 1,093  patents in his lifetime, frankly, more  than any other American.  Just this weekend we spent time in  the city of Houston with the State of  the Black Union, and one of the issues  dealt with the digital divide among African Americans. The  idea of highlighting the importance of invention  and the importance of technology of  that time by establishing and making  better the Edison National Historical  Site is, I think, an asset not only to  the Nation but certainly to the place  where it is lodged. I frankly think that  America is a Nation that has great creativity, and I am proud to be an American for that very reason. We are problem-solvers.  Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the further recognition of the works of Thomas Edison by establishing the Thomas  Edison National Historical Park in the  State of New Jersey, it causes me to be  moved to comment on some of the  statements that have been made earlier on the floor of the House and the  week’s events as relates to signs of  showing that we are not creative in our  governance of America today, that is,  of course, the debate and the recognition of the recent contract with UAE  as relates to the taking over of a number of ports throughout America.  Frankly, let me just say that this is  not a debate about the UAE, though we  now know today that the Coast Guard  has indicated that they are not sure  that there is not a potential for there  to be a security risk in light of port operations being in the hands of foreign  entities.  My concern, of course, in this whole  debate is the fact that we are dealing  with foreign entities in one of our most  difficult areas to secure. We know that  a ship laden with weapons of mass destruction  can  be  volatile  and  dangerous.  ",2006
127,6,2006-02-28,Mr. RENZI.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentlewoman yield?  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I will  not yield at this point.  POINTOFORDER  ",2006
128,6,2006-02-28,Mr. RENZI.," Mr. Speaker, I raise a  point of order on the germaneness of  the subject matter.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  ADERHOLT). The gentleman will state  his point of order.  ",2006
129,6,2006-02-28,Mr. RENZI.," Mr. Speaker, although I  appreciate  very much  the  gentlewoman’s comments as they relate to  Thomas Edison and in particular her  teaching, which enlightened me on his  being the greatest inventor in American history, I would ask that we look  at the germaneness of the subject matter and confine debate to the relevance  of the subject matter, please.  ",2006
130,6,2006-02-28,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," The gentleman  is correct. Debate should be  confined to the pending question.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, as my good friend from the  Republican side wishes to extinguish  debate, let me just indicate, as I started out before, that Thomas Edison represents innovativeness. Unfortunately,  our present administration is not innovative.  So, Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that  my colleagues will join me in being innovative by not yielding to any compromises that may quash the thoughtfulness that we would have in dealing  with our homeland security, which, of  course, also involves technology.  I hope that we will have a reasonable  debate. My good friend from the other  side of the aisle, I hope he will engage  in this debate so that legislation that I  am offering that is creative, that deals  with putting a moratorium on any of  these operations owned by foreign entities, a study by the GAO, a study by  Homeland Security about our security,  I hope that we will have the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to be relevant at  another time.  Again, let me say I congratulate the  sponsors  of  this  legislation  dealing  with the Thomas Edison National Historical Park. It exudes innovativeness  and respect for creativity in America.  It is sad to say that the last week’s  activities and our failures for America’s ports show no creativity. It  is  time for Congress to be as creative as  it can be  in  securing  the Nation’s  homeland.  ",2006
131,6,2006-02-28,Mr. PASCRELL.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to include these in the extension of remarks.  I want to speak in strong support of H.R.  1096—legislation to help restore the Thomas  Edison National Historic Site.  I congratulate  my colleague SCOTTGARRETT for introducing  this worthy legislation. It has been a privilege  to work closely with Representative GARRETT  and Representative DONPAYNE, whose district  houses a large portion of the Edison site, to  preserve this national treasure.  I am proud that I represent a region of New  Jersey  that has given birth  to some of  the  greatest  innovations  in our Nation’s history:  Thomas Edison’s Glenmont estate in West Orange and the Great Falls National Historic District  in Paterson—America’s First  Industrial  City. Each of these impressive areas—only 10  miles apart—sprang  from  the  imagination of  two of the great pioneers in American history:  Thomas Edison and Alexander Hamilton. Both  of  these sites—the Edison National Historic  Site and the Great Falls Historic District—have  been  included among  the most endangered  historic areas in our Nation. The artifacts of  both sites are in terrible physical condition and  are in grave peril of being lost to the country  forever.  Together, these majestic places tell the inspiring story of the rise of the greatest technological and economic power  the world has  ever known. I strongly believe that it is the role  of the Federal Government to partner with the  local community to preserve the glory of these  places for all future generations to behold.  Although these sites are both close to my  heart, I want to specifically voice my support  for  the preservation and rehabilitation of  the  Edison National Historic Site, which embodies  Edison’s  legacy as a pioneer of American  technology. The Edison National Historic Site,  encompassing Edison’s home and laboratory  complex,  is  regarded as one of America’s  original  research and development  facilities.  Half of Edison’s astonishing 1,093 patents  were earned during the 44 years he lived in  West Orange.  The classic inventions created at this site include the phonograph, electric generating systems, the dry storage battery, and the motion  picture camera. Edison left a vast collection of  artifacts, models, photographs, drawings, and  furnishings at the Edison site. In addition, he  left nearly 3,500 notebooks documenting every  experiment,  idea,  failure,  observation  and  business strategy of his long career.  Even as Thomas Edison lives on as one of  the leading visionaries of our time, his home  and labs have tragically fallen into severe disrepair due  to age-related decay. The public  and private sector must work together to ensure that adults and young people alike will always be able to rediscover the genius of Edison and the impact he has had on all of our  daily lives. The support of the National Park  Service has enabled the Edison Preservation  Foundation to create a vital public-private partnership to maintain the site as a major community and educational resource.  Despite  this progress, Congressional support through H.R. 1096 is vital to the Edison  site’s long-term success. The legislation is an  important symbol of Congress’s commitment  to preserving the legacy of one of America’s  most  influential  inventors and  to restoring a  Federal site that is a historic landmark. I urge  the House of Representatives to move forward  and approve this important legislation.  ",2006

134,13,2006-02-28,Mr. GONZALEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong support of H. Res. 668 to give recognition where recognition is long overdue. With  this  resolution,  Congress  applauds  the  groundbreaking  significance  of  the  1966  NCAA Division I men’s basketball championship in which Texas Western upset the heavily  favored University of Kentucky. That year, the  Miners had an all-Black starting line-up, a first  in a national championship competition  that  helped change  the perception of Black athletes.  Texas Western Coach Don Haskins and his  players may not have set out to change history, but  they did. The 1966 championship  game helped pave the way for integration of  athletics, opening sports  to  the civil  rights  movement, often being dubbed, the Brown v.  Board of Education of sports. The next season,  the Southwest Conference was  integrated, and in 1967–68, Vanderbilt broke the  Southeast Conference color barrier.  Unfortunately, it has taken decades before  Coach Haskins and his players’ achievements  have been recognized. In 1966 there were no  trips to the White House or appearances on  the Ed Sullivan show, both customary for national champions. The team did not even receive national championship rings until  their  20-year reunion in 1986.  It is time to recognize the profound contribution to the civil rights movement that this game  spurred, and to recognize the 1966 NCAA Division  I men’s  basketball  champions,  the  Texas Western Miners. I urge my colleagues  in joining me in supporting this bipartisan legislation.  ",2006
135,13,2006-02-28,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 1966  Texas Western Men’s Basketball Team. Their  NCAA championship  victory over Kentucky  forever changed college athletics.  Even  though  it had been over a decade  since Brown v. Board of Education, many colleges had lagged behind on implementing integration into their athletics programs. In 1966,  college basketball players were often recruited  on  the basis of  their skin color rather  than  playing ability. Texas Western  coach Bob  Haskins did not succumb to pressures to start  his White players. He simply played his best  players regardless of skin color.  This resulted  in  the  first  time an all-Black  starting line-up participated in a major athletic  championship contest. The  impact was  felt  throughout  the  country  when  little-known  Texas Western upset legendary all-White Kentucky.  Perhaps most important in this victory was  the stereotypes and misconceptions that were  broken down. For many, the assumption remained that Black players would not be skilled  or  smart  enough  to  successfully  compete  against White players. Bob Haskins and Texas  Western proved on a national stage that Black  players can win and are as smart and talented  as their White counterparts.  The 1966 Texas Western men’s basketball  team opened the doors for schools that had  stalled in implementing integration policies into  their athletics programs; breaking down barriers and forever changing college athletics.  ",2006
136,13,2006-02-28,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  thank Congressman SILVESTREREYES for offering House Resolution 668, a  resolution  which celebrates this year’s 40th anniversary  of Texas Western’s 1966 NCAA Basketball  Championship.  The year of 1966 marked a number of  ‘‘firsts’’ by African Americans. The Honorable  Robert C. Weaver became  the  first African  American Cabinet member with his appointment as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Edward Brooke became  the  first  popularly elected African American  to  the  United States Senate, and it also marked the  first  time a collegiate basketball  team,  the  Texas Western Miners, sporting an all African  American line-up won the NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Championship.  What made this victory important, and what  we are commemorating here today, is not the  fact that a team starting all African American  student athletes beat a team of all White student athletes. We commemorate  rather,  the  closing of one more chapter of segregation  and bigotry to a new chapter where we judge  an individual on the content of their character  and qualifications and not on the color of their  skin.  The Texas Western Miners, in their victory  over  the University  of Kentucky Wildcats,  opened up numerous opportunities for student  athletes of all races and creeds to attend college, participate in sports, and become eligible  for athletic scholarships. The fact that the impact that this victory did so much to change  the perception of African-American athletes  and to speed the desegregation of intercollegiate sports, has  lead many people  to  label  this historic event as the Brown v. Board of  Education of athletics.  Finally, any tribute to the Minors would be  incomplete without acknowledging their coach,  Don Haskins. Coach Haskins  is  to be commended for his continued commitment to build  on the foundation of integration that he inherited at Texas Western—the first college in a  Southern state to integrate its athletic teams—  and for his courage in facing collegiate basketball’s racial issues directly.  ",2006
137,13,2006-02-28,Mr. MARCHANT.," Mr. Speaker, today I recognize  the 40th anniversary of Texas Western’s 1966 NCAA Basketball Championship.  The title game had a profound impact on the  state of racial  integration  in sports and civil  rights in America.  On March 16, 1966, Coach Don Haskins led  the first ever all-Black starting lineup to play in  a major championship contest in a victory over  the heavily-favored Kentucky Wildcats.  Coach Haskins played high school basketball in Enid, Oklahoma, and in college at Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State). He  then  became a successful high school basketball  coach  in Texas. Haskins was a coach at  Dumas High School before becoming  the  head of  the men’s  team at Texas Western  College, now  the University of Texas at El  Paso, in 1961.  Haskins coached the Miners to 33 winning  seasons over the course of his career with the  Miners. He won seven Western Athletic Conference championships, four Western Athletic  Conference  tournament  titles, and made 21  post-season appearances. He established a  proud winning tradition in the community of El  Paso  that still exists  today. Coach Haskins  was voted in to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997.  The Texas Western Miners’ victory was a  watershed moment for diversity in college athletics. It helped expand the civil rights movement into the realm of sports. On January 13,  2006, Walt Disney Pictures  released Glory  Road, which tells the story of the historic 1966  season and pays tribute to the dedication and  bravery of Coach Haskins.  ",2006

(2) Braille lost his sight at the age of three  after injuring himself with an awl in the  shop of his father Rene, a maker of harnesses  and other objects of leather.  (3) A youth who was both intelligent and  creative and was blessed with dedicated parents, a thoughtful local priest and an energetic local schoolteacher, Braille adapted to  the situation and attended local school with  other youths of his age, an unheard-of practice for a blind child of the period.

144,20,2006-02-28,Mr.  RANGEL.," Thank you to the Tuskegee  Airmen. Thank you, America, for recognizing  these  battle-worn  soldiers.  God bless them and God bless America.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1259,  ‘‘to authorize  the President  to award a gold  medal on behalf of the Congress, collectively,  to the Tuskegee Airmen in recognition of their  unique military record, which inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces.’’  On July 19, 1941 the American Air Force  created an all black flight training program at  the  Tuskegee  Institute  in  Alabama.  The  Tuskegee Airmen were not only unique in their  military record, but they inspired revolutionary  reform in the Armed Forces, paving the way  for  integration of  the armed services  in  the  U.S.  The first class of cadets began in July 1941  with 13 men, all of whom had college degrees,  some with PhD’s and all had pilot’s licenses.  From  all  accounts,  the  training  of  the  Tuskegee Airmen was an experiment established to prove that ‘‘coloreds’’ were incapable  of operating expensive and complex combat  aircraft. Stationed in the segregated South, the  black cadets were denied rifles.  The Tuskegee Airmen were credited with  261 aircraft destroyed, 148 aircraft damaged,  15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions  over Italy and North Africa. They destroyed or  damaged over 950 units of ground transportation and escorted more than 200 bombing  missions. ‘‘We proved that the antidote to racism is excellence in performance,’’ said retired  Lt. Col. Herbert Carter, who started his military  career as a pilot and maintenance officer with  the Tuskegee Airmen’s 99th Fighter Squadron.  Clearly, the experiment, as it was called, was  an unqualified success.  The Tuskegee Airmen were awarded three  Presidential Unit Citations, 150 Distinguished  Flying Crosses and Legions of Merit, along  with the Red Star of Yugoslavia, nine Purple  Hearts, 14 Bronze Stars and more than 700  Air medals and clusters. It goes without question that the Tuskegee Airmen are deserving  of the Congressional Gold Medal.  I would like to thank Congressman RANGEL  for his work in bringing this legislation to the  floor of Congress, and his efforts in gathering  308 cosigners. This is an important, and long  overdue piece of  legislation.  I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to give  their support  to H.R. 1259, authorizing  ‘‘the  President to award a gold medal on behalf of  the Congress, collectively,  to  the Tuskegee  Airmen . . .’’  ",2006
145,20,2006-02-28,Mr. NEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. SCHWARZ).  ",2006
146,20,2006-02-28,Mr.  SCHWARZ  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, I have had the pleasure of  meeting the Tuskegee Airmen, the survivors, on a number of occasions. A  number of them live in my home State  of Michigan, especially Major General  Lucius Theus, who lived in Detroit, a  distinguished member of the Tuskegee  Airmen. They last rallied in Michigan  at Jackson, Michigan, in the summer  of 2004; and our colleague  from the  other body, Senator MCCAIN, and  I  were privileged to be at that meeting  and greet the airmen.  As the unit approached its first year  in action, it learned that it was being  transferred to the 332nd Fighter Group,  a unit activated at Tuskegee in mid-  1942 and transferred to Michigan in 1943  where  it  conducted  training  at  Selfridge Air Base and Oscoda Air  Base, both in the eastern side, on the  eastern side of the State of Michigan,  before deploying to Italy. The 332nd  was composed of four African American  squadrons, the 99th 100th, 301st, and  302nd under the command of Colonel  Davis.  Not long after arriving in Italy, the  members of the 332nd were heavily involved in combat missions. Assigned to  bomber escort with the 15th Air Force,  it escorted the bombers on missions  around Italy, flew on the raids to the  access oil refineries in Ploesti, Romania, and strafed German troops retreating from Greece. It established a reputation for protecting its bombers. The  pilots always followed Colonel Davis’  orders. Your  job  is  to protect  the  bombers and not chase enemy aircraft  for personal glory, he said. The Germans called the 332nd the Schwartze  Vogrl Menshen, the black birdmen, and  began to see a plane with a red tail as  something to fear.  On March 24, 1945, the 332nd went on  the longest mission flown by the 15th  Air  Force  to  the  Daimler-Benz  tankworks in Berlin. On this mission,  it downed three of the new Messerschmitt ME–262 jet fighters. The group  received a distinguished unit citation  for its performance that day.  At the end of the war, the Tuskegee  Airmen returned to an America that  was as segregated as the one they had  left.  b1600  Some of the veterans became leaders  in the  fight  for desegregation, both  military and civilian. With their own  community, they offered pride and encouragement. And to the white community they offered an example of the  equality of men. The Air Force became  desegregated in April of 1948. Unfortunately, the rest of the Nation would  take much  longer. But  there  is no  doubt  that  the  example,  professionalism,  and  expertise  of  the  Tuskegee Airmen hastened that day.  It is fitting today, then, Mr. Speaker,  that this bill would bestow the Congressional Gold Medal, our body’s highest expression of national appreciation  for  distinguished  achievements  and  contributions, upon the members of the  Tuskegee Airmen  in  recognition  of  their service to our country during  World War II and in the years after  that conflict. They are living examples  of what is possible when racism is defeated and opportunities are equally  available to all members of our great  country.  ",2006

148,20,2006-02-28,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I cannot rise to the  heights of CHARLIERANGEL, but I rise  in tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen. For  years, it seems we have considered bills  honoring the contributions of these heroic airmen. It is about time this one  passed and passed with huge support.  Their achievements in support of our  efforts in World War II have inspired  books and movies. They have earned  decorations and awards for valor that  are too numerous to cite. As Mr. RANnoted, 992 graduated  from pilot  training at Tuskegee; 450 went overseas  to North Africa and Italy; some 150  died either in training or in combat  missions. And yet, though they were  shot down, not a single bomber, as Mr.  RANGELnoted, among the many they  escorted was ever shot down.  While  their accomplishments have  been recognized by the military, the  military  in truth cannot adequately  honor all of their accomplishments because these men fought and won other  battles that were not military in nature. They defied those who thought  they lacked the intelligence, the skills,  the courage, even the patriotism to fly  and fight. Their courage in the air is  legendary, but their courage on the  ground and in our society made their  achievements in the air all the more  meaningful and remarkable.  Today, the impact of the Tuskegee  Airmen reaches far beyond the skies of  Italy and North Africa. Their service  led to social changes in our country  that  include  the  integration of our  Armed Forces.

149,27,2006-02-28,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  applaud the House Republican leadership  for  finally  standing up  to  the  President and saying no on this agreement, this $6.8 billion contract with  the company  from the United Arab  Emirates.  The problem, however, is more fundamental than just stopping this one. It  is what happens with national security  in our trade agreements. We are in the  middle of negotiating a trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates.  If this trade agreement had already  been signed, we could not back out of  this deal with this United Arab Emirates country. It would be an unfair  trade practice.  The administration and the Congress  have it exactly backwards. Before signing trade agreements, before negotiating a new trade agreement, we need a  provision to address national security  concerns  first. That means a review  about all the implications of national  security before we  sign  these  trade  agreements. That is why I am introducing legislation tonight to do just  that.  f  MARGARET  ROGERS  OF  BROOKSVILLE,  HONORING  GHIOTTO  FLORIDA  (Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to  revise and extend her remarks.)  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is March 1,  and  each March we  celebrate  the  achievements of our American women  during Women’s History Month.  This year I want to take the opportunity  to  honor Margaret  Rogers  Ghiotto from Brooksville, Florida. A  decorated and accomplished business  leader and humanitarian, she deserves  special recognition for her good work  and deeds throughout her 89 years. She  was a pillar in the Hernando County  community until her death earlier last  month. Her story is an inspiration to  all Americans, but especially women.  Known by her friends and family as  Weenie, her  success  as  a  businesswoman came at a time when a woman’s  place was supposed to be in the home.  She owned and managed Rogers Christmas House, as well as Jennings House  in Brooksville, Florida, that is on the  National Register.  It was with great reverence and admiration  that  friends,  family,  and  members of the community paid their  respects to Margaret on February 18,  2006. Margaret’s story is an inspiration  not only to women business owners but  to all residents throughout the Nation.  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET IT  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, I think it is important, as we  have participated in the rising thunder  of  the discussion of port ownership  around America, to say that the American people get it. What they get is  that we are in a new day after 9/11. We  want to make sure that our constitutional rights are protected, but we also  want to make sure the homeland is secure. That is the promise that this administration made  to  the American  people. And, frankly, to know that our  ports are subjected to the potential of  being bought and sold on the open market is a frightening concept.  It  is well known  that  a  tanker  massed with weapons of mass destruction at any one of our ports could be  probably more devastating than the  horrific events of 9/11. Tomorrow, I will  introduce legislation that will ask for a  moratorium for the Nation’s ports and  the buying and selling to foreign entities, not entities in the Middle East,  not entities in Europe, but all foreign  entities. I will ask, as well, for a GAO  study to determine what is the status  of security for our ports. And finally, I  will ask for a report on the security  status of the 10 largest ports in America.  Let’s give a solution. We don’t need  contracts that sell away our security.  f  HONORING  NATIONAL  PEACE  CORPS WEEK AND THE 45TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  PEACE  CORPS  (Mr. KLINE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

156,34,2006-02-28,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. WATERS) is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2006
157,34,2006-02-28,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to address the deteriorating situation in Iraq. Over the past 10 days, we  have seen a country on the brink of  civil war slide into civil war.  On February 22, a bomb exploded at  the Golden Mosque causing significant  damage to one of Shiite Islam’s holiest  shrines and setting off the latest and  most violent sectarian violence since  the war began in 2003.  Since the war began, we have witnessed almost daily bombings in Iraq.  Thousands of IEDs have been exploded.  Hundreds  of  suicide  bombings have  been staged. Tragically, the number of  such attacks has grown each year, a  stark contrast to the Vice President’s  prewar assessment that we would be  greeted as liberators.  According to the U.S. Department of  Defense, the number of insurgent attacks on our soldiers, Iraqi security  forces, and civilians increased 29 percent in 2005 when compared to 2004.  Specifically, the number of car bombs  increased to 873  in 2005, more than  twice of the number of car bombs in  2004, and the number of suicide car  bombs went to 411 from 133.  Conservative estimates suggest that  more than 30,000 Iraqi men, women and  children have been killed since the war  began. Unfortunately,  Iraqis are not  the only ones caught up in these attacks. More than 2,296 U.S. soldiers  have died in Iraq and more than 16,825  have been injured. And I am sorry, I do  not have the number of amputees or  suicides tonight. But they are serious.  Our very presence in Iraq fuels the  death, destruction and has helped create the civil war which now endangers  millions of lives. These are not just my  words. The same thoughts and sentiments are being  echoed  throughout  conservative America.  It was said here earlier tonight, William F. Buckley, Jr., the founder of  ‘‘The National Review’’ recently wrote,  ‘‘One cannot doubt that the American  objective in Iraq has failed.’’  Bill Kristol, one of the war’s staunchest defenders recently said, ‘‘We have  not had a serious 3-year effort to fight  a war in Iraq.’’  Even columnist George Will recently  described Iraq in this manner. ‘‘This is  a civil war,’’ he said.  The bombing of the Golden Mosque  pushed Iraq over the edge. Thousands  of Iraqis are in the streets protesting  and others are attacking their historical  enemies  in  retaliation  to  the  bombing of the Golden Mosque.  According  to  today’s Washington  Post, more than 1,300 individuals have  been killed, and more than 1,000 Sunni  mosques have been attacked since last  week’s bombing of the Golden Mosque.  Instead of putting a stop to the violence, Iraq’s security forces are contributing to the murders. It is clear  that some Iraqis have joined the Iraq  Army  to  continue  family or  tribal  feuds under the protection of the Iraqi  military uniform and that many Iraqis  do not trust the military because of  ethnic divisions.  This is a stark difference from the  President’s words that the Iraqis are  successfully assuming the role of protecting their fellow countrymen. It is  very interesting to note that the very  week that Iraq has seen the most violent sectarian violence in years, the  Defense Department announced  that  the number of Iraqi Army battalions  capable  of  fighting  the  insurgency  without U.S. help had fallen from one  to none since September 2005.  Last  summer,  a  defense  official  claimed that there were three battalions ready to take on the insurgency.  However,  in September 2005, General  George Casey, the top U.S. commander  in Iraq, told the Senate Armed Services  Committee that the number of Iraqi  battalions  capable of  fighting  independently of U.S. troops had dropped  from three to one. Therefore, despite 3  years and more than $260 billion, we  find that the number continues to decrease.  Now, the President  is asking Congress to pass a supplemental appropriations request of $75 billion for the Iraq  war, the war on terrorism, and the gulf  coast recovery efforts. The lion’s share  of this money, about $63 billion, is for  the Iraq war. If this bill passes, the  total amount we will have spent on the  war will be over $350 billion.  The President is asking us to spend $350  billion a war  that his Administration claimed  would be of minimal cost  to American  taxpayers.  Perhaps worse,  the President wants  to  spend hundreds of billions of dollars on this  war at a time when the Congress is pushing  through  tens of billions of dollars  in cuts  to  Medicare, education, Community Development  Block Grants and other important programs.  Mr. Speaker, the Administration has failed. It  is long past time for our troops to come home.  Civil war has broken out—we can not expect  our soldiers  to  try  to sort out which side  is  which in this civil war and we should not take  sides.  I urge  the President  to conclude  this  war and bring our troops home.  f  b2030  MARKING THE 18TH ANNIVERSARY  OF THE SUMGAIT MASSACRES  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  CONAWAY).

159,48,2006-02-28,Mr. ROSS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman from Georgia for joining us  this evening, and I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for joining us.  As members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, we are 37  strong. There are 37 of us in this town  that are committed to trying to get  our fiscal house in order, to once again  have a nation that knows how to live  within its means.  If you have questions or comments  that you want us to answer next Tuesday night, you can e-mail them to us  at bluedog@mail.house.gov.  At the beginning of our hour, I pointed out that the debt as of today is  $8,251,355,000,000.  That  is  $8,251,355,000,000. Every man, woman,  and child in America, their share of the  national debt  is $27,674. And  it continues to grow. It continues to grow. In  fact, just in this last hour our Nation’s  debt has increased by $41.666 million.  So, obviously, you see when we started  an hour ago  it was $8,251,355,000,000,  and, unfortunately, it has increased to  $8.293 trillion. Just another example of  how our Nation must get  its  fiscal  house in order.  I think it is very appropriate that we  spend a  little bit of time changing  these numbers and letting people see  that in the hour that we have stood  here talking about our Nation’s debt  and deficit and getting our fiscal house  in order, we have seen the Nation’s  debt go up by $41.666 million. The debt  now in our Nation $8,251,293,000,000.  f  AMERICAN HERITAGE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  DAVISof Kentucky). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 4,  2005, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  PRICE) is recognized for half the time  remaining  until midnight,  approximately 42 minutes.  ",2006
160,48,2006-02-28,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I  appreciate  the opportunity  to come  and chat with the House and to maybe  set the record straight a little bit.  As a freshman Member of the House,  we have 24, 25 freshmen on our side of  the aisle, and over the past 13 months  we have grown a little weary with what  we see as the amount of misinformation and disinformation that we so oftentimes see brought by the other side,  so we have developed what we call the  Official Truth Squad. And so I am here  to bring you some messages with some  of my  colleagues  from  the Official  Truth Squad, which is an effort to try  to embrace the American Dream, to  embrace the American vision, and to  present to the American people and our  colleagues the story that Congress is  working in a positive manner, that we  are optimistic about the Nation’s future in spite of some things that you  hear from some of our friends on the  other side of the aisle.  When I go home and I talk to constituents, I oftentimes hear them say,  What is going on up there? Why all the  negativity? Why all  the pessimism?  Why all the misinformation that we  appear to hear all the time? And I commiserate with them. So this Official  Truth Squad is an attempt to try to  bring some light to truth, to some of  the  information that we believe the  American people ought to have in contrast to some of the things that you  have heard, even here tonight.  I am pleased to hear the Blue Dogs  present a proposal or two. They talk  about being fiscally conservative. They  talk about being fiscal hawks. But my  recollection is a little bit to the contrary of that. There  is a wonderful  quote that I like from Daniel Patrick  Moynihan, a former United States Senator from New York, Democrat. And he  was such a cogent individual. He was  one of those individuals who worked  for the truth regardless of where it led.  And he had this wonderful quote. He  said,  ‘‘Everyone  is entitled to their  own opinion but not their own facts.’’  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. And I really think that that kind of crystallizes  what we have heard in this Chamber  over the past few minutes.  You have heard the other side talk  about deficit  spending and how we  ought not be spending into the deficit,  and they are right. They are right. But  when they had an opportunity to decrease spending by nearly $40 billion  just a few short weeks ago, not a single  one of them, not one of them, voted for  it. A $39.8 billion decrease in spending  and not a single one voted in favor of  it.  You heard them talk about the alternative minimum tax and how it is an  unjust tax and it needs to go away, and  they are right. They are right. A colleague of mine, Congressman ENGLISH,  has a bill, H.R. 1186, that would repeal  the alternative minimum tax. Not a  single Democrat on that bill, not a single cosponsor  from that side of the  aisle.  You hear them talk about the need  to balance the budget and not spend so  much money, and they are right. They  are absolutely right. But when the proposals are put on the table to do away  with programs that are wasteful or do  away with programs that have significant abuse, where are they? Nowhere  to be found.  So you are entitled to your own opinions, but you are not entitled to your  own facts. And to crystallize that a little more because the disinformation  that we heard over and over about  budgetary cuts really does a disservice  to the debate, does a disservice to the  discussion, does a disservice  to  the  American people, because when you  look at the numbers, when you look at  the truth, that is not what is going on.  And this evening you have heard the  other side talk about budgetary cuts in  the area of defense spending and spending on veterans. So, at home, if I were  sitting there  listening,  I would say,  well, my goodness, they must have addressed the amount of money that was  going to the military or decreased the  amount of money going to veterans.  Mr. Speaker, is that not what you  would think? That  is what  I would  think if I heard that. But here we have  the Defense Department appropriation,  budgetary  authority  from  Congress  from the year 2000 projected through  2007. In 2000 it was $287 billion. In 2001  it was $303 billion. That does not sound  like a cut to me. In 2002, $328 billion.  That  is real money. That does not  sound like a cut to me. In 2003, $365 billion.  Remember, down here in 2000 we were  at $287 billion.  So these are the actual numbers. Fiscal year 2006, $411 billion of budgetary  authority for the Department of Defense. Mr. Speaker, that is not a cut.  That  is responsible spending on the  part of the United States Congress.  And I am proud of the support that we  have given to our military. And I am  proud of the support that we continue  to give to veterans.  You have heard this evening that  veterans’ budgets were cut. Here are  the numbers, the actual numbers, from  1984 through 2005, and I want to draw  your attention to what has happened in  the last 10 years. In 1994 discretionary  spending  for  veterans:  $17.2  billion;  1995, $17.6 billion; 2005, $30.7 billion.  Mr. Speaker, I do not know what  arithmetic they are using. I do not  know where they went to school, but I  do know that that is not a cut in anybody’s book.  So when we get this kind of misinformation, this kind of disinformation,  it does not contribute to the public debate. It is not honest. It is not truthful.  So the Official Truth Squad is here to  try to bring some truth to the situation.  This is veterans’ medical care, and  you heard it talked about this evening,  how we have these incredible cuts in  medical care for veterans. Mr. Speaker,  here are the numbers: 1994, $15.6 billion; 2005, $29.9 billion. Mr. Speaker,  that is not a cut. It is an appropriate,  responsible move by Congress to take  care of those who are protecting our  freedoms.  So  remember what Mr. Moynihan  said, You are welcome to your own  opinions but you are not welcome to  your own facts.  So  I would  like to highlight this  evening what is called the politics of  division that seems to be practiced by  so many here in Washington, and it is  disheartening and it does a disservice  to all of us. We are going to talk tonight in a positive way about America.  We are going to talk in a positive way  about our future. We are going to talk  in a positive way about our Founding  Fathers and about our history and  about our heritage.

162,55,2006-02-28,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, our nation’s history  is  interwoven with  the accomplishments  and contributions of African Americans—from  Hank Aaron, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong to George Washington Carver, W.E.B.  Du Bois, and Maya Angelou—and because of  their efforts our nation is stronger. The African  American community recently  lost  two of  its  leaders and as we mourn the passing of Rosa  Parks and Coretta Scott King, we should be  reminded that we must continue the civil rights  work they devoted their lives to. What better  way to celebrate the legacy of these leaders  and all of those who have worked to ensure  racial justice than by reauthorizing the expiring  portions of the Voting Rights Act. The struggle  for civil rights continues today and we must  make certain that all citizens not only have the  right  to vote, but  that  their ability  to vote  is  protected.  Although the Voting Rights Act has been essential in protecting the voting rights of minorities, additional safeguards are necessary  to  ensure  that every citizen  is  included  in  the  election process.  I remain committed  to  furthering the causes of the Civil Rights Movement and will work hard in the coming months  to guarantee the right to vote for every citizen.  I hope that this month we will celebrate the  lives of all of the strong and determined men  and women who have worked  to ensure  equality for all Americans.  ",2006
163,55,2006-02-28,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr.  Speaker,  celebrating  Black History Month is an opportunity to reflect  upon  the  innumerable  contributions  that  Blacks have made  to  the advancement of  American society and culture. People of color  whether from the homeland in Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America or North America, they  have been more than instrumental in shaping  the social complexion of America and humanity.  It was Carter G. Woodson in 1926 who initiated  ‘‘Negro History Week’’  in  the United  States to promote ‘‘a better understanding of  the contributions’’ of Blacks to human civilization. This noble effort 80 years ago has been  successful  in  informing people all over  the  world about  the numerous contributions of  Blacks. It has also aided in reshaping and negating distortions that historians have in many  cases intentionally promulgated. Black History  Month continues  to amplify accurate depictions and narratives about a myriad of global  endeavors. These undertakings have drastically improved the daily lives and landscape  of the world.  Individuals such as Pianky, the military genius and Black King of Nubia who conquered  Egypt around 700 BC; Antar, the African-Arabian poet and story  teller; and Abram Hannibal, the soldier and commander of 18th century Russia  to Chaka who  led South Africa  until his assassination  in 1828 all exemplify  and  indicate historic contributions  to society.  ‘‘Their presence and deeds underscore an essential reality: Blacks have been part and parcel of world history, from exploration and revolution to scientific and other achievements.’’  Other  notable  achievements  encompass  pioneering the making of iron, valuable works  of art, carved stones into historic ornaments  and  statues,  the  conversion of oil-bearing  plants for both medical and dietary purposes.  Early contributions also include developing cereal and transformation of a wild plant into cotton which led to the art of weaving. Additionally, people of color are among  the earliest  farmers who  produced wheat,  groundnuts,  yams and watermelon.  Other accomplishments within the past 150  years, include performing the first open heart  surgery, produced scientific evidence of cell  life and metabolism, pioneered in blood plasma preservation,  invented  the  inhalers used  by rescue workers at disaster sites, created  communication devices that allowed conversations between fast moving trains, invented machines that allowed for the mass production of  shoes and  improved  the efficiency of  lubricating systems used in large industry today.  This impressive list is not exhaustive of all  the global contributions of people of color.  However, it illustrates the vital contributions to  America and the world. As we think about democracy in this country, people of color have  been at the fore in pursuing ‘‘A more perfect  Union.’’ Consider Rosa Parks who refused to  give up her seat on a bus, which sparked the  Montgomery County Bus Boycott and the Civil  Rights Movement. Also,  it would be hard  to  think about American Democracy without Martin Luther King Jr. and his  leadership and  dream to bring the ideals of democracy into  reality for all Americans.  In his 1970 essay,  ‘‘What America Would  Be Like Without Blacks,’’ Ralph Ellison argued  that ‘‘Whatever else the true American is, he  is somehow Black.’’  [CaribEditorial, Feb. 7, 2006]  IMPORTANTROLEOFPEOPLEOFAFRICAN  DESCENT  The name Dr. G. Carter Woodson means  little to most Americans, West Indians or Africans. Indeed, only a minority of people in  Virginia, Woodson’s birthplace, ever heard of  the former coal miner who graduated high  school at the age of 21 years, but  later  earned a Ph.D. from Harvard University in  1912, around the time when thousands of  West Indians, especially Jamaicans and Barbadians, were  immigrating to Panama to  help build the world-famous canal.  But, as more and more people, Black and  White in the United States, the Caribbean,  Canada, Africa, and elsewhere observe Black  History Month, they are learning that it was  Dr. Woodson who initiated ‘‘Negro History  Week’’ in 1926 in the U.S. to promote ‘‘a better understanding of the contributions’’ of  Blacks to human civilization.  Woodson’s fledgling effort 80 years ago has  since become an international phenomenon,  one in which millions of people, Black and  White, observe Black History Month. Caribbean and African nations may have joined  the observances a bit late, but we believe in  the old adage better late than never.

175,76,2006-02-28,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, when you  reflect back to that many votes, that  many thousands of votes, very quickly  you could go back and look at various  issues PATLEAHY has been  involved  with. I think that is important to do. It  reflects a great legacy for our country,  what he has stood for, the values and  principles.  I wish to add to the accolades what I  have found, and that is, as I have gone  around the world over the last several  years in humanitarian causes, part of  which is done as official CODELs as a  Senator but even more than that as a  volunteer  physician,  going  on  the  ground into communities, into villages  all over the world, what is interesting  to me—people don’t care about the majority leader, they don’t care about the  typical names you hear from the Senate floor, but PATLEAHY’s name comes  up again and again from the underserved, from the people who have suffered the tragedy of landmine injuries.  It is remarkable. It is something we  don’t talk about on the floor a lot. But  to have real people thousands of miles  away coming forward with his name reflects the great legacy he leaves, that  he continues to leave, and I am sure  there will be another 12,000 votes as we  come forward.  I do want to express both to him and  to Marcelle, a nurse, who greatly influenced his life and for whom he has so  much love that he expresses so directly  to so many of us in casual conversations or the sorts of occasions that people don’t see—that is the PATLEAHY I  want to recognize today—congratulations.

177,76,2006-02-28,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, it  has been my distinct pleasure to be either the ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee or the  chairman with my good  friend PAT  LEAHY. Part of what Senate etiquette  tells us is we are supposed to refer to  each other as ‘‘my good friend,’’ but in  the case of PATLEAHY, it is not only  Senate etiquette but it is the case that  he has become a good friend.  Twelve thousand votes is quite an accomplishment, but beyond that, I have  enjoyed  the  spirit of bipartisanship  with which we have pursued each Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for  each of the last 14 years, whether he  was chairman or I was chairman. We  tried to develop the expenditures of the  Federal Government  in a way  that  made sense for America and also had  an impact on the rest of the world.  The majority leader has mentioned  the landmine crusade Senator LEAHY  has led for a long time. He is indeed  known around the world for that. It  has been an extraordinary crusade. He  deserves enormous credit for leading it  and is widely known around the world  for that.  I thank him  for his extraordinary  service over the last 14 years in which  I have been associated with him. It has  been a pleasure to work with him every  year. I, too, wish him 12,000 more votes.  I yield the floor.  ",2006
178,76,2006-02-28,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Vermont.  ,2006
179,76,2006-02-28,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, it is hard  to put in words what I feel as I listen  to my good friends, HARRYREID and  ARLENSPECTER, BILLFRISTand MITCH  MCCONNELL, saying such nice things.  They are friends. We work together.  HARRY—I should say, following Senate  protocol,  the  distinguished  Senator  from Nevada, Senator REID—was kind  enough to first and foremost mention  my wife Marcelle. There is no conceivable way I could have accomplished  any of this without Marcelle. She has  been my guiding light for well over 40  years. Nothing I have done could I have  accomplished without her.  Senator SPECTERwas kind enough to  hold up the picture of the latest member of our clan, Patrick Lucas Jackson.  I think of that because I came here  holding the actual pictures in my mind  of my three children, Kevin, Alicia, and  Mark, and their spouses, Carolyn, Lawrence, and Kristine, but also the pictures of four wonderful grandchildren:  Roan, Francesca, Sophia, and now Patrick. To have them mentioned I realize  there is another generation, and I hope  their children will be proud of what  their father does, but I especially hope  the grandchildren, who will be the hope  of our future, will feel the same way.  BILLFRIST, the distinguished Republican  leader,  and  Senator  MCCONNELL, the distinguished deputy  Republican leader, were kind to speak  of the landmine issue and things we  worked out  together—both of  them  being Senators who have done so much  in that same area.  Sometimes we deal in issues people  look at as just local issues or issues  that affect only a few. What we have  done in this case—Senator MCCONNELL,  who was so good to move to name the  war victims fund the Leahy War Victims Fund—is something I will never  forget; Senator FRIST, who voluntarily  goes into parts of Africa and elsewhere  to use his medical skills. We talk of  these kinds of things—the  landmine  issue; things Senator MCCONNELLand I  have done to bring medicine to parts of  the world that never see it; efforts to  eradicate polio, childhood diseases, to  bring to people the ability to actually  feed themselves. The people we help  don’t contribute to campaigns. When  Senator MCCONNELLand I pass a bill  here on the floor, they don’t know who  we are. They do not know whether it is  Republicans or Democrats. None of  them know that. We will never meet  most of them, but we like to think—I  like to think—we have made their lives  better.  MITCH  We speak of what we bring to this  body. We all come from different backgrounds. It  is not  just our political  background; it is how we are raised, it  is what our faith is. And if we believe  in the best of what we learned when we  were being raised or the best of what it  is we believe in, then we have to help  these people who will never be helped  otherwise, and I have been proud to do  that. I like to think what was instilled  in me by my parents, Howard and Alba  Leahy or in Marcelle by her parents,  Phil and Cecile Pomerleau, brought  about some of this, or just the upbringing  in  the  special  little State  of  Vermont.  I will close with this. I didn’t expect  to say anything, but I was kind of overwhelmed by what was said by a dear  friend  like ARLEN SPECTER, whom  I  have known since we were both prosecutors, a job that some days we think  was the best job we ever had. It made  me reflect on what a great honor it is  for all of us, Republicans and Democrats and Independents, to serve in this  body. Only 100 of us get a chance to do  it at any one time, and someday we  will be replaced by others. What an  honor it is to be here and what a responsibility it is.  I have seen the Senate go through  many changes, but I have also seen the  personal relationships the press doesn’t  see, the public doesn’t see, the personal  relationships we have built across the  aisle and with each other. When we do,  the country is better, the Senate is  better, and people’s lives are better.  I must say that I was awed and humbled the first day I walked on the floor  as a 34-year-old to be sworn in, where  30 minutes before I was the State’s attorney sitting in a county in Vermont  and 30 minutes later was then the junior Senator from Vermont. I still feel  that same awe every time I walk on  this floor. The day I stop feeling that  awe, I will stop walking here.  With that, I have said more than  Vermonters usually do.  I yield  the  floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2006

Finally,  we will be able to move this reauthorization forward with a series of votes  this week. It has been lingering out  there  too  long, especially  since  the  House passed it over 2 months ago.  The Senate needs to be taken seriously in the domestic fight against terrorism. Two months  is too  long to  wait. I fear our delays have sent the  wrong message to our antiterrorism investigators and prosecutors as well as  those who would do us harm.

184,83,2006-02-28,Mr. SMITH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to speak about the need for hate  crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator KENNEDY and  I  introduce hate  crimes legislation that would add new  categories to current hate crimes law,  sending a signal that violence of any  kind  is unacceptable  in our society.  Likewise, each Congress I have come to  the floor to highlight a separate hate  crime that has occurred in our country.  On June 15, 2005, Dwan Prince was  savagely beaten by three men as Prince  stood outside of his apartment building  in New York, NY. The apparent motivation for the attack was Prince’s sexual orientation. According to police,  the three attackers shouted anti-gay  slurs throughout the attack on Prince.  I believe that the Government’s first  duty is to defend its citizens, to defend  them against the harms that are born  out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act  is a symbol  that can become substance. I believe  that by passing this  legislation and  changing current law, we can change  hearts and minds as well.  f  LETTER ON THIRD ARMORED  CAVALRY REGIMENT  ",2006
185,83,2006-02-28,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to share with my colleagues  a letter written by the mayor of Tall-  at Afar, Ninewa, Iraq, concerning the  3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment of the  U.S. Army. This unit of brave soldiers  is completing its second deployment to  Iraq. As the unit prepares to come  home, they have recently received this  letter from the mayor of that city:  In the Name of God the Compassionate and  Merciful To the Courageous Men and Women  of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, who  have changed the city of Tall-at Afar from a  ghost town, in which terrorists spread death  and destruction, to a secure city flourishing  with life.  To the lion-hearts who liberated our city  from the grasp of terrorists who were beheading men, women and children  in the  streets  for many months. To  those who  spread smiles on the faces of our children,  and gave us restored hope, through their personal sacrifice and brave fighting, and gave  new life to the city after hopelessness darkened our days, and stole our confidence in  our ability to reestablish our city.  Our city was the main base of operations  for Abu Mousab Al Zarqawi. The city was  completely held hostage in the hands of his  henchmen. Our schools, governmental services, businesses and offices were closed.  Our streets were silent, and no one dared  to walk them. Our people were barricaded in  their homes out of fear; death awaited them  around every corner. Terrorists occupied and  controlled the only hospital  in the city.  Their savagery reached such a  level that  they stuffed the corpses of children with explosives and tossed them into the streets in  order to kill grieving parents attempting to  retrieve the bodies of their young.  This was the situation of our city until  God prepared and delivered unto them the  courageous soldiers of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, who liberated this city, ridding it of Zarqawi’s followers after harsh  fighting, killing many terrorists, and forcing  the remaining butchers to flee the city like  rats to the surrounding areas, where the  bravery of other 3rd ACR soldiers in Sinjar,  Rabiah, Zumar and Avgani finally destroyed  them.  I have met many soldiers of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment; they are not only  courageous men and women, but avenging  angels sent by The God Himself to fight the  evil of terrorism.  The  leaders  of  this  Regiment;  COL  McMaster, COL Armstrong, LTC Hickey,  LTC Gibson, and LTC Reilly embody courage, strength, vision and wisdom. Officers  and soldiers alike bristle with the confidence  and character of knights in a bygone era.  The mission  they have accomplished, by  means of a unique military operation, stands  among the finest military feats to date in  Operation Iraqi Freedom, and truly deserves  to be studied in military science. This military operation was clean, with little collateral damage, despite  the  ferocity of  the  enemy. With the skill and precision of surgeons they dealt with the terrorist cancers  in  the city without causing unnecessary  damage.  God bless this brave Regiment; God bless  the families who dedicated these brave men  and women. From the bottom of our hearts  we thank the families. They have given us  something we will never forget. To the families of those who have given their holy blood  for our land, we all bow to you in reverence  and to the souls of your loved ones. Their  sacrifice was not in vain. They are not dead,  but alive, and their souls hovering around us  every second of every minute. They will  never be forgotten for giving their precious  lives. They have sacrificed that which  is  most valuable. We see them in the smile of  every child, and in every flower growing in  this land. Let America, their families, and  the world be proud of their sacrifice for humanity and life.  Finally, no matter how much I write or  speak about this brave Regiment, I haven’t  the words to describe the courage of its officers and soldiers. I pray to God to grant happiness and health to these legendary heroes  and their brave families.  NAJIMABDULLAHABIDAL-JIBOURI  Mayor of Tall-at Afar, Ninewa, Iraq.  This mayor’s gratitude towards the  soldiers of the 3rd Armored Calvary  Regiment speaks volumes of the sacrifice and bravery that all of our soldiers are displaying in Iraq. Our service  men and women are making a difference in Iraq by spreading democracy  and fighting the terrorists. These soldiers ought to be proud of their efforts—we certainly are, and so are the  Iraqis.  f  CLEAN WATER AUTHORITY  RESTORATION ACT  ",2006
186,83,2006-02-28,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President,  for  the last 33 years, the American people  have relied upon the Clean Water Act  to protect and restore the health of the  Nation’s waters. The primary goal of  the act to make rivers, streams, wetlands, lakes, and coastal waters safe  for fishing, swimming and other recreation, suitable for our drinking water  supply, and available for wildlife and  fish habitat—has become accepted by  the public not only as a worthy endeavor but also as a fundamental expectation of government providing for its  citizens. It is our responsibility to provide adequate protection to ensure that  our freshwater resources are able to enhance human health, contribute to the  economy, and help the environment.  Despite being one of our Nation’s  bedrock environmental laws, the Clean  Water Act faces new and unprecedented  challenges.  The Supreme Court recently heard  two Clean Water Act cases, the outcome of which will have significant implications for Federal efforts to protect  the Nation’s waters from pollution and  destruction. Fortunately, an unprecedented array of local, State, regional,  and national officials, professional organizations, and public interest groups  from across the country and the political spectrum have joined in the defense of the Clean Water Act. The unparalleled collection of interested parties includes the attorneys general of  33 States plus the District of Columbia;  four former Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency—Russell Train, Douglas Costle, William  Reilly, and Carol Browner; nine current and former members of the U.S.  Senate and U.S. House of Representatives who were directly involved in the  passage of the 1972 Act and its reaffirmation  in  1977;  the Association  of  State Wetlands Managers, the Association of State Floodplain Managers, the  Association of State and  Interstate  Water Pollution Control Administrators, and the International Association  of Fish and Wildlife Agencies; numerous hunting, fishing, wildlife and outdoor recreation organizations and businesses, including Ducks Unlimited, the  National Wildlife Federation, Trout  Unlimited, the American Sportsfishing  Association, Bass Pro Shops, the Orvis  Company, and  the Wildlife Management Institute, among others; and a  number of local, regional, and national  environmental groups. All of these interests  filed briefs expressing strong  support of the Clean Water Act’s core  safeguard: the requirement to obtain a  permit before discharging pollutants  into waters of the United States.  With  such  strong  support  for  the  Clean Water Act, which is grounded in  the language, history, and purpose of  the law itself, I hope that the Supreme  Court will follow its own precedent and  reaffirm  Federal  protections  for  streams, headwaters, tributaries, and  wetlands that have long been covered  by the Act.  Whatever the outcome of these critical cases, Congress must reaffirm the  historical scope of the Clean Water  Act. The best way to do this is through  passage of the Clean Water Authority  Restoration Act, S. 912. This bill simply confirms that the Act has always  covered all of these waters, consistent  with Congress’s clear intent, by codifying the regulatory definition of ‘‘waters of the United States’’ that has  been in use since 1973.

187,104,2006-02-28,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, today I  am submitting a concurrent resolution  establishing an  independent Congressional Inspector General to investigate  ethics violations in the Senate and the  House of Representatives.  Every Member of Congress must be  held to the highest ethical standards.  Those who violate  the public  trust  must be held accountable for their actions. Unfortunately, our current system does not measure up. Too often,  Congress has been unable or unwilling  to  effectively  investigate  or  appropriately punish  those Members who  commit serious ethical violations.  In December 2005, an NBC/Wall Street  Journal poll showed that just five percent of Americans believe all Members  of Congress  are  honest  and  trustworthy. The same poll showed that  most Americans  believe  that most  Members of Congress are dishonest and  are not trustworthy.  This is simply unacceptable. We have  to restore the faith of the American  people in the Congress. Thus, I am submitting a resolution to establish an  independent  Congressional  Inspector  General with the authority to investigate and punish violations of the ethics rules by Members of Congress, Congressional staff and the Capitol Police.  The Congressional Inspector General  will make a preliminary investigation  into all ethical misconduct allegations  to determine whether there is probable  cause that a full investigation is warranted. The Congressional  Inspector  General has expansive authority to investigate ethics allegations, including  improper  conduct  that may  reflect  upon the Senate or House of Representatives, significant violations of  law,  violations of the Senate Code of Official Conduct or the ethics rules of the  House of Representatives, and violations of Congressional rules or regulations relating to the conduct of Members in their performance of official duties.  If a  full  investigation  is warranted, a public report will be developed for the House and Senate Ethics  Committees or the Justice Department  describing any credible evidence of improper conduct or a violation of law.  To insure that this new ethics process is not abused, anyone who knowingly files a false ethics complaint will  be subject to a $10,000 fine or the costs  incurred by the investigation, whichever is greater. They could also be subject to up to one year in prison and will  be banned from making further complaints.  The Congressional Inspector General  will not be able to accept new charges  filed 30 days prior to a primary election  for which the Member of Congress in  question is a candidate or 60 days prior  to a general election  for which the  Member of Congress is a candidate.  The Congressional Inspector General  will also provide periodic reports to  Congress on how to update our ethics  laws and how to improve the investigation and enforcement of current ethics  laws. Finally, it would release an annual report of violations by Members of  Congress and Congressional staff.  I also strongly support other legislation to develop independent oversight  of the Congressional ethics process including the Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission Act of 2006 that  was introduced by Senator OBAMAearlier this year. I look forward to working with my colleagues to develop ethics reform legislation in the upcoming  months.  We need to change the way business  is done in Washington. We must convince the American people that our  government responds to the needs of  our people, not to special  interests.  This resolution will help restore the  faith of the American people in their  government. Together we can work to  change our government for the better.  f  NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS  COMMITTEEONINDIANAFFAIRS  ",2006

193,111,2006-02-28,Mr. EMANUEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  the exceptional  craftsmanship of  R.S. Owens & Company, the manufacturers of  the Academy Awards for over 20 years. I am  proud to have ‘‘Oscar’’ as a constituent, and I  hope my colleagues will join me in watching  the work of R.S. Owens & Company arrive in  Hollywood from Chicago.  With  the Oscars soon approaching,  television sets around the Nation will be tuned in  to watch movie stars as they stroll down the  red carpet, hoping  to  receive  the Academy  Award, an internationally recognized symbol of  excellence in film. While the main attraction of  the night may be the directors, actors, and film  makers receiving the awards, the 131⁄2 inch,  gold-plated statuettes hold an important place  in the night’s event and traditions.  R.S. Owens  is  the Chicago-based award-  manufacturing company  responsible  for producing  the world-renowned Academy Award.  Since they were recommended for the manufacturing of the award in 1983, the academy  has  selected R.S. Owens  to produce  the  statuettes year after year,  in  recognition of  their fine work in the field of award design and  production and of their exemplary dedication  to the craft.  R.S. Owens has been  involved  in awards  manufacturing since 1938. It began, as many  great things do, as a small idea from an enterprising man, Owen Siegel. His idea has grown  from a small dream into one of the most successful award manufacturing companies in the  United States.  While so many companies in the manufacturing field have turned to automated machine  work, R.S. Owens has remained grounded primarily  in handwork. The company employs  workers who are masters  in  their craft, and  take great pride  in  their work—pride  that  is  evident in the quality of award they continually  produce  in a  field where  the product  is so  closely scrutinized as  to allow no errors  in  workmanship.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I  recognize the excellent craftsmanship of R.S.  Owens & Company in their production of the  Academy Award. The company’s  fine work  and dedication make it an excellent example  of flourishing businesses throughout Chicago.  It is an honor to know that such an innovative  and  responsible company calls Chicago  its  home. On behalf of the Fifth District of Illinois  and  the city of Chicago,  I congratulate R.S.  Owens on their continued excellence in their  field, and look forward to the showcase of this  year’s batch of awards at the ceremony this  March.  f  TRIBUTE TO PASTOR CATO  BROOKS, JR.  HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2006  ",2006
194,111,2006-02-28,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great pride and sincerity that I wish to honor  Pastor Cato Brooks, Jr. of  the Tree of Life  Missionary Baptist Church  In Gary,  Indiana,  and his wife, Mrs. Bettye Brooks. The members of  the Tree of Life Missionary Baptist  Church will be honoring Pastor and Mrs.  Brooks  throughout  the month of March  for  their many years of service to the congregation.  Pastor Brooks was born in Forrest City, Arkansas, where he attended Steward Elementary School and Lincoln High School. During  high school, Pastor Brooks proved himself to  be a stellar athlete, having been honored as  an All-State football and basketball player. For  his efforts in athletics, in 1999, Pastor Brooks  was honored by his hometown and inducted  into the Hall of Fame. Following high school,  Pastor Brooks attended Southern University in  Baton Rouge, LA and then answered the call  to serve a tour of duty in the U.S. Army. Upon  completion of his tour, he returned to school at  the University of Kansas, seeking a degree in  Sociology. Pastor Brooks has also attended  the Mid-America Baptist Seminary, Ouachita  Baptist University, and Indiana Christian University, where he earned a bachelor’s and a  master’s Degree, as well as a doctorate of divinity. Pastor Brooks also received his Ph.D.  in Communiology from California Western University of Palo Alto, CA.  Pastor Brooks began his ministry on January 26, 1969. He served as Pastor of  the  Greater Friendship Missionary Baptist Church  in Little Rock, Arkansas from 1970 to 1977 before relocating to serve as Pastor of the First  Baptist Church in East Chicago, Indiana; 18  months  later, Pastor Brooks organized  the  Tree of Life Missionary Baptist Church, serving a congregation of only 26 members, where  he continues to serve today as Senior Pastor.  He is also the Chairman of the Tree of Life  Community  Development  Corporation  and  Care Center and a  former Chaplain  for  the  Gary Police Department.  Pastor Brooks has also achieved many accolades and accomplishments throughout his  lifetime. To name a few, Pastor Brooks has  been recognized by the NAACP, A Walk Without Fear, for his efforts in the civil rights movement, and on May 23, 2004, he was elected  Moderator of the Northern Indiana Missionary  Baptist District Association. In addition, Pastor  Brooks published his  first book, Studies  in  Ephesians, in September 2003.  The youngest of 9 children, Bettye Brooks  was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, where she  attended the Little Rock public schools. She  later attended Arkansas Baptist College, Henderson State Teachers’ College, Philander  Smith College, and Indiana University Northwest. Mrs. Brooks has a degree in Business  Administration and  is a certified Personnel  Management Specialist, Housing Counselor,  and Housing Development Professional.  Mrs. Brooks has held several positions  in  government and community service  throughout her professional career. She has been a  Grants Management Supervisor for the City of  Little Rock, a State Planner for the State of  Arkansas, serving under  then-Governor Bill  Clinton, a personnel director for Pulaski County, AR, a Regional Program Specialist for the  National Urban League, and an Employment  Specialist  for  the Lake County Job Training  Corporation.  After coming to Tree of Life in 1991, Mrs.  Brooks became the Executive Director of the  Tree of Life Community Development Corporation. In this capacity, she and her housing  development  partner  have  successfully  rehabbed over 600 housing units in Gary, East  Chicago, and South Bend, Indiana. In addition,  Mrs. Brooks serves as  the administrator  for  Treasure’s Child Development Center and was  recognized  for her efforts  in 1993 with  the  Athena Award by the Gary Chamber of Commerce. Mrs. Brooks also serves in many other  capacities within the church and the community. She is a Sunday School teacher, a trustee, Executive Director of Development and  Training, Finance Coordinator, and First Cook  at the church. She is also a past president of  the Ernie Pyle PTA and the Inter-Denomination Association of Minister Wives’ and Widows’ of Gary and Vicinity.  Most  impressively,  the Brooks’s never  let  their accomplishments get in the way of their  family. Pastor and Mrs. Brooks are also the  proud parents of 6 children and 13 grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and  my other distinguished colleagues join me in  congratulating Pastor and Mrs. Cato Brooks,  Jr. as they are honored for their service and  ministry throughout the month of March. Their  years of service have touched and improved  the lives of all whom they have served. Their  unselfish and lifelong dedication is worthy of  the highest commendation, and I am proud to  represent them in Congress.  f  HONORING DR. LILLIAN VITANZA  NEY FOR BEING AWARDED THE  PAUL HARRIS FELLOW AWARD  HON. BRIAN HIGGINS  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2006  ",2006
195,111,2006-02-28,Mr. HIGGINS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Dr. Lillian Vitanza Ney of Jamestown,  NY, for being awarded the Paul Harris Fellow  award, the Rotary Club’s highest honor.  The Paul Harris Fellow recognition is given  to show appreciation for contributions to the  Rotary Club’s charitable and education program. A contribution of $1,000 was given on  behalf of Dr. Ney.

She serves as wellness director, cardiology director, medical education director and  vice president of medical affairs at WCA Hospital and is a member of several professional  organizations.  Dr. Ney is also highly involved in the community she served as a city councilwoman including being  the  first  female  city  council  president. She was one of the founding members of the Jamestown Area Youth Orchestra  and is a board member for several community  organizations.  Dr. Ney has shown great dedication and excellence in her work and community. That is  why, Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor her today.

196,118,2006-02-28,Ms. HARMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  last week  I  stood at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long  Beach, the largest container port complex in  the nation, with my good friend Senator SUSAN  the chair of  the Senate Committee  on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  We both have  championed  the  fight  to  strengthen security at our ports. As of  last  week, neither of us had been briefed on the  review conducted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS,  into the sale of stevedoring and terminal operations of many major eastern seaboard and  Gulf Coast ports to a state-owned firm from  Dubai. This sale would not only affect the six  major US port terminal facility leases that have  been reported, but additional operations in 15  other locations, including ports shipping military materiel.  Last week, we stated our concerns about  the announced sale and our plan to issue a  Joint Resolution of Disapproval.  Today,  I am  introducing  in  the House  the  Joint Resolution which Senator COLLINS introduced yesterday, S.J. Res. 32. This resolution  would do  three  things. First,  it officially disapproves of CFIUS’s initial review of the Dubai  Ports World deal. Second, it requires CFIUS  to rescind its previous decision and conduct a  formal 45-day investigation. Third, it requires  that CFIUS brief the Congress before allowing  the deal to proceed, if in fact that is the decision after a full, complete and proper evaluation of the national security risks posed by this  arrangement.  Since Senator COLLINSand I announced our  intentions  last week,  there has been some  progress. Dubai Ports World has agreed to a  secondary  review,  the  Administration  has  agreed to a 45-day assessment of the sale,  and, beginning this week, some committees of  Congress will now be briefed.  But the bad news is that this process got as  far as it did, and that it took deep bipartisan  concern  to have Congress brought  into  the  loop. When our country considers  these  important deals, Congress should be on the front  lines, not the back bench.  And as we heard yesterday from a Senate  briefing, the U.S. Coast Guard cited their concerns over  the deal at  the  time. The U.S.  Coast Guard plays a critical role in ensuring  the security of our ports, and their reservations  make me question why  this deal was approved as quickly as it was.  This issue has also served to highlight the  fact  that  our Nation’s  ports  remain  inadequately protected.  As a member of both the House Intelligence  and Homeland Security Committees,  I have  consistently worked  to  improve our national  security, and believe much  remains  to be  done. When we focus 9 out of 10 transportation security dollars on aviation security, we  fall into the trap of fighting the last war instead  of the next one. Fighting terror requires that  we  look  forward, and what keeps me up at  night is the possibility of a radiological bomb  or human  terrorist entering our ports  in an  uninspected container.  When it comes to port security, we should  have solid answers, not lingering questions. In  this Era of Terror, there remains a constant  threat to our homeland. We don’t have the luxury of waiting to harden the obvious vulnerable targets.  I have visited the Los Angeles/Long Beach  port complex many times. I have authored and  co-authored bipartisan port security legislation.  Representative DANLUNGRENand I will introduce a comprehensive bill soon to ensure a  coordinated approach to maritime and cargo  security through the authorization of key security programs and initiatives, as well as a dedicated funding grant program to shore up security gaps that exist at our Nation’s ports. Senators COLLINS, LIEBERMAN, and COLEMANhave  introduced similar  legislation  in  the Senate,  and both bills will be the subject of hearings  in this Congress.  This resolution on CFIUS is prudent; so are  our efforts to legislate enhanced port security.  I urge its support.  f  TRIBUTE TO MINNESOTA  STATE  REPRESENTATIVES NEVA WALKER AND KEITH ELLISON  HON. MARTIN OLAV SABO  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2006  ",2006
197,118,2006-02-28,Mr. SABO.," Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to  celebrate Black History Month by recognizing  distinguished Minnesota  legislators who are  civil and human  rights  leaders: Minnesota  State Representatives Neva Walker and Keith  Ellison.  Representative Neva Walker was born and  raised in Minneapolis, and attended the University of Minnesota. A ‘‘community baby,’’ as  referred  to by elders, Walker comes  from a  family deeply involved in the community, especially the Sabathani Community Center which  is a pillar of the community and a source of  assistance to many. Walker grew up with this  sort of activism, and she now embodies it herself.  Representative Walker was encouraged  to  run for office when lobbying Minneapolis City  Hall on housing issues. When she learned that  no African American woman had served in the  Minnesota Legislature, this firmed her resolve  to run for office. In 2000, Neva Walker was  elected  to  the Minnesota House where she  continues  to address disparities of all kinds:  health, poverty,  racial profiling and out-of-  home placement.  Representative Walker has a son, and is the  youngest of seven children herself. In addition  to her service in the State House, Rep. Walker  contributes with many  community  involvements such as the Blaisdell YMCA board, the  ‘‘GirlsBEST’’  initiative  through  the Women’s  Foundation of Minnesota, and the Minneapolis  Youth Coordinating Board. She  takes every  opportunity reach out to people, speaking to  groups that range from children in daycare to  college students.  ‘‘I consider myself a seed planter,’’ Walker  said about her efforts.  ‘‘I’m always  trying  to  educate and bring useful information to people, especially youth, people of color and  women.’’  Representative Walker believes it critical to  get civil rights  issues back  into  the public’s  eye. Disparities in poverty and the justice system are too great to stand idly by, she said.  Representative Keith Ellison was born  in  Detroit, attended Wayne State University and  then came to Minneapolis to attend the University of Minnesota Law School. As a student, he first got involved in the anti-Apartheid  movement. He and his wife have four children.  ‘‘I was raised in a household where I was  encouraged to question things,’’ he said. His  grandfather had worked for voting rights, and  Ellison grew up listening to stories of those experiences. Ellison’s activism continued, and  evolved into his profession as a trial lawyer,  working on death penalty cases in Louisiana,  as well as indigent defense work. Today at the  Ellison Law Office, his legal work consists of  criminal cases, civil rights cases and  family  law.  Ellison was  first elected  to  the Minnesota  House of Representatives  in 2002. He said  that instead of cajoling and persuading government leaders to pursue worthy programs,  he was determined to work for change from  inside the system.  ‘‘When you’re a community activist, you propose change,’’ he said. ‘‘But when you’re in  office as a public official,  you make  the  change.’’ As one of two black Representatives  in Minnesota, Ellison believes he helps to improve the level of engagement for people of  color in the state. ‘‘I think all people need to  have equal access to their government.’’  He continues to work on issues of environmental justice, equal justice in the courts, voting rights, and public safety. He is also a cofounder of  the Environmental Justice Advocates of Minnesota, which deals with environmental hazards posed by pollution.  Ellison believes  that  the civil rights movement forever changed America, but that Americans must still work  for economic, health,  educational and social equality for all people.  Mr. Speaker, Neva Walker and Keith Ellison  are dedicated public servants who are making  unique  contributions  to  their  communities,  working for all people, but especially African  Americans and other people of color, women,  and the poor. They are committed to bringing  the promise of America to all its people, and  work day in and day out to achieve that ideal.  I commend them for their activism and their  service in the Minnesota Legislature, and their  dedication  to making  their communities, our  State, and our world a better place.  f  IN MEMORIAM THEODORE R.  ‘‘TED’’ SWEM  HON.

199,125,2006-02-28,Mr. MICHAUD.," Mr. Speaker, early  in November  I had  the pleasure of attending  the  opening of the Lincolnville Central School in  Lincolnville, ME. In Lincolnville, as in so many  small towns across this country, the local elementary school  is an  important part of  the  community.  As Lincolnville opens a modern new school  building, it honors its past by displaying an old  bell, formerly housed in the old school building. The old bell will be a  reminder of  the  many teachers, staff, and students who were  a part of the old school. It will challenge the  Lincolnville community to continue its long tradition of quality education.  The school bell is named for Rufus Knight,  a former teacher at the old Lincolnville school.  The bell was honored in a poem by his great-  grandson, John A. Knight, which was read at  the school opening:  This is the bell that called to us to drink at  springs of learning.  This is the voice of the silver tongue that  satisfied our yearning.  The tocsin sound of wisdom this ancient bell  awakened and horizons of us  rural  folks no longer were forsaken.  The light of education Our knowledge is expanding. This ancient bell awoke in us  deep thoughts of understanding.  And, for many generations we did study and  excel with the beauteous sounding of  this old bell.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE WORK OF  HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATE JOHN  P. SALZBERG, PH.D.  HON.

200,125,2006-02-28,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Salzberg, Ph.D.,  as he retires  from his  lifelong work of promoting human rights around the world.  Thousands of torture survivors and human  rights advocates around the world are forever  indebted to the tireless work of Mr. Salzberg  throughout his 30–year career in the field of  human  rights. John Salzberg completed his  doctoral dissertation in human rights in 1973  from New York University. Following his education, John spent several years working for  former Congressman Don Fraser, D–MN, as  staff on  the House Subcommittee on  International Organizations. In this capacity, John  Salzberg aided in the groundbreaking work on  human  rights undertaken by Congressman  Fraser, which led to the creation of a Bureau  of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs in  the State Department in 1976. John traveled  with Congressman Fraser on what was  the  first official human rights investigation mission  to South Korea and  Indonesia  in  the  late  1970s.  In addition, while working  for Congressman Fraser, John assisted in the drafting  of the legislation which mandated the annual  human rights report now issued by the State  Department each year.  After working for Congressman Fraser, John  went on  to work at  that same Bureau of  Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs for 4  years,  to ensure  it  fulfilled  the mission  intended by Congressman Fraser’s legislation.  Most recently, John used his knowledge of  the  legislative and policy process, and his  dedication to justice and equality, as an advocate for the Center for Victims of Torture. John  began working  for  the Center  for Victims of  Torture in 1992, first as a volunteer and then  as its representative on Capitol Hill. As an advocate for victims of torture, John was a major  force behind the drafting, promotion and eventual passage of the Torture Victims Relief Act  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:29 Mar 01, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A28FE8.069 E28FEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o y r r e h c y         ",2006
201,132,2006-02-28,Mr. LEWIS of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in vehement opposition to the proposed elimination  of National Youth Sports Program  (NYSP) funding, contained in the President’s  Budget Request, for the second year in a row.  I am concerned that some of my colleagues  may not understand the severity of the situation that NYSP is facing. If Congress does not  provide full FY07 funding for NYSP, the program will be forced to close its doors. This will  result in 75,000 of our nation’s most vulnerable youth, being left behind next summer.  NYSP uses sports instruction and competition, as a vehicle to enhance self-esteem and  respect, among boys and girls  from  low-income households. Established in 1969, with a  $3 million funding commitment from the White  House, NYSP has provided over 2 million participants with  instruction  in career and educational opportunities, and exposure  to  the  college environment for nearly four decades.  Because I have witnessed, firsthand, the difference that the NYSP program has made in  the  lives of under served youth  in my Congressional District  I  cannot,  in good  conscience, sit idly by as this essential program is  dismantled.  In my  Congressional  District,  Morehouse College has done an outstanding  job of running the NYSP program for nearly  four decades, serving over 10,000 children  throughout Atlanta. The Morehouse College  NYSP program  is unique, because  it has  taken great pains to maintain a balance between athletics and academics. Similar  to  NYSP programs throughout the nation, Morehouse College offers  instruction  focusing on  sports. However, it also includes additional instruction  in areas  such as: nutrition, drug  awareness and prevention, creative writing,  and leadership development.  The NYSP program has a tremendous impact on the youth that it serves in my Congressional District. By placing NYSP participants  in academic settings, where  they  receive hundreds of hours of exposure  to  the  benefits of higher education, the participants  begin to believe that they, too, can succeed in  college and beyond. Furthermore,  the mentoring  relationships established between  the  teaching/coaching staff, college student volunteers, and NYSP participants, have resulted in  hundreds of former NYSP participants returning to work in the program at Morehouse College as student volunteers.  Mr. Speaker, NYSP  is not asking  for a  handout from Congress. In fact, in 2005 NYSP  secured  two-thirds of  its operating expenses  from other public and private sources, such as  the National Collegiate Athletic Association  (NCAA) and  the 202 selected  institutions of  higher education with which  it partners. The  Administration knows that NYSP works. Congress knows that NYSP works. Institutions of  higher learning in 47 states and the District of  Columbia know that NYSP works. Most imporf  TRIBUTE TO MARCIA S. SMITH  HON. SHERWOOD BOEHLERT  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2006  ",2006
202,132,2006-02-28,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, today I would  like  to draw our colleagues’ attention  to  the  pending retirement of Marcia S. Smith  from  the Congressional Research Service after over  thirty years of service to Congress. Marcia is  one of  the preeminent and most highly  respected policy analysts in her field, and while  she will remain an active figure in space and  telecommunications  policy  at  the National  Academy of Sciences, her intelligence, expertise, objectivity and balance will be greatly  missed on both sides of Capitol Hill.  Marcia Smith began her career at the Congressional Research Service  in 1975, after  graduating  from Syracuse University with a  degree  in political science. She quickly became an accomplished and adept analyst in  space and aerospace policy,  rising  to Specialist in Aerospace and Telecommunications  Policy, first in the Science Policy Research Division, and  then  in  the Resources, Science  and Industry Division, of CRS. In her service  to Congress, she has provided background  and analytic reports, memoranda, committee  prints and expert  testimony  to Members of  Congress and committees of  the U.S. Congress on matters concerning U.S. and foreign  military and civilian space activities, and on  telecommunications  issues  (and  formerly on  nuclear energy).  Marcia has been a mentor and advisor to  over a dozen CRS analysts and researchers  during her time in that organization. She was  Section Head for Space and Defense Technologies from 1987–1991, and Section Head  for Energy, Aerospace  and Transportation  Technologies from 1984–1985.  To give my colleagues an idea of how prolific and proficient Marcia Smith has been during service to Congress, she has authored or  coauthored over 160 reports and articles on  space,  nuclear  energy,  and  telecommunications policies and issues. She has testified  as an expert witness before House and Senate Committees nearly 20 times, a significant  number of  those  times  in  front of  the committee I chair, the Committee on Science.  I would like to point out 2 instances in which  Marcia has served both Congress and her  country in an exemplary manner. In both instances, these were circumstances marked by  tragedy—when the Space Shuttle Challenger  was lost at launch on January 28, 1986, and  again when the Space Shuttle Columbia was  lost during re-entry on February 1, 2003. Within hours of  the Challenger disaster, Marcia  was briefing congressional staff and talking to  Members of Congress about  the  technical,  policy, and human costs of this accident. She  was widely interviewed and quoted by the national and  international news media. And  in  the painful months  following  the accident,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:29 Mar 01, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A28FE8.095 E28FEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o y r r e h c y         ",2006
203,139,2006-02-28,Mr. GORDON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  thank Libby Johnson for her tremendous service  to Tennessee’s Sixth Congressional District while working in my Washington, D.C., office.  After serving as my executive assistant, the  Sumner County native is moving on to greener  pastures. Her last day is today, and although  my staff and I are sad to see Libby go, we are  glad she has taken a job that will further her  career and is worthy of her incredible abilities.  Libby’s conscientious work ethic and incomparable enthusiasm have served her well  in  the  fast-paced world  of Congress. Those  same abilities also have gained her  the respect of her colleagues. Now, she will share  her tremendous abilities and experience with a  new employer, who should be ecstatic over  having found such a fine person.  As busy as she has been, Libby always  took time to say a kind word to those around  her. It seems she has never met a stranger  during her time on the Hill. With her vivacious  personality and contagious smile, she certainly  has made a lasting impression on virtually everyone she has met.  Libby, you have endeared yourself  to me  and my staff. We will miss you and wish you  well in your future endeavors.  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO KEKAHA  FEDERAL CREDIT UNION  HON. ED CASE  OFHAWAII  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2006  ",2006
204,139,2006-02-28,Mr. CASE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the Kekaha Federal  Credit Union on winning the 2005 Dora Maxwell Social Responsibility Award.  Chartered in 1938 to serve the employees  of  the Kekaha Sugar Company,  the Kekaha  Federal Credit Union has expanded its membership to include all businesses and individuals  throughout  the  island of Kauai.  It also  acts as a Community Development Credit  Union, catering to the financial needs of low-  income individuals. The Kekaha Federal Credit  Union has over 1,500 members.  In January 2004, the Kekaha Federal Credit  Union initiated a partnership with the Kekaha  Elementary School to support and encourage  student achievement and  raise school-wide  standardized rest scores. Kekaha Elementary  School serves a community of 3,700  residents, dominated by  low-income, native Hawaiian and immigrant families. At the school,  11 percent of the student body speak English  as a second language, 49 percent are Native  Hawaiian (a historically disadvantaged group),  and 62 percent qualify  for  free or  reduced  lunches due to low-income status. Many students live in single-parent homes or face situations that are not conducive to learning.  As part of their partnership, the credit union  and  the  school  established  the Maximum  Communication Journal program, also known  as the MAX Program. The MAX Program has  become  the cornerstone  to  learning at  the  school, as students must keep a  journal of  class activities and homework, including notes  and notices  from  teachers and  the school.  Each student is then required to have his/her  parents or guardians read and sign the MAX  notebook each week. This ensures communication between the students, parents, teachers, and the school.  With  the  incentive of prizes  that  include  boogie boards, movie passes and bicycles,  students are instructed to write in their MAX  journals and have their parents read and sign  it every week. In order to earn a chance to win  a prize, students have to write in their MAX  journals and have their parents read and sign  it every week. Prizes were also given to the  class with  the highest percentage of completed and signed journals. Prizes are given at  the school’s monthly assembly. Often, parents  and guardians attend these assemblies.  By all measures, this program has been a  great success. The program’s goal of 80 percent student participation has been achieved  for the past four semesters and, more importantly,  Kekaha  Elementary  School  has  achieved passing levels in the State of Hawaii  standardized tests each of the last two times  the tests have been administered.  Students and parents alike are excited and  have a sense of accomplishment. Billy Smith,  the principal of Kekaha Elementary School,  explained:  ‘‘The celebration assemblies are  fun and crazy. Parents are invited to attend  and the kids are happy and excited.’’ Students  have become more responsible as they see  tangible results for their MAX participation.  Dora Maxwell is recognized as one of the  original pioneers of  the credit union movement. This award was created to promote social responsibility among credit unions by formally recognizing and celebrating their social  achievements. The Dora Maxwell Social Responsibility Recognition Award is awarded to  credit unions, based on seven asset-size categories, and  to  specific  chapters  for outstanding social  responsibility projects  in  the  community in which they are located.  I want to recognize and commend Kekaha  Federal Credit Union not only for sponsoring  this important and innovative program, but for  receiving this national recognition by the Credit Union National Association. This award  is  just another example of  the great work and  strong personal  relationships  that our credit  unions provide  their respective communities,  and  represents a perfect union of  the very  best of credit unions and community service.

205,1,2006-03-08,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is my  honor and privilege to introduce our  guest  chaplain,  Reverend  Richard  ‘‘Ricky’’ Atkins, the head pastor of  Courtney  Baptist  Church  in  Yadkinville, North Carolina,  in  the  Fifth District.  Reverend Atkins is a vital part of the  religious  community  in  northwest  North Carolina’s rural mountain region. Prior to leading 350 members at  Courtney Baptist Church, he served at  Zephyr Baptist  Church  in Dobson,  North Carolina, from 1995 to 2000, and  at Oak Grove Baptist Church in Madison, North Carolina, from 2000 to 2005.  He graduated from Fruitland Bible Institute in 2000 with an associate’s degree in biblical ministries.  Reverend Atkins was born and raised  in Mt. Airy, North Carolina. He is the  son of Tommy and Rebecca Atkins,  whose  support was  instrumental  in  helping him get to Washington today.  Reverend Atkins and his wife, Debbie,  currently reside  in Yadkinville with  their two children Alison and Lee.  Reverend Atkins’ life has been one of  service  to God and his community.  Throughout the years he has brightened and enriched the lives of many  others. It is an honor to have him serve  as our guest chaplain. I hope that his  words of prayer will remain with all of  us as we do the people’s work today.  f  ON THE CHILDREN’S SAFETY AND  VIOLENT  CRIME  REDUCTION  ACT, H.R. 4472  (Mr. KELLER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2006
206,1,2006-03-08,Mr. KELLER.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today in strong support of the Children’s Safety and Violent Crime Reduction Act, because it is a commonsense  way to protect our schoolchildren from  pedophiles. Isn’t it a matter of common  sense to allow a local school district in  Orlando, Florida, to do criminal background checks on coaches, janitors and  teachers who work with our children to  make  sure  they  are not  convicted  pedophiles from Georgia or some other  State?  Isn’t  it common  sense  to protect  young schoolchildren in the first place  by keeping these pedophiles locked up  with lengthy prison sentences?  Isn’t it common sense that coddling  repeated sex offenders with self-esteem  courses  and  rehabilitation  doesn’t  work, and that locking them up works?  It is high time that we crack down on  molesters by implementing these commonsense  reforms.  I  urge my  colleagues  to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on H.R.  4472  today.  f  PORT SECURITY AND REPUBLICAN  FAILURES TO SECURE OUR NATION  (Mr. CARDOZA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

207,1,2006-03-08,Mr.  CARDOZA.," Madam  Speaker,  when the Bush administration learned  that the American people wanted to  allow the United Arab Emirates to operate U.S. ports, they were outraged.  That outrage should be extended to  this administration’s pathetic record  on securing our ports and our coastlines.  Since September 11th, according to  the U.S. Coast Guard, the Republican  Congress has shortchanged America’s  seaports by more than $4 billion in security improvements. It is because of  this serious lack of funding that only 6  percent of the cargo coming into our  ports is ever checked. Port security is  so bad that in December, the 9/11 Commission  gave  this  administration  a  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

214,8,2006-03-08,Mr. ROSS.," Although former President Clinton lived  in  several  other homes  during his  childhood, this home in Hope, Arkansas, is the one most closely identified  with his youth and early development.  Former President Clinton’s upbringing in Hope played a prominent role in  his political campaigns. He summed up  his sense of the community with the  well-known phrase, ‘‘I still believe in a  place called Hope.’’  Madam Speaker,  inclusion of  this  site within the National Park System  is  consistent with numerous Presidential sites previously authorized, including  that of  the Ronald Reagan  Boyhood Home in 2002.  Madam Speaker, I would also note  that H.R. 4192 is supported by the entire Arkansas congressional delegation,  and also has the support of State and  local officials. We support H.R. 4192 and  urge the adoption of this legislation by  the House today.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2006

Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition  to this bill. I do not object to the bill  on its merits, and when I first knew  that the bill was coming up, it was not  a problem.  However, upon reading various articles, I do have concerns, and my constituents have concerns. I have heard  from several of them. Let me make it  clear that my opposition is not partisan, it is not a Republican, it is not a  Democratic issue.  Regardless of your personal view of  him, Mr. Clinton served this country as  President for 8 years and should have  his birthplace properly designated as a  place  in American history. However,  before this Congress moves to honor  the former President, I think that he  has some explaining to do.  You know, most Americans are very  outraged over the Dubai Ports deal  with the United States, and I am even  more outraged when I hear that he  may have consulted with the Crown  Sheik of Dubai on this deal. So let me  get this straight. Not only a U.S. citizen, but also a former President gives  advice.  POINTOFORDER  ",2006

219,8,2006-03-08,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," The gentlewoman is correct that debate should  be confined  to  the pending  subject.  However, the Chair currently perceives  a nexus between the substance of the  bill and the gentlewoman’s remarks.  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, how do Republicans or Democrats explain this to our  constituents? How do we possibly show  that we are serious about protecting  the United States from terrorist nations when we are proceeding to possibly honor the birthplace of someone  who may have brokered this deal?  Madam Speaker,  I cannot  support  this bill at this time until Mr. Clinton  explains his role in the Dubai Ports  deal. Reportedly Mr. Clinton has accepted nearly $1 million from the UAE  for strategic advice. He is not a registered foreign agent. He also tried to  get his former press secretary signed as  a spokesman for the UAE. When they  did not hire him, Mr. Clinton turned  around and spoke against the port deal,  and yet there was a reported million  dollars here.  Madam Speaker, I think we need to  take some time and review this very,  very carefully.  POINTOFORDER.  ",2006

225,8,2006-03-08,Mr. ROSS.," Madam Speaker, as the  sponsor of this  legislation, I rise  in  support of H.R. 4192, a bill to designate  the William Jefferson Clinton birthplace home located in my hometown of  Hope, Arkansas, as a national historic  site and unit of the National Park System.  First, I would like to thank Chairman POMBO, Chairman SAXTON and  Ranking Member RAHALLand Ranking  Member CHRISTENSEN for their support  and their assistance in moving this bill  from the Resources Committee in a bipartisan manner to the  floor of the  United States House of Representatives.  Madam Speaker, what we have just  witnessed from the gentlewoman from  Florida is an example of the kind of  partisan bickering that the people back  home are sick and tired of. This is not  a Democrat or Republican issue. This  is about America, and it is about our  Nation’s history.  Madam Speaker, what  the gentlewoman from Florida obviously does not  get is the fact that this is about history. We have only had 42 Presidents in  the history of this Nation; and I believe  all of them, Democrat and Republican  alike, if their birthplace home is still  standing, it should be an historic site  because it is a part of history.

I also want to thank Chairman  SENSENBRENNER for his solid effort in  making sure that this House is once  again on record in working to protect  our children and our families.  I am pleased that an amendment that  I offered to the original legislation last  year, which was adopted with a unanimous vote, is included once again in today’s final bill.  My amendment requires the GAO to  study the feasibility of implementing  on a nationwide basis a tough annual  driver’s  license  registration  requirement that my home State of Nevada  has imposed on sex offenders.  Just last month, it was reported that  there are almost 2,000 convicted sex offenders living in Nevada that are out of  compliance with these registration requirements. Something must be done  to fix this problem. It is nationwide.  This bill takes a huge step forward in  protecting the most vulnerable among  us, our children.  b1145  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this critical bill and send a message to all that preying on our children  will not be tolerated anytime, anywhere.  ",2006
228,36,2006-03-08,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I now  yield to the distinguished gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE) 23⁄4minutes.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I thank  the  distinguished  gentleman,  and  I  can’t thank you enough for the work  you have done in a bipartisan effort to  preserve a very valuable piece of legislation, the hate crimes legislation that  this Congress has gone on record any  number of times to be able to support.  Mr. Speaker, I wish as I listened to  my good friends on the other side of  the aisle that we were squarely focusing on protecting our children. In fact,  I support the National Sex Offender  Registry that is in this particular legislation, the sex crimes, that provides,  if you will, a list of the sex offenders  all over America. I think that is an important element. I obviously support  the idea of preventing sexual assault  on juveniles in prison and certainly the  vetting of foster care parents that are  taking care of our children. But I think  the  basic  fault  of  this  legislation  doesn’t lie in the House, it lies in the  majority leader of the Senate refusing  to put this particular legislation on the  floor of the Senate and going into conference.  My difficulty, of course, is the various kitchen sink elements that are included. I may want to see the Federal  judges that are included and protected  in this legislation protected, but have  we vetted  the question of allowing  judges to carry guns in the courtroom?  Should we not provide more resources  to the U.S. marshals who are there to  protect both the families of the judges  and the people who are in the courtroom? Are we particularly studied on  the issue dealing with juvenile crime?  Time after  time after  time  it has  shown that the trying of a juvenile as  an adult does not work. I believe more  studied consideration of these legislative  initiatives would  represent  the  work of a studied body who cares about  getting  legislation  that  is going  to  withstand judicial scrutiny.  This legislation, which I am still in  dilemma as to its merits for voting on,  raises severe questions. Why didn’t the  gun legislation get in that eliminates  sex offenders from being able to recklessly carry guns? We want to protect  our children. We want to pay tribute to  the legacy and the work of John Walsh  and the legacy of his lost child and the  many lost children that we don’t want  to see happen again. But  for God’s  sake, can we do legislation that embraces all of us who believe in the necessity  of  protecting  our  children?  There is a frustration of wanting to do  what is right and yet having legislation that doesn’t allow the vetting, the  amending and the responsible consideration.  This bill that seeks to protect children has very many merits. I would  just beg my colleagues to understand  that this process must be one that can  last and survive.  I can assure you that this will still  have trouble  in the Senate, because  you have left off the hate crimes legislation which was a bipartisan effort. I  ask my colleagues for consideration of  this bill in the context in which I have  discussed this legislation.  ",2006

Last week I had the opportunity to stand with people whose children have been taken from them, children who were  victims  of  horrific  crimes. So that their children not die  in vain, these wonderful people, including Linda Walker, who is the mother of  Drew Sjodin who lost her life in North  Dakota, have focused their energies on  trying to help keep other children safe  and to keep them safe by giving families the information about dangerous,  high-risk sexual predators who are living in their communities.  It is time we move this bill forward  so that it might be conferenced with  action the Senate would take on similar legislation. I am not happy with the  Senate’s handling of this proposal, not  one bit, but I am not going to let some  quest for perfection delay our efforts to  make our  families safer any  longer.  These families want action now, and  this Congress should give it to them.  Vote for this bill.  ",2006

No longer will  they be able to hide in our communities and seek out our children as  their prey.  The national registration in this bill  will help protect our children so that  when child molesters leave our penitentiaries and move about from State  to State, we will be able to keep up  with them.  As many Members of the House, I am  the  parent  of  four  children,  three  grandchildren and two on the way. I  have met with parents who have lost  their children to child predators who  left penitentiaries and preyed against  them. Mark Lunsford and Marc Klaas  both came to Washington to talk about  the  loss of  their children  to  these  criminals.  We need to have a response, and the  first duty of government, which is to  protect the public and to protect our  children, is the greatest cause that we  can be involved in. As a member of the  Victims Rights Caucus that was started with KATHERINE and JIM  COSTA, we support these efforts and applaud this act.  ",2006

237,50,2006-03-08,Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support of this bill  and particularly to congratulate the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  GERLACH), who is its primary sponsor  and who has carefully shepherded  it  forward at a very sensitive time  in  U.S.-Ukrainian relations.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this  bill especially when taken in tandem  with economic and political reforms  made by the Ukraine, as well as the efforts of our negotiators to put together  a solid WTO market access agreement.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of passage of this bill on the heels of  the other body passing a similar measure under unanimous consent. Just 2  days ago an agreement on market access was signed between the U.S. and  the Ukraine. This agreement is an excellent start to fostering a continued  growth between our two countries.  We recognize that some frictions remain, but this agreement, along with  the Ukraine’s accession to the WTO,  will better enable us to resolve these  frictions expeditiously, and in a mutually beneficial manner. Granting permanent normal trade relations, along  with steps already taken to make government loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank available to U.S. exporters to the Ukraine, will significantly increase U.S. investment in the  Ukraine.  Granting  the Ukraine  permanent  normal trade relations status will not  only  complement  the  difficult  economic reforms that have been made. It  will also  support and  reinforce  the  democratic  reforms  being made  by  President Yushchenko.  It is vital that Congress move forward and reaffirm our commitment to  the Ukraine, to its reforms, both democratic and economic. Mr. Speaker, I  urge passage of this bill.  ",2006

240,50,2006-03-08,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I join my  colleagues in support of this for the  reasons that they have all given. What  happens in Ukraine is important for its  people, obviously. It is important for  its neighbors. It is important for us in  the United States, and I think really in  the world. Let me  just state why I  think it is important in terms of its  economic and democratic development.  Clearly it has met the requirement in  Jackson-Vanik  as  to  immigration.  Jackson-Vanik was an amendment to a  trade bill, and so it is relevant for us to  look at the economic and democratic  developments  within  Ukraine.  The  Jackson-Vanik instrument is our opportunity in the Congress to deal with  the accession of countries to the World  Trade Organization, and that is why we  have withheld PNTR in several cases  until we were satisfied in terms of the  WTO accession agreements and could  participate in the development of those  agreements.  The U.S. has now negotiated with  Ukraine a WTO accession agreement,  and it is satisfactory. I think it will be  mutually beneficial. I think also it will  spark further reforms within Ukraine,  both economic and also, I think, help  the evolution of democracy within that  country. So this is an important moment in terms of the economic role of  Ukraine and the evolution of its democratic processes.  Let me say another word, if I might  quickly,  about  the  importance. We  have been working on this legislation  for a number of years. In proposals  that we have placed on the record, that  we have  introduced, we have talked  about various aspects of our relationship with Ukraine, and various doings  within Ukraine, both human  rights,  how it treats its workers and many  other aspects.  All of these aspects are not covered  in this legislation, but I do think this  legislation points out the importance  of Ukraine to continue its democratic  evolution. There are challenges ahead.  I have had the chance to talk with constituents, with the  large Ukrainian-  American community in the 12th District.  And I want to close with this. To  echo what Mr. LANTOS has said, and  others, what happens in Ukraine is important, as I said, not only for its people, but really for the whole world. The  Orange Revolution  really  resounded  throughout the globe.

Mr. Speaker, as has been discussed  here  today  certainly,  the  Jackson-  Vanik restrictions were made as an  amendment to a 1974 trade bill actually  to punish the Soviet bloc nations for  their despicable human rights record.  Following the collapse of the Soviet  Union,  Jackson-Vanik  restrictions  were placed on all of the former Soviet  Republics,  including the Ukraine. In  recent years, the world has watched as  the Ukraine has embraced democracy  and freedom through their Orange Revolution.  The Ukraine has been a great ally in  the war on terror. The Ukraine has  clearly taken appropriate steps to open  their society and economy and becoming an important member of the community of free nations. The Ukraine  should be free of the onerous restrictions, because they have met each of  the tests laid out by the law.

245,78,2006-03-08,Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise  in opposition to the  Democratic motion  to  instruct conferees. You know, I voted for a bill that  will strengthen pension plan funding. I  want pension plans to have the right  amount of money to pay benefits as  promised. It is crazy to require overfunding, but it is also crazy to allow  more time for them to recover. I mean,  if, in fact, those plans were well managed, as the gentleman just said, we  wouldn’t be in this fix we are in.  Too many companies make bigger  promises than they can pay for, and  they dump their underfunded pension  plans on the PBGC. We are facing an  ocean of red ink at the PBGC, and we  need to be sure that companies put  their money where their mouth is.  I think that since we marked up our  bill, we have heard from many sources  that some of the bill needs to be modified in conference. We need to go to  conference without  restrictions. We  need to be able to negotiate with our  colleagues from the Senate to get a  great bill signed into law. This Democrat motion would weaken the House  bill, and  I can’t support pretending  that plans aren’t healthy.  We need to be very clear with the  pension plan sponsors and employees  who are expecting benefits out of these  plans there needs to be adequate funding to make good on the private promises. Unfortunately,  fewer Americans  every year are lucky enough to have  one of these defined benefit plans. We  are backed up by the Federal Government.  We need to strike the right balance  in pension funding rules so that the  correct amount of money is there to  pay benefits. The House bill is pretty  close to the right answer. We should  oppose the Democrat motion to undermine the good work of this House that  was passed by a vote of 294 Members,  and let us work with the Senate for a  great bill.  ",2006

248,78,2006-03-08,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. TIERNEY) for 3  minutes.  ",2006
249,78,2006-03-08,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, this is  yet another example of the government  under this majority in the House, and  the Senate and the Republican White  House of failing to live up to its role to  protect the American people from circumstances beyond their control.  We have troops over in Afghanistan  and Iraq that are not protected in the  manner in which they should be protected. We have people down in Louisiana and Mississippi and other areas  affected by the storm, Katrina, who are  not getting the attention and the protection that they deserve and their situation warrants.  Here we have a failure of the government to step forward and to protect  the American working family, who has  paid into pension funds, expected them  to be protected, expected something to  be there after 20, 25 or 30 years of work  and contributing to these funds, only  to find out that management people,  CEOs, walk into bankruptcy court and  somehow wipe out the workers’ interest while they end up with golden parachutes and protection for benefits once  they come out of bankruptcy.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. MILLERand I and  others have been fighting this issue for  the working people for some time. In  committee we offered an amendment  that would allow the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation,  that corporation, an entity which would protect  workers. We wanted that to intervene  earlier to be able to work with companies to make sure that they first exhausted all of their possible remedies  by permitting them to terminate plans  and go into bankruptcy only after they  had done that.  We presented a substitute  for this  bill, but we weren’t allowed to have a  vote on it. Our colleagues in the majority, I think, speculate or were afraid  that Members of  their party would  have joined in this motion, because it  would have improved the bill. Companies should first have to exhaust every  possible  remedy  to create  financing  and be creative in order to save and restore pensions before they are allowed  to go into bankruptcy court and wipe  them out while enhancing the position  of the CEOs and other management  people.  b1345  We are fighting here, Mr. Speaker, to  protect  the  retirement  security  of  American families. We are protecting  benefits of airline employees and seeking to encourage retirement savings.  Both the Congressional Budget Office  and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation say that H.R. 2830 would actually add to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s deficit. They say  the bill would actually chase companies out of the defined benefit system,  that traditional benefit system that  people have come to rely on, and it  would leave workers with fewer choices  actually than the plans for retirement  that they have now.  This motion  to  instruct conferees  would at least address some of those  issues, Mr. Speaker. It would protect  the pension benefits of airline employees by asking to support the Senate  provision, to keep American and Continental and Delta and Northwest from  terminating their plans at the expense  of  employees and  taxpayers, giving  them additional time to actually work  on their plans.  It would support the Senate provision to provide  full Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation retirement protections for pilots that are forced to retire at age 60. As Mr. MILLERsays, they  are getting a double-whammy now, and  they should not have to face that situation.  The motion would also make permanent the Saver Tax Credit, urging conferees to accept the House provision for  the credit that provides a matching  contribution for low- and moderate-income workers, and make sure that that  provision, which is used now by 5.3 million people both in 2002 and 2003, to  continue on, and support the House  provisions to split the tax refund for  automatic forwarding to a retirement  account and to provide for the protection of traditional plans, dropping new  funding provisions in either the House  or Senate bill that would encourage  companies to terminate or freeze.  Mr. Speaker, all those things are necessary to improve this bill, and I ask  for support for the Miller amendment.  ",2006

This motion takes some parts of our  tax agenda and says they are important, like the savers credit, the direct  payments of tax refunds to IRAs, but  ignores so many other parts of our bill  that are critical, like the permanency  of  the pension and  IRA provisions,  many of which were in the Portman-  Cardin legislation which this House has  debated  long  before,  I noticed Mr.  CARDINwas here earlier, and long-term  care  insurance, which  is a  critical  issue, and FSA rollover, which many of  my friends on the other side are vitally  interested in as well.

253,85,2006-03-08,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the  gentleman  from Georgia  (Mr. GINGREY)  and  appreciate  you  yielding me time, and I rise in support  of H.R. 4167, the National Uniformity  for Food Act and in support of this  rule.  Ensuring food safety is a partnership  between the Federal Government and  the States. However, while it is a partnership, a national food supply requires  a national approach  to  food  safety.  H.R. 4167 would allow for an orderly review of existing State regulations that  may differ  from Federal regulations.  The legislation carefully balances the  need for uniformity, while respecting  the important role State and local governments have in making sure our food  supply is safe.  Under the current system States may  impose contradictory regulations, imposing  unnecessary  complexity  and  cost on food processors, manufacturers  and wholesalers throughout the United  States. That translates into costs that  are passed on to the consumers, not to  mention the tax burden, Mr. Speaker,  for administration of different and duplicative regulations.  Science-based food warnings should  be applied uniformly.  If a warning  about  food  is  supported by  science,  then consumers in all 50 States should  have the benefit of this warning. Inconsistent warning requirements confuse  consumers, which does not  lead  to  sound decisionmaking.  This  bill will  result  in  allowing  States and the Federal Government to  work together in establishing science-  based food safety policies. Consumers  are not protected well under a system  where States  adopt  different  regulatory requirements on the same food  products. Consumers deserve a commonsense  approach,  a  clear,  single  standard.  To speak to an example, a 2002 study  conducted by Swedish scientists that  provided evidence to support that a  substance with  cancer-causing properties called acrylamide was formed in  some snacks and other foods when fired  or baked at very high temperatures,  but since 2002 some additional studies  have confirmed these results, causing  some States to consider warning label  requirements for foods containing acrylamide.  Specifically, in August of 2005, the  California attorney general filed a lawsuit against several different manufacturers of potato chips and French fries  and has requested a court order requiring companies to  label certain  food  products containing acrylamide with a  warning of the agent and its cancer-  causing properties.  The Food and Drug Administration  does not currently require States to  place  a warning  label  on  products  which  contain acrylamide after  the  baking process. Therefore, enactment  of H.R. 4167 would, for all practical purposes, prohibit the State of California  from requiring food manufacturers to  place an acrylamide warning on their  products unless the State filed a petition for exemption with the Secretary  of Health and Human Services, or unless the FDA decided to set California  as a requirement for the country as a  whole.  This  is  a well-balanced  bill, Mr.  Speaker. It brings good, sound science  to the table, and it provides for a regulation and a means for the States to  make their case with the FDA so that  the entire United States of America  can benefit  from the wisdom of the  Californians.  ",2006
254,85,2006-03-08,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to yield 31⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. WAXMAN).  ",2006
255,85,2006-03-08,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, after  hearing the last speaker on the other  side  of  the  aisle  on  this  rule, he  claimed this is a bill that is well-balanced, thought through; it would lead  to  national  regulations  based  on  science. That all sounds well and good,  but it is just not true.  b1445  This bill has never had a day of hearings. We don’t know all that is in this  bill. You wonder why  the Congress  would do its work in this way: a bill  that has never had a hearing in the  committee, even though  it has been  around for three Congresses. Those who  favor it have never made a record of  why they think it is necessary. The opponents from most of the States, if you  look at this map there are a few States  we have not heard from, but almost all  the States attorneys general and Governors and agriculture commissioners  and the food and drug people in those  States oppose it, but they have never  been able to come in and tell the Congress why. So the other side has never  had a chance, nor has our side of the  aisle, to hear testimony and to make a  record, and yet we are told this bill is  well balanced.  Let me point out that the proponents  of this legislation have said a lot of different things. It has been almost like a  covert legislative campaign. They have  sent people in from the districts, from  some trade association or other, and  said to Members, this is a national uniformity bill. It is just going to clarify  the law. It is going to require all the  States to have the same rules so that  we will not have the burden on interstate commerce.  Well, they have never shown there is  any burden on  interstate commerce.  But  it  sounded  so good  that many  Members cosponsored the bill without  fully understanding that this bill  is  going to overturn 200 State laws that  protect our food supply. Why are we  doing that? What is broken about our  system of federalism that allows the  States to pass laws to protect their  own people? And now the proponents of  this bill want States to come, hat in  hand, to the Food and Drug Administration, a wonderful bureaucracy at  the Federal level, not even elected people, and that agency will decide whether the State laws can continue in effect? They will have higher power than  the States legislatures and Governors?  That is not a well-balanced or well-  thought-through piece of  legislation.  And now we are on the floor arguing a  rule that would so severely limit the  time for debate on all the amendments  and this bill that you have to ask yourself: Why is this going on? What are  they hiding from us? Why don’t they  want this bill to be held up to public  scrutiny through hearings? And why  won’t they let this bill be fully debated  on the floor of the House of Representatives by  the people’s elected Representatives? Why do they have to rush  this through?  Mr. Speaker, this is the early part of  March. We have barely been in session.  We have been meeting 21⁄2days out of  each week as we go from recess in January to recess in February to recess in  March. Let us have another day. Congress can do its work. We don’t have to  rush out to another CODEL or another  junket. We ought to do our job and let  people come in and tell us what they  think of bills and not get steamrolled  into something that no one has fully  examined and that would repeal State  laws. So let us vote against this legislation.  ",2006

263,99,2006-03-08,Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota.," Mr.  Chairman, I rise today in support of  the gentleman’s amendment. Several  of my colleagues have raised valid concerns about the importance of warning  labels for specific serious health issues,  including  birth  defects  and  cancer-  causing agents. I believe the language  in  the gentleman’s amendment  improves the underlying bill by allowing  for an expedited review process by the  FDA.  If a State identifies a health issue fitting the critical categories  listed  in  the amendment, then a warning is necessary,  and  this  amendment  allows  FDA to enact the warning nationally,  not just in the State that proposes it,  granting greater consumer protection  everywhere, and if the FDA approves a  State’s request for a warning, it is important for consumers not just in that  State, but all States, to have that information.  As I said during the general debate  on this bill, we have the world’s safest  food supply, the lowest cost to its consumers, and every American benefits  from a system of national food safety  standards. This amendment and  the  underlying bill builds on the record of  success that we have had in this system by extending the same approach to  food safety standards that is used by  USDA and other agencies.  I strongly urge my colleagues to join  me  in  supporting  this  important  amendment and to oppose any amendments that would gut this bill.  ",2006

In addition, I support the Cardoza  amendment to this bill, which would  accelerate the consideration of warnings for food labels in certain cases,  such as when dealing with the potential for birth defects and cancer-causing agents.  This amendment protects the most  vulnerable in our society, particularly  children. Expedited consideration by  the FDA for these types of labels is the  right thing to do to protect the health  of our families.

268,99,2006-03-08,Mr. ROGERS of Michigan.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise to support the Cardoza  amendment and thank the Member for  working with us. This does improve the  bill and makes very, very clear that we  are going to have an expedited review  for cancer-causing agents or reproductive effects or birth defects.  The reason we have an expedited review here, as we have said many times,  those State laws in effect remain in effect until they get an affirmative ruling from the FDA, so those would remain  in place until they get a scientific ruling from the FDA, and then  we would have the benefit of that information shared with all 50 States, all 50  States’ children, all 50 States’ men and  women who call America home.  I thank the gentleman for working  with us and in supporting this fine bill.  ",2006
269,99,2006-03-08,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I want to point out that there are  two petitions. One is a petition by a  State to allow its law to stay in effect.  The second provision in the bill allows  a State to petition to say the Federal  Government should have one uniform  law that ought to be the same as that  State’s.  Well, this provision that is before us  will have an expedited review of the  States’ petitions. Pesticide  spraying  after  harvest  disclosure,  that  is  a  Maine  law  requiring  disclosure;  postharvest spraying of produce with  pesticides. I have no idea what the reason was for that law, but Maine people  thought it worthwhile because of pesticide spraying and, I guess, the residue  of pesticides.  I  suppose  that  should  have an expedited review.  We have disclosure of fish, whether it  is farm-raised or wild. There is a law in  Alaska dealing with salmon; in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi dealing  with catfish. Certain farm-raised fish  may contain elevated levels of PCBs  and other contaminants. Well, those  State laws may not be allowed to continue. The FDA is going to have to decide that.  There are 50 State milk safety laws.  They are different  laws. Each State  adopted the law it thinks is best. Each  State would have to petition whether  it can continue with the law that it  adopted.  Now, an expedited review sounds like  a good idea because we would like them  to review them carefully so the States  can have a decision, but you know an  expedited review can also mean that  expedite it, and the FDA will say ‘‘no’’  as quickly as possible in order to expedite that review.  I would rather have them have a  thorough opportunity  to  review  the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:32 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H08MR6.REC H08MR6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2006

271,106,2006-03-08,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the amendment of the gentlewoman from Florida. As cochair of  the Children’s Environmental Health  Caucus, I have tried to raise awareness  here  in  the Congress  about  public  health risks for children caused by environmental contaminants.  It is well known that certain fish and  shellfish contain high levels of mercury that can harm babies, unborn babies,  the nervous  systems of young  children, and these levels of mercury in  different States vary. That is the key  point. Many States have enacted shellfish safety laws. Many of the environmental and consumer protection laws  that we now take for granted around  the country first appeared in individual  States.  So there are variations of contaminants  in  individual States. There  is  also a different willingness in different  States to protect their consumers. This  bill, I am afraid, without amendments  like Ms. WASSERMANSCHULTZ’s will result  in the  lowest common denominator applying, for, in other words, the  weakest standards.  b1745  Currently some States have shellfish  safety laws, but not all. Some States  have fish consumption/methylmercury  advisories, but not all New Jersey does.  By preempting these State  laws, we  hurt the consumer and the health of  children.  ",2006
272,106,2006-03-08,Mr. DEAL of Georgia.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, we have already seen  evidence of action at the Federal level  in March of 2004. In fact, the FDA and  the EPA issued a joint guidance to consumers about the issue of mercury in  fish. And that guidance was designed to  try to strike a careful balance that  would demonstrate both the benefits of  eating fish as well as the potential dangers associated with exposure to mercury.  If the bill passes as presented, and  this is an issue with regard to warning  on fish, there are several things that  would be authorized: A State, if it feels  it has a peculiar situation, could petition for a waiver so that they could  apply a nonFederal standard to their  warning. There is absolutely nothing in  the bill that would prohibit a State  from issuing warnings. It just cannot  require that the manufacturer or distributor be the one that be required to  place warnings on the product. But the  State could issue whatever warnings it  saw fit to do so.  I think, as Mr. ROGERS related earlier, the Tufts Health and Nutrition  Letter, indicating that you have to be  careful that you do not do more harm  than good sometimes by issuing warnings that are blanket in nature, I think  that clearly indicates we could go in  the wrong direction.  We believe the bill strikes a careful  balance. It does allow States that have  peculiar situations to ask that they be  allowed to put additional warnings on  products in their State if they think  that is justified. We believe that the  current Federal policy on mercury,  however, in fish is an appropriate and  adequate one, and I would urge the defeat of this amendment.  ",2006
273,106,2006-03-08,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield for the purposes of  making a unanimous consent request  to  the  gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr.  KUCINICH).  (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
274,106,2006-03-08,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the Wasserman Schultz  amendment.  It is widely known that mercury is a highly  toxic chemical, especially  to our children.  It  causes entire clusters of cells  in  the developing brain to die. It causes loss of fine motor  skills, learning disabilities, and seizures. Later  in  life,  it can  translate  into kidney diseases,  and immune system disorders.  One of  the primary ways children are exposed to mercury is through consumption of  fish—either they eat it or their mother does. At  the same time, eating fish that is not contaminated has been shown to be important to childrens’ health.  The best way to deal with the problem is to  stop mercury  from getting  into our environment in the first place. Of course, this administration and Congress have repeatedly refused  to take substantive action to require coal burning power plants to take responsibility for their  toxic mercury releases that end up in our fish.  But because mercury pollution  is allowed  to  persist, people are forced to take on the coal  plants’ responsibility by trying to avoid fish that  are contaminated.  In recognition of this, some States are considering laws that will label fish that are high  in mercury. It is a critical consumer empowerment tool that is the last line of defense for  those who do not want their children or themselves to be exposed to this toxic substance.  But the Food Uniformity Act would undercut  States’ ability to even provide that basic level  of protection  through  labeling. So not only  does the bill undercut States rights, but it also  undercuts personal responsibility.  The Wasserman Shultz amendment makes  an exemption for labeling laws that apply to  mercury and  fish and shellfish.  It  is a commonsense amendment. Please join me in supporting it.  ",2006
275,106,2006-03-08,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself the balance of  my time.  One of the things I want to point out  that I think is important to note is  that the petition process that the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DEAL) pointed out, that whole process has been  scored by the GPO. They have estimated that it would cost $400,000 per  petition.  Should we be creating the obstacles  to information that women need? I will  give you an example. I have a 21⁄2-year-  old baby girl, and I  first  found out  about the dangers of methylmercury  when I was pregnant with her and my  OB–GYN told me, do not consume tuna.  Do not consume any oily-based fish.  Think about someone who does not  have the access to prenatal care that I  had. We have absolutely got to make  sure that depending on the levels of  mercury poisoning in a particular body  of water in different States, that each  State be able to decide the type and  method of information that they provide, and that we not leave only the  ability to notify women and parents of  young children about the dangers of  methylmercury on a Web site put out  by the FDA. That would be inappropriate.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. PRICEof  Georgia).

277,113,2006-03-08,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman  from Maryland  (Mr.  VAN  HOLLEN) is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2006
278,113,2006-03-08,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker, just  35 days ago I attended the President’s  State of the Union address with other  Members of Congress right here in this  Chamber. And that night I was very  much pleased to hear the President  talk about the importance of maintaining America’s competitive edge in an  era of increasing global economic competition.  This is an urgent issue facing our Nation and one on which I think there  should be strong bipartisan support. In  fact, many of us in this House have  been working for some time on what  we call an ‘‘innovation agenda’’ to ensure that America stays number one  when  it comes to  international economic competition.  Indeed,  last  fall  House Democrats unveiled a blueprint  for an innovation agenda.  So I was pleased with many of my  colleagues to hear the President join  this effort in the State of the Union address. He said this was going to be a  priority. In fact, that night he told the  American people, ‘‘Tonight I announce  an American competitiveness  initiative to encourage innovation throughout our economy and give our Nation’s  children a firm grounding in math and  science.’’  He went on to talk about the importance of the No Child Left Behind Initiative and proposed an  increase  in  training  teachers  for  math  and  sciences.  Now, a few days after the State of the  Union address, the President sent his  budget to Congress. Now, we all know  that the budget is what is a true reflection of the President’s real priorities.  That  is where  the American people  have a chance to see whether the President’s words at the State of the Union  address are backed up by action. That  is his opportunity to show that he  means what he says. And I must confess, I was very disappointed with the  President’s budget and I believe the  American people will be disappointed,  too, because his rhetoric that night in  the State of the Union in this Chamber  was not matched by the reality of his  budget.  He may correctly want  to  invest  more in math and science, but if you  look closely at his budget, $115 million  of the $380 million investment is simply taken from other important education initiatives. It is a shell game.  Out of one pocket, into another. And  what is worse, if you look at the President’s proposal for No Child Left Behind, which he talked about  in his  State of the Union address, this year it  is $15 billion dollars short of what this  House and this Senate and the Congress  and  the President  said  they  would provide. And that  is cumulatively $40 billion short of what had  been pledged.  Now, what about higher education?  Our students in this global economic  competition have to be able to compete  in a knowledge-based economy. Yet  students and families are seeing across  this country increasing tuition rates,  making it harder and harder for them  to pay for the tuition and making college out of reach for more and more  Americans.  So what did the President and the  Congress do? The day after the State of  the Union address, this House passed a  budget reconciliation bill that cut $12  billion on student aid, the biggest rate  on student aid in the history of this  country, passed by the Republican Congress. And with the stroke of a pen, the  President  signed  that  into  law and  made college more difficult for many  millions of Americans to reach.  Now, the President also told us in the  State of the Union address that to  maintain our competitive edge we have  to invest in scientific research, and he  was  right. But while he  increased,  rightly, his investment in the physical  sciences, if you look at the medical research budget, it is flat. And in fact, if  you look at 18 of the 19 institutes at  the National Institutes of Health, they  are cut. This violates sort of the first  principle that doctors have in medicine: First, do no harm. Those cuts will  harm our ability to maintain our competitive edge in the medical research  area. We need to get serious.  I am proud to have joined with my  colleague, Mr. INSLEE, to introduce a  number of new provisions with respect  to maintaining  competitiveness,  as  well as others.  The President  also  told us what  many of us already knew: that we are  addicted to foreign oil. If you look actually at his proposals in this area,  they are rather anemic. In fact, his  budget cut our investment in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  And Americans may  remember  the  spectacle just a few weeks ago when  the President wanted to go out and  visit the National Renewable Energy  Laboratory only to discover before the  great photo-op that his budget had cut  funding for that, and 38 employees were  laid  off. So  they had  to  scramble  around to rehire those employees so  the President could get his sound bite  and his photo-op.  We have got to put aside the sound  bites and the photo-ops. And instead of  having the sound bite policy, we need a  very sound energy policy. And again,  many of us have worked on legislation  in this area.  Mr. Speaker, I think the message is  clear: You have to not just look at  what people say but what people do. I  urge the American people to recognize  the gap between rhetoric and reality in  the President’s budget and see that  there are alternatives that many of us  have proposed.  f  ",2006

Whether we  are  talking  about  the  freezing of Pell Grants, this President  has proposed freezing funding for Head  Start. Head Start, the place where disadvantaged kids, kids who it has been  proven in study after study get their  opportunity to succeed in school in a  Head Start program, 19,000 kids would  lose their opportunity to participate in  Head Start.  ",2006
282,120,2006-03-08,Ms. LINDA T.," SA´NCHEZ of California. May I mention that my older  sister, who was the older of the two to  be elected to Congress, was a Head  Start child. That program helped her  become prepared for school, and helped  my mother understand an education  system that was totally foreign to her.  ",2006
283,120,2006-03-08,Ms. WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ.," We  come from three totally different kinds  of communities. Like you in your community, I get stopped  in the supermarket, I get stopped at my son’s soccer games, at dance class, you name it.  And the community I live in happens  to be one that  is sort of middle to  upper middle-class, and it doesn’t matter whether I am in the poorer section  of my district or the wealthiest section  of my district, people are scratching  their heads. Their confidence in their  government  under  this  Republican  leadership has been so badly shaken because of the corruption and the cronyism and the tax cuts and the priorities being totally wrong.  ",2006
284,120,2006-03-08,Ms. HERSETH.," If the gentlewoman  would yield, back to the point that Ms.  SA´NCHEZmade about Head Start, Mr.  Speaker, I think this is so important as  it relates to Women’s History Month  and the importance of the Head Start  Program, the women that have been a  core part of this program, I represent  nine sovereign Native Tribes  in the  State  of South Dakota,  and  tribal  women are among the strongest advocates for Head Start, in both the in-  home program as well as the traditional Head Start Program.  So I could not agree more that any  budget, whether it comes from the administration or the majority in this  House, that would slash or freeze or not  adequately fund Head Start programs  to meet school readiness  is  inexcusable, as well as what had you both  mentioned, and Ms. SA´NCHEZ, I too am  paying off those student loans, how important it is to have access to ways to  finance one’s higher education to become that productive citizen, a taxpayer in one’s community, giving back  and finding good opportunities.  But when you look at the impact of  the egregious budget reconciliation bill  that this House passed by two votes  earlier this year, that found a third of  its savings from Federal student loan  programs, it is also inexcusable. And  when you tack that on to what is happening as I mentioned with Head Start  in Indian country, we have very high  up employment rates, so you can imagine what Native women are faced with.  But the one thing I want to mention,  because we have been focusing on a  number of the challenges, especially as  it relates to the budget and the misplaced priorities, when we talk about  Women’s History Month  I want  to  highlight what will always stand out as  a hallmark, one of the most significant  achievements of women banding  together and being advocates, and that is  in the area of breast cancer research  and awareness.  My grandmother that  I was mentioning earlier, she was a breast cancer  survivor. One of my aunts is also a  breast cancer survivor. I think that is  a model of advocacy in all of women’s  health and how we find creative ways  to adequately fund the research, as we  have done through the Department of  Defense programs that have existed for  that research, and to continue it in  other areas, and to applaud the women,  to applaud the women that were the  strategists,  that were  the activists,  that brought this to the attention of so  many here in the halls of Congress to  make  sure  that  this  serious health  issue was addressed that paved the way  for us to address other health issues for  women that we know are continuing to  be challenges for us.  ",2006
285,120,2006-03-08,Ms. LINDA T.," SA´NCHEZ of California. If you will yield, since we are on  the topic of breast cancer, I want to  mention two weeks ago I lost a Member of my staff in my district office.  She had a 3-year battle with breast  cancer. She died at the age of 49. She  was the most wonderful, outspoken,  helpful caseworker in our office.  Her husband said at her memorial  service, ‘‘You know, Idalia Smith did  not die. She was killed. She was killed  by cancer.’’ He was angry that more  had not been done to try to help eliminate breast cancer in terms of one of  these  horrible  diseases  that  causes  such suffering and takes people from us  far, far too soon.  ",2006
286,120,2006-03-08,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," It is so  sad how we literally now have reached  the point in history where every person  that you talk to can name a woman  that they know that has touched their  lives in some way that has fallen victim to breast cancer. One of my close  friends, 42 years old, a mom of twin 5-  year-olds, just passed away in December, also killed by breast cancer.  You know what  is the most  frustrating thing, is that we have only just  in recent years been able to get NIH  funding  for  women-specific  disease  study, and yet the President has now  proposed a cut in funding for every institute in the NIH.  How are we going  to  reverse  the  trend in breast cancer? Breast cancer is  not even the leading cause of death in  women in this country. It is heart disease. Heart disease is the leading cause  of death. We only just accomplished  having women-specific studies in that  area.  Again, the priorities are just startling.  ",2006
287,120,2006-03-08,Ms. LINDA T.," SA´NCHEZ of California. I just have this to say. We have  talked a little bit about priorities and  we have talked about some very worthwhile programs that are being cut to  the core,  to  the point where  these  kinds of services are going to be eliminated altogether, will be so crippled by  lack of funding that they are not going  to really function and serve the people  they need to serve.  The question for me, and I get angry  about this, I hear colleagues talk about  how they care about breast cancer research, they care about preparing kids  for kindergarten, they care about making sure that educational opportunities  are available, yet they have no qualms  about voting to slash these programs  to the core so they can give tax cuts to  the wealthiest Americans.  If that is not the clearest example of  misplaced priorities, I don’t know what  is, because there is an old saying, you  put your money where your mouth is.  So you  can  talk  about  supporting  something, but if you are not willing to  put your money into that to support it,  you are just giving lip service to it.  ",2006
288,120,2006-03-08,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Our  colleague ROSA from Connecticut has introduced legislation in  the area of breast cancer that we still  cannot get brought to this floor that  would  deal  with  drive-through  mastectomies. You have women in this  country now who, after having their  breasts removed as a result of breast  cancer surgery, are forced out of the  hospital by their insurance company in  24 hours and less after a radical mastectomy, regardless of what their doctor thinks.  What Congresswoman DELAURO’s legislation would do is it would ensure  that it is the doctor, in consultation  with the patient, that would decide  what the appropriate length of stay is.  That is legislation I worked on in Florida, and it is one that we should apply  nationally. Yet we cannot get a hearing, even a hearing, on that bill under  the Republican leadership in this Congress.  That is why it is so important. Listen, I will say this straight out. It is  not  just  important  that we  have  women serving in Congress; it is important that we have women who share  the priorities of most women in America, who are willing to come here to  the Congress and  stand up  for  the  things that we care about.  There is no point in having a woman  here if she is just going to vote just  like men have for generations, really,  because why elect a woman then? We  have got to make sure that we make  progress, that we go forward. This leadership is not taking us forward.

And in addition to that flowery  speech, you speak the truth. Because  so oftentimes here we don’t refer to  that document, the Constitution, that  I carry with me every single day and  that highlights our principles; that is  the founding document that says what  our guidelines ought to be.  Where are our walls and fences? What  should we be doing? We ought to hear  every single day on the floor of this  House, is that the responsibility of the  Federal Government? We ought to be  asking ourselves that on every single  thing we do.  ",2006
290,127,2006-03-08,Mr. CONAWAY.," Mr. Speaker, if the  gentleman will yield  for  just a moment, your good colleague from Georgia was sharing with us last night an  experience he had with a town hall  meeting. Somebody asked him about a  proposed cut of the President, and I  will not name the particular policy  area because I don’t want to get off  into that kind of thing, because it just  distracts us. But anyway, they asked,  why are you in favor of cutting whatever?  His great answer back, and  I am  going to steal it from him, was to look  at them and say, okay, how many in  here think that is the Federal Government’s responsibility; that particular  area of public policy? And not one person raised their hand. And this is an  area that  is very  important to our  country, very vital to our country, but  it is just not the Federal Government’s  role.  And he did it again. Somebody else  brought  up  another  area. And  he  thought, well, it worked once so let me  try it again. How many people here  think that is a role that the Federal  Government should be doing? Not one  hand raised.  So I think Americans are like that.  They understand that if we begin to  pose things in that frame, questions  just like that, that we will begin to get  the political will and  the political  backbone and support for getting back  to basics and getting back to the constitutional Republic that we have.  ",2006
291,127,2006-03-08,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," I appreciate so  much, again, the gentleman’s coming.  Really, it is a positive picture, because  what it says is that we ought to be  looking  at  our  founding  document.  That is a positive uplifting picture.  I guess what is one of the most distressing things about what you have  said is that you described this budget  that is going to be proposed as a radical budget, but it is a balanced budget.  There is nothing radical about a balanced budget within a 5-year period of  time, which is, as I understand it, what  will be proposed. So it is not radical.  In fact, doing anything else is harmful, is not compassionate, and is probably radical because it puts us on that  track  for the GDP percentage being  consumed by the Federal Government  that you pointed to of 50 percent in the  year  2050. And as you  say,  that  is  unsustainable.  It means  it  doesn’t  work. Can’t work.  So thank you so much for joining me  tonight, and I really appreciate your  perspective and your insight and your  acumen that you bring from the private sector to us here in Congress.  I have talked about Senator Moynihan’s wonderful quote that ‘‘Everyone’s entitled to their own opinion but  not their own facts.’’ What we try to do  on the Truth Squad  is to highlight  some of the comments that have been  made on the floor of the House of Representatives and to point out what in  fact the truth is. And we have heard an  awful lot, an awful lot lately about the  Dubai Ports situation, the potential  transfer or sale of management of six  of our Nation’s ports to Dubai Ports  World.  And regardless of what you think  about that, there are some real questions that many of us have about that.  But in the context of that discussion,  we have heard over and over and over  again that no money has gone to port  security, the money has been slashed  to port  security, and  the Congress  hasn’t been responsible in what it has  done with port security. So what I have  done tonight is to bring two new highlights for the Official Truth Squad that  talk about port security funding.  This first one highlights the funding  to the six ports that are in question  here as it relates to the current topic.  b2145  This chart says since September 11,  2001, Congress has authorized a 700 percent increase. That is not a cut, that is  not flat, that is an increase in funding  for port  security, and  in particular  Congress has authorized the following  amounts for six of the most high-risk  ports: $43.7 million to the port of New  York and New Jersey; $32.7 million to  the port of Miami; $27.4 million to the  port of New Orleans; $16.2 million to  the port of Baltimore; and $15.8 million  to Philadelphia, a 700 percent increase  in port security since September 11,  and nowhere do you see a decrease.  That is highlighted even more so on  this chart here that demonstrates and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:32 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00127 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H08MR6.REC H08MR6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2006

You cannot  say even if this problem gets addressed,  this port deal gets addressed, which it  should, you cannot say, okay, we are  done. It is so much deeper than that.  Democrats have been constantly fighting for increased port security, and Republicans have not, plain and simple.  ",2006

When  I  hear  comments  that would  suggest  that Democrats are in any way impeding or obstructing this Congress, my  response is that is absurd.

298,134,2006-03-08,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE)  is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2006
299,134,2006-03-08,Mr.  PALLONE.," Madam  Speaker,  after President Bush made his  first  ever visit to India last week, I want to  lend my personal support to the ever-  improving  relationship  between  the  world’s two largest democracies. His 3-  day visit was another great step towards our two Nations’ strategic partnership. The United States and India  have made extraordinary progress over  the last several years, and the path  that lies ahead is critical to our improving relationship.  Besides the U.S.-Indian civil nuclear  cooperation deal, President Bush and  Prime Minister Singh spoke about a  number of important initiatives that  would enhance cooperation in defense,  counterterrorism, agriculture, energy  and promotion of democracy. Based on  their shared values of diversity, democracy, and prosperity, the growing partnership between the United States and  India has created profound opportunities that are central to the future success of the international community.  I appreciated that the President put  some emphasis on the Kashmir conflict. He called for a solution agreeable  to all parties and emphasized the need  for  ‘‘tangible progress’’ on the issue.  The  deep-seated  hostility  between  India and Pakistan, of course, long predated the U.S. war on terrorism, but  the conflict in Kashmir cannot be separated from it. Bush used his trip to  urge the leadership of India and Pakistan  to continue down  the  road  to  peace.  Madam Speaker, last year India and  Pakistan  agreed  to use  confidence-  building measures aimed at promoting  trade and normal relations, and have  begun to narrow their differences on  the issue of Kashmir. I am encouraged  by this recent effort to improve the security situation in Kashmir. I am also  hopeful that cooperation between India  and Pakistan can continue so we can  finally sustain peace in Kashmir.  Madam Speaker, there is also a growing agricultural cooperation between  America and India shown by the India  Knowledge  Initiative on Agriculture  formulated  last July. Fittingly,  the  President visited with farmers and agricultural scientists in the state of Andhra Pradesh, where some of the best  modern cultivation methods and new  farming technology are being  implemented.  As a Member from the Garden State  of New Jersey, I believe it is important  that we continue to help developing  countries  like  India  emulate  technologies already adapted by the United  States to increase farm production. We  must support programs like those at  Cook College, the Rutgers University  agricultural school in my district, that  are committed to providing agricultural solutions through education and  research. Through their involvement in  various  international  initiatives  to  promote modern research and development, Cook College and others are  vital to global food production.  Madam Speaker, energy cooperation  is another strong aspect of the growing  relationship between our two Nations.  Just  like  the U.S.,  India  is  facing  spikes in oil and gas energy prices, and  they are searching  for ways to  fuel  their rapidly growing economy. As developing economies continue to expand  and existing industrial economies use  more and more energy, global demand  is leading to serious price increases.  That is why we must work together to  develop alternative sources of energy  for homes, businesses and cars. We  must find ways to promote the development of stable and efficient energy  markets in India to ensure adequate  and affordable supplies.  I hope that over time, the U.S. and  India can work together to find ways  to lessen both Nations’ dependence on  foreign oil. It is critical that we reduce  the world’s dependence on oil from unstable  nations  that  pose  security  threats to us and our allies.  Last July, President Bush and the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh,  agreed that the U.S. would share nuclear technology for India’s civilian energy use. Since then, chief delegates  from both governments have been tirelessly negotiating the details of India’s  separation of nuclear power into civilian and military sectors along with establishing international oversight for  India’s civilian programs.  b2300  At the conclusion of his trip, President Bush announced the details of an  agreement  that  both  parties  have  signed on to, and now all that remains  is congressional approval, which I urge  my  colleagues  to  support when  it  comes under consideration.  However,  the President’s  trip  to  India last week should not be viewed  merely as a way to complete the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement. Indeed,  the President used his time accordingly to discuss all the issues of importance to the growing U.S.-India relationship,  including peace throughout  the region and cooperation on global  issues like agriculture and energy.  f  IMMIGRATION  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  DENT).

Pending:  Reid amendment No. 2932, to provide additional transparency in the legislative process.  ",2006
311,148,2006-03-08,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I wish to  spend a couple of minutes this morning  commenting on the provisions offered  by  the Democratic  leader, Senator  REIDof Nevada, which is a comprehensive amendment that covers a lot of  the waterfront related to the matter  before us, and that is greater transparency and accountability by Members of this institution as well as those  who lobby us, who come to us and petition us as paid representatives of various public, private, and nonprofit entities, so we have a better opportunity to  restore a lot of the confidence that has  been eroded in how this institution performs its public function.  My colleague from Nevada, the chairman of the Democratic team here, has  put together a very good proposal. It  has been endorsed and supported by  over 40 of our colleagues as part of the  larger Reid bill. It is called the Honest  Leadership Act.  It  covers a  lot of  ground. I want to identify the provisions in this bill. I know my colleague  from Nevada has done that already, but  it deserves repetition.  As someone who has now spent more  than a quarter of a century in this  body, I have great respect for my colleagues and  their  integrity. We all  know that laws are not only written  for the majority who abide by the law,  but occasionally we write laws because  there are those who step outside the  boundaries, particularly when it comes  to public responsibility and trust. I am  not suggesting by this amendment, nor  is the Democratic leader, that my colleagues in any way, at least the overwhelming majority, are violating not  only the law of the land but even ethics, a sense of responsibility, a sense of  good conduct. But we have  learned  painfully  over  the  last  number  of  months that there are people, unfortunately, who serve in public life, who  serve  in this great Capitol building,  who do take advantage of their position for private gain, who have abused  that public trust and have caused this  institution and its Members to suffer  once again the derision of our constituents, of people who are disappointed  about how we conduct our business. It  is a painful thing to go through.  I have often said I would be willing to  take the 99 Members I serve with in  this body and compare their ethics and  morality to almost any other group of  people, and I am sure they would stand  up very well. But the facts are that we  have people who do abuse the process,  and we need to be cognizant of that and  respond to it. That is what Senator  LOTTand I are doing. That is what my  colleagues,  Senator LIEBERMAN and  Senator COLLINS, are doing with their  proposal which is part of the underlying bill.

317,155,2006-03-08,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Illinois.  ,2006
318,155,2006-03-08,Mr. OBAMA.," Mr. President,  I rise  briefly to support the amendment offered by Senator REID. I also support  the amendment that was introduced by  Senator DODDand Senator SANTORUM,  of which I am a cosponsor. But let me  focus on the particular provision  in  Senator REID’s bill, the honest leadership bill, that I think all of us should  pay attention to, and that is the provision which closes a loophole that would  still allow Members and staff to receive  free meals from lobbyists up to $50 in  value.  On my way over to the floor, I passed  a couple of security guards and Capitol  police. I asked them how often lobbyists had bought them a meal. Surprisingly, they said none.  I talked to the young women who  help us on the elevators on the way up.  I asked  them: Has a  lobbyist ever  bought you a meal? The answer was  ‘‘no.’’  In cities and towns all across America, it turns out people pay for their  own  lunches and their own dinners,  people who make far less than we do,  people who cannot afford their medical  bills or their mortgages or their kids’  tuitions. If you ask them if they think  that  people  they  send  to Congress  should be able to rack up a $50 meal on  a lobbyist’s time, what do you think  they are going to say? You ask them if  they think we should be able to feast  on a free steak dinner at a fancy restaurant while they are working two  jobs to put food on the table. I don’t  think we need a poll to find out the answer to that one.  I want to be clear. In no way do I  think that any of my colleagues or  staffers would exchange votes  for a  meal. But that is not the point. It is  not just the meal that is the problem,  it is the perception, the access that the  meals get you. In current Washington  culture, lobbyists are expected to pick  up the tab when they meet with Members or staff. It is understood by all  sides that the best way to get face time  with a Member is to buy them a meal.  You don’t see many Members eating  $50 meals with constituents who come  into town to talk about issues on their  minds, or with policy experts who are  discussing the  latest economic theories. Most of  these meals  that are  taken are with lobbyists who are advocating on behalf of special interests. It  diminishes perceptions, and it is something that I think has to stop.  Let me close by saying this. If people  are interested in meeting with lobbyists or having dinner with lobbyists,  they can still do so. It is very simple.  You pull out your wallet and pay for it.  I strongly urge we support the Reid  amendment.  In addition,  I  strongly  support  the Dodd-Santorum  amendment, of which I am a cosponsor.  I yield my time.  ",2006
319,155,2006-03-08,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, Senator  DURBIN from Illinois asked to be heard  for 2 minutes as well. Senator DURBIN  has time during the day to comment on  this.  This is a very comprehensive amendment Senator REID has  offered.  It  strengthens what is, in my view, already a very strong bill of the Rules  Committee. But it does close some gaps  that I think are critically important. I  hope we can develop some bipartisan  support. It will take some issues we  would have to debate later in the day  off the table because they would be included in this amendment.  So, again, I urge my colleagues to  take a look at this. You may not agree  with every single dotted ‘‘i,’’ as I said  earlier, and crossed  ‘‘t.’’ But  if you  agree with the thrust of this, I think it  deserves your support and it is one that  would strengthen this bill on lobbying  reform and the transparency and accountability issues, which are the hallmarks of this joint legislative effort.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",2006

343,162,2006-03-08,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, first, I  was fascinated by the comment from  the Senator  from Connecticut  that  after a few years some of this stuff will  make sense to us. I have only been here  20 years. I am a patient man; I will  wait.  Let me put this in perspective, as far  as my interest in this. Back in 1986 I  was elected to the House of Representatives. There was a procedure that was  used at that time called the discharge  procedure whereby a person could discharge a bill out of the committee  without having committee action, but  it could be blocked by someone and we  could not know the name of the person  who blocked it.  Consequently, we found ourselves in  this situation where there would be  legislation that everyone at home is  very excited about. We could go home  and campaign and say, yes, I am for  this. I remember several of the West  Texas Democrats wanting to oppose  gun control. Yet their caucus wanted  them to support gun control. So they  would tell the people at home that  they were opposing it. Yet they were  the very ones who kept it from coming  up for a vote.  That is exactly the same thing we  are dealing with here. In 1994 we were  able to pass that reform. When we  came over here in 1994, I was not even  aware that you could put a hold on a  bill without disclosing who you were or  who was putting the hold on. This is a  very similar thing. It is transparency,  bringing it out in the open.  I agree with my good friend Senator  WYDEN that if Members want to, they  can put a hold on a bill. This does not  affect that. Members just have to say  who they are.  This morning I had my amendment  on the floor and Senator WYDEN and  Senator GRASSLEY showed me  their  amendment was essentially the same. I  was very happy to fold mine in. I am  happy to be part of this.  After a number of years now, this  will become a reality. I applaud my fellow cosponsors for the fine work they  have done.  Let me review how that means of obfuscation worked—this from the CONGRESSIONALRECORD, page H1131, March  10, 1992:  A good example is the method Members  from the House of Representatives used to  hide their votes from the people concerning  a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution. Shortly after it was discovered in  a USA Today poll in 1987 that over 80 percent  of the people in America want a balanced-  budget  amendment  to  the  Constitution,  House Joint Resolution 268 was introduced.  House  Joint Resolution  268  immediately  gained 246 coauthors from over the Nation. I  can just envision, at the town hall meetings  back home, a liberal Democrat standing up  and holding House Joint Resolution 268 in  his hand saying, ‘‘See here, ladies and gentlemen. This is my name as cosponsor of  House Joint Resolution 268.’’ What the Congressman didn’t tell these people is that he  has no intentions of allowing House Joint  Resolution 268 to come up for a vote. How  does this Congressman, who  is trying to  make the people back home believe that he  is supporting a budget-balancing amendment  to the Constitution, keep  from having to  vote on it?  It is very simple, the Speaker merely puts  it in a committee and then makes a deal  with the committee chairman not to bring it  up for consideration. The only way that it  can be brought up for consideration is for a  discharge petition to be signed by 218 Members of Congress. The discharge petition is in  the Speaker’s desk and must be signed during the course of a legislative day. However,  the names of those individuals who sign a  discharge petition are kept secret and if a  Member discloses the names of other Members who sign the discharge petition, he can  be disciplined to the extent of expulsion  from membership of the House of Representatives. So House Joint Resolution 268 had 240  cosponsors, but only 140 Members were willing to sign the discharge petition.  Pretty cozy, huh? The Congressman can  falsely represent his position to the people at  home and never have to vote on the issue. I  might add that there is a happy ending to  that House Joint Resolution 268 story. Several of us contacted a national publication.  While the publication knew we couldn’t divulge the names of those who signed the discharge petition, they agreed to print the  names of the  individuals who coauthored  House Joint Resolution 268, but did not sign  the discharge petition. We found a loophole  in the corrupt institutional system that protects Congressmen from their electorate and  as a result of that, we were able to immediately force it out onto the floor and we  missed passing a balanced-budget amendment  to  the Constitution by only  seven  votes.  That situation disturbed me so much  that in March of 1993 I filed a one-sentence bill on  the House  floor challenging the secrecy, ‘‘Once a motion to  discharge has been filed the Clerk shall  make the signatures a matter of public  record.’’  I had 87 cosponsors, and it passed by  a vote of 384 to 40.  In an article about my  initiative,  Reader’s Digest  in November of 1994  wrote, ‘‘The success of this legislation  is proof that when Congress is required  to do the people’s business in the open,  the people—rather than special interests—win . . . the passage of this one  bill is an important first step in the  right direction. And it took a little-  known Representative form Oklahoma  to point the way.’’  I ask unanimous consent  to have  printed in the RECORD the full text of  this article.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Reader’s Digest, Nov. 1994]  A STORYOFDEMOCRACYANDCAPITOLHILL:  HOWTHETRIALLAWYERSFINALLYMETDEFEAT  (By Daniel R. Levine)  When  a  twin-engine  Cessna  airplane  crashed near Fallon, Nev., four years ago,  the National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB) ruled pilot error was the cause. But  that didn’t stop lawyers for two of the injured passengers from suing Cessna on the  grounds that the seats on the 25-year old  plan did not provide adequate support. The  seats had been ripped out without Cessna’s  knowledge  and  rearranged  to  face  each  other. But the lawyers claimed that Cessna  should have warned against removing the  seats. A jury awarded the two plaintiffs more  than $2 million.  In Compton, Calf., a single-engine airplane  nearly stalled on the runway and sputtered  loudly during take-off. Less than a minute  into the air it crashed, killing two of the  three people on board. On July 18, 1989, two  days before the one-year statue of limitations would expire, the survivor and relatives of the deceased passengers filed a $2.5  million lawsuit naming the plane’s manufacturer, Piper Aircraft Corp., as a defendant.  Not mentioned in the suit was the fact that  the plane, built in 1956, had been sitting at  the airport unused and uninspected for 21⁄2  years. The case, awaiting trial, has already  cost Piper $50,000.  The NTSB found that 203 crashes of Beech  aircraft between 1989 and 1992 were caused by  weather, faulty maintenance, pilot error or  air-control mishaps.  But  trial  lawyers  blamed  the manufacturer and  sued  each  time. Beech was forced to spend an average  of $530,000 defending itself in each case and  up to $200,000 simply preparing for those that  were dismissed.

I will see if we can get  that done. I think it would be to everyone’s advantage if we could resolve this  part of the situation we have on the  floor.

346,169,2006-03-08,Mr.  GRASSLEY.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am placing a hold on the nomination of James Lambright to serve as  President of the Export-Import Bank of  the United States.  I  am  placing  this  hold  on Mr.  Lambright’s  nomination  as  I  have  major concerns regarding the issuance  of  taxpayer-guaranteed  credit  insurance by the Export-Import Bank for an  ethanol project  in Trinidad and Tobago. Specifically, the approval of this  credit insurance by the Export-Import  Bank appeared to violate the Bank’s  authorizing statute.  Let me explain.  In March  2004,  the Export-Import  Bank approved the  issuance of $9.87  million in taxpayer-guaranteed credit  insurance to help Angostura Holdings  Limited, of Trinidad and Tobago, finance the construction of an ethanol  dehydration  plant  in Trinidad. The  purpose of this credit insurance was to  enable Angostura to purchase equipment to be used to dehydrate up to 100  million gallons of Brazilian ethanol annually. Angostura would then reexport  the resulting dehydrated ethanol to the  United States duty-free under the current Caribbean Basin Initiative trade  preference program.  But section 635(e) of the Export-Import Bank’s authorizing statute—the  Export-Import Bank Act of 1945—states  that the bank is not to provide credit  or financial guarantees to expand production of commodities for export to  the United States if the resulting production capacity is expected to compete with U.S. production of the same  commodity and that the extension of  such credit will cause substantial injury to U.S. producers of the same  commodity. The statute goes on to provide that ‘‘the extension of any credit  or guarantee by the Bank will cause  substantial injury if the amount of the  capacity for production established, or  the amount of the increase in such capacity  expanded, by  such  credit or  guarantee equals or exceeds 1 percent  of United States production.’’  As of 2004, when the credit guarantees for Angostura were approved, the  total 100 million gallon capacity of the  Angostura facility was nearly 4 percent  of U.S. production. This amount clearly exceeded the 1-percent threshold for  causing substantial injury to the U.S.  ethanol industry as spelled out in the  Export-Import Bank’s authorizing statute.  So it appeared to me that the approval of credit guarantees for Angostura by the Export-Import Bank violated  the Export-Import Bank’s authorizing statute.  Moreover, as the amount financed by  the Export-Import Bank was less than  $10 million, no detailed economic impact analysis was conducted by the  bank. I note that the amount approved  by the Export-Import Bank $9.87 million was conveniently just below this  $10 million threshold amount.  In the Consolidated Appropriations  Act of 2005, Congress asked the Export-  Import Bank for an explanation of the  credit guarantees for Angostura. Specifically, the 2005 act required the Export-Import Bank to submit a report to  the Committees on Appropriations of  the Senate and the House containing  an analysis of the economic impact on  U.S. ethanol producers of the extension  of credit and financial guarantees for  the development of the ethanol dehydration plant in Trinidad and Tobago.  Congress also required that this report  determine whether such an extension  would cause substantial injury to such  producers, as defined in section 2(e)(4)  of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945.  In January of last year, the Export-  Import Bank provided its report. In its  report, the Export-Import Bank avoided the issue of whether its credit guarantees for Angostura caused substantial injury to U.S. producers, and thus  whether the approval of these guarantees was in compliance with the Export-Import Bank’s authorizing statute. The Export-Import Bank avoided  the issue by claiming that the Angostura plant will not  ‘‘produce’’ dehydrated ethanol. Rather, the Export-Import Bank stated that this plant will  merely  ‘‘process’’ dehydrated ethanol  by removing water from wet ethanol  produced in Brazil, thus merely ‘‘adding value’’ to the wet ethanol  from  Brazil.  However, despite  the  semantics of  the Export-Import Bank, the Angostura plant will clearly be producing dehydrated  ethanol. This  is  common  sense. An ethanol dehydration plant—  of  course—produces  dehydrated  ethanol.  Moreover, the Customs Service recognizes  that  ethanol  dehydration  plants  in Caribbean Basin  Initiative  countries produce dehydrated ethanol.  While the Export-Import Bank currently does not have an inspector general, the conference report for the Foreign Operations appropriations bill for  fiscal year 2006 directs the Export-Import Bank’s  inspector  general—once  appointed to look into this credit insurance approval. Specifically, the conference report provides that the inspector general  shall provide a written  analysis to the Finance Committee and  the  Committee  on  Appropriations,  within 90 days of appointment, as to  whether the loan guarantees provided  to the ethanol dehydration plant  in  Trinidad and Tobago met the provisions  of  the Export-Import Bank’s  charter. The  analysis  shall  include  whether ‘‘value added’’ methodology is  routinely used by the bank to determine whether a proposed  loan guarantee or export credit meets the statutory test regarding the definition of  substantial injury found in the bank’s  authorizing statute. The inspector general shall also make recommendations  as to whether it is appropriate to use  such methodology in making a determination of substantial injury.  As the Export-Import Bank currently  does not have an inspector general, I  am placing a hold on Mr. Lambert’s  nomination until such time that I receive assurances from him that, first,  the Export-Import Bank will act quickly to appoint an inspector general, and  second, that Mr. Lambert will see that  the inspector general will indeed provide a written analysis on the credit  insurance approval within 90 days of  appointment.  f  INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY  ",2006
347,169,2006-03-08,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to commemorate March 8,  2006, International Women’s Day. It is  an undeniable fact that as the world  becomes more interconnected, societies  which value women’s rights and  include them in the political, economic,  and civic process have a greater chance  of prospering and contributing to international peace and stability.  Nowhere is this more evident than in  Iraq. We all know that in order for Iraq  to succeed as a nation, women must  play an integral role in the government  and women’s rights must be treated as  fundamental  human  rights.  While  much work remains to be done in Iraq,  I am pleased to see that women are  playing a prominent and active role in  the government.  As such, it is a great honor to not  only  commemorate, March  8,  2006,  International Women’s Day but also  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:00 Mar 09, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G08MR6.049 S08MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o y r r e h c y         ",2006
348,211,2006-03-08,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Louise Lorenzi Fountain, a lifelong citizen of Las Vegas, who died on Sunday, January 29, 2005, at the age of 92.  Louise was a link to the past as the last remaining child of David Lorenzi, the namesake  of Lorenzi Park. Louise was born on November 14, 1913, to David Lorenzi, a French immigrant, and Julia Travese Moore. Her younger years were devoted to helping her father  develop  and manage  Lorenzi  Lake Park,  which was built by Lorenzi and is considered  a primary  landmark  in  the development and  life of the citizens of Las Vegas. Louise’s father has been noted as one of the 100 most  influential citizens of Las Vegas. He opened  the park  in 1926 with a pair of man-made  lakes, a swimming pool, a dance hall, a band  shell, and other amenities that made it a recreational refuge in the desert.  Louise married Edgar Fountain in 1936. He  had hitchhiked from Georgia in search of work  on the construction of the Hoover Dam. The  couple left Las Vegas for 10 years and lived  in Grand Coulee, Washington, where Edgar  helped build Grand Coulee Dam. After returning to Las Vegas, she became a full partner  in several business ventures the couple started, including the Nevada Amusement Co., a  Toyota dealership, and a television sales business.  Louise was active in two Methodist churches and was a member of  the First Presbyterian Church. She was a charter member  and regent of  the Valley of Fire Chapter of  The Daughters of  the American Revolution.  She enjoyed gardening, playing bridge, and  entertaining friends. She was a loving, wonderful person and a dear mother who will be  sorely missed. Louise’s  life exemplifies her  service and contributions to the city she loved.  With her passing, a small fragment of beauty  and kindness has left us.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand on the  floor of the House to recognize Louise Lorenzi  Fountain and the wonderful life that she lived.  f  HONORING ROCHELLE STEVENS  HON.

349,211,2006-03-08,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I ask my  colleagues to join me today in recognizing the  achievements of 2-time Olympic medalist and  11-time NCAA All-American Rochelle Stevens.  A native Memphian, Rochelle has racked up  accomplishments both on and off  the  track.  She is a credit to our community, and her determination and commitment to helping others  are an inspiration.  For  the past 15 years, The Rochelle Stevens Foundation has hosted an  invitational  track meet in Memphis that has funded scholarships and new shoes for athletes across the  southeast.  Rochelle has made a difference. She has  inspired our community by her example and  her spirit, and we know our state is a better  place for her work.  On February 24, 2006, Rochelle was elected to the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in  Nashville where she represents Memphis well.  We wish Rochelle all the best and thank her  for giving back so much to our community.  f  MEDICARE PROGRAM NOT  CONFUSING  HON. VIRGINIA FOXX  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 2006  ",2006
350,211,2006-03-08,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, today I would like  to discuss  the Medicare Part D prescription  drug plan, a historic program that renews our  commitment to our Nation’s seniors.  This plan gives seniors choices for prescription drug coverage that will cost less while offering more benefits. It has brought Medicare,  a program created 40 years ago, into the 21st  century. Millions of seniors who were without  access  to drugs are now getting  them and  many are saving thousands of dollars a year.  Clearly, people have liked what they have  heard about this program as sign-ups for the  third week of February amounted to 546,000  and the week before, numbered 543,000. All  told, almost 26 million people have signed up  so far.  The Democrats say  that seniors are confused about this program. I’m feeling a little bit  confused myself and here’s why: Democrats  are holding town halls for the sole purpose of  criticizing this plan while at the same time telling seniors they should consider signing up.  Well, I guess I can understand why they are  confused.  Mr. Speaker,  there  is nothing  confusing  about a program that will help Medicare beneficiaries pay for their prescription drugs while  at the same time saving them money.  f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO BOB BLUM  HON. JON C. PORTER  OFNEVADA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 2006  ",2006
351,211,2006-03-08,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Bob Blum who has broadcasted at over  1,000 sporting events for the University of Nevada Las Vegas.  A member of the American Football Foundation Hall of Fame for his work with the old  AFL’s Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers, it is hard to find anyone who has seen  more games  than Bob since he began his  play-by-play career in 1948. Still going strong  at 85, he has been behind the microphone for  190 Rebels men’s basketball games, 80 football games, 75 baseball games, 20 softball  games  and  over  635 women’s  basketball  games. His current position is the announcer  for the Lady Rebels Basketball team.  Bob began commentating for UNLV in 1973.  One of his most memorable games was  in  1977 when the Rebels made the Final Four  and were playing at Atlanta  in  the midst of  UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian’s first round of  wrangling with the NCAA. At the last minute  Congressman Jim Santini had come to Atlanta  and didn’t have a ticket, so Bob allowed the  Congressman to sit with him. The Congressman began cheering, and at half time Wayne  Duke, the commissioner of the Big Ten and  the head of the tournament committee, came  over and told Bob that his guest was not allowed  to cheer on  the press  row. Bob  informed the Commissioner that his guest was  none other  than Congressman Santini, who  was  the chairman of  the committee  investigating the NCAA. Commissioner Duke then  asked Bob to ‘‘Have him quiet down a little.’’  Another  favorite game  that Bob Blum  remembers announcing took place the previous  year, in 1976. UNLV played Hawaii-Hilo and  beat them 164–111. With a combined score of  275 points, it is still the highest-scoring game  in NCAA history.  Mr. Speaker,  I am grateful  to honor Bill  Blum and his extraordinary career. I wish him  the best at announcing  for another 1,000  games.  f  HONORING GORDON L. ZEINE  HON.

353,218,2006-03-08,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Madam Speaker,  today  I  rise in support of S. 2271, a bill to add civil liberty protections  to  the conference report on  H.R. 3199, the USA PATRIOT Reauthorization  Act. Although I voted against the Patriot Act in  December,  the  Republican  Leadership  rammed  it  through Congress anyway.  I welcome this opportunity to eliminate some of its  most egregious provisions and to further enhance civil  liberties protections.  I will keep  fighting to improve this law so that we can find  the right balance between waging the war on  terrorism and protecting  the  rights of  the  American people.  S. 2271  improves civil  liberties  in  three  ways. Under  the Patriot Act,  libraries, bookstores, and other recipients of court orders for  information are bound by a nondisclosure requirement. These organizations are unable to  tell the target of the investigation that records  have been obtained on the public, if they believe the search is unwarranted. As currently  written,  the Patriot Act prevents appropriate  oversight to affirm the need for such requests  for  information. S. 2271 allows recipients of  these court orders to challenge the nondisclosure requirement, which helps protect civil liberties by placing a check on unrestricted use  of these court orders and protects against unlawful search and seizure.  As currently written, the Patriot Act greatly  expands the use of administrative subpoenas,  known as National Security Letters  (NSLs).  NSLs are equivalent to search warrants, but  they are signed by government bureaucrats instead of issued by courts. These subpoenas  have minimal civil  liberty checks  in place  to  ensure an  investigation  is warranted. Presently,  the Patriot Act  requires  recipients of  NSLs to disclose to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) the names of their attorneys  who are notified of the NSL. This overzealous  provision could launch investigations into attorneys trying to defend clients who received unwarranted investigations. S. 2271 removes this  requirement to disclose attorney names, and I  am pleased to support this change.  Finally, S. 2271  increases  the burden of  proof on obtaining evidence  from  libraries.  Under the Patriot Act, an NSL could require libraries to hand over book checkout lists and  Internet records for specific users, which is a  tremendous violation of privacy. S. 2271 requires  investigators  to obtain a court order,  which would prevent overzealous investigators  from trying to find evidence without probable  cause.  If S. 2271 does not pass, I am concerned  that  the Patriot Act will move  to  the President’s desk for signature lacking protections to  prevent  challenging  nondisclosure  requirements, increasing the opportunity for civil liberties abuses, and subjecting libraries to unnecessary and intrusive scrutiny. While I continue to oppose the underlying Patriot Act, I  will vote  for  these  improvements.  I  look  forward to working with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to correct other deficiencies  and protect  the American people  from both  terrorists and potential abuses of our  freedoms.  POLISH  NATIONAL  ALLIANCE  (PNA)  OF  NORTH  AMERICA—  LODGE 711 100TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. RICHARD E. NEAL  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 2006  ",2006
354,218,2006-03-08,Mr. NEAL.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize on the House floor that 2005 marked  the one-hundredth anniversary of Lodge 711  of the Polish National Alliance (PNA) of North  America.  I’m  proud  to  have  Lodge  711  headquartered  in my district  in  the  town of  Wilbraham.  PNA is the largest ethnic fraternal insurance  society in the United States that offers quality  life insurance and annuity products, which allows its members and families to achieve financial security. But the PNA’s involvement in  the communities it serves goes beyond providing quality financial services by organizing  various social and cultural programs. Whether  its sports and youth programs, spelling bees,  college scholarships, or Saturday Schools promoting Polish heritage and culture, PNA helps  its members  live more  fuller and enjoyable  lives.  Mr. Speaker, I’m honored to have the opportunity to represent a diverse and culturally  rich constituency, particularly the Polish communities that have a large presence in Massachusetts’  second  congressional  district.  Throughout my years of public service I have  witnessed with great pleasure the Polish communities’ dedication and commitment to civic  affairs. The lessons of Poland’s long and hard  history of achieving  independence has not  been  lost with  the Polish  immigrants who  came  to America or  their offspring born  in  America.  The American and Polish people have a  long  and warm  relationship  that  evolves  around the love of freedom and opportunity.  This bond goes back  to America’s  revolutionary years when the Polish patriot, Tadeusz  Kosciuszko,  fought  in  the American War of  Independence and achieved the title of brigadier general. Later, Kosciuszko once again  fought for independence when leading the Polish-Lithuania uprising of 1794. The American  people honor Kosciuszko with a statue of the  patriot in the U.S. Capitol building.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Teresa  Struziak-Sherman, Director for PNA Region A,  for all her wonderful work over the years that  has contributed to the success of the PNA. I  would also like to recognize all the other people of Polish ancestry that I have known and  worked with throughout my years as a public  servant and look forward to my continued relationship with them.  f  TRIBUTE TO HALEY SACK  HON.

",2006
357,2,2006-03-15,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, 3 years  ago, this administration began a grim  march of folly into Iraq. Today, our  troops are bogged down in the middle  of a civil war.  Iraq has become an incubator of terrorism. Over  2,300 U.S.  troops have  been killed, tens of thousands more injured  and  perhaps  100,000  innocent  Iraqis have been killed, with countless  others injured.  As both  the  Iraqi public and  the  American people demand the U.S. leave  Iraq, this administration plans to send  more troops. We must bring our troops  home. We must vote against any additional appropriations  that would be  used to keep our troops there.  Plans exist right now that would enable the United States to bring our  troops home, to begin the effort to  bring our troops home. Not a dime  more for continuing this war; not a  dime more for an illegal war that was  based on lies about weapons of mass destruction.  f  RETREAT AND DEFEAT  DEMOCRATS  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, on Monday, Senator RUSS  FEINGOLDsadly reminded America that  the Democrat Party is still dancing to  the tune of retreat and defeat through  appeasement.  Senator FEINGOLD’s call to censure  President Bush for implementing a legitimate and effective terrorist surveillance  demonstrates  that Democrats  continue to push political ambitions  more than our national security.  From DICKDURBIN’s slandering our  troops  as  communists,  to Howard  Dean’s defeatist  remarks about our  troops’ efforts, to Senator FEINGOLD’s  careless call to censure our President,  it is obvious that Democrats have no  positive plan to protect American families.  Instead of proposing ways to prevent  terror attacks on our soil, Democrats  prefer to spend their time and energy  on political tricks that do not serve  the interests of the American people.  As  our  enemies  continue  to  issue  threats daily against our country, Republicans will remain committed to  proactively  investigating,  capturing  and detaining al Qaeda operatives and  any other terrorists who seek to attack  American families.  In conclusion, God bless our troops  and we will never forget September 11.  f  CONGRESS MUST STEP IN TO EXTEND DEADLINE ON MEDICARE  PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN REGISTRATION  (Mr. MORAN of Virginia asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",2006
358,2,2006-03-15,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, in 2 months, about 10 million senior  citizens are about to get a Bush Medicare tax imposed on them for the rest  of their lives. If they don’t sign up for  the Medicare prescription drug bill by  May 15, then they can’t sign up again  until the end of the year, and for the  rest of their lives they will pay a 7 percent higher premium than their neighbors  under  exactly  the  same  circumstances just because they couldn’t  figure out this myriad of dozens of different plans that they are presented  with.  This is wrong. The Republicans and  the Democrats need to get together to  extend the deadline to the end of the  year, regardless of what the President  decides. It is time for Congress to act  and to save these 10 million Americans  from having an unfair tax burden on  their shoulders  for the rest of their  lives. It is wrong. Let’s fix it.  f  ROBERT G. CANAR  (Mr. GOODE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
359,2,2006-03-15,Mr. GOODE.," Mr. Speaker, Mr. Robert  G. Canar has distinguished himself by  exceptionally  meritorious  achievements in public service to this Nation  by serving the United States Army for  over 42 years. Mr. Canar began his public service career in the U.S. Army as  an air defense artillery officer and as a  military  intelligence officer. During  his 22 years on active duty, he served  in various assignments  in Vietnam,  Korea, Europe  and  in  the United  States.  Mr. Canar joined the former Foreign  Science and Technology Center in 1983  when he was assigned as a division  chief  supervising  collection  requirements, imagery, and electronics intelligence branches. Because of his demonstrated abilities, he has been given  positions of greater responsibility as  the director, information management,  and later as the director, programs and  resources, which led to major initiatives to renovate Foreign Science and  Technology Center’s  facilities to accommodate growth of the workforce  and to secure facilities to meet Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  standards.  Mr. Canar served as  the National Ground  Intelligence Center’s chief of staff from 1994 to  2003, and as the center’s acting executive director from 2003 to 2004. In response to the  Global War on Terrorism,  the center underwent a massive growth with the influx of new  responsibilities to support the soldier.  In 2004 Mr. Canar volunteered to serve for  a year as the senior intelligence officer with  the Civilian Police Assistance Training Team,  Baghdad, Iraq. In this capacity he supervised  an  International Police Liaison Officer Team  and a Multi-National Command-Iraq military  team which organized and  trained  the  Iraq  Ministry of Interior Criminal Intelligence Service Directorate.  He ended his civil service career as  the  special assistant to the commander, National  Ground Intelligence Center responsible for the  establishment of a Joint Use Intelligence Analysis Facility in Charlottesville, VA.  Throughout his service, Mr. Canar has provided outstanding  leadership, sound advice  and expert professional  judgment on significant issues that affected the Army. His actions  and counsel were invaluable to Army leaders  as they considered the issues facing the Nation today. Mr. Canar’s dedication to accomplishing the Army’s missions has been extraordinary. He has been a truly outstanding public  servant and will be missed by  the United  States Army.  f  DRUG  FOR  MEDICARE  PRESCRIPTION  PLAN;  BAD  MEDICINE  AMERICAN SENIORS  (Mr.  CARNAHAN  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2006
360,2,2006-03-15,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Mr. Speaker, since  the new Medicare prescription drug  plan took effect at the beginning of  this year, Members of this body have  heard from thousands of frustrated seniors struggling with the confusing and  poorly written plan. Now  they are  dealt a new blow: seniors who don’t  register in time will be forced to pay a  penalty for the rest of their lives.

361,9,2006-03-15,Mr. COLE of Oklahoma.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to address several of the points  of my good friend from Massachusetts.  First,  in terms of going  into war  without the information and without  the debate. I was not in Congress when  that decision was made, and, frankly, I  looked back and have read the debates  very carefully, watched the debates at  that time, and know that, frankly, everybody that was voting voted on the  best information they had available at  that time.  Frankly, I remind my good  friend  that we were operating with a CIA that  was run by a President Clinton appointee, that he was pretty adamant in  terms of there were WMDs there. That  was the shared opinion of every other  intelligence agency in the world. And,  again, I don’t question the motives of  the decision that was made.  I would also add this. For me, the  more compelling figure is not what we  found before we thought we were going,  but what we found after. I go back to  those mass grave sites and I go back to  those tens of thousands of people that  were killed. And, frankly, I go back to  a level of American responsibility for  allowing that to persist, in my opinion,  after 1991.  I relate to my friend a story that I  heard on my very first visit to Iraq,  when I was talking to a young American sergeant. It was becoming evident  at that point that the stockpiles we  thought were going to be there weren’t  there. There was dual-use technology,  and perhaps the potential to recreate  something. No question Saddam Hussein was working his way out of restrictions, but what we thought was  there, wasn’t there.  And I asked this young sergeant who  had risked his life in the drive to Baghdad what he thought, given that information. And he first gave me sort of a  nice stock political answer and said basically what  I  said: Well, we don’t  know. We are still looking. And I said,  but we haven’t  found any. And he  looked at me, and I will never, ever forget what he said when I said, so, was it  worth it? And he answered my question  with a question.  He said, sir, have you ever been to a  mass grave  site? And  I  said, no,  I  haven’t. He said, I have. He said, you  haven’t seen anything until you see  bodies coming out of the ground and  hundreds of family members trying to  identify them and wailing. And I have  seen that, and I wonder why the whole  world wasn’t here 10 years ago. That is  a good question for us to ask ourselves  inuring the course of this debate.  I also want to address my friend’s  point about a commission in two ways.  First, by making the point that there  is a good deal of oversight that goes on  in this process. I used to serve on the  House Armed Services Committee.  I  still do. I have a waiver on that committee now. But that committee, I can  assure you,  is very thorough  in  its  oversight. I think appropriations has  an oversight function.  But, finally, and more importantly, I  think on this particular piece of legislation, both sides of the House often  ask for an open rule, and anything germane to this piece of legislation, this  supplemental  appropriation,  can  be  brought here. I think that is a very  good thing. Now we are being told we  not only want things that are germane  to one of the largest spending bills and  one of the most important pieces of  legislation that we will deal with this  year, we want things that are not germane. We want waivers granted.  And, by the way, we are being told  that by both sides of the aisle. This is  not an exclusive demand. I think it is  a misdirected demand. I would like to  see us move back toward more open  rules, more regular order, and I think  this rule is a step in that direction.  ",2006
362,9,2006-03-15,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",2006
363,9,2006-03-15,Mr. COLE of Oklahoma., I yield 20  seconds to my friend.  ,2006
364,9,2006-03-15,Mr. TIERNEY.," Thank you.  Well, first of all, I was here when we  voted on the Iraq thing, and believe  me, there was plenty of information for  people that wanted to look at it to  know which way things were going.  And certainly our White House should  have known which way things were  going, and they made representations  that turned out not to be accurate. So  people can be responsible for their acts.  Secondly, the mass graves you are  talking about are mass graves of the  late 1980s, early 1990s, when members of  our present administration were over  there being friendly with the Iraqis and  with Saddam Hussein.  It is never not germane for this body  to do its oversight duty. It is always  germane.  ",2006
365,9,2006-03-15,Mr. COLE of Oklahoma.," Reclaiming  my time. I disagree with my friend’s  characterization  of when  the mass  graves were. There are certainly  35  years’ worth of mass graves in Iraq, but  a lot of them are from 1991 on, and particularly from the uprising of the Shi’a  against  Saddam Hussein, when  an  American Army was sitting on their  border and we urged them to rise up  and did nothing to help them.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
366,9,2006-03-15,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  will be happy to yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Massachusetts.  ",2006
367,9,2006-03-15,Mr. TIERNEY.," I want to clarify that  in 1991, the first Mr. Bush was President, when you were encouraging the  uprising to go into that, and that is a  period of time when there were many  mass graves in that situation.  And, secondly, I just want to drive  home the point that there is never a  time when oversight for this group is  not germane to the function that we  do. We  legislate, we have oversight,  and there has been no effective oversight of either the Katrina situation or  what is going on with contracting in  Iraq and Afghanistan, not  from any  committee in this body, and the record  is clear on that and it speaks for itself.  ",2006
368,9,2006-03-15,Mr. COLE of Oklahoma.," Let me just  make a quick point on Katrina.  Actually, there was good oversight  there. Chairman DAVIShad a very good  committee. Unfortunately, my friends  on the other side of the aisle chose  largely not to participate in an oversight function.  ",2006
369,9,2006-03-15,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself 30 seconds just to say that  President Bush’s first Secretary of the  Treasury, Mr. O’Neill, wrote a book  after he left and commented that the  first Cabinet meeting he went to, in  January, they were discussing going  into Iraq, to his great surprise. So that  was planned long before September 11.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. SABO).  ",2006

Americans deserve a rigorous review  of foreign investments that affect our  national security posture. Never again  should we find that the President and  the Secretaries of Homeland Security,  Treasury and Defense are unaware of a  critical transaction until after it has  been approved.

375,16,2006-03-15,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Chairman, today we turn our attention to  the fiscal year 2006 emergency supplemental, addressing the global war on  terror and the gulf coast disaster assistance.  The  committee-recommended  funding levels is $91.833 billion, which is  $400 million below the President’s request.  The bill provides for $67.6 billion in  support of Operation  Iraqi Freedom  and Operation Enduring Freedom. The  supplemental fully funds the administration’s  request of  $4.85 billion  to  train and equip security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The  bill  earmarks,  I  repeat, Mr.  Chairman, the bill earmarks $850 billion over the President’s request to upgrade Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles. The committee  is also  earmaking,  I  repeat, Mr. Chairman,  earmarking an additional $480 million  over the request for newer, self-up-armored Humvees, for a total of $890 million of earmarks.  The committee has fully funded the  President’s request to procure and develop countermeasures to prevent IED  attacks on our troops. The bill also includes the enhanced $400,000 life insurance benefit  for servicemembers and  $100,000 death gratuity for combat-related fatalities.  The committee did not fund $1 billion  of the request for various construction  projects related to security training  activities in the region because they  were poorly defined and not well justified.  The committee did provide a five-fold  increase for the Department of Defense  Inspector General to monitor war expenditures.  Under title II, the supplemental provides $19.1 billion for hurricane-related  disaster assistance, including $9.55 billion for FEMA’s disaster relief fund.  The bill also provides $4.2 billion for  HUD  community development block  grants to address long-term recovery  and restoration of devastated areas.  b1215  The bill also provides the requested  amount of $1.46 billion for various flood  control projects and levee repairs by  the U.S. Corps of Engineers.  This legislation also requires FEMA  to provide better reporting on the expenditure of disaster  funds and provides funding for the Inspector General  of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to  investigate and prosecute fraud cases.  Like most Members of the House, I  have heard from many of my constituents expressing strong concerns about  the possibility of foreign-owned companies managing U.S. ports. As a result  of those concerns, the House Appropriations Committee overwhelmingly,  and in a bipartisan fashion, adopted an  amendment  that prohibits  the company, Dubai Ports World, owned by one  of the governing bodies of the United  Arab Emirates, from taking over the  operation of any port facility in the  United States.  It was not my intention, Mr. Chairman, to have the committee rewrite  the Defense Production Act or change  the Committee on Foreign Investment  in the United States, the CFIUS process. Those are very complex policy decisions which rest primarily with the  Financial Services Committee. Additionally, the Homeland Security Committee,  the  Armed  Services  Committee, the Committee on Energy and  Commerce,  and  the  Committee  on  International Relations have a great  deal of interest in this matter.  The  straightforward  amendment  adopted in our committee was crafted  to block only the Dubai Ports World  deal. This is a national security issue.  This is a national security bill. Our  goal is to ensure that security of our  ports is in America’s hands.  During our debate, Mr. Chairman, on  the  supplemental,  I  fully expect an  amendment  to  strike  this  language  from the bill. This striking amendment, which will likely fail on a broad  bipartisan basis, gives our Members the  opportunity to voice their strong opposition to the port deal. It will also send  a  strong and unmistakable message  that the Congress and the American  people stand united on the critical national security issue that involves the  ports.  Mr. Chairman, I urge an aye vote on  the passage of this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2006

377,16,2006-03-15,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of this bill, and I am pleased to  have worked with Chairman KOLBE to  develop the foreign assistance portion  of  this measure. The bill  cuts  the  amount requested for international assistance by about $140 million from the  administration’s request, and rescinds  an additional $17 million in previously  appropriated funds that are no longer  needed.  However, I do have concerns about  what we have included and what we  have not included. I am particularly  concerned about the lack of funding in  this bill for Afghanistan. During the  chairman’s recent visit to Afghanistan,  the ambassador and USAID staff outlined a need for $600 million in FY 2006  supplemental funding to help address  the power and infrastructure needs in  Afghanistan.  Our ambassador, the Afghan government, and provincial leaders all agreed  that progress on reconstruction and development was critical to help consolidate the rule of law, curtail the influence  of  the Taliban  and  al Qaeda  operatives and combat opium poppy  cultivation.  Yet, the President’s request does not  contain the $600 million that Ambassador Neumann requested. It does not  even contain the $407 million that Secretary Rice requested in her submission to OMB. The President requested  just $62 million for assistance to Afghanistan  in the supplemental, one-  tenth of what  is needed. The committee  further cut this amount providing only $8 million for Afghanistan.  Now, I do understand that Chairman  and Chairman LEWIS are frustrated with the lack of response from  the State Department on the counternarcotics program in Afghanistan, and  I share that frustration. However, in  this instance, I fear that we are cutting  off our nose to spite the State Department’s face. I do not think this is a responsible strategy.

383,23,2006-03-15,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Chairman, I want to  commend  the gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS), the Chairman of the  committee,  for his work  in bringing  this supplemental appropriations bill  to the floor. He has really done an outstanding job of, I think, balancing the  different  interests that are  involved  here.  I want to take my time, Mr. Chairman, Members, to speak a bit about  that part of the bill that deals with the  foreign assistance funds. That is Chapter 3 of H.R. 4939.  The Foreign Operations portion of  the  fiscal year 2006 supplemental  is  $2.08 billion. That amount is $140 million, or 6.7 percent less than the request of the administration of $2.2 billion.  Now, here is how we arrived at this  lesser figure.  First, we  eliminated  funding  requested by the President that is not for  the current fiscal year. That is $74 million. We eliminated funding that was  requested  for  non-emergency  costs.  That is $99 million. And we reduced  costs by rescinding previously appropriated funds of $17 million that are  not needed because of changed circumstances.  Let me talk for a minute about specific regions and countries. First, Iraq.  The bill provides new budget authority  of $1.67 billion for Iraq, or two-thirds of  the amount  in  foreign assistance  is  going to Iraq. But that is a reduction  of $58 million from what the President  requested. This  reduction  represents  the amount requested for fiscal year  2007 costs for the U.S. Agency for International Development. As I said a moment ago, we concluded that this 2006  supplemental bill should not be used to  pre-fund expenses of the next  fiscal  year.  In addition, the supplemental transfers $185 million from the Iraq Relief  and Reconstruction Fund appropriation to augment the new funds provided in this supplemental. These are  still unobligated funds that are appropriately applied to the purposes of this  legislation. And that brings the total  available to Iraq of $1.85 billion.  Many Members are greatly concerned  about Darfur and our efforts to stave  off genocidal warfare in that region of  Africa.  Though  a  fraction  of  the  amount requested for Iraq, our bill attempts to accomplish this. It contains  $201 million, fully funding the President’s  request  for Darfur programs.  This includes $123 million for the African Union Mission in Sudan, or called  AMIS, for peacekeeping activities. The  administration has assured us that this  $123 million will finance the entire U.S.  fiscal year 2006 contribution.  Also included in this amount is $11.7  million for refugee assistance and $66.3  million  in nonfood assistance  in the  International Disaster and Famine Assistance Account. The plight of displaced persons in Darfur remains critical and is pathetic.  The supplemental bill provides new  budget authority of only $8.4 million  for Afghanistan. This is a reduction of  $54 million from the request but does  not constitute a lessening of our commitment to this emerging democracy.  Rather, it represents, first, the amount  requested, $16 million, for fiscal year  2007 funds for USAID. It reduces that  amount.  Second,  it  eliminates  the  amount requested  for non-emergency  requirements of $38 million. The $8.4  million  fully  funds  the  request  for  emergency replacement of an electric  turbine generator and assistance  for  migration and refugee requirements.  My colleagues should know that the  Secretary of State has not yet met the  requirements of the fiscal year 2006 Appropriations Act which requires a certification that the Government of Afghanistan  is  fully  cooperating with  U.S.-financed  efforts  to  eradicate  poppy cultivation. It did not seem prudent at this  juncture to appropriate  any non-emergency funds for Afghanistan until that certification can be  made.  The legislation includes $10 million  in the Democracy Fund appropriation  for the promotion of democracy, governance, human  rights,  independent  media and the rule of law programs in  Iran. This is a reduction of $55 million  from the requested amount. However,  $50 million of that is for broadcasting  efforts and is addressed in Chapter 6 of  this bill, the jurisdiction of Mr. WOLF’s  subcommittee.  For Liberia, the bill includes a total  of $63.8 million. $13.8 million of that  amount would be used to cover the extraordinary costs of refugees returning  to Liberia, and $50 million will provide  assistance  for economic and project  support.  Now let me turn to the issues that  are not specific dollar amounts. One of  these is a general provision, Section  3012, not in Chapter 3 of the bill. It  deals with assistance  to  the Palestinian Authority.  I want to be clear. This bill includes  no new, no additional funding for the  Palestinian territories, and the President’s supplemental request  included  no such funding. However, the fiscal  year 2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill did include $150 million  to support the Palestinian people and  build  the capacity of  the Abbas-led  government. Since the fiscal year 2006  bill was passed, as my colleagues know,  Hamas won a majority of the Palestinian legislature in the recent elections.  The provision included in this bill before us today reconfirms and reemphasizes congressional oversight of our foreign assistance programs to this troubled region. It directs that no fiscal  year 2006 or prior year funding can be  used to support the Palestinian Authority or a successor entity until the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:38 Mar 16, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15MR7.052 H15MRPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

This is a very  important issue. And there is definitely  a need  for  future  training  in prosthetics to meet the needs of our wounded veterans, and indeed, some of our  active duty service people.  The only concern I have is that this  would take $20 million out of the defense health budget and move it basically to training. Now, this is a very  perspective, thoughtful idea. It needs  to be done. And the only concern is the  current needs of the defense health  budget. But I am prepared, Mr. Chairman, to accept this amendment, to  move forward, and as we come to conference, if there is any need to reassess,  we would do that. But in the spirit in  which it is offered, I am prepared to accept the amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by  the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  MILLENDER-MCDONALD.)  The amendment was agreed to.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk  will read.

386,44,2006-03-15,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition  to this amendment, and I know some of  my colleagues may question why that  would be the case, but I think there is  a very good and sound reason for that,  and I hope the gentleman from Massachusetts will listen to this.  As Members will know, our committee has supported $290 million for  the African Union for the AMIS fund.  That is the African Military in Sudan  support fund. $123 million, that is in  this bill. I have been to the Darfur region twice in the last 18 months, and I  have seen the very difficult conditions  under which this African Union force is  working, and I have been pushing the  State Department to come up with a  strategy as to what would be the future  for the A.U. fund.  So, with all of the support that the  subcommittee has shown so far for this  effort, why are we opposing this additional funding?  Well, the Members may come from  both sides of the aisle to the floor and  claim that this funding is critical to  saving lives in Darfur, but the simple  fact is that this will not do that. It  does nothing of the kind. In fact, it  could actually be counterproductive.  Let me explain why I say that.  There is now an agreement between  all the parties, the African Union, the  administration and the United Nations,  that the African Union force we call  AMIS, A-M-I-S, should transition to a  United Nations  force. Just this  last  Friday, the African Union announced  its support for such a transition and  extended  the mandate of  the AMIS  force until the end of this fiscal year. I  have their communique  in my hand  here suggesting that it will be extended  and then there would be a transition to  a United Nations force. The administration’s request, which is fully funded  in the bill before us, will fulfill the  U.S.  contribution  to maintain  the  AMIS force until that time.  If we were to adopt these additional  funds, we are basically saying that we  do not agree with the idea that this  force  should  be  transitioned  to  a  United Nations force. We are saying we  want to add additional funds to keep it  an African Union fund and not transition it to a United Nations force.  That, Mr. Chairman, would be a mistake. Because there is no question the  African Union has made it clear they  cannot expand the force. They are willing to extend  it  for the time being  until  it can be  transitioned  to  the  United Nations force, but they have no  capability and no intention of expanding the force. So to put these additional moneys in here to expand the  force simply says that we are opposed  to transitioning it to a United Nations  force where we could have the proper  size and the proper forces attached to  this.  So that is why I say this amendment  actually would be counterproductive to  what the gentleman  from Massachusetts seeks to do. It is for that reason  that I cannot support the message that  we would send with this amendment.  If the situation in Darfur is not resolved by the end of the year, this force  should be transitioned to the United  Nations force where we have seen over  and over again it has the capability of  dealing with this kind of peacekeeping  operation, from Bosnia to other places  around the world.  So I urge my colleagues to reject this  amendment. They will not be voting  against the AMIS, the African Military  in Sudan, the A.U. force, that is there.  They will  instead, by rejecting this  amendment, they will be voting for a  coordinated effort to truly bring stability to the troubled region of Darfur;  and, for that reason, I would urge my  colleagues to vote against this amendment.  ",2006
387,44,2006-03-15,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, more than a year and  a half ago, the House and Senate voted  unanimously to condemn the genocide  in Darfur, and yet every day more people die, and the slow genocide persists  unabated.  It  is beyond  imagination that the  collective might and concerted will of  the nations of the world cannot find a  way to end this daily toll of human  misery. Mr. Chairman, I hope and pray  that Sudan will allow the U.N. peacekeeping mission to move forward so we  can end  this devastation. While we  wait, however, we must find ways to  make the African Union mission more  effective.  I would note to my colleagues that  the problem in Sudan has not generally  been a lack of resources. With bipartisan support, often under Democratic  initiative, the Congress has provided  over  $1.3  billion  in  assistance  for  Darfur and southern Sudan. This assistance has been and continues to be  needed, and we are committed to providing it.  The primary problem, in my opinion,  has been a lack of political will from  the government of Sudan,  from the  international community and, to some  extent, from the United States. Until  we address  these  issues of political  will, I am afraid we will be forced to  rely on solutions that treat the symptoms without curing the disease.  I support this amendment because it  seeks to make a bad situation better. I  thank the gentleman for offering it.  I also want to acknowledge the leadership of members of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, specifically Representatives JACKSON of Michigan and especially Chairman  KOLBE, who have worked diligently to  bring attention and focus to the situation in Darfur.  For those reasons, I will support the  amendment.  The  Acting  CHAIRMAN  (Mr.  GINGREY). The  question  is  on  the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. CAPUANO).

The Bush administration, if you read  the paper the last several days, has  been meeting every day with experts  around the world on the issue of Iran.  To cut this money back pulls the rug  out from the administration. Iran is a  threat.  Iran is developing a nuclear bomb.  Iran is the one that funded Hezbollah.  Iran blew up the American embassy  once. They blew up the American Embassy  in Beirut a second time. Iran  blew up  the Marine Corps barracks  killing 241 Marines. It is an emergency.

400,58,2006-03-15,Mr.  JEFFERSON.," Mr.  Chairman,  today, I rise to offer the first of two  amendments to H.R. 4939, the Emergency  Supplemental  Appropriations  Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror and the Hurricane Recovery Act of  2006, that will add more funds to the  Community Development Block Grant,  CDBG funds, to meet the housing and  rebuilding needs of Louisiana, Texas  and other places.  The  first  amendment,  number  6,  printed in the CONGRESSIONALRECORD,  will take $2 billion from the Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency,  FEMA, and add it to the Community  Development Block Grant funds, making that total request $6.2 billion.  This amendment keeps the total hurricane supplemental request at $19.1  billion. The proposed  $2 billion decrease in FEMA funding brings that  total to $7.755 billion.  Mr. Chairman, information recently  given to us by the Appropriations Committee indicates that FEMA will not  run out of its current funds until the  second week of July. Moreover, with  FEMA’s weekly spend rate of $500 million, the first proposed appropriation of  $9.55  billion,  less my  amendment,  would fund FEMA through the end of  October.  Mr. Chairman, I am certain that between now and October we will be able  to amply  try and  figure out what  FEMA really needs and provide the resources it needs at that time.  Mr. Chairman,  the  administration  has asked Louisiana repeatedly to submit a housing plan, and we did that.  This  chart  shows what Louisiana’s  housing needs are. We had severe destruction of our housing infrastructure  in our State, and we have more than  100,000 housing units destroyed. This  will cost over $100,000 billion to get this  whole matter straightened out, along  with other project losses back home.  What we are saying here is that we  have a plan which we submitted to the  White House, and we have had this plan  looked at very closely. The agreement  is that Louisiana has submitted a very  solid plan  for $4.2 billion  for unmet  needs  in  its housing  reconstruction.  Without housing, our city cannot rebuild. Without housing,  there  is no  chance to bring our city back. And so  we are saying today, Mr. Chairman,  that without full funding we cannot  meet the crucial needs to help our citizens rebuild their lives.  There is a move being made now to  take the money out of the $4.2 billion  to apply to Texas and perhaps some  other places, and we say we need all of  the $4.2 billion. We also have the $2 billion for Texas. We do not argue they do  not need more help, but we do not need  to have our money raided to take care  of Texas or any other place.  By increasing the CDBG funding, we  will  allow  the needs  of Louisiana,  Texas and other States to be met without  short-changing  the  administration’s commitment to Louisiana.  Mr. Chairman, you know  firsthand  the monumental housing crisis in Louisiana. Today, thousands of people are  being evicted from hotels around the  gulf region by FEMA with nowhere to  turn. Thus, I implore my colleagues to  support this amendment so that we can  help these hard-working, earnest taxpayers in the gulf coast rebuild their  lives and realign their futures.  Louisiana needs the full $4.2 billion  to do that. Support my amendment to  make Louisiana, Texas and the rest of  the gulf coast region whole.  I urge  adoption of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  b2100  ",2006

402,58,2006-03-15,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. Mr. Chairman, there  is no  doubt that the Community Development Block Grant Program needs more  funding,  however,  this  amendment  would take $2 billion out of the Disaster Relief Fund, which is severely underfunded as it is, of the more than $35  billion in supplemental funds that we  have provided to the Disaster Relief  Fund for the recovery from Katrina,  Rita and Wilma. As of March 8, only  $3.7  million  of  that  remains  unallocated; and long term recovery, of  course, is just getting underway.  The disaster  fund  is very volatile.  Over the last month, weekly obligations have varied from $250 million to  $1.1 billion. That is per week. The administration estimates the current balance of $3.7 billion in the disaster fund  will only last us through the end of  May as it is. If you take $2 billion out  of that, there is not much left to last  us in the disaster fund.  Now, if you take those monies out of  the disaster fund, many of the authorized activities for which the States are  expecting  funding cannot be  funded.  And I am talking about the Stafford  Act Recovery Programs  in  the gulf  coast States’ ability to respond to new  disasters if they should occur.

406,72,2006-03-15,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in  favor of S. 2320, legislation regarding  the low-income home energy assistance  program that we call by the acronym  of LIHEAP.  I believe that this is a good bill that  will help all Americans, both in warm  weather States and  in cold weather  States, but it will be particularly helpful  to  those  in  the warm weather  States  like Texas and places where  summers can be difficult as the winters  are in the Northern States.  The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005  which  this House passed,  the other  body passed and the President signed  recently,  included  $1  billion  for  LIHEAP for fiscal year 2007. The moneys were offset by savings elsewhere in  the titles written by the Energy and  Commerce Committee, which  I have  the privilege to chair.  The bill before us today spends the  funds this year and splits the funds  equally between regular and contingency  funds. Mr. Speaker, I support  this approach because the increase in  regular funds in the bill would allow  significantly more LIHEAP  funds to  flow to the warm weather States to  help with cooling costs this summer.  This has happened only once before  in the 1980s. For Texans, which is the  State that I come from, this will mean  an additional $38 million this year, almost doubling Texas’s LIHEAP funds.  Overall, the funding increases in the  bill before us will help both the warm  weather States and the cold weather  States in the winter. Warm weather  States  in the summer and the cold  weather States in the winter. This is a  good solution for all States, both warm  and cool; and I hope that we will support the bill.  We do have an unusual parliamentary procedure, Madam Speaker, that I  think we need to bring before the body.  The bill before us has already passed  the Senate.  If we pass  it with no  amendments, it will go to the President for his signature.  The supplemental bill, which we have  been debating until  several minutes  ago, also has some LIHEAP  funding  that is under a different formula mechanism, as I understand it. It is quite  possible, if not probable, that that bill  is also going to pass.  If it does, we then have a situation  which is somewhat murky, but, as best  we can tell, whichever bill gets to the  President last for his signature will be  the bill that dictates the formula funding for this fiscal year. I put that into  the RECORDsimply because I think all  Members of the Chamber need to know  that.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2006
407,72,2006-03-15,Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.," Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I would like to thank my colleague  from Texas for calling up S. 2320, and I  agree with what he said. I this it is interesting, though, the parliamentary  procedure that the chairman of our Energy and Commerce Committee talked  about, because I would assume that if  this bill passes with the two-thirds requisite votes tomorrow and goes to the  President, that the section in the supplemental bill would be stripped out in  the  conference  committee,  because  that bill still goes to the Senate into a  conference  committee.  So  I  guess  parliamentarily that would be the solution in our situation.  Madam Speaker and Members, low-  income Americans have been  struggling to pay for heating bills during  the winter; and, thankfully, this winter  has not been as cold as expected and  heating bills have not  increased as  greatly as feared. However, natural gas  prices that drive electric prices have  quadrupled over the past several years.  The States’ public utilities commissions, PUCs, are passing those costs on  to our constituents.  Low-income Americans also struggle  to pay cooling bills. When the 90 and  100 degrees heat rolls around this year,  the situation is going to become very  critical very quickly.  Air conditioners run on electricity,  and a lot of electricity comes from natural gas. The need for relief is going to  be intense throughout 2006, the end of  this winter, this summer, and the start  of next winter due to the incredible energy  prices  our  country  is  experiencing.  The LIHEAP program has been controversial because the formula can pit  different regions of the country against  each other. For the first $2 billion appropriated under this program, Northern States do very well, and relatively  little funding goes to the South. Above  this $2 billion trigger, however, the formula becomes much  fairer,  for Congress has never crossed this trigger by  any  large amount, that  is until tonight.  The Senate compromise  legislation  provides an extra $500 million to the  LIHEAP formula over and above the $2  billion Congress has already provided.  This  is  incredibly  important  for regional equity.  This  legislation has provided  $500  million in contingency funding which  can be used for emergencies such as  blizzards, heat waves, hurricanes; and  this funding is required to be allocated  in 2006.  Today marks the first day we have a  real chance to cross that $2 billion trigger and provide a measure of equity for  the warm States. Importantly, today  also marks the best chance to increase  LIHEAP for 2006 for cold States as well  by providing 2006 contingency funding.  If we pass this legislation today, the  LIHEAP allocations for 2006 will become much more equitable between regions. It is important we pass this legislation today. It will directly go to the  President’s desk and provide  immediate extra assistance for the Northern  and the Southern States this year.  The  administration  supports  this  bill, and I would like to introduce this  letter from Secretary Leavitt into the  RECORD.  THESECRETARYOFHEALTH  ANDHUMANSERVICES,  Washington DC, March 8, 2006.

409,79,2006-03-15,Mr.  SCOTT  of  Georgia.," Madam  Speaker, first, I want to respond to  something my distinguished colleague  from the other side said. Now you talk  about smoke and mirrors. For him to  say on our side that we are talking  about raising taxes is so disingenuous.  Nobody is talking about raising taxes.  We are talking about fiscal responsibility and pay-as-you-go  responsibilities.  We are saying that we do not want to  cut vital services to the American people and then go borrow more money  that we have to pay interest on. That,  in effect, when you put it altogether, if  anybody is talking about raising taxes,  it is the Republicans. Somebody has to  pay for this. You know who is going to  pay for it, our grandchildren and our  children based on their proposals.  No, sir, you are not going to be able  to depend on Democrats this night that  we are  talking about  raising  taxes.  Democrats are talking about keeping  our taxes low and bringing fiscal responsibility back to this House.  You talk about responsibility. When  Democrats were in control, when President Clinton was there, he left a several trillion dollar surplus. In just 5  years, this President and this Republican-led Congress has squandered that  surplus. So when you talk about who is  more  responsible  for  the  taxpayers’  money,  it  is Democrats, not Republicans. And the American people are  not going to be fooled by this smoke  and mirrors of consistently trying to  paint the Democrats as being for raising taxes and they for not. The Republicans are for raising taxes and raising  the debt ceiling.  Madam Speaker, I want to show this  chart. It is not as big as your chart,  but the Republicans have increased the  debt limit by $3 trillion. I have been  here 4 years, and this is the fourth  time that the Republicans have asked  to raise the debt ceiling so they can  borrow more money.  In June, 2002, they asked to raise the  debt ceiling by $452 billion. In May,  2003, they asked to raise the debt ceiling by $984 billion. In November of 2004,  they raised the debt ceiling by $800 billion, all of which we are borrowing  against, against the best national security interests of this country, against  the best financial security interests of  this country.  ",2006
410,79,2006-03-15,Mr. RYAN  of Wisconsin.," Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I hope the gentleman appreciates the  fact that I yielded him a minute to  beat me up some more.  ",2006
411,79,2006-03-15,Mr.  SCOTT  of  Georgia.," Madam  Speaker, will the gentleman yield?  ",2006
412,79,2006-03-15,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin., I yield to  the gentleman from Georgia.  ,2006
413,79,2006-03-15,Mr.  SCOTT  of  Georgia.," Madam  Speaker, let me assure the gentleman  it was not beating him up. He is a great  gentleman, but it is some of the policies that have been emanating  from  the gentleman’s leadership.  ",2006
414,79,2006-03-15,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Reclaiming  my time, a couple of points.  Number one, as a percentage of this  economy, this is not the largest deficit  we have had in history, which is the  statistic that matters. But you know  what? This deficit is too big because it  is a deficit, period.  Number two, if you do not pass this  tax bill, taxes automatically go up.  That means they are increased. Here is  what this tax bill does:  It prevents  these tax cuts from going away. Said  another way, it keeps taxes where they  are so they do not automatically increase because the law requires that  taxes go up next year, the year after,  and the year after that.  So the concern we have is that because we lowered taxes, got economic  growth going again, created new jobs,  it actually increased revenues to the  Federal Government and lowered our  deficit projections. The  concern we  have is let us focus on spending, not  taking more money out of the pocketbooks of our constituents. Let us not  take a bigger bite of the paychecks of  the workers of America by taking more  of their tax dollars. Let us prevent  these tax increases from hitting the  American people and let us focus on  the real problem, spending.  So if you try to defeat this tax bill,  you are basically saying we want taxes  to increase. Or if you want to offset it,  you are saying to prevent tax increases  we need to increase taxes. That does  not make a lot of sense.  So the point is we have probably a  fundamental disagreement. We believe  that we should not raise taxes on people. We believe that the more money a  person has in their paycheck, the more  money a person has in their pocketbook and wallet and their business, the  more successful they are going to be,  the more freedom they have, the more  prosperous they will be and the better  our economy will be. And its impact on  our budget deficits is a beneficial one,  usually, because  it means there are  more revenues coming to the government.  Nevertheless, we should not look at  it as an opportunity  to  spend. We  should look at this good economic news  we have right now, the fact that the  economy is growing, people are going  back to work and paying taxes, we  should look at this as a moment to  make sure we do not spend as much  money so we can reduce the deficit and  pay down our debt. That is what it is  all about at the end of the day.  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the dialogue and the debate. I urge a no vote  on this motion to instruct.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore  (Mrs.  DRAKE). Without objection,  the previous question is ordered on the motion  to instruct.

418,79,2006-03-15,Mr. POE.," Madam Speaker, 3 years  ago this month, the fight for liberation  of Iraq began in the hot desert lands of  the Middle East. On March 19, 2003,  American  soldiers embarked on  the  war against  tyranny,  treachery and  terrorism. Since  then,  thousands of  brave,  passionate  Americans  have  fought for freedom for the Iraqi people.  As  the  song  says, all have given  some, and some have given all in this  battle  for  liberty  and  justice. The  Americans went to  Iraq as  freedom  fighters and have established a democracy  in  that place  that has never  known true freedom.  Those young Americans are all volunteers, and more Americans are joining the military each day to continue  this battle.  When I was in Iraq, I visited with  those Americans, and  they  told me  they are winning this war on terror,  and I agree with them. This is the finest military ever assembled in history,  and we owe them our support and our  resolve. I paraphrase what President  Kennedy  said, We will  support any  friend, oppose any foe, pay any price to  secure the defense of liberty.  Some things are just worth fighting  for, and freedom is one of those things.  God bless these Americans, and that’s  just the way it is.  f  CONGRATULATING THE PLANO,  TEXAS, BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM  (Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks and  include  therein extraneous material.)

420,93,2006-03-15,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  think we have a Secretary who  is  working hard on it. There are problems, but at the same time, we are  writing a million prescriptions a day  without incident. Beneficiaries are saving a lot of money.  I spoke with the Senator from Florida about how the average premium is  now $25 a month, 20 percent lower than  we  first projected. I spoke with the  Senator from Florida about the lower  drug costs, saving the taxpayers dollars as well. Just this year, the benefit,  as I said, will cost $8 billion less than  originally thought. The 10-year cost  has dropped by $180 billion.  I heard from a couple in Iowa who are  saving nearly $2,800 a year. Another  Iowan is saving $1,750 a year. And here  is another one. A person from Massachusetts  is  saving  $17,000—$17,000—a  year on medicine because they are participating in this program.  Getting this level of savings depends  on  strong  competition  among  the  plans, and we have that. Many people  will  remember  the  skepticism  on  whether many plans would participate  at all. Some would say that we have  too many choices and that is why beneficiaries  need  more  time.  Those  choices, in fact—let me put it this way:  It is not just choices, but because of  choice, we have competition keeping  premiums  low, and they are  letting  people pick the plan that best suits  their medical needs.  My amendment strikes an effective  compromise, I believe, to Senator NELSON’s amendment, which is before us.  Senator NELSON’s amendment calls for  a unilateral extension of the enrollment deadline right now, and it would  extend it until the end of the year and  into  the  enrollment period of next  year.  As I said, I think it is premature to  make that decision now. Some people  think 6 months is not enough time to  make a decision on a plan. Yet millions  are enrolling even now.  Many  people  are  also  concerned  about  the  late  enrollment  penalty.  This penalty is modeled after the way  Medicare Part B has worked since its  origination in 1966. There is a late enrollment penalty in Part B that anybody who doesn’t sign up for it when  they get to be 65 will pay, and that is  there to encourage people to enroll  early and to think of Part B as not  some Government program, just a Government program, but to see all of  this—whether it is Part B or it is Part  D, as in drugs—as an insurance policy.  People who are 65 today thinking  about signing up for the Part D drug  program under Medicare may be very  healthy and may think they have never  taken a pill in their life and that they  will never take a pill, but that is today  when they are 65. They are not going to  know what their health needs are when  they are 70 and maybe get sick and  have to take a lot of medication.  It is a little bit as if you were never  going to have a car accident, you would  never buy car insurance. If you were  never going to have a  fire  in your  house, you would never buy fire insurance. But Americans see insurance as a  very useful tool, a necessary tool to  manage their risks, and our seniors and  disabled people ought to see this as an  insurance policy, maybe not needed  today, but that will be needed some  day, and they ought to be enrolled.  Obviously,  if you didn’t have that  penalty in Part B and now in Part D,  the drug part, then who would ever  sign up until the day before they have  to buy their  first pill,  just as you  would not buy your car insurance policy until the day before you were going  to have a car accident.  So I hope people see it as a good investment, as an insurance policy, as it  has been for Federal employees for the  last 40 years.  The late enrollment penalty is designed to encourage enrollment, and as  with other coverage of  insurance,  it  spreads these costs across many enrollees. The more people enroll, the lower  the costs are for everyone.  So if the Senator from Florida wants  to keep these costs continually low,  get more people under the umbrella,  sell an insurance policy, as he has been  so successful selling people on the importance of keeping Senator NELSON in  the Senate.  The open enrollment creates an enrollment deadline. The deadline that is  involved in the open enrollment period  encourages people to act, to get the  protection  against  unexpected  drug  costs. We all know that people sometimes wait until they need coverage to  get it. It would be the same as if only  people with a burning house get fire insurance. If you waited until the day before your house was going to burn down  to buy fire insurance, fire insurance  would be awfully expensive. That leads  to higher costs for everyone.  For the same reasons then, there is  an enrollment period and a late enrollment penalty under Medicare Part B,  not at all a new idea. The premise of  the Nelson amendment  is that Congress needs to override that 6-month  open enrollment period and make  it  even  longer. The Nelson amendment  would do that today even though enrollment is on track. It would extend  the open enrollment period now even  though we don’t know whether it will  be necessary 2 months from now. It  presupposes a bad outcome to the enrollment of Part D of Medicare.  It  plans for failure, and I think this plan,  particularly with how successful the  competition is, for failure is wrong.  Frankly, I think Senator NELSON’s  amendment has the potential to do  more harm than good, regardless of his  good intentions. Without the pressure  of that May 15 deadline, many beneficiaries may forgo savings by putting  off their decision.  Now, it may turn out that the enrollment period needs to be extended, as I  said  in my  first remark to my colleague from Florida. And if that is the  case, then my amendment would give  the Secretary the authority to do that  right away. No further congressional  action would be needed.  Under my amendment, if in 2 months  the Secretary determines the enrollment period should be extended, if enrollment is lagging, for example, then  he has clear authority to do that.  My amendment would also automatically delay the late enrollment penalty  if the enrollment period is extended by  the Secretary of HHS.  My amendment would provide  the  funding needed to continue the open  enrollment  period. This  funding  is  needed to continue the round-the-clock  operations of the 1–800 Medicare number, and the expanded operations for  that open enrollment period.  I close this debate by reading an editorial  from the New York Times  in  1966. This was an editorial about the  implementation of the original Medicare Program we have had on  the  books since 1966. A quote from the New  York Times:  But as Medicare gets underway, the danger  is that the strains on it will generate pressures for unsound change. They will come  from those who will be disappointed because  they have been led to expect too much as  well as from those who see failure in every  shortcoming. Changes will come in time, but  they should be made on the basis of Medicare’s own experience. This great new experiment must be given ample time to get over  its growing pains.  Those growing pains for Part D Medicare are now just 21⁄2months old. So I  go back to the first sentence, for the  consideration of my friend from Florida, ‘‘that the strains on the system  will generate pressures  for unsound  change.’’  I think his  is an unsound  change. This  quote  speaks  volumes  about our current situation with Part  D Medicare.  I urge my colleagues to support my  amendment and to oppose the Nelson  amendment.

443,100,2006-03-15,Mr. GREGG.," I understand I have 9  minutes. Good.  The discussion which just occurred  between the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Washington  is a discussion which reflects the difference between our views and how you  should budget. Essentially what the  Senator from North Dakota and the  Senator from Washington said is we  should break the cap, we should spend  additional money, and we should raise  taxes. Their approach to budgeting is  to tax and spend. Our approach, on the  other hand, has been to say if there is  a priority which the Senate feels is a  high priority, whether it is veterans’  benefits or CDBG—and there will be  other amendments like these—that the  Senate should declare there is a priority and set up a process where other  programs will have to be reduced in  order to pay for that program within  the cap. The Senator from North Dakota correctly  referred  to  it as an  across-the-board cut.  Section 920 is a technical event. It  does not have money in it, and it never  has. But when you identify a 920 expenditure,  it  creates  a mechanism  where another program activity would  be cut across the board.  That is the philosophical difference  between our parties.  This budget increases the size of Government from last year to next year by  over $100 billion. That is the growth in  this  budget—over  $100  billion. The  growth  in the discretionary account  will be about $30 billion under this  budget. Those are huge numbers of  growth. That is expanding the Government in a very dramatic way and a  very significant way, much more so  than I would personally wish to do. I  wish to see us control, for example, entitlement spending a little more aggressively around here, which is the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:19 Dec 27, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\S15MR6.REC S15MR6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2006

445,107,2006-03-15,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I yield 5  minutes to myself off the resolution.  We have heard from the other side that  we have proposed additional spending  in the committee. Yes, we did. The difference between our spending and the  spending the other side offered—and  they have offered, repeatedly, amendments to increase spending—is that we  paid for ours. We paid for it.  The Senator has a list that shows we  offered in committee amendments that  have  increased spending $126 billion.  Let me explain where almost all of  that spending was. One amendment.  One amendment to say that veterans of  our country should have their spending  considered mandatory rather than discretionary—mandatory  rather  than  discretionary. I think most Americans  would say spending on veterans is not a  discretionary matter.  We asked them to go to war, asked  them to put their lives on the line. In  many  cases,  they have  come  back  wounded, injured, and in need of care.  Is it discretionary to fund those accounts, to take care of their medical  needs? We don’t think so. We think it  should be on the mandatory side of the  ledger. That is scored as $104 billion of  our $126 billion of spending.  Now, yes, I will look anybody in the  eye and say that was spending that was  responsible, to keep the promise made  to our Nation’s veterans. And we paid  for it. We didn’t just run up the debt  the way our colleagues do. Over and  over, they have voted for spending. We  have shown the  lines. Spending has  gone up under this administration. But  revenue has gone down. They voted for  all the spending, and they voted for all  the tax cuts, and the result is the debt  is going up, up and away. So they are  the party of borrow and spend. Borrow  and borrow,  spend and  spend. They  don’t want to reduce any spending.  I don’t  see any amendments  that  they have offered to cut spending. They  offered amendment after amendment  to increase spending, but they don’t  want to pay for it.  The Comptroller General has told us  that ‘‘continuing on this unsustainable  fiscal path will gradually erode, if not  suddenly damage, our economy, our  standard of living, and ultimately our  national security.’’ He is talking about  this runup of debt.  I want to conclude. My colleague said  they had a deficit reduction plan and  they didn’t get a single vote from our  side for it. He is right. They didn’t  have any deficit reduction. There is no  deficit reduction in their plan. The deficit went up. They passed their plan  and the deficit went up. In 2005, the  deficit was $319 billion. They passed  their deficit reduction plan without a  single Democratic vote. In fact, some  on their side voted against it. And now  the deficit is going to be $371 billion.  So the Senator is absolutely correct.  We didn’t vote for their so-called deficit reduction plan that didn’t reduce  the deficit; it increased the deficit. And  we are not going to vote for this plan  that runs up the debt $600 billion a year  each and every year  for the next 5  years, taking us to a debt of $11.8 trillion before the baby boomers ever retire. So that is the difference between  the parties.  In terms of economic performance, I  say to my colleague, he says that the  productivity numbers are a result of  the Tax Code. I don’t think so. I think  the productivity numbers are the result of the hard work of the American  people, the ingenuity of the American  people, not as a result of the Tax Code.  The productivity numbers were going  up dramatically when we had the previous Tax Code. So the notion that the  Tax Code is the reason for the productivity gains is just imaginary.  If we want to talk about economic  performance, in the Clinton administration we got twice as much increase  in real average hourly earnings. We got  50 percent more increase in real disposable personal income. And we got 10  times as much job creation. That is  with the previous Tax Code.  So it is not the Tax Code that is producing those results.  It  is the hard  work and ingenuity of the American  people.  ",2006

457,114,2006-03-15,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Madam President, I rise to talk about an amendment Senator BYRDand I are offering  to adequately fund Amtrak. I understand there is an alternative that has  been offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania which, very frankly, I think  amounts to an empty gesture. It is an  amendment that looks as though it has  funding for the continuation of Amtrak’s operations but in fact it doesn’t  because  it doesn’t have a source of  funding that has any reliability to it.  The bottom line is if we want to fund  Amtrak, if we want to keep it going, a  vote has to be made for the Byrd-Lautenberg amendment.  President Bush proposed to initially  bankrupt Amtrak in last year’s budget.  The American people and the Democrats  and Republicans  in  Congress  stood up and said no. So this year, instead of trying to kill Amtrak outright, President Bush wants to put it  on a starvation diet.  This is no time for us to be looking  at trying to kill Amtrak because Amtrak in many cases is our only alternative to the crowded skies, to the  crowded highways, to be able to move  people in the event of emergencies, and  as a way to get to work and take care  of people’s needs. Amtrak and transit  in general offers one of the few options.  When we look back at what happened  on 9/11, the only transit transportation  facility that was available on that terrible  day was Amtrak. We  never  thought it could happen, but we shut  down aviation completely. Here we are,  and some of our friends on the other  side of the aisle think that eliminating  Amtrak might be a good idea.  What was proposed by our colleague  from Pennsylvania, the junior Senator,  was  that we  find a  funding  source  somewhere in magic land. The money  is not there. It is something called 920,  which is to hide behind the facts and  not tell the truth. But when I look at  what  is happening  in  the State of  Pennsylvania  in terms of Amtrak, I  frankly cannot  figure out what the  mission is here. Pennsylvania has over  4.9 million riders a year on Amtrak.  It is not just Philadelphia and New  York; it is not just Philadelphia and  Washington; it is places such as Harrisburg and other communities within the  State  of Pennsylvania  that  require  service. Instead, what they are getting  here today is a sleight of hand, saying,  Well, we want to put more money in  Amtrak, more money than has been  proposed in the budget by some $500  million. The fact is there is no money  there. There is a colloquialism that has  developed  in  America  which  says  ‘‘show me the money.’’ There  is no  ‘‘show’’ and there is no ‘‘dough.’’ That  is where we are.  Our  amendment  accounts  for  the  funding necessary by taking it from  corporate loopholes and tax shelters.  I hope people here will understand  how valuable Amtrak is to our country, how necessary it is, and vote for  the Byrd-Lautenberg amendment and  not the alternative that has been proposed.

461,114,2006-03-15,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, the  Senate is about to vote on the Murray  amendment which is the only amendment before this Senate that will restore actual dollars to the $1 billion  cut to the Community Development  Block Grant Program. We will see another amendment that is paid for by a  920 account that is now $10.5 billion in  the hole—not real money.  When our Committee on Appropriations gets that next fall, all of the Senators will be asking: Why are we cutting CDBG? We did not put real money  in to restore that cut, unless we pass  the Murray amendment that is paid for  by closing tax loopholes.  Real dollars are the difference between this and next fall when our Senators are asking us about CDBG money  and why it is being cut. We will relate  it directly back to this vote on this  amendment.  Let everyone know where the real  vote is. If no one believes me, read the  Wall Street Journal article,  ‘‘Republican Budget Plan Advances as Challenges By Democrats Fail,’’ outlining  that Republicans in tighter reelection  races are offering amendments that are  not paid for.  I ask unanimous consent to have this  article printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 15, 2006]  REPUBLICANBUDGETPLANADVANCESAS  CHALLENGESBYDEMOCRATSFAIL  (By David Rogers)  WASHINGTON—A Republican  budget  plan  advanced  in the Senate, after Democrats  narrowly  failed to  lift proposed spending  caps and  impose tighter antideficit rules  that would make it harder to extend expiring  tax cuts.  Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd  Gregg (R., N.H.) predicted passage of the resolution this week. But a succession of 50–50  roll-call votes underscored the fragile support for the plan, which projects higher deficits than the White House’s budget for the  fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.  Adding to the tension  is that senators  must temporarily set aside the resolution  today to address a companion bill that would  raise the nation’s debt ceiling by $781 billion.  The new $8.965 trillion ceiling represents an  estimated 50% increase since Mr. Bush took  office, and Sen. Kent Conrad (D., N.D.) complained that the nation’s debt is rising like a  ‘‘scalded cat.’’  Meanwhile, top House Republicans reached  agreement last evening on a set of lobbying  and ethics-rules changes in response to recent scandals. Elements include a moratorium on privately funded trips for the remainder of this Congress, a ban on lobbyists  accompanying lawmakers on corporate aircraft, and improved audits of disclosure reports filed by lobbyists.  ‘‘I think we have a good package here,’’  said House Rules  Committee  Chairman  David Dreier  (R., Cal.). Majority Leader  John Boehner (R., Ohio) hopes to begin moving major pieces—such as the travel moratorium—through the House early next month.  In the budget debate, Republicans admit  they are more cautious this election year in  trying to use the budget process to effect  change in spending or tax policy. Mr. Gregg  has largely abandoned any attempt to use  his power to order Senate committees to  come up with savings to slow the growth of  government benefits like Medicare. And the  five-year savings from such programs in his  resolution is a fraction of the $39 billion deficit-reduction bill signed by the president  last month.  This leaves the proposed $872.5 billion cap  on discretionary appropriations as a  last  symbol of fiscal discipline, and Republicans  have clung to the provisions for fear of opening the door to unchecked spending.  Mr. Gregg would transfer more money to  health and education programs to win support from moderate Republicans. But domestic cuts would be required, and by the chairman’s account, his adjustments are largely  ‘‘illusory.’’  Republicans in tight re-election races are  offering amendments endorsing more spending for causes such as veterans health care  and education for the disabled, but these are  for show since no money has been added  above the cap. For example, $3 billion was restored for defense by Sen. James Talent (R.,  Mo.) who said the ‘‘highly skilled people’’ in  today’s military result in higher personnel  costs.  ‘‘There’s no such thing as a grunt anymore  in America’s military.’’ Mr. Talent said. The  most serious challenge came from Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) who proposed to  raise the cap by $6.3 billion to make room for  education priorities. But he failed 50–50 for  lack of support from Sen. Arlen Specter (R.,  Pa.), who is pursuing a less-direct challenge  to his leadership.  Mr. Specter is proposing that lawmakers  get around the $872.5 billion ceiling by allowing an extra $7 billion in ‘‘advanced appropriations,’’ a category of spending often used  to fund education programs ahead of a school  year. Mr. Conrad appeared cool to this approach, but if Mr. Specter could win over  supporters of Mr. Kennedy’s amendment, he  could prevail in a roll-call vote today.  * * * crucial to the nation’s competitiveness.  They are also vital to U.S. defense industries, with many of the most-advanced components and electronics made at newer facilities.  Economists point to growing import competition and an exodus of U.S. production  work to low-cost countries as reasons for the  birthrate slump. One indication is the ballooning U.S. trade deficit, which hit another  record in January.  La-Z-Boy Inc., Monroe, Mich., a maker of  recliners and other furniture, felt the imports’ bite in 2001, when inexpensive wooden  furniture from China began pouring into the  U.S. market.  In  response,  the  company  closed 20 U.S. factories and outsourced most  of  its own wood-furniture production  to  China.  To be sure, some manufacturers are adding  bricks and mortar.

The opposite is true.  This legislation requires negotiation.  That is what the plans are doing all the  time to drive down the price of drugs—  what it does to drive down the price of  the  premium way  below what we  thought it would be. Again, everything  is backward when they talk about this.  In the real world, there are choices.  Wherever you want to go for any consumer products, those stores negotiate  prices to get good prices. It is just a  way to get the job done. Statistics that  have come in on this show that competition is driving down the price of  drugs—the 25 leading drugs—by 35 percent on average this ought to show  that this process is working.  ",2006

I commend him for his leadership.  I rise today to express grave concern  about this historic increase that is before us  in America’s national debt.  Today, we owe $8,270,260,017,805.93, and  counting, on the national debt. That is  a long string of debt that isn’t going to  go away—over $8.2 trillion. In fact, it  continues to grow. Just last month, we  paid $21 billion in interest alone. Earlier today, I offered an amendment for  $5 billion to make sure that the radios  in this country are connected, interoperable, so they can communicate in  case of a terrorist attack or a national  disaster or other emergency. This was  turned down by the body as being too  much.  Yet we spent $21 billion last month in  interest alone on the national debt.  The legislation before us allows this  administration to continue to rack up  another $800 billion on the Nation’s  credit card. That means we are allowing the debt to exceed $8.9 trillion.  That is unbelievable. That is trillion  with a capital ‘‘T.’’  Tragically, 5 years ago, we were sitting on top of the largest surplus in the  Nation’s history. The year I came into  the Senate as a member of the Budget  Committee, we were debating what to  do with the largest surplus in the Nation’s history,  $5.6  trillion. At  that  time, the Senator from North Dakota  suggested—and I supported it—a strategy that would divide that surplus into  thirds: one-third for strategic tax cuts  in order to grow the economy; one-  third for investment in our people, education, health care, science, research,  law enforcement, those kinds of things;  and one-third to go to paying down the  liability we know is coming with Social Security.

487,135,2006-03-15,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  (Purpose: To require a study of debt held by  foreigners)  At the end of the joint resolution, insert  the following:  ‘‘Sec. l STUDY.—(a) The Secretary of the  Treasury, in consultation with the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System  and other appropriate agencies of the United  States Government, shall conduct a study to  examine the economic effects of the holding  of United States’ publicly-held debt by foreign governments,  foreign  central banks,  other foreign institutions, and foreign individuals.  (b) The Secretary  shall  transmit  that  study to the Congress within 180 days of the  date of enactment of this legislation.  (c) The study shall provide an analysis of:  ‘‘(1) for each year from 1980 to the present,  the amount and term of foreign-owned debt  held by the public, broken down by foreign  governments,  foreign central banks, other  foreign institutions, and foreign individuals,  in the  and expressed in nominal terms and as a percentage of the total amount of publicly-held  debt in each year;  ‘‘(2)  the economic effects  that  the  increased foreign ownership of United States’  publicly-held debt has on  ‘‘(A) long-term interest rates in the United  States,  ‘‘(B) global average interest rates,  ‘‘(C) the value of the United States dollar,  ‘‘(D) United States capital market liquidity,  ‘‘(E) the cost of private capital  United States,  ‘‘(F) the generation of employment in the  United States through foreign affiliates, and  ‘‘(G) the growth  in real gross domestic  product of the United States;  ‘‘(3) (A) for each year from 1980 to the  present, the effect of foreign debt on the  United States income account,  ‘‘(B) the predicted effect over the next 20  years, and  ‘‘(C) the effect of the deteriorating income  account on the overall United States current  account deficit;‘‘(4) the ability of the Department of the Treasury to track purchases of  publicly held debt in secondary and tertiary  markets, or, if this ability does not exist, the  implications of that inability for fiscal policy, monetary policy, and the predictability  of capital markets;  ‘‘(5) the effect that foreign ownership of  United States’ publicly-held debt has or  could have on United States trade policy:  ‘‘(6) whether the  level of United States  debt owned by China may adversely affect  the ability of the United States to negotiate  with China regarding currency manipulation  by China;  ‘‘(7) the effect of the increase of foreign  holdings of United States debt held by the  public on national security; and  ‘‘(8) the implicit tax burden that results  from foreign ownership of United States debt  held by the public, defined as the per capita  amount that a United States Federal income  taxpayer would pay in annual Federal income taxes to fully service such foreign debt  during each of  fiscal years  2006  through  2010.’’  ",2006
488,135,2006-03-15,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President,  this  amendment is quite simple. It directs  the Treasury Department to study and  report on the increase of foreign holdings of U.S. debt and what the consequences of that debt are for America.  We all know that debts can add up. We  all know that paying  just the minimum payment on a credit card balance leads to years of payments and a  much larger total of payments in the  end. Most American  families know  that.  As a result, we urge and sometimes  require credit card companies and car  companies  to disclose  to  customers  how  long they will be paying those  minimum payments. We require them  to say how much the full balance will  be when the consumer has paid off the  loan. It is pretty basic stuff.  This amendment is a lot like that.  This amendment asks the Treasury Department to spell out the implications  of our debt to foreigners. This amendment asks the Treasury to investigate  what the full cost will be in higher interest rates, in the value of a dollar, in  lower  economic growth,  in  lessened  power to negotiate trade agreements,  and  in diminished national security.  We should let taxpayers know—that is  our employers,  the people we work  for—how big the payment really  is.  This amendment will help get the answers.  The Treasury is authorized to issue  debt totaling a little more than $8 trillion. Last year’s budget resolution generated an increase of $781 billion more,  and that has led to the joint resolution  before us today. This will be the fourth  largest debt limit increase in our Nation’s history.  So the question needs to be asked:  Who is loaning us this money? Some of  it is internal, like borrowing from Social Security. Much of it is borrowed  from American citizens and businesses.  Now there is also an especially worrisome trend, a trend worrisome not only  to me and my constituents in the State  of Montana but also taxpayers across  the country. That  is the amount of  U.S. Treasury bonds held by foreigners.  Five years ago, foreigners held about  $1.1 trillion. Today that number has  doubled to $2.2 trillion. Japan holds  about two-thirds of a trillion dollars;  China holds a quarter of a trillion dollars. So the questions that inevitably  follow are, first, how long can we continue to borrow more money? Second,  what are the implications to our foreign policy as foreigners increase their  holdings of U.S. debt? And, third, what  share of America’s taxes are being used  just to pay interest on debt?  These are  some of  the  issues we  should debate today. These are some of  the issues addressed in my amendment.  Every business has  limits on  the  amount it can borrow. Banks say to  businesses: Sorry, this  is your  loan  limit. Financial institutions limit the  amount that any individual or family  may borrow. Every credit card has a  maximum balance.  As a business or a family increases  its debt, lending institutions begin to  monitor the situation. Creditors even  increase the interest rate charged on  the debt.  At some point, America will face this  economic reality. We cannot continue  to accelerate our borrowing and ignore  the consequences of increasing foreign  held debt.  As one conservative economist put it  last  year  in  the National Review:  ‘‘Growing nervousness in the bond market may be signaling an end to the free  lunch Americans have enjoyed for the  last 3 years, in which time foreigners  have essentially  financed our budget  deficit.’’  Indeed, we cannot count on that free  lunch forever.  So I am offering a simple amendment. It directs the Treasury Department to coordinate with appropriate  Government agencies to study and report on the increase of foreign holdings  of U.S. debt. The amendment asks  Treasury to study any associated national  security  implications.  The  amendment also asks the Treasury Department to assess how this increase in  foreign investment of our federal debt  affects our trade policy.

489,142,2006-03-15,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to express my sincere sympathy  and deep concern for those affected by  the collapse of the Kaloko Reservoir on  the island of Kaua’i in Hawaii. This  tragic flooding has caused loss of life  and substantial property damage. The  people of Hawaii have shown exceptional resolve in assisting their fellow  citizens as emergency personnel and  other volunteers have rushed to provide assistance to people in need. We  continue to pray for those who are still  missing and for those who are working  tirelessly in search and rescue efforts  and in additional emergency response.  As many of you know, several islands  in my home State have been inundated  by severe rainstorms over the past few  weeks. Flooding has caused substantial  disruptions of life as schools and business have been  forced  to close and  many roads have been damaged or have  been washed out because of high water.  Property damage in cities and in rural  areas has been severe.  Hawaii’s Governor Lingle has called  upon the National Guard and many  State agencies to assist those who have  suffered losses and to respond to immediate  needs. However,  the  damage  caused by this flooding demonstrates  the need to prepare in advance for adverse conditions and to be vigilant in  examining vulnerable areas.  I stand ready to offer any assistance  to the State of Hawaii that I can, including  securing  emergency Federal  funding for the State.  Throughout this adversity, the people of Hawaii have shown the resolve  that they are known for in times of crisis. I am proud of my constituents as  they help their neighbors and work to  restore conditions around their homes,  schools, businesses, and places of worship.  I know that their efforts will  bring comfort and solace to those in  need.  ADDITIONAL STATEMENT  MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT MAXCY  ∑",2006
490,142,2006-03-15,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to honor  the  life  of Robert  Maxcy of Waldoboro, ME, who passed  away this weekend at the age of 76. Bob  served 56 years in the Waldoboro Fire  Department, including the last 42 years  as its chief, and I would like to recognize his  lifelong devotion  to public  safety.  Chief Bob Maxcy was born on November 17, 1929, in Thomaston, ME, the son  of the late Earl and Ruth Maxcy. At  age 14 he began his service as a firefighter at the Thomaston Junior Fire  Department. This was the beginning of  his outstanding career  in service to  both Maine and the Nation.  Upon his graduation from Thomaston  High School, Chief Maxcy served honorably with the U.S. Air Force from  1947 to 1950. During his service, Chief  Maxcy attained the rank of gunnery  sergeant.  When he returned to Maine in 1950,  Chief Maxcy became a firefighter with  the Waldoboro Fire Department.  In  that same year, he married his loving  and devoted wife, Muriel. By 1964, Chief  Maxcy had established himself as a  leader in the department and was appointed chief of the Waldoboro Fire Department, a position in which he served  for 42 years.  Beyond his dedication to his department, Chief Maxcy also was a leader in  the community and the State, as evidenced through his participation in the  Waldoboro  Firemen’s  Association,  Knox County Firemen’s Association,  Maine  State  Federation  of  Firefighters, and the Lincoln County Fire  Chiefs.  Chief Maxcy was truly an honorable  Maine man. In addition to his success  as a community leader and firefighter,  he will be remembered for his love of  his family, the outdoors, and the Red  Sox. Chief Maxcy is survived by five  children, Deborah, Marcia, Marc, Dee,  and Daryl; his brother, Harlan; his sister, Marilyn; his grandchildren, great  grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.  Chief Bob Maxcy will be greatly  missed. I offer my sincere condolences  and prayers to Chief Maxcy’s family.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his  secretaries.

491,170,2006-03-15,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor and recognition of Norbert Magalski of  Parma, Ohio, a noble Good Samaritan and  Gulf War veteran who has  lent a hand  to  many.  Mr. Magalski, as a trained emergency medical  technician and  tow  truck operator has  helped  countless people on  the  roadside.  Even  in an age when people are  too overwhelmed with  their own priorities  to  lend a  helping hand to strangers, he has made it a  common practice in his life to help those who  are in need of assistance on the road.  Mr. Magalski was injured last Thursday by a  suspected drunk driver while helping a young  woman who had veered off I–76 and into a  guardrail. He suffered broken bones in his left  leg, left shoulder and face. It will be several  months before he fully recovers.  This man  is  truly one  to be honored and  emulated as he remains committed to lending  a helping hand when needed. He is a modest  and kind-hearted citizen who in spite of injury  will continue  to help strangers  in need. His  kindness and generosity is something that is  not often seen in today’s society. My thoughts  and prayers are with him and his family for his  quick recovery.  Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me  in honor and recognition of Norbert Magalski,  whose dedication and courage  in  lending a  hand to his fellow citizens has helped save the  lives of many.  f  A TRIBUTE TO HELEN HANCOCK  HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
492,170,2006-03-15,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor Ms. Helen Hancock, of Alhambra, California. Each year in March, in recognition of  Women’s History Month, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by  our nation’s women.  Helen Hancock was born in Indiana in 1922.  She attended Nursing School at Case Western Reserve University  in Ohio as well as  Redlands University in California. After completing her schooling, she served 2 years in  the Army Nurse Corps during World War II.  Ms. Hancock moved to California in 1953 and  began working at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. In 1959, she moved to Alhambra, California.  Less  than a year after her  retirement  in  1988 from a 35-year career in nursing administration at Huntington Hospital, and 8 years  as a Member of the State Board of Registered  Nursing, Helen Hancock plunged into community volunteer work. Since then she has used  her  extensive  nursing  and  administrative  knowledge and skills to make a significant difference in the health and well being of countless seniors and their families.  As a senior herself, Ms. Hancock desired to  help other senior citizens enjoy  their  retirement years and began volunteering at Huntington Senior Care Network (HSCN); a Huntington Hospital  community-based  program  that helps seniors maintain  their  independence. Her interview skills have added to the  success of a National Council on Aging project  of HSCN to enhance the health of frail seniors  through increased physical activity. Helen has  been a tireless advocate for seniors as a long-  term care ombudsman for the Department of  Aging for nearly 15 years. For nearly 25 years,  she has been a resource for caregivers of Alzheimer’s patients at a weekly support group,  and she continues to promote Alzheimer’s disease education, as well as senior services and  elder abuse education, through membership in  several community coalitions.  Helen  is a  faith community nurse coordinator for All Souls Catholic Church, as part of  a program sponsored by Methodist Hospital of  Southern California and All Souls Catholic  Church, to improve the health of the community. She and her team conduct events that include blood pressure screenings, blood donor  drives and health education presentations to  reach members of their parish.  Last year, Helen was among 26 older adults  honored as Outstanding California Senior Volunteer leaders by the University of California  Berkeley School of Public Health.  I ask all Members of Congress to join me  today  in honoring a  remarkable woman of  California’s 29th Congressional District, Helen  Hancock.  f  HONORING RONALD HUDSON  HON. RON LEWIS  OFKENTUCKY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
493,170,2006-03-15,Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to pay tribute to the life of a remarkable  citizen from my congressional district. Ronald  Hudson, a  longtime  resident of Leitchfield,  Kentucky, passed away February 20th at age  65. Mr. Hudson was a colorful and widely respected  figure  in Grayson County, having  served on the Leitchfield Fire Department for  46 years, 31 of those as Chief.  In a  recent  feature story  in  the Grayson  County News-Gazette, Chief Hudson  described himself as  ‘‘not a poster boy  firefighter’’ when he first joined the department in  1959. With typical self deprecating humor, he  described himself as ‘‘too short and too skinny, with trouble taking anything serious for any  length of  time.’’ He credited  the  late Murrell  Conklin, then Chief Emeritus of the Leitchfield  Department for coaching him through his first  few years, helping to mold him into a serious  firefighter and public servant.  Ronald Hudson was named Chief after only  12 years of service on  the department. As  Chief, he was  responsible  for  training and  managing a diverse crew of firefighters, purchasing and maintaining  fire apparatus, and  perpetually pursuing sources of  funding  to  keep  the department running. Chief Hudson  was personally responsible for countless acts  of heroism throughout his four decades as a  firefighter. Yet he always humbled himself with  the tough reality of all emergency personnel:  You can go from hero to zero and back again  in a matter of seconds.  Chief Hudson’s contributions to his community, staring down danger time and time again  to save lives and protect the safety and comfort of his neighbors, has made Leitchfield a  fine place to live for many years. Ronald Hudson’s life, career, and especially his final years  fighting against his own declining health, was  the true epitome of courage and generosity of  spirit.  In addition to his position on the Fire Department, Chief Hudson also served as Grayson County Coroner and was a member of the  American Legion Post 81, the Leitchfield Masonic Lodge, and the Fraternal Order of Police. He was a veteran of the U.S. Army and  owned and operated a small business  from  1983 to 2002.  Ronald Hudson’s distinguished life of service to his community and his country, along  with his unwavering dedication  to his  family  and  fellow  firefighters,  is a portrait of outstanding citizenship worthy of our collective respect and appreciation. It is my great privilege  to honor his memory today before the entire  United States House of Representatives.  f  THE  FEDERAL  JUDGESHIP  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE  EFFICIENCY  ACT OF 2005  HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON  OFIDAHO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
494,170,2006-03-15,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. Speaker, article III of the  Constitution states that ‘‘the judicial Power of  the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as  the Congress may  from  time  to  time ordain  and establish.’’ At times in our Nation’s history, Congress has found it necessary to realign the United States Courts of Appeals into  more efficient and manageable circuits. Once  again, it’s time for Congress to exercise its article III powers by realigning the Ninth Circuit  and creating a new Twelfth Circuit.  I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of  Judiciary Chairman SENSENBRENNER’s H.R.  4093, the Federal Judgeship and Administrative Efficiency Act of 2005. In addition to creating additional federal judgeships, this legislation would divide the Ninth into two circuits.  These would consist of a new Ninth made up  of California, Hawaii, Guam and the Northern  Marianas, and a new Twelfth with Alaska,  Washington, Oregon, Montana,  Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona.  Mr. Speaker,  this division makes sense.  Putting aside any political, historical or emotional  arguments,  the  numbers  speak  for  themselves. A split of the Ninth Circuit is necessary because it has become disproportionately  large and unwieldy  in  relation  to  the  other eleven regional circuits.  The Honorable John M. Roll, U.S. District  Judge for Arizona, has recently provided me  with updated statistics regarding the Ninth Circuit. This  is where  the Ninth Circuit stands  today:  The population of the Ninth Circuit is 58 million people. This is one-fifth of the population  of the United States. It is also 27 million more  people than reside in the next largest circuit.  The Ninth Circuit consists of 9 states (including the most populous state), a territory,  and a commonwealth. The other circuits average less than four states. No other circuit decides the law for 9 states.

495,177,2006-03-15,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  express my deep concern at reports of the apparent harmful  impact of  the marketing of  high-cost  refund-anticipation  loans, RALs,  to  underserved communities.  While RALs are advertised as giving consumers quicker access  to  their hard-earned  tax refund, it has been brought to my attention  that  tax refunds can be obtained almost as  fast by the taxpayer to whom the refund is due  as if taxpayers file online. It appears that not  only are refunds not delivered with any greater  expediency, but with interest rates between 40  to 700 percent and additional  fees,  these  loans are so excessively priced that they deny  the taxpayer full use of their money.  This issue is of particular interest to me as  some of my constituents seem to be feeling  the brunt of these loans, I have recently been  informed that one of the highest concentration  of refund loans in 2003 was made within the  15th Congressional District in my home community, central Harlem. Also as the Ranking  Member of the Ways and Means Committee,  I am concerned because according to a recent  study undertaken by  the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, one  quarter of New Yorkers who  claimed  the  Earned Income Tax Credit in 2003 paid large  amounts of  their wages  in  fees  related  to  RALs.  Low-income families need not be exploited  for the gains of corporate entities. According  to  the  IRS, 79 percent of RAL recipients  in  2003 had incomes of $35,000 or less. In contrast, as  the nation’s  largest  tax-preparation  chain, H&R Block experienced an 8.5 percent  increase in RAL revenue for Fiscal Year 2003.  While RALs are one of H&R Block’s products,  I expect the company to practice due diligence  not only in promoting these products equally  among your many locations but also in informing clients of their rights and product terms.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you during this tax season to lend your support in holding H&R Block  and other  tax-preparing companies  responsible to equitable targeting of these high-cost  loans and full disclosure of their terms.  f  TRIBUTE TO HARRY BROWNE  HON. RON PAUL  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
496,177,2006-03-15,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Speaker, America  lost a  great champion of liberty when Harry Browne  passed away on March 1, at the age of 72.  Harry had a passion for liberty and knowledge  of a wide variety of subjects. His communication style, as he himself so marvelously put it,  focused on converting his opponents  rather  than winning  the argument. These attributes  helped make him one of  the most effective  proponents of the freedom philosophy I have  had the privilege of knowing. Harry’s numerous books and columns, his radio and Internet  broadcasts, and his speeches educated millions in sound economics and the benefits of  a free society. Harry motivated many people  to become activists  in  the movement  to restore American liberties.  Harry  first came  to public attention  in  the  1970 when he penned a best-selling  investment book, How You Can Profit From  the  Coming Devaluation, which foresaw President  Richard Nixon’s abandonment of  the gold  standard and the ways the American economy  would be damaged by the inevitable resulting  inflation. Harry’s book helped many Americans  survive, and even profit, during the economic  troubles of  the seventies.  It also  introduced  millions of people to the insights developed by  followers of the Austrian school of economics  regarding the dangers fiat currency poses to  both prosperity and liberty posed by fiat. How  You Can Profit From the Coming Devaluation  is generally recognized as the founding document of  the hard money movement, which  combined the insights of the Austrian economists with a practical investment strategy.  Harry’s  third book, You Can Profit  from a  Monetary Crisis, reached number one on the  New York Times bestseller list. Other popular  books by Harry include How I Found Freedom  in an Unfree World, The Great Libertarian  Offer, and Why Government Doesn’t Work. I  was pleased to write the foreword for one of  Harry’s  books,  Liberty  A–Z:  Libertarian  Soundbites You Can Use Right Now, a collection of direct, thought-provoking, and often humorous responses to the questions advocates  of the freedom philosophy face.  During  the nineties, Harry worked  to advance liberty as a presidential candidate, columnist, radio  talk-show host, and columnist.  He also hosted an  internet-based  talk show  and founded DownsizeDC, a grassroots advocacy  group  whose  goals  are  accurately  summed up in its title. Even while struggling  with Lou Gehrig’s disease, Harry maintained a  full schedule of writing, hosting his radio show,  and speaking around the country.  Harry’s efforts were not limited to the economic realm. He understood the threat to liberty and prosperity posed by global crusades  for democracy, as well as the importance of  opposing restrictions on civil liberties. Harry’s  outspoken defense of civil  liberties and  the  Framers’ foreign policy of nonintervention took  on added importance in the last years of his  life when  too many self-styled advocates of  liberty attempted to curry favor with the political establishment by focusing solely on issues  of economic liberty or combined advocacy of  low taxes and regulations with active support  for militarism and restrictions on personal liberty.  In all his educational, financial, and political  work Harry served as a model for everyone  who works for the free society. Harry was principled and uncompromising in message, while  temperate and respectful of differing opinions  in delivery. He avoided  the histrionics  too  common in our today’s talk show culture, and  he never personalized his arguments. Even  when an opponent resorted to ad hominem attacks, Harry always kept his presentation on  the high ground of  ideas and principles.  In  conclusion, Mr. Speaker,  I extend my sympathy  to Harry Browne’s wife, Pamela, and  daughter Auburn, as well as the many he befriend in his years in the freedom movement,  and I pay tribute to Harry Browne for his lifelong efforts on behalf of individual liberty.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN BURN  ASSOCIATION  HON. PHIL ENGLISH  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
497,177,2006-03-15,Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues  the  immense  contributions by  the  American Burn Association, ABA, to the fields  of burn treatment, education and prevention.  Whether caused by accidents, natural disasters or potential terrorist attacks, the ABA has  been  integral  in shaping  the discussion on  how this nation’s burn centers should manage  burn injuries. In all cases, the American Burn  Association stands ready as the critical initial  line of first responders. They need our support.  The ABA has more than 3,500 members in  the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia and Latin  America. All of the members of the association  are burn care specialists. They include physicians, surgeons, nurses, occupation and physical  therapists,  researchers, social workers,  firefighters, emergency  response personnel,  and  the underpinning of burn  research and  care—hospitals with highly specialized burn  centers.  As an organization, the ABA sets the industry standards for quality care for both civilian  and military treatment of burn injuries. Its research into advanced treatment for burn injuries is the foundation for the high quality of  care available to our wounded soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq.

498,184,2006-03-15,Mr. MCINTYRE.," Mr. Speaker,  I am very  pleased that the House is considering H. Con.  Res. 190 today, that urges the Russian Federation to protect fully the freedoms of all religious communities without distinction, whether  registered and unregistered, as stipulated by  the Russian Constitution  and  international  standards. As stated  in  the  resolution,  the  United  States  throughout  its  history  has  sought to protect the fundamental and inalienable human right  to seek, know, and serve  God according  to  the dictates of one’s own  conscience.  I  completely agree. The  ‘‘first  right’’ of religious freedom must be respected,  and so this resolution is of critical importance.  The Russian Federation is an OSCE participating State and has freely committed to protect this right, so that all may freely profess  and practice the religion or belief, either alone  or in community with others. Russia has promised to do this through numerous OSCE documents, but also in its own constitution. Article  28 of the Russian constitution declares ‘‘everyone shall be guaranteed the right to freedom  of conscience, to freedom of religious worship,  including  the right  to profess,  individually or  jointly with others, any religion.’’  Unfortunately, this fundamental right is not  always observed, especially  for groups  that  are not registered with  the government. For  groups denied registration, who have had their  registration stripped, or refuse registration on  religious  grounds,  the  lack  of  registration  means  they experience significant difficulties  in enjoying their religious liberties. Registration  is critical  for  religious groups  to enjoy  fully  their religious freedoms, as many rights and  privileges afforded  to  religious communities  are contingent on obtaining registration.  In addition to discrimination by local authorities,  in  the  last  two years  there have been  more than ten arson attacks estimated on unregistered Protestant churches. At a Helsinki  Commission hearing that I attended last year  on  problems  facing  unregistered  religious  groups in Russia, I was troubled to learn of  the lack of effective action by law enforcement  to bring the criminals to justice. The perpetrators  of  these  hateful  acts  have  gone  unpunished, with police and other officials  turning a blind eye. In the worst cases, law  enforcement personnel have actually been the  persecutors,  carrying  out  violent  actions  against individuals from unregistered communities who are only wishing to practice peacefully their faith.  In closing, the Russian Federation is urged  to do more, to ensure that all may fully enjoy  their religious liberties. I therefore urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 190.  f  A TRIBUTE TO DR. MANANA  PETROV  HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
499,184,2006-03-15,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  recognition of Dr. Manana Petrov, a distinguished member of the Brooklyn community. I  am honored to pay tribute to this outstanding  leader and I hope my colleagues will join me  in  recognizing  her  impressive  accomplishments.  Dr. Manana Petrov was born in the former  Soviet Union during  the height of  the Cold  War. Upon graduation  from high school, Dr.  Petrov enrolled  in Rostov Medical  Institute.  When Dr. Petrov’s family was forced to move  to the Georgia Republic, she transferred and  graduated from the Tbilisi Medical Institute. Dr.  Petrov worked as a physician  in  the  former  Soviet Union until she, her husband and her  daughter  immigrated  to  the United States.  Driven by the need to put food on the table,  Dr. Petrov passed all of her medical exams  within a year of immigrating to the U.S. Following the completion of her medical exams,  Dr. Petrov began her residency at the Brooklyn Hospital working tirelessly to support her  family.  In 1997, Dr. Petrov successfully passed her  licensing exam and is currently Double-Board  Certified in Internal Medicine and Hospice and  Palliative Care. She has been serving as the  attending physician at Brooklyn Hospital  for  the last 9 years. During her time at Brooklyn  Hospital, Dr. Petrov has served as an outstanding role model for aspiring doctors and  was nominated as the ‘‘Best Teaching Attending.’’ Additionally, in 2000, she was appointed  Medical Director of Hospice of New York and  in 2003, she was named  the Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine at  the Brooklyn  Hospice Center. Also  in 2003, Dr. Petrov  opened her own practice in Brooklyn, NY and  is faithfully serving her patients to this day. Dr.  Petrov has also worked for the last 5 years as  an Associate Program Director in an Internal  Medicine Program and boasts two publications  in medical journals.  Dr. Manana Petrov is an inspiration to not  only  those  in  the medical profession, but  to  our entire community. She has overcome numerous obstacles to realize her dream of becoming a doctor. Dr. Manana Petrov encompasses the true identity of a role model in today’s society and for that I ask that we applaud her accomplishments and contribution to  our community.

LINCOLN DAVIS  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 15, 2006  ",2006
500,184,2006-03-15,Mr. DAVIS of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to pay my  respects  to Corporal  Brian J. Schoff for his service to a grateful nation. Corporal Schoff may have given his life  in defense of his country, but his soul and  spirit will live on to the many who knew him.  During a  funeral procession  in Manchester,  Tennessee hundreds of people stood outside  their homes and along the road to honor their  fallen soldier.  Corporal Schoff, a member of 2nd Battalion,  506th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat  Team, 101st Airborne Division, was awarded a  posthumous  promotion  from  Private  First  Class to Corporal, a Purple Heart, the Bronze  Star, and Good Conduct Medal for his service.  While I didn’t know Corporal Schoff personally, I do know the quality of our soldiers serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the globe.  They are caring, patriotic, God-fearing men  and women. I wish to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Brian Schoff for his selfless sacrifice. May he live on in eternal happiness with  his Lord in heaven.  Corporal Schoff  is survived by his  father,  Brian L. Schoff; his mother, Cathy Odle; his  stepfather, Kenneth Odle; stepsisters, Alicia  Burgess  and  LaDawn Mauk;  stepmother,  Debra Schoff; and his half-sister, Brianna  Schoff.  f  A TRIBUTE TO ROBIN KELLY  SHEARES  HON.

509,4,2006-03-27,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, we are  about to begin this week a very significant discussion, debate, and, hopefully,  passage of some legislation to address  what is one of the crucial public policy  issues we have as a country, which is  the question of how we handle immigration.  We are, obviously, a nation which has  been built on immigrants. Every one of  us in this country, except for Native  Americans, comes from a family that  came from somewhere else and immigrated to this country. It is a part of  our heritage of which we are most  proud, the fact we have been able to assimilate  cultures  from  around  the  world and bring them to the United  States and create America. We should  take pride in something that sets an  example for the rest of the world to  show that people can gather and can  live together and can be productive and  can produce a nation founded on democracy,  freedom,  liberty,  individual  rights, and heritage—heritage which  has built a matrix of strength for us as  a nation as we bring together peoples  from different cultures and we form an  America.  E Pluribus Unum, the line above the  Presiding Officer of the Senate, says it  so well: From many, one. We are,  therefore, a nation which needs to have  an  immigration policy which understands that, which, first and foremost,  appreciates and continues to reward  the  idea that there are people  from  around this world who wish to come to  America to participate in this country  and to make us a more productive  place in which to raise their children  and to assist us as a nation in being  stronger  economically,  socially, and  from a standpoint of inner strength we  obtain from having so many different  people participate in our country. We  always want to be that beacon, that  light upon  the hill  that draws  the  world to us. As long as people want to  come  to America, we know we are  doing something right, and we should  take great pride in it.  We continue to be a place where people want to come and, as a result, we  do have issues of how we deal with immigration. But most importantly, as  we move down this road, we have to  recognize it is critical that we not do  anything which tarnishes or chills or  in any way undermines that great tradition of America, which is that we  reach out our arms to people who wish  to come here and be productive and  participate in our way of life.  However, unfortunately, over the last  few decades, and especially in an accelerated way as we moved through the  nineties and moved into this first decade of 2000, we have seen that a large  number of people are coming into our  Nation  illegally. They are not  following the course which is available to  become an American citizen legally—  to immigrate here, to take advantage  of our system, and to build on the opportunities that are here but to do it  legally. That has become a problem for  us. It is a problem, obviously, from the  standpoint that it violates our laws. It  is also a problem for us in the post-9/11  world where we need to know who is  coming into this Nation because of the  threat of terrorist acts against us.  For the most part, these people who  come to our country have come here  for purposes which are good and decent. They want to have a better life.  They want to be able to earn a better  living. They want to be able to give  their families more than they had in  the nation they left. That is a well-intentioned purpose. But they have still  come here illegally, and we need to address the issue of how we deal with  that situation.  This question has been divided into  basically two functions. First is how  we physically control the borders of  our Nation and make sure those borders are reasonably secure so that we  have a decent idea of who is coming  across those borders and why they are  coming into our Nation.  The second question is how we deal  with people who have come here to  work, to perform tasks which are available to them, people who may already  be here illegally, but people who still  want to come here and do it in a way  that is within the law. And that, of  course,  involves  the  debate  over  a  guest worker program.  On the first issue, I have had a fair  amount of interest and involvement because I chair the subcommittee that  has jurisdiction over this question, the  Subcommittee on Homeland Security.  The question of whether our borders  are secure is something which, since I  have taken over as chairman of this  subcommittee, has been all consuming  over the last 2 years I have had the  good  fortune  of  chairing  this  subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.  It  is pretty obvious to any  American that our borders are not secure, that we do not know who is coming in. We certainly don’t know who is  leaving. We don’t know what is coming  in, and we don’t know, to a large degree, what is going out.  But on the issue of movement of people, we are attempting to address that  question. We have over the last 2 years  significantly  increased  the  resources  going into border security. We have increased the number of Border Patrol  agents by almost 2,000. We have  increased the number of beds which are  available—what is known as detention  beds—also by a significant number. We  have increased resources flowing in to  the border security area, especially in  the area of technology capability, trying to set up a system called US–VISIT  which will allow us to effectively track  who is coming into our country on a  real-time basis through using fingerprints and our databases on  fingerprints. We have made progress, but we  are nowhere near solving the problem.  I wanted to talk briefly about that  specific  issue and  then a  little bit  about the bigger  issue of the guest  worker program and how you become  an American citizen.  As the Judiciary Committee wrestles  with this problem of border security, it  is important that we do it the right  way, that we think about it in terms of  what is going to get the best results  versus what is going to get the best  press releases.  To begin with, we do not need a wall  across our southern border. We don’t  need it from the standpoint of being  able to know who is coming across the  border, we don’t need  it  from  the  standpoint of being good neighbors,  and we do not need it from the standpoint of presenting the national culture. Doing that would be the exact opposite of what we should do as a Nation.  There may be sections, clearly, where  some sort of fencing or wall will be  necessary, sections where the commingling of the border is so close that it is  very difficult to control that section  without some sort of a definable event  which forces people who wish to come  across the border through a controlled  point, but to run a wall the length of  the border as has been suggested by  some of our colleagues, especially in  the other body, is just anathema to the  concept of what America stands for. We  want to continue to be a society which  says we are open, that we are a place  where people are encouraged to come,  and that we are a place that reaches  out to people who wish to be productive and come here to be productive  VerDate Mar 15 2010  20:22 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S27MR6.REC S27MR6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006

527,10,2006-04-03,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  (Purpose: To allow United States citizens  under 18 years of age to travel to Canada  without a passport, to develop a system to  enable United States citizens to take 24-  hour excursions to Canada without a passport, and to  limit the cost of passport  cards or similar alternatives to passports  to $20)  At the appropriate place, insert the following:  SEC. ll. TRAVEL TO CANADA.  TO PASSCANADAWITHOUT (a) SHORT TITLE.—This  section may be  cited as the  ‘‘Common Sense Cross-Border  Travel and Security Act of 2006’’.  (b) TRAVEL PORT.—Section 7209(b) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  (Public Law 108–458) is amended—  (1) in paragraph (1)—  (A) by striking ‘‘The Secretary’’ and inserting the following:  ‘‘(A) INGENERAL.—The Secretary’’;  (B) by striking ‘‘This plan’’ and inserting  the following:  ‘‘(B) DAY PASSES.—The  plan  developed  under this paragraph shall include a system  that would enable United States citizens to  travel to Canada for a 24-hour period without  a passport by completing an application for  a ‘day pass’ at any port of entry along the  land border between the United States and  Canada, and certifying that there was not  sufficient time to apply for a passport before  the excursion. The  traveler  shall not be  charged a fee to acquire or use the day pass.  ‘‘(C) IMPLEMENTATION.—The plan developed  under this paragraph’’; and  (2) by adding at the end the following:  ‘‘(3) MINORS.—United States citizens who  are less than 18 years of age, when accompanied by a parent or guardian, shall not be  required to present a passport when returning to the United States from Canada at any  port of entry along the land border.’’.  (c) LIMIT MENTS.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law or cost recovery requirement established by the Office of Management and  Budget, the Secretary and the Secretary of  State may not charge a fee in an amount  greater than $20 for any passport card or  similar document other than a passport that  is created to satisfy the requirements of the  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108–458).  TRAVEL DOCUON FEES FOR would be required for United States-  Canada cross-border traffic.  The amendment is quite simple. It  would provide, for children under 18—  that is, 17 and under—who are accompanied by parents moving cross-border,  they would not need one of these new  cross-border cards.  It would provide  that there be an opportunity for the  State Department to offer 3-day passes  for those who are simply on a 1-day  cross-border trip and would also provide that these new cards which would  be required in lieu of passports cost no  more than $20.  As you know, it takes over $90 to purchase a passport. That is not an inconsiderable sum. It takes some while to  get a passport. If you have a family of  four or five going up to Winnipeg or  Regina,  the  northern  part  of  our  State—we have a 4000-plus mile border—for a family of four or five going  to see a relative, if we have a passport  requirement, that is pretty dramatic.  We have always been able to use our  driver’s license, and the Department of  Homeland Security says that is going  to be replaced by a passport. We complained  about  that. They  said: All  right, what we will require is a passport card. We don’t know the specifics  of that card, but what we want to make  sure of is that card not be prohibitive  for families. I don’t have any problem  with requiring a standardized card, but  I don’t believe it should cost more than  $20. I don’t believe it should be required  for children under 17 traveling with  their parents. There also ought to be  exceptional circumstances, with proper  identification, for those who make day  trips.  As I said, I am joined in this amendment by many of my colleagues from  the border States,  including Senator  from Maine, Senator SCHUMER  from New York, Senator BURNS from  Montana, and Senator JEFFORDS from  Vermont. I hope we can have some discussion and debate and hope in the conduct of the debate on this immigration  bill that we may include that.  I yield the floor.  ",2006
528,10,2006-04-03,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Georgia.  ,2006
529,10,2006-04-03,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President,  I  sat here with interest, listening to the  Senator from North Dakota. I think we  agree on an awful lot. I may not agree  with everything he said, but he made  some very salient points with respect  to the earlier laws we have passed on  this issue of immigration and the amnesty—that is what it amounted to—  that was given to certain folks who  were included in the previous immigration bill the Senator addressed. He is  exactly right. It didn’t work back then.  While there are provisions in this bill,  some of which I may agree with—they  may be good—there are certain other  points  in this which simply are not  very good pieces of legislation.  I would like to take a moment to  speak on the amnesties that exist in  the immigration bill passed by the Judiciary Committee that is now under  SNOWE discussion on the floor. Some in the  Senate like to call it something else—  earned adjustment or earned citizenship—to try to distinguish it from what  Congress has done in the past. However,  I believe  that  the  legislation  adopted by the Judiciary Committee is  so similar to the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act passed by Congress, which everyone agrees  is amnesty, that in fairness, what the Senate is being asked to consider today  should likewise be called amnesty.  One reason why I am opposed to amnesty, or earned  legalization,  is because the last time Congress addressed  what to do about the illegal population  in our country, a similar approach was  agreed upon, and it did not work. In  the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, increased enforcement, both  at the border and in the interior of the  U.S., and especially with regards to  employer sanctions was mandated to  eliminate the jobs magnet for so many  illegal  immigrants.  In addition,  the  theory was that our increased border  security would stem the tide of illegal  immigrants coming into the country.  Coupled with this enforcement was  an amnesty offered to  illegal aliens  who met  specified  requirements  in  order to bring them out of the shadows  and allow them to acquire legal status.  There were actually two amnesties included in the Immigration Reform and  Control Act of 1986—the Legally Authorized Workers—LAW—program and  the Special Agricultural Worker Program—SAW.  Similarly in the bill put forth by the  Judiciary Committee, there are mandates for increased border security and  interior  enforcement  as well  as  a  strong  emphasis  on  employer  sanctions. Coupled with this also exists two  amnesties: one  for the estimated 11  million illegal aliens currently in the  U.S. and another  for  illegal aliens  working in agriculture.  The 1986 SAW Program required that  illegal aliens work a certain number of  hours in agriculture in order to obtain  a temporary legal status. Then 1 to 2  years after obtaining a temporary legal  status, those agricultural workers were  given  permanent  residency  status.  Now, every Senator I have seen come  to the floor has called this 1986 SAW  program an amnesty, yet many maintain that the current Judiciary Committee proposal is not an amnesty.  However,  the  current  agricultural  program in the Judiciary Committee  bill is constructed in much the same  way:  Illegal aliens who worked  150  hours in agriculture in the 2-year period ending on December 31, 2005, can  obtain a temporary legal status, here  called a blue card. Then by working 100  hours per year  in agriculture  for 5  years or by working 150 hours per year  in agriculture for 3 years, that illegal  alien will be given permanent resident  status. So the only difference between  a program that is unanimously agreed  upon to be amnesty and one that is argued not to be is the requirement that  (d) ACCEPTANCE OFPASSPORTCARDS AND  DAYPASSESBYCANADA.—The Secretary of  State, in consultation with the Secretary,  shall negotiate with the Government of Canada to ensure that passport cards and day  passes  issued by  the Government of  the  United States for travel to Canada are accepted for such purpose by the Government  of Canada.

Three cheers to the  Senate for having an immigration bill  that is in no way as punitive and tart  and prickly as the House bill.  I think the Senate will proceed in a  rational way.

We put in this bill—and Senator  MIKULSKIoffered a sense of this amendment last year and it won—to extend  for 1 year these provisions. I thought in  the bill that came out of committee we  were dealing with it when we added  400,000 per year—more than doubling  the number who would come  in  to  work—who could be covered, I think,  by this category. My question is, has  the Senator been able  to ascertain  whether this would be in addition to  the  400,000 who would  be  approved  under the Judiciary Committee mark?  ",2006
544,17,2006-04-03,Ms. MIKULSKI.," First of all, the answer is that this amendment will be  the bridge until the Judiciary Committee legislation is actually up and  running. The H–2B employers will use  the H–2C visas you all created once the  program is up and running. But it will  not be up and running for October of  this year, if, in fact, we get a bill. We  don’t know if we will get a bill. If we do  get a bill—you know how sluggish that  bureaucracy is in writing rules and regulations—this is a safety net.  ",2006

564,31,2006-04-03,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, I end tonight saying a  few words about the  devastating storms that occurred last  night in my home State of Tennessee.  First and foremost, I offer my deepest  condolences to the families who lost  loved ones last night. My heart goes  out to those families who are reeling in  the aftermath of this sudden and totally unexpected tragedy. The people of  Tennessee grieve with you and our  prayers are with you through this painful ordeal.  I let my fellow Tennesseans know I  requested that the President have a  quick  review  and  approval  of  the  State’s request for assistance. I have  also taken the opportunity to talk directly with  acting FEMA Director  David Paulison to expect my clear support for the State’s request. Director  Paulison is looking into the matter, of  course. We had a good exchange. I appreciate FEMA’s strong support.  Senator ALEXANDER and  I  stand  ready to assist the State and local officials in any way possible to ensure our  communities have the resources they  need. We will pull together as Tennesseans and neighbors and together  we will get through this awful crisis.  Our thoughts and our hearts and prayers go out to others who have been affected by the storms in other States.  When I talked to Director Paulison  today, he was describing that those  storms were northwest of Tennessee, as  well.  ",2006

566,31,2006-04-03,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President,  last night, severe tornadoes and strong  storms swept through west Tennessee.  Dyer and Gibson Counties were the  hardest hit. According  to  the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, at least 23 individuals lost their  lives in just those two counties. One of  those killed was Jane King of Newbern,  TN. She was a relative of Congressman  JOHNTANNER, and our thoughts are  with JOHNand Betty Ann Tanner and  all of Jane King’s family.  At least 70 people have been injured  as a result of the storms. TEMA expects that number to rise. There  is  damage to at least 11 other counties in  west Tennessee. Thousands  of Tennesseans have  lost their homes and  their livelihoods. TEMA reports that  1,200 buildings were damaged or destroyed in the town of Bradford alone.  Tennessee Emergency Management  Agency officials are on the ground in  the counties affected. They are helping  to survey damage. They are offering assistance. A state of emergency is in effect. The biggest need thus far is to get  the roads clear. GEN Gus Hargett has  assigned 30 members of the 230th Engineer Battalion of the Tennessee National Guard to assist with debris removal. The Dyersburg Armory is being  used as a Red Cross processing site.  This afternoon, Senator FRISTand I  sent a letter to President Bush asking  for speedy review and approval of the  State’s request for Federal disaster assistance. I ask unanimous consent that  letter be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  WASHINGTON, DC, APRIL3, 2006.  THEPRESIDENT,  The White House,  Washington, DC.  DEARMR. PRESIDENT: Last night  devastating  tornados  swept  through  several  West Tennessee communities. In Dyer and  Gibson counties at least 23 individuals lost  their lives. Many others lost their homes and  livelihoods. State and  local officials currently are assessing the damage. Many of the  affected communities are in rural areas and  it could take some time before the full extent of the damage is realized.  In anticipation of Tennessee Governor Phil  Bredesen’s request for Federal disaster assistance, we respectfully urge you to act as  expeditiously as possible and approve Tennessee’s request for federal assistance. It is  our understanding that there is significant  damage in many areas of West Tennessee,  and local emergency responders and the Tennessee  Emergency Management  Agency,  TEMA, are working to provide assistance to  survivors. They will soon begin the process  of assessing the damage to affected communities.  Thank you for your consideration of our  request on behalf of Tennesseans suffering  from  these  devastating  and  unforeseen  events. Please let us know if you have any  questions or need additional information.  Sincerely,  WILLIAMH. FRIST, M.D.,  Majority Leader, U.S.  Senate.  LAMARALEXANDER,  U.S. Senate.  ",2006
567,31,2006-04-03,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President, tomorrow Governor Bredesen and Congressman TANNERwill be on the site.  We will continue to be in touch with  Governor Bredesen and provide whatever assistance we can. We will work  closely with State and local officials.  My prayers are with the families who  have suffered tremendous loss as a result of these storms, and I know we  will see shining examples of the Tennessee volunteer spirit and neighbor  helping neighbor as west Tennesseans  rebuild their homes, their businesses,  and their lives.  WESTERN HEMISPHERE TRAVEL  INITIATIVE  ",2006
568,31,2006-04-03,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, I come  to the floor to speak about this important amendment on the Western Hemisphere travel initiative.  The Western Hemisphere travel initiative was authorized  in the  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of  2004 based on  the  recommendation of the 9/11 Commission.  It mandates that the Department of  Homeland Security, DHS, implement a  new documentation program validating  citizenship by January 1, 2008. Once executed, all U.S. citizens crossing the  Canadian or Mexican Border into the  United States will be required to carry  a passport or other accepted documentation, such as a passcard, in order  to verify their citizenship.  The DHS and the State Department  are  in  the process of promulgating  rules to implement this initiative and  are considering executing the air and  sea portion of this initiative by next  January.  While the need to tighten security at  our borders  is an  important undertaking, I am concerned that in their  haste to accomplish this mission pursuant to a congressionally mandated  timeline, DHS and the State Department may be overlooking serious concerns about the implementation of this  initiative raised by border States and  Canada.  They are evaluating two options in  order to identify citizenship. The first  would require a person entering the  United States to present a passport.  However, passports are expensive and  require weeks to acquire. The second  alternative  is  the  issuance  of  a  passcard, which would  be  slightly  cheaper but would still require a background check and could only be used  for travel between Canada, the United  States, and Mexico.  Each of these options assumes that  DHS and the State Department are  able to process the flood of requests for  passports and passcards. There is no  reasonable way they could get all of  these requests processed by the deadline, thereby adversely affecting travel  and business for millions.  Take for example a military family  reassigned from the lower 48 to Eielson  Air Force Base, Alaska, who has to  drive from the lower 48 through Canada  with all of their belongings. This family may not have the opportunity or  funds to acquire passport before traveling.  Alaska is the only State in the Nation that you have to pass through a  foreign country to get to by land. I  have a lot of concerns about how this  initiative will affect travel.  Each year, a large number of people  travel to Alaska from the lower 48 on  the  Alaska-Canada  Highway,  also  known as the Al-Can. Each summer, we  routinely see large numbers of RV’s on  the road with license plates from New  York,  Pennsylvania,  Florida,  California, everywhere. They are now going  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:24 Apr 04, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G03AP6.047 S03APPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o y r r e h c y         ",2006

570,66,2006-04-03,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  recognition of Patricia Deans, a decorator, designer, economist, coordinator, organizer and  entrepreneur.  I hope my colleagues will  join  me in recognizing her accomplishments.  Patricia was born in Wilson, NC in 1941 and  is the oldest daughter of Samuel and Helen  Ruth Reid. Patricia graduated from Charles H.  Darden High School and moved to New York  in 1959.  In September 1963, she graduated  from Adelphi Business School and began  working  in  the health care profession where  she remained for 30 years. She is the mother  of  three children, Sharon, Walter and Sean,  and  the proud grandmother of nine grandchildren.  As a community advocate, she is involved  with the following organizations: National Association  for  the Study of African-American  Life and History; National Juneteenth Observance  Foundation,  state  coordinator;  Solid  Waste Advisory Board, SWAB, Brooklyn Borough President’s  appointment May,  1996;  Glenmore Plaza Tenant’s Association, president; Brownsville Heritage House  Inc.,  first  vice president; Faith Hope and Charity Community Services, Inc., secretary; Brooklyn Public Library Friends Group; Stone Avenue and  Brownsville  Branches; Multi-Cultural  Committee  for District 23, member; Youthbuild  Brownsville, member.  Patricia’s art exhibits have  touched both  children and senior citizens. Mt. Ararat-Presentation Church Community Senior Citizen  Center exhibited her art during  its Thanksgiving Convocation for resident leaders.  Patricia’s work, which has a multi-cultural  focus—Kwanzaa, Dr. Martin  Luther King’s  Celebration, Hispanic Heritage and Black History Month to name a few—is also exhibited at  the Brownsville Heritage House. Founded by  Mother Rosetta Gaston in March 1981 at the  age of 96, Brownsville Heritage House was to  be a beacon of hope to the Brownsville Community. Patricia’s commitment is to safeguard  and enhance the work started by Mother Gaston. One of Patricia’s greatest objectives is to  see Brownsville Heritage House become  to  Brooklyn what  the Schomburg Center  is  to  Harlem. She desires to see children take advantage of the rich heritage contained within  its walls. Patricia wants more people  to become aware that Brownsville Heritage House,  located on the third floor of the Stone Avenue  Branch Library, is the first library built for children and therefore should have landmark status.  Patricia’s art graced the Fort Greene Senior  Citizen Center and other venues around the  city as well as a library dedication at PS/IS  332, which was attended by the former first  lady of New York City, Mrs. Joyce Dinkins  along with other dignitaries.  Patricia’s strong belief in improving the quality of life in urban and rural environment led  her  into becoming an entrepreneur  in July  1994. She saw the need for community based  partnerships to provide opportunities for the elderly, the children and the homeless. By pooling resources, sharing gifts and  talents,  the  end results will provide multiple opportunities  and empowerment for this population.  To  further  this  quest, Patricia  conducts  workshops, consults on arts, education, restoration and environmental community development  through  the use of  intergenerational  instruction.  Mr. Speaker, Patricia Dean’s selfless service has continuously demonstrated a level of  altruistic dedication that makes her most worthy of our recognition today.  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

572,66,2006-04-03,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  recognition of Marie Isabel Holness-Flemming,  Senior Associate Director of Social Work Services at North Brooklyn Health Network. I hope  my colleagues will join me in recognizing her  accomplishments.  Ms. Holness-Flemming is an accomplished  professional, dedicated to helping people cope  with illness and crisis. As a social work professional for over 20 years she has worked with  and developed programs to service a wide variety  of  populations  such  as  critical  ill  newborns, the elderly, persons with HIV/AIDS,  victims of violence and substance abuse.  Ms. Holness-Flemming was born in Panama  City, Republic of Panama to Boswell and Vera  Holness. At the age of two, she immigrated  with her family to the U.S. where they settled  In the Bronx. Education, highly valued in her  household, Ms. Holness-Flemming was a New  York State Regent Scholarship winner. She  went on to attend Union College In Schenectady, New York  obtaining  a Bachelor  of  Science degree  in Biology and Psychology.  After working for several years with preschool  children as a day care teacher, she returned  to academia and obtained a Master of Social  Work degree from Hunter College School of  Social Work.  Pursuing  her  interest  in  children,  she  worked  for a child-abuse prevention agency  focusing on ‘‘at risk’’ families in order to prevent children from entering the foster care system. Understanding that violence in the household was not only directed toward the children,  she developed support groups for victims of  domestic violence  in an effort  to empower  women to protect themselves as well as their  children. In 1987, she then joined the social  work  staff at Lincoln Medical and Mental  Health Center where she served for 14 years  in a variety of positions moving  from direct  practice to program development and administration. She worked as a Social Work Supervisor, Discharge Planning Coordinator, and  Coordinator  for HIV AIDS  testing counseling  programs, Director of Social Work and Associate Director for the Emergency Department.  Ms. Holness-Flemming was honored by  the  Generations+ Health Network as one of  its  outstanding women in March 2001.

586,11,2006-05-01,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Louisiana.  ,2006
587,11,2006-05-01,Mr. VITTER.," I thank the Chair. And  I appreciate all of those words by my  colleague from Louisiana and certainly  join her in all of those comments.  Now, if I could briefly outline amendment 3728, which has not been called  up, but I will outline what  it does.  Again,  the Domenici amendment  is  crucially necessary for levy and hurricane protection work  in south Louisiana. Amendment 3728 would simply  supplement  that  in  relatively  small  ways in terms of dollar amounts but in  very important ways.  At the outset, before I explain what  it covers, let me explain three crucial  overall points about the amendment.  No. 1, all of the moneys or funds or  expenditures in this amendment 3728  are completely offset so it does not increase the size or the cost of the bill  whatsoever.  No.  2,  everything  covered  in  the  amendment was actually included in  the underlying bill at the committee  covers  five  crucial  stage of the process. It has been removed as it comes to the floor, but it  was  included  in committee and  the  chairman of  the  subcommittee,  the  Senator from New Mexico, has no objection to the inclusion of these important items. In addition, the statement  of administration policy on the bill,  while it highlights a number of items  the administration actually opposes in  the bill, does not highlight any of the  items in this amendment. The administration has not expressed opposition to  these items.  And No. 3, all of the operation and  maintenance required for these items  in my amendment is funded 100 percent  by the locals, by the local sponsors of  these projects.  Basically,  it  things.  No. 1, addressing  further damaged,  destroyed or inferior protection levees  in south Louisiana. While the Domenici amendment addresses many of those  needs, all of these areas where there is  a blue rectangle giving the new heights  of the levee protection system, after  the work in the Domenici amendment  is completed, there are, unfortunately,  a few gaps in this area of Lafourche,  Terrebonne, and also the east bank of  Plaquemines Parish. And this amendment would help fill those gaps.  No. 2, fulfilling shortfalls in funding  for full pumping capacity needs in Jefferson and Orleans Parishes with the  closing of outfall canals.  No. 3, meeting shortfalls to ensure  equal levels of hurricane protection on  the east and west banks of the Mississippi River  in  lower Plaquemines  Parish, again, one of the slight gaps I  pointed to on the map.  No. 4, providing a plan to protect  lower Plaquemines parish for the long-  term and vital resources in that Parish—energy and seafood and maritime.  And No. 5, the amendment would direct the national academies to perform  a study to determine that portion of  the levy system that lost height due to  construction, design, subsidence, and  settlement.  In closing, Madam President, again,  let me emphasize that everything in  this amendment No. 3728 is offset, that  everything in it was included by the  committee during committee deliberations and is not opposed in the statement of administration policy and that  everything in it, operation and maintenance related to these works, would be  funded 100 percent by the local sponsors of these important works. I urge  all of my colleagues, Republican and  Democrat, to support my amendment.  It does not increase the size of the bill,  it merely perfects, if you will, the very  important work being done by  the  Domenici amendment.  With that, Madam President, I yield  back my time.

593,25,2006-05-01,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I assume  the opponents of  these nominations  would want to be recognized, or the Republican majority supporting him.  I  understand there are three Republicans  to speak on the judges and one Democrat is allowed to speak.  No one is here, so I will speak.  I will support this nominee, Michael  Barrett. He has the support of his home  State Senators. I have also heard from  both Democrats and Republicans  in  Ohio. That makes it worth supporting.  In fact, the nomination of such consensus nominees  is an  indication of  what should be done  in States, and  would lead to the confirmation of more  judges. In January 2001, we were following a  shutdown of  judges going  through. As  the  distinguished Presiding Officer knows, the Republicans  were determined to block virtually all  of President Clinton’s judges for a long  period of time. I became chairman and  for 17 months moved a record number  of judges for President Bush, 100. Actually, since 2001, while the Republican  majority  has  not moved President  Bush’s  judicial  nominees  anywhere  near as  fast as I did, we have still  moved 238. That includes two Supreme  Court Justices, and 43 circuit court  judges. However, we do have some that  create problems.  Unfortunately, as demonstrated by  the  recent  withdrawals  of  several  nominees, all  too often  this White  House seems more  interested  in rewarding cronies and picking political  fights than  in selecting  lifetime appointments  after  thorough  vetting.  Sadly, the Republican Senate has proceeded to rubber stamp these important nominations and failed in its role  as a constitutional check on the President.  The  controversial  nominations  of  Judge  Terrence  Boyle  and  Brett  Kavanaugh are contemporary cases in  point. With the extreme right-wing and  special interest groups agitating for a  fight over  judicial nominations,  the  Republican leader of the Senate is answering their demands by seeking to  force Senate debate on these controversial nominees. Rather than focus on  proposals to end the subsidies to big oil  and rein in gas prices, rather than devote our time to immigration reform  legislation, rather than completing a  budget, the Republican leader came to  the floor last week to signal a fight  over  controversial  judicial  nominations is in the offing. Such a controversial maneuver serves only to divide and  distract us from America’s real problems. During this President’s administration, gas prices have more than doubled  and  undocumented  immigrants  have doubled, but  judicial vacancies  have been cut in half from the time  when Republicans in the Senate were  stalling President Clinton’s  judicial  nominations. Despite the real problems  that confront Americans with respect  to security, health  insurance, rising  health costs, rising energy costs, and  spiraling deficits and debt, some would  rather pick an election year fight over  judicial nominations.  In fact, I mentioned Judge Boyle. I  contrast his nomination to the nomination  of Michael Barrett. Michael  Barrett, as I said, will go through easily. I will support him. I will vote for  him, as I told the distinguished Senator, the former Lieutenant Governor  of Ohio, now senior Member of the U.S.  Senate, ",2006
594,25,2006-05-01,Mr. DEWINE.,"  But you take somebody like Judge  Boyle. Here is somebody who has violated  every  judicial  ethic you  can  think of. He ruled on multiple cases involving corporations in which he held  investments. In at least one instance—  this  is  chutzpah beyond all understanding—he was presiding over a case  involving General Electric, and while  doing that, he bought stock in General  Electric; then, 2 months later, he ruled  in favor of General Electric.  Now, in the first year of law school  you might get an example like this because it is so clear-cut and easy to understand. This is amazing—amazing—  not withstanding all the other conflicts  of  interest he had  in  other  cases.  Whether or not it turns out that Judge  Boyle broke Federal law or canons of  judicial ethics, these types of conflicts  of interest have no place on the Federal bench.  This is not the first judicial nominee  to engage in these kinds of apparent  ethical lapses. Less than two months  ago, the President withdrew the nomination of Judge James Payne to the  Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit  after information became public about  that nominee’s rulings in a number of  cases in which he appears to have had  conflicts of  interest. Those conflicts  were pointed out not by the administration’s screening process or by the  ABA, but by journalists.  During the last few months, President Bush also withdrew the nominations of Judge Henry Saad to the Court  of Appeals  for  the  6th Circuit and  Judge Daniel P. Ryan to the Eastern  District of Michigan. And we saw the  arrest of another Bush administration  official and former judicial nominee to  the Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, Claude Allen, who had earlier  withdrawn as a nominee and more recently resigned his position as a top  domestic policy adviser to the President. When we are considering lifetime  appointments of judicial officers who  are  entrusted with  protecting  the  rights of Americans, it is important to  be  thorough. Unfortunately, all  too  often this White House seems more interested in rewarding cronies.  They add to the long list of nominations by this President that have been  withdrawn.  Among  the more  well  known are Bernard Kerik to head the  Department of Homeland Security and  Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. It  was, as I recall, reporting in a national  magazine that doomed the Kerik nomination. It was opposition within the  President’s own party that doomed the  Miers nomination.  Over the weekend we heard that this  administration’s former FDA director  is under investigation and its political  director testified, again before a federal grand jury. Of course, Mr. Libby  remains under indictment, and Messrs.  Safavian, Scanlon, Abramoff  and  a  number  of  House  Republicans  are  caught up in another criminal probe.  In light of this long list of failures of  the White House to fulfill its commitments to the American people to be  above reproach and its lackluster vetting process, it is more important than  ever that the Senate and the Senate  Judiciary Committee afford nominees  the kind of careful scrutiny that will  yield enough information to decide on  a nominee’s fitness for an important  appointment.  In Judge Boyle’s case,  not only were his answers to the committee’s  questions  evasive,  but  he  failed to produce even the unpublished  opinions he issued from the bench.  I am also concerned that the Senate  Judiciary Committee is being required  to consider the nomination of Brett  Kavanaugh to the United States Court  of Appeals for the DC Circuit without a  complete record. The Democratic members of the committee have twice asked  for another hearing in connection with  his nomination. Mr. Kavanaugh failed  to provide meaningful and substantive  responses to many of the questions  posed to him at his first hearing and he  delayed for seven months before providing evasive and incomplete answers  to written questions.  In addition, a new hearing is warranted because several troubling issues  have come to  light since his  initial  nomination. As Associate White House  Counsel  and  staff  secretary,  Mr.  Kavanaugh has served in the inner circle of the White House at a time when  many controversial policies and decisions were being considered. Senators  have not had a chance to question him  about his role in connection with those  matters. For example, what was Mr.  Kavanaugh’s role in connection with  the warrantless spying on Americans?  What was his involvement in the policies affecting detainee treatment and  interrogation? What was his involvement in connection with military tribunals, torture, and rendition of prisoners to other countries? Given the  scandals  now  plaguing  the White  House, it is important to know whether  Mr. Kavanaugh has had a role in connection with  the  actions  of  Jack  Abramoff, Michael  Scanlon,  David  Safavian,  the matters  being  investigated in connection with the Plame  matter, and many other matters.  The wall of secrecy that the administration has maintained is no environment in which carefully to consider an  administration  insider  for a  lifetime  appointment to an important Federal  judicial position.

598,32,2006-05-01,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, we will be  closing in a few moments. But before  doing  that,  I want  to comment on  events carried out in Washington yesterday, indeed around the country yesterday, in response to a crisis that is  going on, a crisis that is more than a  crisis. It is genocide going on in the  Darfur region. It is the western region  of the Sudan.  Yesterday,  roughly  10,000  people  gathered in front of the Capitol, on the  Mall, to bring attention to what is happening: that crisis, that genocidal campaign that is underway and being perpetrated against the people of Darfur.  I applaud all of  the participants’  compassion and commitment  to  the  cause which has been discussed again  and again on the floor of the Senate  but, indeed, is a devastating crisis that  is destroying a population and, indeed,  is genocide.  This is an issue that is very close to  my own heart, in part because I travel  just about every year to do medical  mission work in that part of the world,  in the Sudan.  Indeed,  I was  in the  Darfur area and in Chad a little over a  year ago on the ground.  I mention it because this afternoon,  several hours ago, I had the wonderful  opportunity of meeting with a small  group of refugees from the Darfur region. The meeting was organized by  SaveDarfur.org. It gave me the opportunity to visit firsthand with individuals from several of the tribes that occupy the Darfur region.  It is interesting, there are 10, 11, 12  tribes throughout Sudan. In the south,  two or three tribes dominate. In different parts of the Sudan, tribes dominate. But it is interesting, over in the  Darfur region, the number of tribes  that intersect together. It is sort of  midway—north-south—in  Sudan,  so  you have a lot of the tribes that are  more endemic to the northern part of  Sudan, as well as the southern and  eastern part of Sudan. All of them  commingle in that region.  We met, oh, about 50 yards from here  on a balcony overlooking the Mall. And  as you stood on the balcony there, on a  beautiful day in Washington, looking  out, you could not help but think of  the contrast between what is going on  in the homeland of those refugees to  the United States from Darfur and that  beautiful day  looking out upon our  monuments and the freedom and liberty for which they stand. That contrast between the turmoil that is going  on, as we speak, in Sudan and America’s homeland peace and prosperity  were really felt.  I have had the opportunity to go to  Sudan a number of times. I have talked  to the refugees in the border camps.  They are along the western border of  Sudan and  in the country of Chad,  which  is to the west of the Sudan.  There are 12 refugee camps. The refugee camps have anywhere from 8,000  to 20,000 people who are living on a sustenance level, with the aid of NGOs and  peoples around  the world,  in  little  tents, makeshift  tents,  but  living  there, in essence, permanently.  There are about 2 million people who  have been displaced in the Darfur region and about 200,000 people who have  died as a result of brutality which  leads back to government sponsorship.  We have heard again and again the  stories and seen pictures of the villages  that are set afire, of the women who  are raped, the children who are abducted, recruited to armies, and even  many executed.  The Government of Sudan has failed  to take credible steps to date, and we  need  to use  everything within  our  power and our standing in the international community to convince other  people to act and to act now. We cannot—cannot—tolerate this genocide.  On this floor we have called it for  what it is: genocide. President Bush  has called  it genocide. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell has called  it genocide.  Last month, before we left for the  Easter/Passover recess, I met with a  number of friends from Sudan, many of  whom I had gotten to know when I was  last in Sudan, in the southern part of  the Sudan. They had been sponsored by  a charity out of Knoxville, TN.  We talked about the clinics and the  hospitals in southern Sudan. And we  discussed the pressure the American  Government has been able to bring to  date on behalf of the Darfur people.  But there is a lot more we can do. And  there is a lot more we should do.  Because these individuals were from  the southern part of Sudan—that is a  thousand miles away, a long way away  from the Darfur region—they reflected  how our Government getting involved  in  the  southern part of Sudan had  brought more peace, and it stopped the  civil war that had gone on there for the  last 20 years.  One  of  those  visitors,  Reverend  Kayanga, is a friend, actually, somebody whom I have gotten to know. He  said it best when he said, ‘‘The only  people that visited us were your people.’’ He was saying that to me, again,  reaching out: Thank you for the past.  But you need to get even more involved  as we address this devastating crisis in  the Darfur part of Sudan.  The conflict in the region is huge.  First of all, Sudan itself, the country,  is about a third of the size of the continental United States. The Darfur region is vast. The area of conflict is  probably a third bigger than all of Iraq.  So it is a huge area, which is one of the  challenges. Things are getting worse,  not better, which is the message they  were giving me. Indeed, as I talked to  people on  the ground,  in  terms of  NGOs, the NGOs are having a harder  time. The  rainy  season comes  in  4  weeks. Once that comes in, there is no  way to get aid and have it distributed  throughout the Darfur region.  As yesterday’s rally demonstrated,  the American people have vast stores  of compassion and caring for these people and for the suffering of others. We  have  a  passionate  commitment  to  human rights. Now is the time for us to  reflect  it. At our Government’s  request, the African Union has agreed to  extend the ongoing peace talks until  midnight on Tuesday. Indeed, Deputy  Secretary of State Robert Zoellick will  leave today for Abuja, Nigeria, to help  both parties resolve the crisis. Negotiations have gone on for 2 years, and a  settlement is long past due. Those who  are responsible for this genocide, for  the war crimes against humanity and  criminal acts, need to be brought to  justice. No  longer can we wait this  tragedy out. We must act, and the  international community must be encouraged to step up as well. Hundreds  of thousands of lives are at stake.  ",2006

602,32,2006-05-01,Mr. FRIST.," In the Darfur region I  have not. But  it  is very similar to  southern  Sudan.  It  is  fascinating,  southern Sudan, where 2 million people  have been displaced, and 5 million people have been killed  in a civil war  there, and it started there. That is why  I have great hope. A lot of people just  give up on these regions, because when  we went there initially, it was almost  exactly the same. There was a lot of  fighting within 10 or 15 kilometers.  I started operating in a little schoolhouse that had been diverted for about  8 years. That was 1997–1998. Now  in  2006, there is a village there and commerce  and  a hospital, no  fighting;  50,000 people go through what was a  schoolhouse and is now a big hospital.  When people give up in Africa or say  we have been through this before and  talk about corruption in government,  we can’t give up. We should not give  up.  I very much appreciate my distinguished colleague asking because there  is a lot we can do. And it starts with  the compassion and caring that the  American people exemplify. Now is the  time for us to act.

603,39,2006-05-01,Mr. STEVENS.," Madam President,  today Senator INOUYEand I introduce  the Communications Act of 2006. Just  over a month ago, the Senate Commerce Committee concluded a series of  15 hearings on the state of our Nation’s  communications  laws. We  looked at  what changes in the law would be required to spur innovation, encourage  competition, and provide better service  at a lower price for consumers. Senator  INOUYEand I, and the members of our  committee heard from dozens of witnesses and still more who have offered  comments and suggested language. Our  staffs met with literally hundreds of  people  representing  every  point  of  view.  The measure we introduce today is a  working draft  intended to stimulate  discussion and is open for comments  and suggestions for change. It attempts  to strike a balance between competing  industries, consumer groups and local  government. Both Senator INOUYEand  I may propose additional changes based  on comments offered by our members  or interested parties. We will hold two  hearings  to  take  testimony on  the  draft bill and will listen to proposed  changes. It is our hope that through a  process of collaboration, we can draft a  bill that represents a bipartisan consensus.  The bill  includes elements  from a  number of bills introduced by members  of our committee from both sides of  the aisle. The Call Home Act that Senator INOUYEand I introduced last week  would allow the FCC to take any action short of price regulation to reduce  rates for members of our Armed Forces  who call home. The measure includes  thirteen  cosponsors  from  our  committee and another twenty-five cosponsors from the Senate at large. The Call  Home Act has been endorsed by twenty-five military and veterans organizations.  The overarching theme of the bill we  introduce  today  is  deployment  of  broadband  nationwide.  Today  the  United States is less than 16th in adoption of broadband worldwide. We are  not only behind most of the developed  world, we even lag behind some of the  less developed parts of the globe. To  address this broadband gap, the bill we  introduce today will allow local governments to offer their own broadband  service, so long as they do not compete  unfairly with the private sector. The  provision is based largely on Senator  MCCAIN’s and LAUTENBERG’s bill, S.  1294, cosponsored by Senator KERRY,  but includes elements to protect the  private sector from unfair government  competition  from  Senator ENSIGN’s  bill, S. 1504 cosponsored by MCCAIN,  LOTT, DEMINT, and VITTER.  Senator MCCAINwas also very helpful  in crafting the interoperability section  of the bill. After Hurricane Katrina and  later Wilma and Rita, the committee  held a series of hearings on problems  communications companies had in restoring service and the difficulties first  responders had in talking to one another even when service had been fully  restored. During those difficult times,  Senators LOTT and VITTER played an  important role in highlighting the importance of interoperability in times of  crisis. As part of the reconciliation bill  adopted last December, this committee  addressed the interoperability problem  by dedicating $1 billion to interoperability programs. However, because of  the Byrd rule, it was not possible to  provide guidance on how the money  should be spent. The interoperability  bill we introduce today adopts many of  the recommendations offered by a variety of groups from the 911 Commission  to the recent White House report. It  embraces key concepts such as Planning  and  interoperable  equipment  grants which have been discussed with  the Department of Homeland Security  and various public safety groups.  The bill will also crate prepositioned  technology caches in every State in the  Union with some redundant regional  caches  for national  emergencies—an  idea offered by Senator INOUYEand his  staff. These caches will include equipment  like  satellite  telephones  that  work even when towers and power lines  have been destroyed.  Senator KERRYhas also been in involved in the interoperability discussion, and I believe he will have suggestions as we move forward on how to  build redundancy into our communications system.  One of the centerpieces of the legislation is video franchising reform. The  bill is based largely on legislation introduced by Senator ENSIGN, S. 1504,  cosponsored by Senators MCCAIN, LOTT,  DEMINT, and VITTER. Senators SMITH  and ROCKEFELLER introduced a similar  measure. Consistent with the Inouye/  Burns principles, the measure retains  local  franchise  involvement,  but  is  based off of the Alaska model which  uses expedited procedures, consistent  with the shot clock principles in the  Inouye/Burns principles.  By using a standard application, but  preserving the cities’ right to manage  their own rights of way and providing  the revenues needed to operate their  institutional networks as well as their  PEG channels, the bill seeks to balance  the needs of those who want to deploy  broadband networks for video services  and the desires of cities to continue the  services  they  offer  today. We  also  sought to address the needs of the existing  cable  companies  by  offering  them the same terms as new entrants  immediately upon approval of the competitor’s  franchise application. Additionally, a cable company can avail  itself of  the new  streamlined  rules  after its current franchise agreement  expires.  Another issue addressed in the draft  bill is access to video content. While  satellite companies are barred  from  hoarding  exclusive  sports  programming, the so-called terrestrial loophole  does not impose the same mandate on  cable companies. As a result, through  acquisition of regional sports networks  by cable operators, competition with  satellite  providers  is  stymied. The  Sports Freedom Act included in this  bill is patterned after a provision in  the Ensign bill cosponsored by MCCAIN,  LOTT, DEMINT, and VITTER.  Also critical to providing compelling  content is the broadcast flag. Broadcasters are reluctant to offer their best  programming over the air for fear it  could be stolen and distributed worldwide over the Internet with no regard  to copyright protection. This has been  a critical issue for Senator INOUYEon  the video side and for Senator FRISTon  the audio  side. Senators SMITH and  BOXERtook on this issue and developed  a draft bill which became the basis for  the legislation we introduce today. It  attempted to strike a balance between  the needs of broadcasters and the desires of the consumer electronic industry not to have the Federal Government pick technology winners and losers. While interested parties may have  suggestions for improving the bill, we  believe it is a good first step in addressing  their concerns.  I commend  Senators SMITH and BOXER for their  hard work on this issue.  The measure includes a white space  provision modeled after S. 2327, the  Allen-Kerry WIN Act supported by Senators SUNUNU, DORGAN, and BOXER. It  adds some protections the broadcasters  requested  to prevent harmful  interference by requiring any new device to  be tested in an FCC certified lab before  deployment. The concept of using vacant TV channels  for broadband deployment through Wi-Fi, Wi-Max and  other technologies is strongly endorsed  by  consumer  groups  and  the  technology community. Also, each can play  an  important  role  in  bringing  broadband to rural America.  The legislation includes guidance on  the DTV transition that was not possible in the reconciliation bill because  of the Byrd rule. Much of the language  we  included  is based on a provision  Senator INOUYEworked on to Address  consumer education issues. It also includes an  international coordination  element  requested  by  Senator  HUTCHISON to address interference on  the US-Mexico border that will also  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:33 May 02, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A01MY6.029 S01MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006
604,88,2006-05-01,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, this week we  commemorate Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Martyrs’ and Heroes’ Remembrance Day. With  events in Israel, the United States and around  the world, communities have gathered to memorialize the six million Jews murdered during  World War II.  This year, by a coincidence of the calendar,  Yom Hashoah comes just days after the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide and days  before a rally planned in Washington to protest the genocide in Sudan. Each of these observances is a somber reminder that world inaction in the face of injustice leaves a tragic  precedent for other acts of senseless bloodshed.  The road from Armenia to Auschwitz was direct. If more attention had been paid to the innocent victims and those who perpetrated the  atrocities against  the Armenian people,  the  Holocaust might have been prevented. Perhaps  if 60 years hadn’t passed before  the  U.N.  formally commemorated  the Holocaust,  international consciousness of other genocides  like the massacres in Darfur could have been  awakened sooner.  While the U.N. General Assembly has finally  committed to observing Holocaust commemoration annually, there is still tremendous complacency about modern day anti-Semitism.  Many nations have stood idly by while Iranian  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attacks the  Holocaust as fiction and aggressively calls for  Israel’s destruction.  For example, Ukraine this year will mark the  65th anniversary of  the Nazi massacre of  more than 100,000 Jews at Babi Yar. Yet it  took  fierce pressure  from  the United States  and Israel to urge the Ukrainian government to  take a stand against MAUP, a local university  that openly praises Ahmadinejad’s anti-Israel  statements, hosts anti-Zionism conferences,  and actively distributes anti-Semitic propaganda across Europe.  Memorials become relics if they do not stir  our modern conscience. One of the reasons  that Yom Hashoah was chosen  to be commemorated on the anniversary of the Warsaw  ghetto uprising is to inspire in all of us a drive  to fight back against injustice and intolerance.  Today, let us not only pay tribute to those  who perished. Let us pledge  to stand up  against governments that persecute their own  people. Let us bear witness  to  the crimes  against humanity  that are occurring  in our  midst. And let us declare our commitment to  fight the reemergence of anti-Semitism so that  the cry ‘‘Never Again’’ rings true.  f  SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title  IV  of Senate Resolution  4,  agreed to by the Senate on February 4,  1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all  meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference.  This title requires all such committees  to notify the Office of the Senate Daily  Digest—designated by the Rules Committee—of the time, place, and purpose  of the meetings, when scheduled, and  any cancellations or changes  in the  meetings as they occur.  As  an  additional  procedure  along  with the computerization of this information, the Office of the Senate Daily  Digest will prepare this information for  printing in the Extensions of Remarks  section of the CONGRESSIONALRECORD  on Monday and Wednesday of each  week.

605,4,2006-05-10,Mrs. MYRICK.," Mr. Speaker, to date,  more than 30 million Americans have  signed up for the new Medicare prescription drug program, and that is because it saves them money. An AARP  survey found that almost 80 percent of  those enrolled  in the Medicare prescription drug plan say that the new  benefit is meeting or exceeding their  expectations. Seniors don’t have  to  choose between prescription drugs and  paying their bills or putting food on  the table anymore.  And there is still time for seniors  who are not currently enrolled to sign  up for the program. They have until  May 15th to sign up without any penalty.  They simply have to call 1–800–MEDICARE and ask about drug savings, and  there will be someone there who will  help to walk them through the process.  Again, the deadline to sign up with  no penalties is May 15, so call and save  today.  f  PROVIDE REAL TAX RELIEF FOR  CONSUMERS AND REPEAT  ENERGY TAX BREAKS  (Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
606,4,2006-05-10,Mr. CLEAVER.," Mr. Speaker, how  high do gas prices have to go before  this administration is willing to break  its ties with the oil and gas company  CEOs? For 5 years now, the major oil  companies have been bringing in record  profits, while the pain at the pump has  grown worse for average Americans.  Today, consumers are paying $3 a  gallon. If you are making minimum  wage, that means your first hour at  work is used to buy 11⁄2gallons of gasoline for your car.  Major oil companies just reported $16  billion in profits for the first quarter  alone, and the national response has  been moral outrage. Yet last year they  pushed  through an energy bill  that  gave oil and gas companies an additional $20 billion in tax breaks and subsidies.  The problem is, those in charge here  are not willing to have the courage to  stand up and make things right.  f  TIME FOR ACTION ON ILLEGAL  IMMIGRATION  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2006
607,4,2006-05-10,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker, one  of my colleagues referenced the study  from the Law Library of Congress entitled ‘‘Immigration Law Sanctions and  Enforcement in Selected Foreign Countries.’’ It evaluates the policies and the  practices of Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, Sweden and Switzerland. The countries were selected specifically to provide a geographically and racially diverse group for comparison purposes.  What the study found is that strong  enforcement of  immigration  law and  tough sanctions can effectively reduce  illegal immigration.  Mr. Speaker, it is of concern to us  that we learned yesterday that the U.S.  Government  is releasing  information  on the Minutemen border patrols to  the Mexican Government. It  is very  frustrating that our government would  be both willing and able to release information to the Mexican Government  on these patrols, yet unable to adequately deter  illegal entry  into this  country.  Mr. Speaker, I want to see a border  wall or technology improvements that  will actually halt illegal border crossings. There  is  incredible  consensus  among Tennesseans  that  enough  is  enough on this issue. It is time for action.  f  DO-NOTHING CONGRESS REFUSING  TO ADDRESS NEEDS OF AMERICANS  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2006
608,4,2006-05-10,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  today is the 130th day of 2006. Guess  how many of those days this House has  been in session to address the needs of  the American  people? Twenty-nine.  Twenty-nine. This is only the 29th voting day of the year here in the House of  Representatives.  No wonder, Mr. Speaker, the American people have lost confidence in this  Congress.  The Republican majority  would rather recess than tackle the  tough issues of our day.  Or could it be that the Republicans  are  simply  incapable  of  governing?  House Republicans have yet to pass a  budget for the upcoming fiscal year.  Before the April recess, the House Republican leadership brought a bill to  this floor, but was forced to pull it  from consideration after determining  that it would fail.  Regardless of whether or not Republicans are able to pick up enough Republican votes this week, the fact remains that they have presided over the  largest fiscal collapse in American history. Five years ago they  inherited  record budget surpluses, and they have  turned those into record deficits.  f  b1030  PORK BOOTLEGGERS  (Mr. MCHENRY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

609,4,2006-05-10,Mr. MCHENRY.," Mr. Speaker, some  say we have no border security. The  Associated Press reported that border  authorities  inspecting a car crossing  into the United States from Mexico uncovered a food item in a strange place.  Customs and Border Patrol officers  searched the man’s car, and they found  two pounds of raw pork, oh, heaven forbid.  The meat was wrapped in foil inside  two  disposable  diapers. Bringing  in  pork is prohibited because the ‘‘other  white meat’’ can carry hog cholera.  Some say we have no border security.  Authorities  seized  these  items  and  fined the man $250.

610,18,2006-05-10,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. DREIER), the chairman of  the Rules Committee.  ",2006
611,18,2006-05-10,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, my friend  from Pasco understands this very well,  and he has done a great job of providing  leadership on these economic  growth issues.  Mr. Speaker, my friend from Rochester and my friend from Fort Lauderdale are two people for whom I have  the highest regard. I really do. I enjoy  working with them on the Rules Committee, and I just had the thrill of participating  in  the Canada-U.S.  Interparliamentary  Conference with my  friend  from Rochester, dealing with  areas of concern as it relates to our  neighbor to the north.  But I have to say, as I listen to the  arguments that are being propounded  by both of my friends from the other  side of the aisle, they represent little  more than what I describe as the ideological baggage of the past.  b1200  Now, my friend from Rochester has  just talked about the 1980s. It is true  that we saw a tremendous increase in  spending during the 1980s, a lot of increased spending  in the area of national defense. And we saw the demise  of the Soviet Union. The Cold War  came to an end.  During the 1980s, Mr. Speaker, because of the 1981 Economic Recovery  Tax Act, I think I am the only Member  on the floor now who was here at that  time, and I am very proud to have  voted  for  that. We  put  into  place  across-the-board tax rate reductions,  marginal  rate  reductions. And Mr.  Speaker, what happened? We  saw a  doubling of the flow of revenues to the  Federal Treasury during the 1980s.  People continue to try and rewrite  the history of the 1980s, somehow implying that we saw the U.S. economy  go right into the tank. We saw a surge  in economic growth and a doubling in  that flow of revenues to the Treasury.  And so I think that this notion of class  warfare, us versus them, is a tired, old,  failed one.  Now, my friend just referred to the  tax reduction that an American who is  earning $40,000 will get juxtaposed to  someone who is earning hundreds of  thousands of dollars a year, who will  get a $41,000 tax reduction. And he referred to the fact that someone will  earn $40,000 and get a very small tax  cut, and  that person  in  the upper  bracket will get a $41,000 tax cut.  I mean, I would ask my friend, does  he advocate that the person earning  $40,000 a year get a $41,000 tax cut?  ",2006
612,18,2006-05-10,Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Florida.," Mr.  Speaker, will the gentleman yield?  ",2006
613,18,2006-05-10,Mr. DREIER.,  I yield  to  the gentleman from Florida.  ,2006
614,18,2006-05-10,Mr. HASTINGS  of Florida., Absolutely not.  ,2006
615,18,2006-05-10,Mr. DREIER.," The point that I am  making, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that if  you  look at someone who  is paying  taxes, you look at what their tax liability is, and again I get to the point  that we raise that we have seen the  American people who are earning in excess of $200,000 a year, Mr. Speaker,  having a tax payment to the Federal  Treasury that is twice that of all other  taxpayers, twice that of all other taxpayers, the rate of growth of that.  And so I think that we need to realize it is the job creators who pay taxes  and it is the job creators who, with tax  relief, will be able to create more opportunity in this country to make sure  that  those who  are  less  fortunate,  those about whom my friend from Ft.  Lauderdale and I are concerned.  And to somehow imply that there is  not concern on this side of the aisle for  those who are trying to have opportunity in this country is a preposterous  argument. We care even more, I would  argue, because we are the ones who are  guaranteeing  everything  possible  to  provide them with opportunity will be  met.  And so I say, Mr. Speaker, that we  are in a position where this measure is  going to allow investors to plan and  save. It will provide a little certainty.  And we need to remember that more  than half of the American people, 91  million Americans, are today members  of the  investment class. One of the  things we need to note is that many  people who  are  earning  $40–,  $50–,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:32 May 11, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10MY7.027 H10MYPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

Mr. Speaker, I want to point out simply for the record that this bill was reported out of committee by a 60–1 margin, a very strong bipartisan indication  of  support and appreciation  for  the  main points in the bill.  As to the point on missile defense, I  think the activities in Iran and certainly North Korea indicate that we  would be prudent to think about developing missile defense. So I am very  pleased with the bipartisan nature of  this  legislation. Frankly,  I  suspect  most Members will vote for it in the  end.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. MILLER).  ",2006
617,25,2006-05-10,Mrs. MILLER  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for  yielding me time. I thank all of the  members of the Rules Committee for  bringing the rule to the floor today.  As a member of the House Armed  Services Committee, Mr. Speaker, I am  extremely proud of the bill that we  have brought to the floor here today,  and I certainly want to congratulate  and thank Chairman DUNCANHUNTER  as well for his outstanding leadership  and his dedication to a strong national  defense and particularly to our troops.  Mr. Speaker, one of the most important parts of this bill, I think, is that  we do recognize that the most important asset in our entire arsenal is really not our incredible weapons or vehicles or ships, it is the men and women  who bravely wear the uniform. That is  why this bill has put such a strong  focus once again on  supporting our  troops.  The bill will provide for an across-  the-board increase of 2.7 percent in the  base pay for our troops, as has been  mentioned numerous times already. It  blocks increases in fees for those who  are enrolled  in TRICARE prime and  standard.  It also allows full TRICARE coverage  for select Reserve personnel. It provides enhanced pharmacy services for  nearly every military beneficiary. In  addition, we forcefully attack the persistent problem of improvised explosive  devices, or IEDs as they are commonly  called, which have caused so many terrible problems for our troops.  The enemy knows that they cannot  defeat our forces on the battlefield, so  they are resorting to planting bombs  along the roadside. This bill authorizes  over $100 million for radio signal jamming devices to prevent the detonation  of IEDs.  It also provides for another $100 million for 10 or more surveillance aircraft  to patrol those areas where the IED activity is most deadly, and we must do  certainly more to protect our troops  from IEDs so that we can limit the  amount, the number of casualties in  battle. But in addition we need to learn  better really how to defeat these terrible weapons, because, guess what,  they could soon be finding their way to  our streets here within our own borders  in America.  The American people and our troops  can rest assured that we understand  the problem of IEDs, and with this bill,  again, we are taking very forceful action to defeat them.  When we take the oath of office, we  swear to uphold the Constitution of the  United States, whose preamble actually requires for us to provide for the  national defense. This bill not only allows us to live up to our constitutional  responsibilities to provide for that defense, it ensures that our Armed Forces  will remain the best trained, the best  equipped and the most lethal fighting  force the world has ever known.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support the rule and the underlying  bill.  ",2006
618,25,2006-05-10,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2  minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. SNYDER).  ",2006
619,25,2006-05-10,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Speaker, I was eating my  lunch downstairs, and as a  member of the committee I voted for  this bill in committee, as did Mr. SKELTON, and I support the bill.  However, Mr. HUNTER’s discussion of  the provision about Channel  Islands  National Park, Santa Rosa Island, I  thought was incomplete and gave an  inaccurate picture of what the situation is. I agree with ",2006
620,25,2006-05-10,Mrs. CAPPS.," This is  a provision, section 1036(c) of the bill,  that should never be in the defense bill.  You read the one sentence. It has nothing to do with veterans. There is not  the word  ‘‘veterans’’  or  ‘‘military’’  anywhere in the provision. This should  have been a provision that was considered by the Resources Committee.  Having said that, this is the background on this situation. In 1902 a private family owned and took control of  the Channel Islands. In 1986 they sold it  to the National Park Service as part of  the Channel Islands National Park for  about $30 million and had an agreement that they could be on the island  managing their own private herd of elk  and deer for some period of time.  In the late 1990s there was litigation  brought by the National Parks and  Conservation Association, and a settlement was  reached between  the National Park Service, the family that  owns the deer and the elk, and the National Parks and Conservation Association. Everyone agreed to this settlement that has been going on now for  the last decade, that by December 31,  2011, there would be no more hunting  on this  island because the  island  is  shut down, about 90 percent of it, 4 to  5 months of the year.  But here is the key point. Number  one, this is a privately owned herd. It  is the same as if Mr. COLEor Mr. SKELTONhad a herd of cows. This herd of  deer and elk is owned not by the government, not by the National Park  Service, this herd is owned by a private  group. It is not the government’s business to decide what to do.  Second, there is not a plan, as was  described by the Armed Services Committee chairman, to exterminate the  herd. Here is what the plan is. And several months ago I talked to a member  of the  family. They  love this herd.  They have professionally managed this  herd for years. They have trophy hunts  on the island. Their intent is to move  this herd off the  island and  find a  place, they do not know where yet, I do  not think, but to move it off of the island.  According to the settlement that was  reached, it is what I call the Wiley  Rogue provision, if there are a few animals that are left that the company is  having trouble, that own it, they are  having trouble trapping those animals,  the National Park Service has agreed  to share in half of the expense of getting those last few animals, including  perhaps, perhaps, if necessary, the hiring of professional hunters or helicopters or  something  to get  them.  There is not a plan to exterminate this  private herd. This is a privately owned  herd. It is not up to the government to  exterminate it. This provision is only  to help this private company get these  last few animals. That is only if necessary. This provision should not have  been in the defense bill.  ",2006

625,32,2006-05-10,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank Chairman HUNTERand Mr. SKELTON for the opportunity. I stand here  today in support of the bill moving forward, but I have a caveat that I hope  will be able to be addressed before we  come to a final conclusion.  As the chairman knows, my original  opposition was  to what  has  been  termed the ‘‘bridge fund’’; upon reconsideration, I have become a strong advocate of  it. For those not  familiar  with it, the bridge fund is a legitimate  methodology for the authorizing committee to deal with the actual cost of  deployments  of  our Armed  Forces  throughout the world.  Presently, the bridge fund will deal  only with approximately  6 months’  worth of costs associated, expenditures  associated, with these deployments. As  a result then we will have to take up  yet another supplemental budget, probably just after the first of the year,  within a month or so, and that will, in  turn,  find us dealing with other requests, other emergencies, that will be  included in this so-called supplemental  budget. It is not an emergency that we  need funding for for our deployments  overseas, but rather an admission and  an acknowledgment of the true costs of  these deployments overseas.  So, Mr. Chairman, I most certainly  urge that we move the bill along and,  at the same time, then take up this  question of being straightforward and  honest with the American people as to  what the true costs are of our deployments and to see to it that the military does not have to cannibalize the  existing budget and take us away from  what I consider 100 percent support of  the troops 50 percent of the time.  I believe, even though I am in opposition to much of what is the foundation  for support, the irony in this is that  those like myself who did not support  the effort in Iraq as undertaken and  have serious reservations about how  the war is being conducted, the military action is being conducted in Afghanistan, are actually being sustained  in our position; rather than  finding  support for those who originally were  for the war in Iraq or think that we are  doing the right thing in Afghanistan,  that position is being undermined because we are not being straightforward  with people as to what the true costs  are.  There  is a case of unease  in the  American public, I think, with regard  to our present policies in Iraq and Afghanistan because we do not have a  straightforward, honest approach with  the American people as to what the  costs are. I believe the American people will pay any costs to protect our security if they feel that we are being  honest and straightforward about it.  We need to do that. We need to bring  the bridge fund in our authorization up  to the actual cost, and not undermine  the good work that has been on this  bill this year.  Mr. Chairman, as the ranking minority member of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee  of the HASC, I am pleased to support H.R.  5122. I also want to commend my chairman  and partner on the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, Congressman KURTWELDON,  for  his nonpartisan approach  to our subcommittee’s portion’ of this bill.  The procurement and research portions of  this bill  that  the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee oversees strikes an effective balance between getting our  troops  the equipment they need, ensuring that the equipment  works, and ensuring that it is all acquired at a  price the Nation can afford. Striking this balance is always difficult, but given the pressure  on the DOD budget from the war in Iraq, this  was an especially  challenging  year.  I am  pleased  to support  the procurement and research aspects of this bill as a good-government approach  to making  tough decisions  when funds are limited.  This bill  is a significant  improvement over  the procurement and  research budget presented by the President in two critical ways.  First,  it  is a more straightforward document  that lays out what the committee decided the  military’s priorities should be, and what funding these priorities will actually cost. Second,  it shifts funding from programs that are simply  not working and moves  those  funds  to programs that are working and are delivering effective equipment  to  the  troops  in  the  field  today. With  troops  in combat  the Congress  has a non-negotiable obligation  to weigh  in  heavily on  the side of  immediate and near-  term needs of the military.  There are two programs that this bill takes  some significant  funding away  from, and  I  want to address the committee’s reasoning on  these reductions, because they were both difficult decisions. The first is the Army’s Future  Combat System, which this bill cuts by $325  million.  I want to be clear that this is not a move to  punish the Army. Everyone on this committee  recognizes that the Army is carrying the heaviest burden in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  in  terms  lives  lost and dollars spent. Every  member of this committee also wants to ensure we have an Army that is ready today and  prepared for the challenges of the future.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr. HAYES), who represents so many  great people in uniform in North Carolina and has spent so much time working  for their quality of  life and  for  their effectiveness on the battlefield,  and also for all of the people who work  in the defense industry so we can make  sure when the American taxpayer pays  for defense items, since we defend the  free world, that those items are made  by Americans and represent American  jobs.

627,39,2006-05-10,Mr. HAYES.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  Chairman HUNTERand I thank the minority member, Mr. SKELTON,  for a  truly outstanding piece of bipartisan  work. This is all about the men and  women in uniform. It reflects the commitment, the dedication, the timing  and the absolute perseverance of two  fine leaders in our committee in wholeheartedly supporting the incredible effort that our men and women in uniform are putting forward in winning  the war on terrorism. I thank them for  their hard work and support and their  unanimous approval of this bill.  I am very proud to have Fort Bragg,  the epicenter of the universe, home of  Joint Special Operations Command, in  my home district.  As we are all aware, Special Operations Forces, SOF, are playing an increasingly essential role as we continue to fight and, more importantly,  win the war on terror. Due to their importance in winning this fight, the 2006  Quadrennial Defense Review called for  a 15 percent increase in Special Operations Forces beginning in fiscal year  2007. This would increase Army Special  Forces battalions by one-third, raise  SEAL team manning, and grow Civil  Affairs and Psychological Operations.  Some of the very best ways to begin  growing the SOF  force  is to retain  those highly  trained  individuals already serving under Special Operations  and attract like-minded warriors to the  command. That is why my provision  requiring a DOD study on improving  retention of special operators is so essential.  I would again like to thank Chairman HUNTERand Chairman SAXTONof  our subcommittee for their support and  for working with me on this, and supporting me by including it in the manager’s amendment.  The report will give us better data on  the cost and investment that goes into  training and maintaining a special operator. It will include cost of training  and how much has been invested in the  average SOF operator after two deployments. It will also speak financially to  the special operators who have accumulated over 48 months of hostile fire  pay and the percentage who have accumulated over 60.  I will soon introduce a bill to provide  a new retention incentive for Special  Forces soldiers, and look forward to  continuing  to work with Chairman  HUNTERand my colleagues on this critical national security issue.  As we look towards the future, winning the war on terror, securing the  freedom for America and other like-  minded folks around the world, I want  to emphasize this is about every man  and woman in uniform whom we are so  proud of and appreciate for their service, and for their families’ support, and  we will continue to say prayers  for  their continued safety and success.  As we look forward to freedom, the  shining city on the hill and the best  days of America lying ahead, it is the  men and women in uniform who protect, defend and make us proud  to  whom we should look and give thanks  every night.

629,39,2006-05-10,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill. As a  relatively new member of the Armed  Services Committee, I am grateful to  the ranking member, Mr. SKELTON, and  Chairman HUNTERfor working with me  on parts of the bill that are particularly important for Colorado, including  report language about the importance  of the High Altitude Army Aviation  Training Site, which  is  located  in  Eagle,  Colorado,  and  its  need  for  enough aircraft to fulfill its mission.  I am also grateful for the chairman’s  support of a provision to name a housing facility at Fort Carson, Colorado,  in honor of Mr. HEFLEY, who as my colleagues know is retiring this year. During his 20 years of representing Colorado’s Fifth District, Mr. HEFLEYhas  served with integrity and honor, and he  has been a fair and effective lawmaker.  I have learned a great deal from Mr.  HEFLEY in my years in Congress, and  along with everyone else here, I will  miss him.  I am also pleased with many other  provisions in the bill, including the extension of TRICARE coverage to all  Reservists, the blocking of the proposed plan to raise certain TRICARE  fees, the authorization of additional active duty Army and Army National  Guard personnel, added funds for up-armored Humvees and IED jammers, and  the 2.7 percent pay increase for military  personnel,  among  other  provisions.  I hope that the Rules Committee will  allow  debate  on many  important  amendments not made in order in today’s rule,  including one I proposed  that will bring us further towards our  goal of energy independence, and therefore national security.  In conclusion, I think this is a good  bill, a carefully drafted and bipartisan  bill, and I urge its support.  ",2006

632,39,2006-05-10,Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the  ranking member for yielding me this  time. I would like to thank all of my  colleagues on the committee and the  committee staff for their hard work on  what I believe is a very good bill.  In particular, I would like to thank  our Personnel Subcommittee  chairman, Mr. MCHUGH, for working with  me this year on several  issues pertaining to sexual assault and harassment of military women, and Chairman  EVERETTof the Strategic Forces Subcommittee for his cooperation in ensuring that we do not put technology  ahead of policy in the realm of military space.  I am also very happy to report that  this bill includes language to strengthen congressional oversight of detainees  issues, particularly with regards to the  issue of command responsibility. The  Department of Defense wants to say  that they are holding people accountable whenever detainee abuse occurs,  but where does the ultimate responsibility lie?  A full 95 percent of the courts martial cases of detainee abuse involve the  enlisted personnel. As of last month,  only five officers had been criminally  charged  in  connection with  abuse  cases, none of them above the rank of  major, and I do not believe that that is  command  responsibility.  It  is  clear  that this committee and this Congress  take the issue of detainee abuse seriously, but we cannot  fool ourselves  into thinking the problem  is solved  until this issue of command accountability has been effectively addressed.  Our work on detainee issues is far  from over, but the language in this bill  is definitely a step in the right direction.  The budget we received from the Department of Defense  this year had  many major flaws, misguided increases  and out-of-pocket health care costs, severe cuts to National Guard funding,  and other budgetary shell games that  have sacrificed the well-being of our  servicemembers to avoid the pain of  cutting big ticket items, but this committee came together in a very bipartisan way to address these problems  and we ended up with a bill that we are  proud of. It is not a perfect bill and I  hope that the next rule will allow for  my colleagues’ amendments that will  make this bill even better.  ",2006

This  policy was rejected every year for the  last 10 years, and I look forward once  more to voting against it.  Current law was signed by President  Clinton  in 1996 and bans the use of  military facilities for abortions except  in the case of incest, rape or where the  life of the mother is at risk.  Rest assured, women in the military  do have access to the elective medical  procedures they want. Therefore, this  debate is not about a woman’s right to  obtain treatment. This debate is about  maintaining the principal mission of  military medical centers to heal and to  protect human life.  Madam Chair, this amendment overturns this mission and turns these facilities  into abortion clinics at  the  American taxpayer’s expense.  I, for one, will not support the use of  Federal funds or military hospitals to  promote or to perform abortions.  ",2006

It would  lift the ban on privately  funded abortion care at overseas military bases where abortion is legal. Currently servicewomen or women military dependents are  forbidden  from  using their own personal funds to obtain an abortion if they are stationed  overseas.  Enacting this amendment will put an  end  to  this  discriminatory  policy  against the 350,000 women in our military who are serving our country each  and every day. We must ensure that  servicewomen overseas are guaranteed  their legal right to access comprehensive health care services. We must demand that servicewomen overseas can  obtain the same quality and range of  medical care available to them in the  United States.  We must protect those who risk their  lives each and every day to protect  their country. Let us reject this administration’s ongoing politically motivated war on women and let’s start by  adopting this important commonsense  amendment.

Military treatment centers, which are dedicated to healing, nurturing and saving  lives, should not be  forced  into the  business of ending lives. This amendment, plain and simple, turns these facilities into abortion clinics by repealing a prolife provision, a prolife provision which was  signed  into  law by  President Clinton as part of the National Defense Authorization Act  in  1996.  This amendment contradicts fundamental U.S. military values such as  honor, courage and taking responsibility for one’s own actions. We believe  that life begins at conception and that  it is sacred. As Members of Congress,  we should do all we can to protect life.  That is what our military hospitals are  doing.  Instead, while we stand here today,  opportunist pro-abortion Members are  once again belittling and devaluing the  sanctity of human life. If this inappropriate amendment were adopted, not  only would taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars be used to perform abortions on  demand on our military bases, but our  military medical personnel would be  forced  to perform abortions against  their will.  b1600  Instead of equipping our armed services personnel with the tools needed to  operate and treat wounded or ill troops  and defend America, this amendment  would mandate that our military personnel  perform  abortions  and  kill  human fetuses. This is unacceptable.  This amendment must be  rejected  today, just as it has been in the past  five Congresses. I urge my colleagues  to join me in protecting human life by  voting against the Davis amendment.  ",2006

641,109,2006-05-10,Ms.  WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ.,"  Madam Chairman, American women  have a constitutional right to choice as  guaranteed by the right to privacy.  However, our  servicewomen and  the  wives and daughters of our servicemembers are denied this basic right  when stationed at military  installations overseas. This amendment guarantees  that women who  selflessly  pledge to defend our Constitution at all  costs are afforded the same rights that  they fight to uphold.  Current law allows women stationed  overseas to access abortion services on  a military base only after an act of  rape or incest or when her life is in  danger. It is bad enough that victims of  rape or incest have to pay for these  procedures out of their own pocket.  But as American women, it is unconscionable that they cannot access the  same safe, clean and legal reproductive  services available to women here the  United States, even if they are paying  for it themselves.  Are we really asking these brave and  noble women, who are ready to make  the ultimate sacrifice, to relinquish  the same rights that they fight so valiantly to uphold and defend?  I encourage my colleagues to stand  with our servicewomen as they put  their lives on the line. Lift the ban on  privately funded abortions and support  this amendment.  ",2006

645,116,2006-05-10,Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  superb work in conference. I rise on behalf of this conference report because I  stand here today on behalf of the next  generation.  We have heard some rhetoric on the  other side, but the fact remains, the  next generation needs new jobs. The  next  generation  needs  economic  growth, and it is fairly clear, contrary  to the rhetoric on the other side, economic growth helps the working class.  It is the key to social justice, and ultimately, it is the solution to our deficit.  We need to leave in place the current  tax policies  that are working,  that  have been so successful in creating the  fastest growth in 20 years, 138,000 jobs  created  last month,  18  consecutive  quarters of growth averaging 3.2 percent. Our trading partners for the most  part cannot match that. We are doing  it because we have put in place clear  growth incentives, including the right  rate on capital gains and the right tax  treatment of dividends.  The other side wants to repeal those  reforms. The  other  side wants,  as  usual, to raise taxes. The other side  wants to talk about revenues that, if  these  tax  rates went up,  probably  would not be realized. There is an absurdity to the tax policy as advocated  on the other side that schedules a capital gains hike, that schedules a phase-  out of the proper tax treatment of dividends, and puts in place all sorts of distortions that ultimately will reduce  the effectiveness of the market.  What we need to do is continue our  commitment to economic growth and  send a clear message to national markets that we are going to continue the  tax treatments, the tax policies, that  have yielded these economic benefits.  Let us pass this legislation. Let us  extend for 2 more years the tax treatment of capital gains. Let us continue  our commitment to economic growth.  May I add, as I was listening to the  comments of the speaker from Michigan, he was mentioning the other taxes  that people pay, other than the income  tax; and he should have noted that  those are their Social Security and  Medicare contributions. For the most  part, those taxes are a process of earning benefits.  It is fairly clear that the Republican  majority has taken thousands of families off of the Federal income tax rolls  to their permanent benefit.  ",2006

So you  can call it payroll, you can call it income tax, but a tax is a tax is a tax.

647,116,2006-05-10,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker, the  Republican rubber-stamp Congress is in  session. Republicans are going to rubber stamp the last act of the budget.  The first act was in December when the  Republicans took from the poor, the  disadvantaged and the foster kids, the  people on  food stamps and students  trying to get a student loan.  The Republicans emptied one Christmas  stocking, but  they  thought  it  would  be unseemly  to  immediately  give it to the rich right in front of the  poor. So they waited and they waited  and they waited, and  finally, today,  they think the people have forgotten  and gone to sleep. So they are going to  give it to the rich.  The party of 1 percent is going to get  a reward. The millionaires are going to  get a windfall for which they did nothing except attend fund-raisers. Every  millionaire will  get  a windfall  of  $41,000. The average American makes  exactly that during a year. He will get  $16. Millionaires, $41,000; ordinary people, $16.  Those are real numbers, no matter  what they say, and that means it is reward the rich, ignore the poor. That is  the Republican rubber stamp of the  President’s views on the world.  They say it will increase savings. The  savings rate in this country is zero. In  fact, it is less than zero. Ninety-nine  percent of the people in this country  are not better off, only the 1 percent  who get the rubber stamp today; and  the rest of America is forced to choose  between filling the gas tank and putting food in the refrigerator.  Now, they all brought their rubber  stamps today, but what they have not  told you, and  I will enter  into the  RECORDat this point the article from  The Washington Post from May 9.  [From washingtonpost.com, May 9, 2006]  ANOTHERPOSSIBLEBUMPTOTHEDEBT  CEILING  (By Jonathan Weisman and Shailagh  Murray)  A $2.7 trillion budget plan pending before  the House would raise the federal debt ceiling to nearly $10 trillion,  less than two  months after Congress last raised the federal  government’s borrowing limit.  The provision—buried on page 121 of the  151-page budget blueprint—serves as a backdrop  to  congressional  action  this week.  House leaders hope to try once again to pass  a budget plan for fiscal 2007, a month after a  revolt by House Republican moderates and  Appropriations Committee members forced  leaders to pull the plan.  Leaders also hope to pass a package of tax-  cut extensions that would cost the Treasury  $70 billion over the next five years. They  would then turn Thursday to a $513 billion  defense policy bill that would block President Bush’s request to raise health-care fees  and co-payments for service members and  their families.  In recent days, Congress has received some  good news on the budget front. A surge of tax  revenues this spring, sparked by economic  growth, prompted the Congressional Budget  Office last Thursday to revise its 2006 deficit  forecast from around $370 billion to as low as  $300 billion. But  the  federal debt keeps  climbing because of continued deficit spending and  the government’s  insatiable borrowing from the Social Security trust fund.  With passage of the budget, the House will  have raised the federal borrowing limit by an  additional $653 billion, to $9.62 trillion. It  would be the fifth debt-ceiling increase in recent years, after boosts of $450 billion in 2002,  a record $984 billion in 2003, $800 billion in  2004 and $653 billion in March. When Bush  took office, the statutory borrowing limit  stood at $5.95 trillion.  Democrats will harp on those statistics not  only in the budget debate but also when the  House takes up tax legislation expected to finally emerge  from House-Senate negotiations today. The legislation would extend for  two years the deep cuts to tax rates on dividends and capital gains that Congress approved in 2003. It would also slow for one  year the expansion of the alternative minimum tax, a parallel income tax system designed to hit affluent but increasingly pinching the middle class.  Although the debate will be rancorous, the  tax measure is expected to pass by a comfortable margin. The budget vote will be  closer. House leaders had to pull the budget  plan from the floor in April, after moderate  Republicans balked at planned cuts to health  and education programs and appropriators  objected  to  limits on home district pet  projects—known as earmarks—and a provision that would limit emergency spending  for natural disasters to about $14 3 billion a  year.  Appropriators have come on board, Appropriations Committee spokesman John Scofield said. GOP leaders and committee chairman Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.) tried to win moderate support last week by cutting $4 billion  from the president’s defense spending request and adding that money to labor, health  and education programs. But  some moderates are still holding out.  ‘‘I expect they do not have the votes right  now,’’ said Rep. Michael N. Castle (R-Del.), a  leader of the balking moderates. ‘‘Could they  get the votes by the end of the week? I’d give  it a 50–50 chance.’’  GOPHEALTH-CAREREDUX  It’s ‘‘health week’’ in the Senate, but don’t  expect any big policy cures. Republicans are  seeking to pass legislation that would restrict malpractice awards and encourage insurance pools among small businesses. The  three bills are GOP perennials that in the  past have met with staunch opposition by  Democrats and interest groups. Given the  high stakes of the midterm election year,  the prospects  this week don’t  look any  brighter. Two of the bills, both aimed at limiting medical malpractice  jury  awards,  stalled in the Senate last night after failing  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:06 May 11, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00116 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10MY7.104 H10MYPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006
648,123,2006-05-10,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this ill-advised, ill-conceived, poorly calculated, and deeply regressive tax bill for the  same reasons that I rose to oppose the tax  cuts of 2001 and the yearly effort by this Congress  to make  them permanent every year  since their approval.  I oppose them for a host of reasons. I oppose them because they are leaving our children and grandchildren with trillions, I say that  again, trillions of dollars of liabilities owned by  the Chinese, the Saudis, the Indians, and the  Europeans. We are  literally mortgaging  the  prosperity of today’s children to the fickle nature of our competitors and rivals.  I oppose  them because  it has  forced our  military to go into battle without proper body  armor on our  troops—soldiers who  largely  come  from  families  that do not benefit  from  these tax cuts—and without blast shields on  our Humvees.  I oppose them because it shifts the tax burden from those who benefit the most from the  success of America,  to  those who are desperately  trying  to  realize  their  American  dream. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the poorest workers under  this  legislation will end up with a  total  tax savings of  two dollars while  those  who earn $1,000,000 or more will pocket a  generous $42,000.  But  this distribution  isn’t  just unfair  to  the  working poor; it is deeply unjust to the middle  class. Families who earn  from $75,000  to  $100,000 will only receive a dollar a day of tax  relief—not even close enough  to cancel out  the higher interest rates on credit cards and  student loans that are resulting because of our  persistent budget deficits.  Finally, I am opposed to this legislation because it excuses this Congress from the tough  decisions that a future Congress and a future  President are going to have to make. We all  know  that  the Alternative Minimum Tax  is  going to hit the middle class hard and to fix it  will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. But  rather than addressing it, we are asking the  Congress of 2012 to take care of our mess.  We know  that  the  retirement of  the Baby  Boomers  is going  to  force massive concessions in our budget, but again, our message is  to  leave  it  to  tomorrow. Let someone else  clean up our mess.  Well, I hate to say, with this Congress and  this President I am not surprised we are asking someone else to take responsibility for yet  another mess.  ",2006
649,123,2006-05-10,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition  to the tax reconciliation bill. Today’s tax budget  reconciliation bill will give  the average  American family an average of $10 per year  from the extension of this tax benefit, or about  enough to cover 3 gallons of gas. They will receive no benefit from the extension until 2009.  Despite  the popular GOP rhetoric about  the  large percentage of Americans  that benefit  from the rate reduction, the average American  family’s share of the total tax cut is approximately 2 percent.  Taxpayers with annual incomes greater than  $10  million  will  receive  approximately  $500,000 in tax reductions per year.  While I do believe we need to create a fix  to the Alternative Minimum Tax problem, today’s bill just pushes off the problem by another year.  I have voted numerous  times  in  favor of AMT relief far larger than the provisions included in the conference report. The  conference report has limited relief that only  applies  in 2006, but protects dividend and  capital gains benefits  through  the close of  2010.  We are paying for this $70 billion tax cut by  deep cuts of $39 billion over 5 years in programs like Medicaid and child support enforcement. The other $31 billion will be added to  the debt.  Medicare  funding was cut by $6.4 billion;  the social security  index by $732 million.  In  New Jersey alone three thousand mothers will  be dropped  from  the Women,  Infants, and  Children (WIC) program, which helps mothers  care  for  their babies before and after birth.  Four hundred children in New Jersey currently  attending Head Start will be cut out of this important childhood education and development  program. More  than 3,200  low-income and  disabled people will be cut  from Section 8  housing vouchers, all in New Jersey alone.  They have also made a college education  more expensive. Cuts—more than $12.76 billion—to  federal  student  financial aid were  made by increasing rates that students pay,  charging students more  fees on  their  loans,  and reductions in subsidies to lenders. This is  the largest cut in history in student loans. The  result will be nearly $8 billion in new charges  that will  raise  the cost of college  loans—  through new fees and higher interest—for millions of American students and families who  borrow to pay for college. For the typical student borrower, already saddled with $17,500  in debt,  these new  fees and higher  interest  charges could cost up to $5,800. Once again,  New Jersey  families were hit—over 125,000  college students  in New Jersey will be affected.  Today’s tax bill cuts $70 billion in taxes and  the reconciliation bill cut $39 billion in spending, so how will the other $31 billion be made  up? By adding to our national debt, putting the  burden on our children and grandchildren. According to the Treasury Department, major foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities total  $2.18  trillion. Currently, China  is  the world’s  second-largest  buyer,  exceeded  only  by  Japan. Furthermore, China’s  purchases  of  U.S. government securities have exploded by  more than 211 percent since the beginning of  2001 and now total $311 billion.  This situation is dangerous because it is a  major way that we are funding the federal government—by selling our debt to the Chinese.  In 1980, 17 percent of the federal debt held by  the public was in foreign hands. By 2006, 45  percent of  the debt held by  the public was  owned  overseas. Unfortunately,  this  trend  seems  to be  increasing  rapidly. During  the  past year, approximately 90 percent of  the  debt we have accumulated has been purchased by foreign banks, individuals and governments.  The high  level of  foreign holdings of U.S.  securities could have a debilitating impact on  our economy and  foreign policy.  If China  threatened  to  sell  large  volumes  of U.S.  Treasury securities, it could easily fuel higher  inflation and put pressure on the Federal Reserve  to  increase  interest  rates, putting our  economy at risk for a large-scale recession.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose  this tax reconciliation bill, because we can do  better.  ",2006

This gimmick-laden  piece of  legislation will require  taxpayers  to  borrow another $70 billion so that the wealthiest Americans can keep  their  taxes  low  in  2009 and 2010. What kind of priorities favor  the wealthy in the future over working families  today? We can ill afford the continued ‘‘tax cut  and spend’’ mentality  that has marked  the  House during  the  last  few years.

The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 8 printed in House Report  109–459 offered by Mr. GUTKNECHT:  At the end of subtitle B of title VI (page  220, after line 8), add the following new section:  SEC. 624. ELIMINATION OF INEQUITY IN ELIGIBILITY AND PROVISION OF ASSIGNMENT INCENTIVE PAY.  (a) SENSEOFCONGRESS.—It is the sense of  Congress that the Secretary of the Army  should promptly correct the pay inequity in  the provision of assignment incentive pay  under section 307a of title 37, United States  Code, to members of the Army National  Guard and the Army Reserve serving on active duty in Afghanistan and Iraq that arose  from the disparite treatment between—  (1) those members who previously served  under a call or order to active duty under  section 12302 of title 10, United States Code,  and who are eligible for assignment incentive pay; and  (2) those members who previously served  under a call or order to active duty under  section 12304 of such title and who are currently  ineligible  for assignment  incentive  pay.  (b) REPORTREQUIRED.—Not later than 30  days after the date of the enactment of this  Act, the Secretary of the Army shall submit  to Congress a report—  (1) specifying the number of members of  the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve adversely affected by the disparate  treatment afforded  to members who previously served under a call or order to active  duty under section 12304 of title 10, United  States Code, in determining eligibility for  assignment incentive pay; and  (2) containing proposed remedies or courses  of action to correct this inequity, including  allowing time served during a call or order  to active duty under such section 12304 to  count toward the time needed to qualify for  assignment incentive pay.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to  House Resolution 806, the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. GUTKNECHT) and a  Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Minnesota.  ",2006
653,130,2006-05-10,Mr. GUTKNECHT.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself 11⁄2minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I will try to make this  as simple as I can. We have one of the  largest deployments right now of National Guardsmen  from the State of  Minnesota since World War II. It has  created a disparity.  Back in January, members of the 1st  Platoon Bravo Company asked my office to help with a pay problem. It just  so happens that most of them were  called up to serve in the Balkans back  in 2003. Part of them were called up  under a Presidential Reserve Call Up,  and others were called up under a Partial Mobilization.  What this has led to is a discrepancy  in how much they may be eligible for  in terms of what we used to describe as  combat pay. The bottom line is that  about 400 members of the Minnesota  National Guard, who will be doing the  same duty as the other members of the  National Guard in Iraq, will not be eligible  for roughly $7,000  in  incentive  pay. This is an inequity. It is unfair,  and it is something that we in Congress  can and should do something about.  I want to thank the chairman of the  committee and the ranking member  and the staff as well. We have been  working with them for several weeks  and they have been extremely helpful  on this matter. Hopefully tonight we  can adopt this amendment and send a  clear message to the Pentagon that  this inequity needs to be resolved and  it needs to be resolved soon.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2006
654,130,2006-05-10,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Chairman, I ask  unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I do not oppose  the amendment and I am unaware of  anyone on our side of the aisle who opposes this amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Arkansas?  There was no objection.  ",2006
655,130,2006-05-10,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I think this is a very  straightforward amendment supported  by the entire Minnesota delegation. My  understanding  is  it  expresses  very  clearly that we expect people who perform equally for their government are  meant to be treated equally. I also ask  for the study and I support the amendment, as does this side of the aisle.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2006
656,130,2006-05-10,Mr. GUTKNECHT.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for his comments.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 11⁄2minutes to  the gentleman  from Minnesota  (Mr.  KLINE).  ",2006
657,130,2006-05-10,Mr. KLINE.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  for his leadership on  for yielding me this  this  issue and  time.  I rise today in strong support of this  amendment. In my 25 years of military  service, sadly I have witnessed other  examples of pay discrepancies. It is unfortunate that even today such issues  arise, but I am pleased to be in a position now to help solve this problem.  In a true sign of their dedication to  duty and camaraderie, many members  Mr. GUTKNECHT Mr. GUTKNECHT of the 34th Brigade Combat Team volunteered to join their fellow Guardsmen in Iraq despite having previously  deployed to Bosnia and Kosovo. I was  disappointed  to hear  that many of  these dedicated citizen-soldiers were  denied incentive pay simply because of  the administrative mechanism used to  mobilize them. This is not the way we  as a nation should treat those who  have volunteered to serve.  and I promptly engaged the House Armed Services Committee professional staff to help solve  this problem. As a member of  the  House  Military  Personnel  Subcommittee,  I was  gratified  by  the  staff’s prompt action, and I would like  to thank them as well as Chairman  and Chairman HUNTER for  their efforts.  I would also like to commend the entire Minnesota  delegation  for  their  strong support in both the House and  Senate.  This past week, my staff delivered a  letter signed by the entire delegation  to the Department of Defense requesting their assistance in resolving this  inequity, and I will include a copy of  the letter for the RECORD.  This amendment is a fitting addition  to that initial effort, and it is my hope  it will help spur the resolution of this  significant problem.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  MCHUGH CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  Washington, DC, May 4, 2006.  Hon. THOMASF. HALL,  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, Washington, DC.  DEARSECRETARYHALL: We are writing to  request a review and adjustment of the current policy regarding Assignment Incentive  Pay (AIP). Several activated members of the  Minnesota National Guard (MNNG), now deployed to Iraq, recently brought to our attention a pay technicality that makes the  distribution of AIP inequitable. Specifically,  under current finance rules, the soldiers who  previously deployed and served in Kosovo are  eligible for AIP, whereas the soldiers who  previously deployed and served in Bosnia are  not. We believe these soldiers, whether having served in Kosovo or in Bosnia, should be  treated equally for purposes of AIP eligibility.  After consulting with House Armed Services Committee staff, we conclude that this  would best be treated as a Department of Defense (DOD) policy matter. There appears to  be nothing in the law that would preclude  DOD from modifying the technical eligibility  criteria, making these soldiers, and others  like them, eligible for AIP.  Enclosed please find the letter we received  from the MNNG soldiers who brought this  matter to our attention. Also enclosed is a  letter from Major General Larry W. Shellito,  Adjutant General of  the MNNG. General  Shellito’s letter supports our view that a  change to current policy regarding AIP is  needed.  After an initial review of this issue, we  would request an update from your office. If  you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Fred Chesbro in Congressman  John Kline’s office at (202) 225–2271.  Sincerely,  John Kline; Martin Olav Sabo; James L.  Oberstar;  Collin  C.  Peterson;  Jim  Ramstad; Mark Kennedy; Mark Dayton; Gil Gutknecht; Betty McCollum;  Norm Coleman.

658,137,2006-05-10,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. CARDIN).  (Mr. CARDIN asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
659,137,2006-05-10,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker, I must  tell you that I agree and have been  talking to my seniors that they need  to, and I quote, ‘‘review carefully all  the options that are available to them  and determine whether enrollment in a  Medicare prescription drug plan best  meets their needs.’’  I have had over 30 town hall meetings  since this bill has been enacted, and at  these meetings I have had people from  our Office on Aging to help seniors go  through the different options to make  a decision whether they need or they  don’t need to join a plan and which  plan they should join.  But, Mr. Speaker, the problem is, the  information that was made available to  them when this bill was passed was  wrong. The information is extremely  confusing. In my State we have 47 or 48  different plans with deductibles that  range by great numbers, and it is very  difficult for my constituents to understand this bill.  I have gotten e-mails from people in  Maryland who tell me the bill is very  confusing, and they should at least be  allowed more time to make a decision.  I got e-mails saying that this one constituent is going to make a decision,  but he is not sure whether it is right or  wrong because he needed more time  and he doesn’t have that time.  So, Mr. Speaker, yes, we want our  constituents to make the right decision, and we urge them to focus in on  making the right decision, but it is absolutely wrong that we are not extending the May 15 deadline. Our constituents need more time, and we certainly  shouldn’t be imposing a lifetime penalty because a senior perhaps makes  the wrong decision in part because of  our failure to get the right information  to our constituents.  Mr. Speaker, I would have hoped that  we would be using the time now to correct this bill. This bill is structurally  flawed. We need to make this a real  benefit within Medicare. We need to  take on the cost of prescription drugs.  We need to deal with the coordination  of the benefits with retiree benefits so  that retirement plans don’t terminate  retirees’ prescription drug  coverage.  We need to do all that.  We need to cover drugs that aren’t  covered today. I could tell you of a person  in my district, Barbara Waters,  who had her drugs for epilepsy covered  before this bill was passed, and now it  is not covered because it is under a  class of drugs not covered under Medicare. We need to correct that. There is  a whole group of organizations that are  urging us to correct the bill.  So I appreciate the fact that we have  a resolution on the floor urging seniors  to focus on what is in their best interests under the law we passed, but what  we should be doing is having a bill on  the floor giving our seniors more time,  eliminating this penalty and then correcting  the mistakes  that we made  when we passed this bill.  ",2006
660,137,2006-05-10,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. KINGSTON).  ",2006
661,137,2006-05-10,Mr.  KINGSTON.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentlewoman  from Connecticut  for yielding  and  the  gentleman from Georgia for his leadership  on this issue.  I want to tell the story about Bennie  and Katheryn, real people in Vidalia,  Georgia. This is a couple who was paying $2,200 a month for their prescription drug bill. One of my staffers happened to be related to them and heard  about it, and he went over there and  sat down with them on all their drug  needs and went over the website. He  did not make a recommendation, but  he showed them the information and  they made their own choice. Now their  total drug cost has gone from $2,200 a  month to $104 a month, a 95 percent  savings.  When they saw stuff like that, they  did not believe it was possible, because  they too had heard some of the rhetoric, some of the angry, some of the  bitter rhetoric that comes out of Washington, D.C., and they thought, well,  there is no way. But, in fact they are  enjoying it now, and they need that  extra income just like so many other  millions of seniors do around the country.  Mr. Speaker,  I heard  former Secretary of Health and Human Services  Tommy  Thompson  say  that when  Gladys starts talking to Mabel, this  thing will really take hold. And, indeed, that is the truth. My office has  had 48 workshops helping people decide  which program works for them. Maybe  it doesn’t work for them, because I am  always quick to say, it might not be  the best thing for everybody. That is  part of what a public offering is. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.  But  it works  for most people. It  is  about a 50 percent to 60 percent savings  for most people. Bennie got a 95 percent savings. Not everybody is going to  get that.  But  the  interesting  thing  is  that  Gladys is talking to Mabel, because my  always quotes  Ronald Reagan in saying that markets  are more powerful than armies. In this  case we have an army of people saying  this is a horrible program that should  be thrown away, thrown out; it is bad,  it is wicked, it is the Republicans up to  no good.  But look at the market. In my district, with my 48 workshops, our market penetration  is about 70 percent  right now. The interesting thing is one  friend GILGUTKNECHT of my colleagues who is not in favor of  this bill has about the same penetration, and he hasn’t held one workshop.  That  is one  the  ironies  of  it.  I  thought I am going to go out as a  salesperson and really wave the flag  and tell everybody how great it is. I am  irrelevant. The market is more powerful than the army, the army for it or  the army against  it. The market  is  selling this thing, not the Republican  Party, not the Democrat Party, wherever they may stand on it at the moment.  The reality is the seniors like it, and  the reality is our seniors need it, because so many of them were having to  choose between food on their table and  prescription drugs.  My mom, who takes Tamoxifen from  now on for the rest of her life, and my  dad who has diabetes and their friends,  they have some choices. Not everybody  is going to sign up for it, but everybody  is aware that the program is out there.  I will close with a quote from my  good friend from Minnesota, who had  voted against this bill. He said he has  moved from being an atheist to an agnostic, but pretty soon he is going to  be a holy roller and a believer like everybody  else,  because markets  are  stronger than armies.  ",2006
662,137,2006-05-10,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from  Chicago,  Illinois  (Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY), who has been fighting in  her district to explain this bill and to  improve it.  ",2006
663,137,2006-05-10,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, there are times that I  wonder whether my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle live in a different reality from the rest of us. This  resolution encourages senior citizens  and persons with disabilities to carefully review all the part D private plan  options  before  them  and  determine  whether to purchase a policy.  We all want senior citizens and disabled people to make informed choices,  and we have been helping them, but the  reality is there is no way that the millions of beneficiaries who have not enrolled are going to be able to do that in  the next 5 days.  The  Republican  resolution  completely ignores the complicated mess  that the Republican Congress created  in part D. It ignores the fact that current HHS Secretary Leavitt’s parents,  who he helped, got it wrong and had to  change plans.  It ignores the Kaiser Family Foundation report that nearly half of all citizens don’t know about the May 15 deadline or the lifetime financial punishment they will face if they miss it, permanent higher premiums as  long as  they live.  It ignores the GAO report that the  Medicare hotline gave inaccurate or inadequate information on which was the  best plan to 60 percent of the callers.  It ignores the fact that independent  counselors are inundated and unable to  provide unbiased advice to sort out the  dozens of private plans available.

665,144,2006-05-10,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Yes. That is not all  he said, Mr. Speaker.  Again, this is Mr. Toomey, President  of Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group, who served in this Congress, Mr. Speaker, and this is what he  is saying about the Republican Congress:  ‘‘Republicans have  abandoned  the principles of limited government  and fiscal discipline that historically  have united Republicans and energized  the Republican base. Too many Republicans have gotten too comfortable in  office.’’  That is what Pat Toomey, a former  colleague, a member of this Congress a  short time ago, is now saying about the  Bush Congress.  ",2006
666,144,2006-05-10,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  agree with the gentleman and I agree  with former Congressman Toomey. As  you made the point about the wealthiest,  the millionaires getting  $42,000  back and the missed priorities and the  schoolteacher in Ohio who is making  $35,000 or $40,000 and getting just a few  dollars back, we are not saying that  the wealthy person does not make a  certain contribution to society because  they  do. Make  profits  and make  money, we want you to. But there is  just as much value to our society by  the teacher.  ",2006
667,144,2006-05-10,Mr. DELAHUNT., We are saying let us  be fair. Fairness here.  ,2006
668,144,2006-05-10,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," And who actually  needs the tax cut is that person who is  a  home  health  care  aide,  driving  around, and the gas prices are high and  everything else.  Mr. DELAHUNT talked  about  borrowing the money to do this and who  we are borrowing it from. This is from  2001 to 2005, of the $1.18 trillion in debt  that the Bush presidency, the Bush  House and Bush Senate racked up, $1.16  trillion of the $1.18 trillion came from  foreign nations. We are not even borrowing  the money  from  National  Citibank or some bank  in our own  country, we are borrowing this money  from the Chinese government or the  Japanese government. That at the end  of the day makes us weak.  I want to show one more chart here.  This is the public debt held by China.  It has quadrupled under Bush. It was  $62 billion in 2000, and it is $257 billion  in 2005.  ",2006
669,144,2006-05-10,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Mr. Speaker, if the  gentleman would yield, I asked this  today in a hearing in the International  Relations  Committee  of  Secretary  Zoellick, and he indicated that now the  debt is $262 billion that is owed by the  United States Government to the Chinese.  ",2006
670,144,2006-05-10,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," And so if you are  sitting in a community in Ohio or in  the industrial Midwest or in New England or somewhere across this country  where the jobs you have are being lost  to China, and then you know that your  government at the same time is borrowing money from China, and the Chinese government is using that money  to undermine American business in the  United States of America and we continue to borrow it, and that is just in  the past year or so, another $5 billion  has been borrowed from the Chinese.  This is going on again and again.  The reason I bring this up is today we  expanded this. We increased this even  more. The $42,000 that we are going to  give a millionaire, we do not have it.  DELAHUNT ",2006
671,144,2006-05-10,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Mr.  Speaker, I think we are going to need  to do these charts on dry erase boards  from now on because it changes so rapidly and in the wrong direction that we  are wasting public resources by printing them on unchangeable paper.  ",2006
672,144,2006-05-10,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Right. The money  we pay in interest every year, $230 billion a year, we pay in interest on the  debt. That is interest on the debt. Compared to education and homeland security and veterans, this is the number  we are paying on interest. This is reckless spending. This is a Congress that  has  run away with  the  checkbook.  They are taking the country off a cliff  financially without  any  regard  for  what this is costing future generations.  This group started to talk about optimism and what the future was going  to look like.  ",2006
673,144,2006-05-10,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I  cannot help but take this rubber stamp  out. How did we get to where we are  right now? It is not because of good  policy making. It was not good policy  making. It was because the Republican  Congress, Mr. Speaker, has said, Mr.  President, whatever you want, regardless of how bad it may make our fiscal  situation in this country, we are willing to endorse it.  b2045  Today, in the Washington Post, folks  want to talk about, if they think Mr.  just came up with  these  numbers, go on to Washingtonpost.com  and they are right here, as it relates to  what you will get if this budget passes  the way the Republican administration  wants it to pass.  And I think it is important that people realize that it is not the people that  you send here to Washington, D.C., to  represent you; it is the White House.  Still, the Republican Congress is saying, even at low approval ratings, Mr.  President, we are with you all the way.  Whatever you want, we are willing to  rubber-stamp it and we are willing to  follow your lead, even if it is in the  wrong direction, even if gas prices are  higher now, even if we are borrowing  record breaking, we are making history  in borrowing $1.05 trillion and counting  from foreign nations, that is okay.  Even if it comes down to us defending  a special oil deal, and then we had it  turn around on you, but even at the beginning, allowing it to happen, we are  with you all the way. Mr. President,  whatever you say, we are going to rubber-stamp it.  So I think it is important, when you  think of this Republican majority, Mr.  Speaker, and I think when a number of  our Members look in the mirror, especially on the other side of the aisle, a  rubber stamp has to be somewhere in  the background because that is what  has happened, and that is what has got  us in the situation that we are in now,  and the American people see it, crystal  clear.  This is not a Democratic issue. I am  going to yield to you in one second.

674,151,2006-05-10,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," You  are absolutely right. One of the other  elements of our alternative budget plan  would embrace once again, as was the  policy during the Clinton administration and when Democrats controlled  the United States Congress, was the  concept of PAYGO.  b2145  That is, I know, with you as a member of the Budget Committee and Mr.  SPRATTas the ranking member, is an  idea  that  our Democratic Members  have championed as a part of our alternative. And we have done that on a  number of occasions and attempted to  get the Republicans to go along with us  and the concept of PAYGO.  PAYGO is very simple. We came from  States, and in our State legislatures  you have to operate in the black. Just  like people who are members of their  families, they struggle not to have to  go into debt, not to have to live paycheck to paycheck and not to have to  go into massive credit card debt.  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership here does not subscribe to that  philosophy, and that is evidenced by  their rejection of pay-as-you-go rules  whereby we would not spend more than  we have.  On March 17 of last year, Mr. SPRATT,  our ranking member on the Budget  Committee,  offered  a  substitute  amendment to the 2006 budget resolution that failed 165 to 264, no Republicans supporting pay-as-you-go legislation. And we have the rollcall indicating that we were supportive.  Again, Mr. SPRATT offered another  amendment dealing with PAYGO that  would have reestablished PAYGO, 224  Republicans voting ‘‘no,’’ none voting  ‘‘yes,’’ and it failed, to 232. So we have  certainly tried. It is not for our lack of  trying to make sure that we restore  some fiscal discipline here.  The thing that has been the most  frustrating for me as a new Member of  Congress, and I am sure it is a frustration you have faced, is that the Republicans try to lead people to believe that  they are the party of fiscal responsibility. Yet, I am someone who believes  that actions have to back up words and  talk is cheap, and that seems to be all  that they have been about since I have  gotten here.  ",2006
675,151,2006-05-10,Ms. SCHWARTZ of Pennsylvania.," It  was  interesting  in the Budget Committee when we talked about the principle that you are talking about, that  we should know where the revenues are  coming from if we are going to spend  money. That  is really what we are  talking about.  It is basically being unable to meet  their obligations. It is knowing where  that money is coming from. Of course,  we do budget not just for next year, but  we budget out 5 years. We used to  budget to 10 years. But we do see those  kinds of numbers so we can anticipate  what we think might be happening.  And what was interesting about that  discussion in the Budget Committee is  that there, in fact, is some interest, I  think, on the other side of the aisle in  doing this. They understand as well  that, I think some of them do know, of  course, they would not let that pass,  but in fact I think if we really, truly  could sit down in a bipartisan way and  say, look, we have a responsibility to  do this in a way that does not create a  debt we do not even have any way of  repaying at this point.  The Republicans  have,  of  course,  taken certain things off budget. That  means, of course, that let’s not really  consider what the cost to Katrina is,  for example; the real cost of the war in  Iraq and Afghanistan in which some estimates in the budget this year have  been $50 billion when we know that it  could well get up to $400 billion.  Well, if you know that, we have to be  straight with the American people. We  have to be able to say, this is what we  know it is going to cost us. How are we  going to have the revenues to support  that? Where is it going to come from?  Let’s have that as a serious discussion  and  let’s make the hard choices we  have to make.  We know we want to support our  troops. We want to make sure that  they have all the equipment they need.  That has been a discussion. Of course,  we will support the troops in that. But  let’s be real about what it will cost us  and let’s be honest with the American  people about how we will do that.  I think there is some interest on the  other side of the aisle, but in fact if we  do that, there is no way they could go  ahead with the kind of budget that we  will be faced with tomorrow because it  does not reveal all that we need to  know about what our obligations are.  And as you point out, for American  families who struggle every day to figure out how do they pay, we talk about  gasoline prices. That throws budgets  into a real problem when you have  budgeted really tight.  It is not a problem to budget really  tight if you do not have any contingency, if you are not really honest with  yourself that there will be an expense  next month. But in fact we are making  it harder on American families by not  being honest with them.  And we are making it harder on them  by not bringing down gasoline prices.  We are making it harder on them by  not helping their kids going to college.  We are making it harder on them by  not allowing ways for us to be sure  that their business can pay for health  insurance.  You can almost name any issue and  we are making it harder on American  families when in fact it does not have  to be that way.  ",2006
676,151,2006-05-10,Mr. CLEAVER.," May I inquire of the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, Congressman CARNAHAN and  I are  from  Missouri. We are in the middle of the  country and we are not prone to extremes, so we believe you are supposed  to balance the budget. Congressman  father was the Governor  twice in the State of Missouri; he balCARNAHAN’s  anced the budget. I had to do the same  as Mayor of Kansas City.  In fact, there is a State law in Missouri that you must balance your budgets. There is no such thing as you did  not do it this year. You must balance  the budget.  ",2006

678,151,2006-05-10,Mr. CLEAVER.," Maybe as a member  of the Budget Committee you can help  me understand why the money for the  gulf  coast  reconstruction  and  the  money  for Iraq was not budgeted. I  mean, we do not have two of the most  costly  items  in  the  U.S.  budget  factored in, and as a new Member that  troubles me.  It would trouble the American public  if they knew. You mean you do not put  in the cost of the war in Iraq? You  mean you do not add in the budget the  rebuilding of the most devastated region  in  the history  of  the United  States? Well, how are we going to do  it?  So maybe you could address that.  ",2006
679,151,2006-05-10,Ms.  SCHWARTZ  of Pennsylvania.,"  There is an explanation. I cannot necessarily and I do not want to make explanations about why it was done this  year.  I will  talk about  that  for a  minute.  The fact is that it is reasonable for  us to say that there is going to be an  emergency that happens in this country that we cannot budget for. Katrina  is an example. We could not have anticipated that a year ahead of time  there would be an emergency as catastrophic as Katrina and the devastation it caused in the gulf States. And I  have been there and many of you have  been there to see the devastation.  So that is why we allow for a process  that we can have a supplemental appropriations. We get an emergency appropriation, as it is called; and that is  appropriate because we need  to act  quickly. We need to act appropriately  to help Americans.  We have done it to help people in  other countries as well.  That is certainly true in time of war  as well. If you go to war, you did not  anticipate going to war. Then you have  an emergency appropriation, a supplemental is what we call it, and that is  appropriate.  What  is  less understandable and  I  think that you make clear  is what  about a year later? What about 2 years  later? Why cannot we anticipate at  least in a better way what in fact the  costs will be to clean up in Katrina? If  we are wrong, we might need to do a  supplemental.  But now to not say we are in Iraq.  There is a cost; we know what it is  costing us every week. We know what  it is costing us every month to put $50  billion in when all the estimations are  that it will be at least $200, probably  $300 billion at least. It is really just not  being honest about what it is going to  cost us in the future.  For Katrina, again let’s decide what  we can accommodate to pay for and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:32 May 11, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00151 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10MY7.190 H10MYPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006
680,165,2006-05-10,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, the problem with the Enzi bill is laid out in  great detail in a report filed by the minority of the HELP Committee. This is  not a question of my not liking the  bill, it is not a question of Democrats  versus Republicans, it is a question of  the bill not being good. It is not a good  bill, as indicated by 41 attorneys general. Forty-one attorneys general have  signed letters saying the Enzi bill is  not good for their States. These attorneys  general  are  from Democratic  States and Republican States. Insurance commissioners from around the  country have acknowledged that the  bill is not a good bill. The bill is opposed by 206 different advocacy groups  and  health  care  organizations,  disability groups, and professional organizations.  For  example, we know  that  the  American Association of Retired People opposes this legislation. I was able  to speak to Mr. Novelli a couple of  times about this bill while it was moving through the system, and AARP believes the bill is very hurtful to senior  citizens, as well as the Small Business  Majority, the National Health Council,  and the Lance Armstrong Foundation.  As I said, more than 200 different organizations think this legislation is bad  for the American people.  I have been led to believe that when  this bill is brought to the floor, the 30  hours doesn’t expire postcloture on the  motion to proceed until sometime this  afternoon. We have agreed to go to the  bill at an earlier time. But it is not  going to give the people in our country  the opportunity to move forward on  progressive, strong legislation. We will  be stuck with the Enzi bill, and AARP  doesn’t think it is going to go anyplace. The amendments will be controlled by Senator ENZI. If he likes the  amendment, he will allow us to offer it.  If he doesn’t, he won’t. I submit that is  not the way we should move forward on  legislation  brought  forward  during  Health Care Week dealing with health  care reform.  There are many  issues  related  to  health care we need to deal with. There  are issues that are so fundamental to  what is going on in the country today,  and we believe the proposal put forward by Senator LINCOLN from Arkansas, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator BAUCUS, and  of course a person who has worked very  hard on this  legislation  for months,  Senator DURBIN, should be the legislation we debate. But it will not be. We  should have the opportunity to offer  amendments relating to postponing the  May 15 cutoff line of the eligibility for  Medicare drug benefits. That  is not  going to be allowed.  We should be able to offer legislation  dealing with the ability of Medicare to  be competitive and bid for drugs at a  lower price. That won’t be able to be  offered.  We should be able to offer an amendment dealing with stem cell research,  giving hope to millions of Americans.  We won’t be able to do that. That is  unfortunate.  Walking into the Chamber today, I  was asked by someone: Tell us what  you stand  for.  I think, rather than  what I stand for, what we stand for as  a minority, it is who we stand for. I  think that is the direction we should  be focusing: Who do we stand for?  There are lots of people we stand for.  We stand for parents with no health  care. We stand for those people with  maladies who are crying out for some  research on stem cells so we can move  forward  finding cures  for  these diseases—Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes.  We stand for children who are attending failing schools because the Bush  administration refuses to put money  into the schools that needs it. It is reported today that very soon there will  be 10,000 schools in America that will  be failing. I don’t think that speaks  well. Why are they failing? It is because of this Leave No Child Behind  Act that the President pushed so hard.  We stand for the soccer mom who,  today, someplace, is going to fill up her  vehicle with gasoline and find the price  is prohibitive.

Given the track record of the administration and the mismanagement of the  prescription drug program and the fact  that there is genuine concern and confusion among seniors, what reason did  the administration give you for not following  your  extremely  reasonable,  sound suggestion that could make a  difference for seniors all over the country?  ",2006
682,172,2006-05-10,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," I thank the  distinguished Senator for his question.  The answer is, I have asked representatives of the administration in two different committees this same question.  The  answer  comes  back,  cold-  heartedly: We have a deadline. We have  to enforce that deadline or people will  not make a decision.  I understand the necessity of a deadline. The nature of human beings is  that we often procrastinate. But there  are  compassionate  exceptions  that  ought to be considered. This is one.  Coming from a State, as I do, with a  high  percentage  of  our  population  made up of senior citizens, this certainly ought to be a compassionate exception.  ",2006
683,172,2006-05-10,Mr. DURBIN., Will the Senator yield  for a question?  ,2006
684,172,2006-05-10,Mr. NELSON of Florida., I am happy  to yield to the distinguished assistant  minority leader.  ,2006
685,172,2006-05-10,Mr. DURBIN.," I understand we are  only about 5 days away from the deadline for people to sign up for Medicare  prescription Part D. I know the Senator has joined me and others in suggesting this program could have been  done differently, a lot fairer, a lot simpler, could have more competition so  that seniors would have had even lower  drug prices. Sadly, major parts of it  were written by the pharmaceutical industry and by the insurance industry.  I know the Senator from Florida has  spoken to many seniors, as I have, and  knows that as they have tried to understand the program and sign up for it,  some of them have been overwhelmed.  In Illinois, there are over 45 different  programs  from which  to  choose.  I  talked to pharmacists, who are a good  source of information, who tell me the  seniors come in, throw up their hands,  and say: What are we supposed to do?  I ask the Senator from Florida, when  you reflect on the fact that there are  some  35.8 million Medicare  beneficiaries who have drug coverage, according to the administration, isn’t it  true that 70 percent of those people—  more than 26 million—already had prescription drug coverage before this program was underway? And of the 16 million who previously did not have coverage, about  10 million or  so have  signed up. So we still have about 6 million of the 16 we were trying to sign up  for drug coverage—sounds to me like a  substantial percentage, 6 million—who  have not signed up at this point, about  40 percent. They are facing a penalty.  Do I understand the Senator  from  Florida has joined with others, including myself, in legislation extending the  deadline for signing up, also saying to  the seniors: If you made a mistake in  choosing a program, we will give you a  makeover, a do over, so that you can  change the program within 1 year without penalty? I ask the Senator to explain.  ",2006
686,172,2006-05-10,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," The distinguished Senator  from Illinois understands correctly. If the deadline were  extended until the end of the year, the  administration’s own figures are that  an additional 1 million-plus senior citizens would sign up of that group of 6 or  7 million. If that is a million seniors  who would not  suffer  the economic  hardship of an additional 6 or 7 percent  penalty or the economic hardship of  not being able to have the right drug  they need because they signed up with  a mistaken decision of a wrong formulary, then is that not worth it for  the sake of the senior citizens to grant  a compassionate extension?  ",2006
687,172,2006-05-10,Mr. DURBIN.," I ask the Senator from  Florida, does he believe, as I do, that if  we would have allowed the Medicare  Program to bargain with the drug companies to get, by bulk discount, the  lowest prices for seniors, just the way  the Veterans Administration does, that  the end result would have been at least  one kind of standard program, Medicare Program, with lower prices which  other private companies could have  competed with, if they chose? Wouldn’t  that have offered the lowest price to  the seniors and one simple standard  program to turn to if they had any  doubts about the right choice?  ",2006
688,172,2006-05-10,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," The Senator  is correct. As a matter of fact, it is  something the Federal Government has  OFFICER.  been doing for over two decades in the  Veterans Administration.  The Veterans Administration buys prescription  drugs in bulk. As a result, the cost to  veterans is $7 per month for their prescription drugs. Using the law of economics  in  the private  free marketplace, buying drugs in bulk, you can  negotiate the price down. But when  this body passed the prescription drug  bill 3 years ago, Medicare, the Federal  Government, was prohibited from purchasing  in bulk and negotiating the  price down.  ",2006
689,172,2006-05-10,Mr. DURBIN.," How much time remains, Mr. President?  The  PRESIDING  than 1 minute.  ",2006
690,172,2006-05-10,Mr. DURBIN., The administration has  argued the reason they didn’t let Medicare bargain down in bulk discounts is  because they wanted the market to  work its will. Am I correct in remembering that they also appropriated hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize  the  insurance  companies  that were  going to offer this? Is that kind of massive Federal subsidy consistent with  free market economics?  ,2006
691,172,2006-05-10,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," The Senator’s point is not only correct, but it  is so pointed that anyone who hears it  should suddenly say: Ouch.  ",2006

705,179,2006-05-10,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  we are in the midst of Health Week.  Apparently, during Health Week, we  don’t pass any of the bills the American people want but, rather, we schedule procedural votes.  Why aren’t we taking up something  such as stem cell research? That  is  what the American people want to see  us do. There is such value in the use of  stem cells for research and potential  treatment of all types of diseases. Despite all the promises of stem cell research, we are not working on it this  week. This week we are simply doing  our political stuff: posturing for the  next election.  There are other  important health  care issues besides stem cell research  that we could be taking up; namely,  Medicare. We should be discussing that  on the floor of the Senate. We should  be passing  legislation to extend the  Medicare enrollment date past May 15.  Right now, under the present Medicare drug plan, if you don’t sign up by  this coming Monday, you will be penalized permanently for signing up late.  Millions of Americans are having serious problems understanding this outrageously complex Medicare plan, but  the administration, the President of  the United States is saying: Hurry up  and make the choice, we are not going  to extend the enrollment date. It is insulated from what reality is. It is too  bad.  In New Jersey, seniors have to choose  among 45 plans offered by 19 providers,  and we are saying rush, rush, rush.  Most people can’t get through the language, no less the dates and those requirements. But the administration is  saying to my constituents that even  though their health is at issue, they  have to rush to a decision. It sounds  like this is a deadline that nothing can  move and, unfortunately, that is the  truth coming from this administration.  If we want to talk about health initiatives, Republican health initiatives,  let’s talk about the one that  is  in  place, this horrible new Medicare plan.  We have seen the Republican model  of health care, and it is not pretty. In  fact, many have called it a disaster.  One need only pick up the local newspapers to see this disaster play out  from Maui to Miami, from Portland,  OR, to Portland, ME. The new Medicare drug plan is failing our seniors.  We  see  it  demonstrated  in  this  placard in the headlines: The Boston  Globe:  Many seniors say Medicare drug plan will  not help them.  Newsday:  Medicare guide is in need of Rx.  The New York Times:  Drug plan enrollment opens amid confusion.  It goes through all of these well-  known newspapers, showing the opinions they are hearing from their constituents.  How did we get there? This Medicare  Part D Program is an example of the  majority vision for the future of health  care in our Nation. One thing that is  pretty clear about Medicare Part D is  that whoever wrote it was clearly not  focusing on the health of our seniors,  and if the goal were to help our seniors,  there would not be this thing called the  donut hole, a gap in coverage.  Many Americans  have  not  heard  about it or don’t know what this coverage gap is. When I explain it to people  listening at home, they are not  even going to believe it. But it is true  because I have heard about it when I  address people all across our State.  The way the program works is that  for many people, in the middle of the  year when you have spent $2,250 on  drugs, which is not a lot of money considering the drug use  for preserving  health and  for prolonging  life, their  prescription drug coverage will stop at  $2,250. They will not have any coverage, but they will still have to pay  the premium.  What does that mean? It means that  sometime in the summer or fall of this  year, millions of Americans will walk  into a pharmacy for their medication  and the pharmacist  is going to ask  them for hundreds of dollars in payment. When the person says, Wait a  minute,  I have Medicare,  the pharmacist will say: Yes, but you are in the  donut hole, when you don’t get any  benefit until you reach spending over  $5,100; so you will have to pay the full  price now.  It makes no sense. It is hard to understand, but unfortunately it is true  and it is happening. My office has been  contacted by constituents who experience this problem, and we are trying to  help them, but this is only the beginning.  Another senseless component of the  Republican Medicare law is the prohibition that prevents Medicare—can you  believe this—prevents Medicare  from  negotiating prices directly with  the  pharmaceutical  companies. The VA  permits that and the discounts are significant. But you can’t do that in Medicare because the focus is to protect the  companies rather than it is to protect  the citizens.  I come from New Jersey, home of the  world’s leading drug companies. And I  admire these companies. Their discoveries have saved the  lives of untold  millions of people. To be quite honest,  they are often targets of unfair criticism. But I don’t see any reason to prohibit Medicare from negotiating prices  with these companies. Medicare, the  largest health care system in the entire world, is prevented from negotiating with these companies. The Republican Medicare law prohibits Medicare from negotiating for a good price,  and there is no valid reason for it.  When I talk with my constituents  about this new Medicare  law, all of  them ask the same question: Why is  this program so complicated? That is a  good question. The program  is complicated because the people who wrote  it were not focused on helping seniors.  Rather,  they were  focused  on  promoting ideology. The Republican ideology is now destroying Medicare because it is based on the need to privatize everything, outsource Medicare.  If the goal were to help seniors get  their  prescription  drugs,  the  result  would not be so complicated. We can’t  blame seniors and their  families  for  being confused when we present them  with the kind of complex picture they  see.  The Democrats  invented Medicare,  and when  it  comes  to  serving  the  American people, running an effective  Government, we do know how to do it.  I think it is pretty obvious now in the  wake of this Medicare mess and the  bungled response to Hurricane Katrina  that there is little ability to run our  Government. It doesn’t seem to work.  Incompetence runs rampant.  Why can’t they run a Government?  Because they always want to farm out  the hard work to the companies—Halliburton, the HMOs, and the list goes on  and on. They even want to outsource  our air traffic control system. Remember that fight? And that still looms in  front of us.

710,221,2006-05-10,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, let me  say at the outset that I salute Senator  from Wyoming. He has shown extraordinary  leadership  and  political  courage to bring this issue to the floor.  The last time we had a serious conversation about health care for American  families and businesses was  in  that one brief shining moment when  the Democrats were  in control and  brought the Patients’ Bill of Rights to  the floor; otherwise, during the time  that I have served in the Senate, we  have run away from this issue. I salute  Senator ENZI. Although I disagree with  his bill, and I will explain why, I admire his political courage and vision to  report a bill from his committee and  ENZI bring the issue to the floor. I have said  that before the press, I have said it at  home, and I want to say it on the floor  on the RECORD. Although we may disagree on approach, I respect him very  much for being willing to bring this  complex and politically controversial  issue to the floor.  I think if you put it up for a vote as  to when a week ends in America, we  might not reach a consensus. There are  some people who would argue: Why, a  week ends on Friday night. That is the  end of the week. Others say: No, a week  ends on Sunday night. But what we  have found is that Health Care Week in  the Senate ends at 2:30 on Wednesday  afternoon because that is when the Republican majority leader came to the  floor and filled the tree, which means  closed down amendments on the health  care debate.  The Republican majority leader felt  there were only two issues relevant to  health care in America. The first was  the issue of medical malpractice and  preempting the States that traditionally regulate medical malpractice. For  I  believe  the  fourth  time, Senator  FRISToffered the medical malpractice  bills at the beginning of the week, and  they failed again, this time failing to  even attract a majority of the Senators  supporting either bill that he brought.  Then the Senator moved to the health  care  issue before us: small business  health  insurance. Then the majority  leader came today, having given us all  of about a day and a half to consider  this issue, and said that is the end of  the story. No more amendments. We  are not going to consider any other  health care amendments in the bill before us. We are closing down the Senate  when it comes to health care issues.  That is interesting because what the  Republicans have done is to close down  debate on stem cell research. Senator  FRISTcame to the floor and said: We  don’t want  Christmas  tree  amendments. Christmas tree amendments—  stem cell research. I don’t know if Senator FRISThas been back in his State.  I have. They have roundtable discussions about stem cell research. They  sit at a table surrounded by men and  women who have their hopes pinned on  medical research, those who are suffering from juvenile diabetes and the  serious problems that come with it—a  mother who gets up several times during the course of the night to wake her  young daughter and to test her blood  to see if she needs insulin, if she needs  to eat something; another family with  a young man with Lou Gehrig’s disease  who has reached the point now where  he cannot communicate. All he can do  is sit in his wheelchair, this young man  in his 20s, with tears rolling down his  face,  as his mother  says: Senator,  please, please do something about stem  cell research. It may not save him, but  it may save someone else. Parkinson’s  disease—to  have my  colleague  and  closest friend in Congress, Lane Evans,  a young man stricken with Parkinson’s, forced to end his congressional  career, who had the strength to come  to the floor last year in the House and  beg for stem cell research and others  suffering from Parkinson’s and spinal  cord  injuries. Think of those people  whose  lives have been compromised  and slowed down because of these injuries. All they want is a chance for a  vote on stem cell research.  This President has prohibited stem  cell research beyond a single line of  available stem cells and has virtually  closed  it down as a Federal undertaking. We have decided, as a matter of  Federal policy, that we will not do this  research. We have been asking for over  a year for a vote on the floor of the  Senate on stem cell research. We were  heartened when the Senate majority  leader, Senator FRIST, came  to  the  floor in July of last year and said: I  may be switching my position, he said,  but I am going to support stem cell research. It meant so much because we  respect him, a heart transplant surgeon, a man with his medical credentials, to break from the President on  this issue, on stem cell research and  say he would join us in the fight. But  how disheartening to hear today as the  Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from Tennessee refer to debate on  stem cell research as not relevant to  health care. Not relevant. It may not  be relevant to their lives, but it is relevant  to  the  lives of  thousands of  Americans.  We in the Senate know what is at  stake. If we don’t bring this matter up  for a vote this week on stem cell research, the chances of seeing the bill  before the end of the year are slim to  none. When we think of all of the families counting on us to step up for stem  cell research, I want to ask you, Mr.  President,  isn’t  this worth a  fight?  Isn’t this worth a fight on the floor of  the Senate, to make sure that we get a  vote this week on stem cell research,  for the people who are counting on us,  whose lives are compromised and broken because of disease and  illness?  Isn’t this worth a fight in Health Care  Week? Obviously, not on the other side  of the aisle. They have declared stem  cell research not relevant to Health  Care Week.  And what else? They have decided  that Medicare prescription Part D is  not an important part of Health Care  Week. Medicare prescription Part D,  where some 9 million Americans in 5  days, if they don’t sign up for this program, will  face a  lifetime penalty.  Medicare prescription Part D is a program written by pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies, a program which has been one of the worst  that has ever been dreamed up on Capitol Hill. When we want to take a few  moments to fix some basics and take  the penalty off seniors, the Republican  leadership says, now, wait a minute.  That is not relevant to a Health Care  Week debate. Prescription drugs for 9  million seniors, that is not relevant to  a health care debate.  Of course, we have heard Senator  of North Dakota repeatedly  DORGAN VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:42 Feb 05, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S10MY6.REC S10MY6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006
711,235,2006-05-10,Mr. ENZI.," I would like to have you  see the small business organizations  that are supporting the Enzi-Nelson  bill. There are a couple of hundred of  them here—12 million employers,  80  million workers.  I would like for you to see the small  business organizations that are supporting the Durbin-Lincoln bill. Oh,  there are two. OK.  I want to share a letter from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners as well. They are writing in  response to our May 2 request for a review of S. 2510 Small Employers Health  Benefits Program sponsored by Senators DURBINand LINCOLN.  I ask unanimous consent the letter  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  MAY9, 2006.  Hon. MICHAELB. ENZI,  Chair, Committee on Health, Education, Labor  and Pensions, Washington, DC.  DEARCHAIRMANENZI: We are writing in response to your May 2, 2006, request for our  review of S.  2510,  the Small Employers  Health Benefits Program Act, sponsored by  Senators Durbin and Lincoln.  The authors of S. 2510 sought the input of  the NAIC when drafting their bill and we appreciate their willingness to work with and  consider the views of insurance regulators.  Like your bill, S. 1955, the Durbin/Lincoln  bill does not include the option of self-funded  association plans, instead requiring coverage  to be purchased from carriers that are licensed in and regulated by the states. This is  a significant improvement over association  health plan legislation, such as S. 406. The  bill would also preserve state rating rules  and  benefit mandates,  thus maintaining  state authority over health insurance regulatory policy.  We are concerned, however, about the practical impact this legislation would have. S.  2510 creates an unlevel playing field by requiring plans sold through the Small Employer Health Benefit Plan (SEHBP) to meet  different  rating  standards  than  those  required of plans not sold through the SEHBP.  By setting different rules for different carriers, S. 2510 could create an unworkable  market in some states.  For example, if state law allows carriers in  the general market to charge small employers with healthier, younger workers significantly less, and the federal law requires carriers in the SEHBP to have only a modest  variation in rates, the SEHBP carriers will  be selected against.  In  fact,  few carriers  would want to participate in this program in  states with such rating disparity.  S. 2510 does attempt to ameliorate this  problem by providing subsidies for those that  participate  in the SEHBP. We agree that  these subsidies will help, but they are not  sufficient. We believe that states are best  suited to establish rating rules for all carriers—creating two sets of rules would be  harmful to the workings of the small group  markets. This could also limit the ability of  states to develop innovative programs to address the growing health care crisis.  Finally, both S. 2510 and S. 1955 will not affect the underlying and primary causes of  skyrocketing health  care  costs  that are  making  health  insurance  increasingly  unaffordable for millions of Americans. However, we do applaud you and Senators Durbin  and Lincoln for your efforts and we hope our  dialogue will continue and yield real solutions.  Sincerely,  CATHERINEJ.  WEATHERFORD,  Executive Vice President and CEO;  ALESSANDROIUPPA,  Superintendent of Insurance,  State  of  Maine, NAIC President;  WALTERBELL,  Commissioner of Insurance, State of Alabama, NAIC President-Elect.

713,249,2006-05-10,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, the  Senate is currently considering legislation proposed by Senator ENZI that  would profoundly change health care  coverage. The proposal has been modified from the version approved by our  committee.  It is important for the Senate to understand fully the impact that this legislation would have on millions of  Americans. I have requested an analysis of  this modified proposal  from  Professor Mila Kofman of the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute.  I ask unanimous consent to have this  analysis printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  GEORGETOWNUNIVERSITY,  May 10, 2006.  SENATOREDWARDKENNEDY,  Hart Senate Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEARSENATORKENNEDY: This is a response  to your request for an analysis of the proposed  rating  structure  in  the Manager’s  Amendment to S. 1955. This also addresses  your question on how the proposed amendment compares with the current NAIC model  law on small group rating:.  In general, the proposed Manager’s Amendment would not improve the bill. Under the  new proposed rating structure there would  be no new protections for consumers and a  significant loss of existing state-based protections in the area of premiums. This loss of  protections will  adversely  impact  people  with medical  needs,  older workers,  and  women of child-bearing years. This will also  have a negative impact on ‘‘micro’’ groups  (employers with fewer than 10 employees) because  insurers will be allowed to charge  these groups higher rates solely on the basis  of the employer’s size.  Here is a brief summary of how the proposed amendment would work:  Associations:  The  amendment  clarifies  that associations certified as small business  health plans  (by the U.S. Department of  Labor under Title I of the bill) would enjoy  a complete carve-out from small group rating state pools in both adopting and non-  adopting states. Each certified association  would be allowed to have their own premium  rate not tied to the rest of the small group  market. This would segment the small group  market.  Assuming  associations  attract  healthy businesses  (there are many ways  that the bill would allow associations to  ‘‘cherry-pick’’ healthy people), any restrictions on rates in the rest of the small group  market would be undermined. Rates between  association coverage and coverage outside  the association could vary broadly. For a  discussion of this, please see attached paper  ‘‘Health Insurance Regulation by States and  the Federal Government: A Review of Current Approaches and Proposals for Change.’’  In adopting states, the bill clarifies that  premiums within an association may vary  using the same standards that would apply  in  small  group market  (see  discussion  below). This would be at least 500 percent  variation in rates for businesses covered by  the association or if the state allows, variations in rates could be even greater.  In non-adopting states, it is unclear whether the rating standards in the bill would even  apply. If they apply. then a variation in premiums of 500 percent would be allowed for  businesses covered by an association  (so  some employers would pay 5 times more  than others for the same coverage within an  association).  Small group market: In adopting states,  insurers are required to vary rates by at  least  500 percent  (called  ‘‘total variation  limit’’). This means that states can allow insurers to have greater variations in rates.  Using age. health, claims. and duration factors. variations of at least 300% are required.  Note that insurers must use age, health, or  both and may use duration and claims experience. The option is given to insurers. If a  state wants to adopt this approach and become an ‘‘adopting state.’’ it must allow insurers to use age and health. This requirement essentially eliminates community rating and adjusted community rating by allowing insurers to adjust rates based on health.  Allowable factors included in the 500 percent  minimum required variation are: industry.  geography. group  size, participation  rate,  class of business. and wellness programs.  Note that gender is not listed. The bill is unclear whether gender rating is prohibited or  is added to the 500 percent variation.  At renewal, the same rules would apply.  This means that premiums may increase at  least by 500 percent if a smaIl business has  high claims the year before.  In non-adopting states  (generally states  with greater protections for consumers). the  language in the bill is ambiguous. The proposal says ‘‘The plan may not vary premium  rates by more than 500 percent].’’ The term  ‘‘plan’’ is not defined. If the term  ‘‘plan’’  means an ‘‘insurer,’’ then one possible interpretation  is that premium variations are  limited to 500 percent (if insurers chose to  follow this new tederal standard). What is  clear. however, is that adjusted community  rating and pure community rating would be  preempted.  Renewal rates would limited to trend plus  15 percent to reflect claims of small business.  Importantly, in non-adopting states insurers would have a choice of whether to follow  a state’s existing laws or the new federal  one. As a way of example, in DC, which has  no rating laws, assuming DC chooses not to  adopt the bill’s rating structure and is therefore a non-adopting state. Insurers are not  likely to use the rating restrictions in the  bill.  The proposed rating structure varies significantly  from  the NAIC model  law  for  small business health insurance premiums.  By way of background. the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in  the early 1990’s adopted and since replaced a  model law that provided for rate bands that  permit premium variation up to 200 percent  based on health status. The old model, which  is the basis for the original bill, allowed further premium variation based on age, gender, industry, small business group size, geography,  and  family  composition. Rates  based on adjustments for these factors had  to be actuarially justified but were not limited except for industry, which was limited  to a 15 percent variation. The old NAIC  model act permitted a wide variation  in  rates, allowing for a price difference of 26 to  1, or more. This means that for the same policy an insurer could charge a business or a  person $100 per month or $2600 per month depending on risk and other factors. Higher  rates under the model would be permitted as  long as there was actuarial evidence to support wider variations.  Shortly after adopting its original model  with rate bands, the NAIC replaced it with a  model law for small groups that requires adjusted community rating, prohibiting premium surcharges based on health or other  risk characteristics (like claims experience  and durational rating). The current NAlC  model act limits premium surcharges based  on age to 200 percent; it prohihits insurers  from varying small group premiums based on  gender of people in the group or an employer’s size. Today 12 states follow the current  NAlC model act. Ten states require all insurers to use community rating or adjusted  community rating for all small group policies. Two others, Michigan and Pennsylvania, require Blue Cross Blue Shield plans  (their largest insurers) and HMOs to use adjusted  community  rating. The  proposed  amendment would preempt these state rating protections.  Please let me know if you need additional  information. Thank you for the opportunity  to address your questions.

716,263,2006-05-10,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  introduce  the Wastewater  Treatment Works Security Act of 2006.  I am pleased to be joined in this effort  by Senator CHAFEE, the chairman of  the  Subcommittee  on  Fisheries,  Wildife and Water and Senator MURKOWSKI, an important and influential  member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, EPW. The bill  being proposed is similar to legislation,  S. 1039, that passed the Committee on  Environment and Public Works  last  Congress on a strong bipartisan vote  and a bill that passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 413 to 2. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues in  the minority objected to bringing that  important, bipartisan legislation to the  floor. At an impasse with the close of  the 108th Congress, I asked the Government Accountability Office to survey  the wastewater community in order to  determine what steps publicly owned  treatment works, POTWs, had taken to  assess their security and if need be,  what steps they had taken to enhance  security at their facilities.  In March 2006 we received GAO’s report and the results confirm that the  approach advocated by the House of  Representatives and by the EPW Committee is the right approach. The Federal Government must work cooperatively with our counterparts at the  state and local level to ensure our nation’s  infrastructure  is  secure. GAO  found that without a federal requirement to do so, the overwhelming majority of the largest POTWs have conducted or are in the process of conducting  vulnerability  assessments.  They did not need a heavy handed federal mandate to do the right thing. Of  those who have not and do not plan to  do a vulnerability assessment, a majority believed they had taken sufficient  other  security measures or believed  that by updating their Emergency Response Plan the utility had a good understanding of its vulnerabilities.  While this is tremendous progress, it  is  important that all systems know  what their vulnerabilities are and take  steps to mitigate them. The legislation  my  colleagues Senator CHAFEE and  Senator MURKOWSKI and  I  introduce  today builds upon the good work already taking place by working in collaboration with  the publicly owned  treatment works. For the few systems  remaining who have not done an assessment, our bill provides them an incentive to do so by authorizing funding. Further, once these systems have  completed their assessments and certified to EPA that they have done so,  they can join their colleagues in seeking grants to address some of the security problems identified in the assessments.  During Hurricane Katrina, we saw  how  important  emergency  response  plans are and how valuable mutual aid  agreements can be. Our bill allows  funding for the development, expansion  or upgrading of an emergency response  plan as well as for the voluntary creation of a mutual aid agreement or  participation in such an agreement.  The GAO also found that the majority facilities had actually made significant security  improvements prior to  the tragedy of September 11. Of the 206  who responded, 149 had vehicle gates;  174 had security fences; 160 had redundant power sources; 133 had redundant  pumping devices or collection bypass  systems. Following September 11, 138  facilities now have safeguards for on-  site delivery of materials and 112 have  additional site lighting. It is important  for all of my colleagues to note how  much  progress  these  entities  have  taken to secure their facilities and protect their communities.  The use of chlorine has been a topic  of discussion for years. Chlorine is by  far  the most  effective  disinfectant  available and it is the least expensive.

726,305,2006-05-10,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, what we  have just seen happen is not surprising,  but  it  is disappointing. Health Care  Week has come to an end in the Senate  on Wednesday evening. We have decided we don’t have the time, interest,  or inclination to take up other issues.  It is a take-it-or-leave-it situation. If  we do not accept the Enzi bill, S. 1955,  now pending, nothing will be done on  health care in the Senate.  It is no wonder to me the American  people are cynical about this process.  There are so many things we need to  do. We are 5 days away from the deadline on Medicare prescription Part D.  My best estimate is 50 percent of the  people we had hoped would enroll have  not done it. They are going to be penalized on May 15 up to 7 percent a year  on their premium costs for the rest of  their life. We have asked for an extension of time so they can make a choice.  We have asked for an extension of time  so seniors who have chosen the wrong  plan can choose another plan without  penalty. Those are not unreasonable.  We ask for extensions for people who  file  income  tax without  questions  asked. To give an extension to an elderly person struggling with 45 different choices for the right prescription drug program is not unreasonable.  It would be compassionate. It is the decision of the Senate Republican leadership that we don’t have the time or inclination to take up that issue.  I  just asked  the majority  leader:  What about stem cell research? Last  July, he pledged support for stem cell  research. The writing is on the wall:  Another year will go by, and this Senate will not go on record on stem cell  research.  While millions  of Americans  and  their families are suffering from diseases that could be directly impacted  by this research, the Senate doesn’t  have the time or the  inclination to  take up this issue. Is it any wonder  that people are angry with the Congress as  it  is presently being conducted? Is it any wonder people are  calling for significant change, not only  in the direction of this country but in  the policies we follow on Capitol Hill?  We are going to break our necks to  bring up a tax bill before we leave this  week to give tax benefits and tax cuts  to the wealthiest people in America.  We have to get that done, but we don’t  have time to bring up stem cell research which  could  give  hope  and  promise for cures and relief to millions  of American families?  Where are our priorities? The priorities of this Republican-led Congress  are priorities that do not reflect where  America is today. The motions we have  just heard do not reflect that. To suggest that we don’t have time, for example, to even consider the reimportation  of drugs so that people struggling with  fixed incomes can afford the drugs they  need to stay independent, be strong,  stay alive—we don’t have  time  for  that. No, we have to get on to a tax  cut—a tax cut. Let me tell you what  the tax cut is.  The tax cut which the Republicans  want to force through here before we  leave this week—we have to break all  records  to make  sure we  get  this  done—is a tax cut that will mean for  people making less than $75,000 a year  about on average $100 in tax relief. The  good old $100 check is coming back at  ENZI you, America, if you make less than  $75,000 a year; that is your tax cut; be  prepared, party on. But if you happen  to be making $1 million a year, well,  that is another story. This Republican  tax cut, which they just have to have,  means about $42,000 less in taxes paid  by someone making $1 million a year.  No  time  for drugs  imported  from  Canada  for people on  fixed  incomes  who can’t afford what they need to  stay alive, no time for stem cell research  for  the millions of  families  counting on us to push forward on medical research to find cures and relief,  no time to deal with Medicare prescription Part D when 7 or 8 million Americans, senior citizens, are about to face  penalties in 5 days, no time for that,  but plenty of time for tax cuts. It tells  the story. No wonder the people across  this country and even 30 of the Republicans are saying it is time for a change  on Capitol Hill. It is time for new leadership, new direction, and new values.  If this is the best we can do, to come up  with a tax cut for the wealthiest people  in America and ignore the real needs of  small business and the elderly, to ignore the real needs of those who are  fighting for medical research to give  them hope to live another day, it is a  sad outcome.  I started this day by praising Senator  and I will end it by doing the  same. I respect him. I admire him. He  brought an issue to the floor that is a  tough one—health care  in America.  And this debate is long overdue. We  have been waiting a long time to address an issue that troubles families  and businesses across this Nation. I  thank Senator ENZI for his leadership  in bringing this to the floor. But I have  to tell you, what has happened today  procedurally on the floor gives no credit to that effort by Senator ENZI. Shutting down amendments, not even giving us a moment to raise these important issues, even with limited time and  limited debate, is unfair. And what a  contrast. What a contrast to the immigration bill where the Senator  from  Tennessee,  the Republican majority  leader, has argued that we need every  possible amendment to be considered  before it comes to a conclusion. Wide  open; let everybody bring what they  want, whether they are for the bill or  against it. But when it comes to health  care, when it comes to what counts,  this man, who has made medicine his  profession and his life before he came  to the Senate, does not give us an opportunity to go into the issues that are  so important to people across America.  It is a sad outcome for America, it is a  sad outcome for the Senate. This Senate appears to be not only risk averse  but work averse, and that is a shame.  It is time for a change.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  f  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.  TOMORROW  ",2006

728,312,2006-05-10,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, I ask the House  of Representatives to join me in congratulating  the Flint Olympian Games as it celebrates 50  years of promoting physical fitness and sportsmanship. Events commemorating this anniversary will be held throughout the summer in my  hometown of Flint, Michigan.  Conceived 50 years ago as a finale to the  summer athletic program for Flint students, the  Games have grown into a community wide experience. Frank Manley and the Flint School  District Community Education Directors held  the  first planning meeting  to organize  the  Games in 1956. The following year 1500 students participated  in 6  sports. Today  the  Games involve 11,000 contestants active in 22  sports. Encompassing  the entire  family  the  Games have become a tradition among generations of Flint residents.  The opening ceremonies will be held on  July 11 at Flint Central High School followed  by a fitness walk and field day. The competitions will commence on that date and continue  through July 22 at locations scattered throughout the community. An awards dinner will be  held on July 27 to honor the participants and  volunteers that have organized and sponsored  this event. The amateur athletes will go on to  participate  in  the  49th  annual  CANUSA  Games. The CANUSA Games is a competition  held between the residents of Flint and its sister  city, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.  The  CANUSA Games foster goodwill between the  citizens of both communities. Held on alternate years in each community, this year the  CANUSA Games will  take place  in Flint on  August 11, 12 and 13. For many of the participants  this  is  their  first exposure  to persons  from another country.  In addition to the actual sports competitions,  the organizers have also planned a banquet to  be held in June and a golf outing for July. The  50th Flint Olympian Games Celebration is a  joint celebration sponsored by the Flint Community Schools, Citizens Blue Ribbon Committee, Greater Flint Olympian-CANUSA Association, City of Flint, the Ruth Mott Foundation  and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation. The  50th Anniversary Games will be dedicated to  the  founders, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Stewart  Mott and Mr. and Mrs. Frank Manley.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in applauding  the dedication of  the many volunteers and  contestants that come together each year in  the atmosphere of camaraderie to promote the  ideals of sportsmanship, physical well being  and friendly competition. Their vision of families playing and working  together  to accomplish goals is to be commended.  PAYING TRIBUTE TO EARL AND  MILDRED BURRIS  HON. JON C. PORTER  OFNEVADA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 9, 2006  ",2006
729,312,2006-05-10,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Earl and Mildred Burris for 70 years of  marriage.  Earl and Mildred were married in 1936, and  over  the course of 70 years have raised a  family  that now  includes  two children,  five  grandchildren, and seven great grand children.  Earl and Mildred’s marriage dates back to the  days when Franklin Roosevelt was  in  the  White House, and the Berlin Olympic Games  preceding Hitler’s march through Europe. During  their  time  together,  they have witnessed  such historic events as  the  landing on  the  moon and the construction and destruction of  the Berlin Wall.  They raised their children in an age where  they did things together as a family and instilled in them the values of service, community, and charity. In 1990, the couple moved to  Boulder City, Nevada. Since that time Earl has  been very active in water-related citizens committees, and both Earl and Mildred have been  active in the church.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Earl and  Mildred Burris for their 70 years of marriage.  Their commitment to each other is admirable,  and should serve as a lesson to us all. I commend and congratulate them, and wish them  many more anniversaries together.  f  HONORING OFFICER SCOTT  SEVERNS  HON. CHRIS CHOCOLA  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 9, 2006  ",2006
730,312,2006-05-10,Mr. CHOCOLA.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I rise  with a solemn heart to honor a hero. On Friday, April 21, 2006 Cpl. Scott Severns of the  South Bend Police Department was shot during an attempted robbery. He succumbed to  his wounds and passed early Sunday morning.  I have heard it said that at times like these,  we should not focus on how someone dies,  but on how they lived, but how Cpl. Severns  died was a testament to how he lived. When  two would-be robbers approached Cpl. Severns and a female companion, brandished a  gun, and  threatened  them, Cpl. Severns  instinctively stepped  in between  the gunman  and his friend. Character like this cannot be  taught through a police academy course, and  it  is not  issued  to every officer after  their  swearing in. This type of valor can only come  from an individual with the heart of a hero.  We oftentimes do not take enough time to  appreciate the sacrifice that law enforcement  officers make every single day so that we can  live in safety. It is easy for us to go about our  daily lives without a thought about those that  stand in between us and those that would try  to hurt us.  Cpl. Severns’s sacrifices from the moment  he first put on his uniform, until his tragic, premature end, exemplify  the best of American  law enforcement.

731,326,2006-05-10,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the superior performance of the Liberty Christian School Warriors’ Boys Track  and Field team for their second consecutive  Texas Association of Private and Parochial  Schools, TAPPS, State title.  The Warriors totaled 150 points at Hart-Patterson Athletic Complex  in Waco, TX easily  winning  the TAPPS 5A crown over second-  place Midland Christian with 82.50.  After  the  first day’s  field events,  things  looked just as dark as the weather forecast for  Liberty, as the Warriors trailed Dallas Christian  by five points. With the weather holding despite the prediction of thunderstorms in Waco,  the Warriors came back strong on the track,  and dominated the medal stand, shattering the  state record of 3:24.45  in  the 4 x 440-yard  relay with 3:22.70 and also winning the 4 x  l00-meter relay in 43.49 and taking third in the  4 x 200 in 1:31.20.  This victory was a combined effort and  would not have been possible if it was not for  the incredible sense of teamwork put forth by  all athletes.  I extend my sincere congratulations to the  principal, coaches, teachers and members of  the Liberty Christian School Boys Track and  Field Team. The team showed true that value  of sportsmanship then victory. I am honored to  serve as  their U.S. Representative  in Congress.  f  RECOGNIZING  NICHOLAS  A.

733,326,2006-05-10,Mr. GILLMOR.," Mr. Speaker, it is my great  pleasure  to pay special  tribute  to an outstanding young man  from Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District.  I am happy  to announce  that James D. McKinney of Bowling Green,  Ohio has been offered an appointment to attend  the United States Military Academy at  West Point, New York.  James’ offer of appointment poises him to  attend the United States Military Academy this  fall with the incoming cadet class of 2010. Attending one of our nation’s military academies  is an invaluable experience that offers a world-  class education and demands  the very best  that  these young men and women have  to  offer.  James brings an enormous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming  class of West Point cadets. While attending  Bowling Green High School in Bowling Green,  Ohio, James attained a grade point average  which placed him near the top of his class.  While a gifted athlete, James has maintained  the highest standards of excellence in his academics, choosing  to enroll and excel  in Advanced Placement classes  throughout high  school. James has obtained the rank of Eagle  Scout, has been a delegate to Buckeye Boys’  State and president of his school’s Model  United Nations Club.  Outside  the classroom, James has distinguished himself as an accomplished student-  athlete by actively participating in fencing and  cycling. He has also remained active  in his  community by volunteering to assist his local  Meals on Wheels program. Upon completion  of high school, James continued his education  at Washington and Lee University  in Lexington, Virginia. I have no doubt that James  will employ the lessons of his student leadership as he excels among the leaders at West  Point.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating James D. McKinney on his  appointment  to  the United States Military  Academy at West Point. Our service academies offer the finest military training and education available anywhere in the world. I am  sure that James will do very well during his  career at West Point and I ask my colleagues  to join me in wishing him well as he begins his  service to the nation.  f  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL RICHARD  SIMCOCK  HON.

Since  then  Leah has distinguished herself as a prominent  and respected leader in her trade during her  28 years with KB and Lewis Homes. Leah was  known  for her contributions  in  the areas of  quality assurance and customer service.  Leah was the regional general manager for  KB Home’s Southwest region, which includes  Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Tucson. In 2004, her  region delivered nearly 7,000 homes.

Since its founding in June of 1980,  Denver Harbor Senior Citizens has provided  an outlet  for seniors  in our area  to get  together on a regular basis, socialize, and maintain meaningful friendships.  On any given weekday, the Denver Harbor  Recreation Complex  is  visited by a  large  group of active senior citizens. Many gather in  groups to play dominoes, bingo, or Loteria, a  traditional Mexican game. While  the games  often bring out some good-natured competition  among the players, everyone enjoys the camaraderie and laughter that the group activities provide.  Without doubt, Denver Harbor Senior Citizens,  Inc.  is one of  the most active senior  centers  in Harris County.  In addition  to  the  programs provided  in  the new and beautiful  Denver Harbor Recreation Complex, the group  sponsors numerous senior outings and trips to  Austin and other areas within  the State of  Texas, where  the members can  recall  the  Texas  history  lessons we  all  learned  as  schoolchildren.  Denver Harbor Senior Citizens also provides  hot meals for its members, an invaluable service ensuring that senior citizens have well-balanced meals. As we age, the importance of  nutrition cannot be underestimated and is critical to our good health. This group has taken  that principle to heart and has put in place the  benefits and services that keep our senior citizens active and healthy—in body, mind and  spirit.  On May 19, 2006, Denver Harbor Senior  Citizens will officially celebrate its twenty-fifth  anniversary with a dinner reception and dance  at the Denver Harbor Recreation Complex.  I would  like  to extend  to  this group my  heartfelt congratulations and thanks for twenty-five years of dedication to Denver Harbor’s  senior citizens and wish them all the best in  the future.  f  HONORING HARRY ‘‘BUS’’  YOURELL  HON.

Mr. Yourell served admirably in the United  States Marine Corps during World War II earning the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Asiatic Pacific Medal with  three stars, and  the  Presidential Unit Citation Award.  Born on February 19, 1919, in Hammond,  Indiana, Yourell moved to Oak Lawn in 1956.  He raised three children with his wife and established  a  popular Oak  Lawn  restaurant  named  ‘‘Bus’ Drive-in’’ and was engaged  in  the insurance brokerage business.  Harry ‘‘Bus’’ Yourell served with excellence  in community and civic affairs by participating  in the Heart Fund, the Boy Scouts, the Lions  Club, the Elks Club, the Holy Name Society,  Rotary, American Legion Post 757, VFW Post  5220, and Catholic War Veterans.  He  is a  loyal and active Democrat who  served his party as President of  the Worth  Township Regular Democrats for three years,  was elected delegate to the 1964 State Nomination Convention, was  six  times  elected  Democratic Committeeman of Worth Township, was a member of  the Cook County  Democratic Central Committee, and was elected delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1968.  Yourell served nine  terms as an elected  member of the Illinois House of Representatives, where he served as Chairman of  the  Counties and Townships Committee, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Administrative  Procedures, Chairman of  the Election Laws  Commission, Chairman of  the County Problems Commission, and was a member of the  Executive Committee, the Cities and Villages  Committee, the Financing of Education Commission, and  the C-Selm Pollution Control  Commission.  As an Illinois State Representative was chief  sponsor of bills to raise the drinking age to 21  and to create the Joint Committee on Administrative Procedures; he also sponsored legislation creating one of the toughest narcotic bails  in  the nation, banning  look-alike drugs, and  the consolidated election law.  Citizens of our state who serve with distinction deserve to be recognized and honored for  their  accomplishments;  therefore,  it  is my  honor to recognize Harry ‘‘Bus’’ Yourell for his  dedication and service to his family, friends,  community, and country.  I wish him all  the  best in his retirement and future endeavors.  f  CELEBRATING  THE  135TH  ANNIVERSARY OF THE PHOENIX ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT #1  HON. ED PASTOR  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 10, 2006  ",2006
738,340,2006-05-10,Mr. PASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise before you  today to bring attention to the 135th Anniversary of the Phoenix Elementary School District  #1, which  is  in  the heart of my district and  celebrates  its 135th birthday on May 15.  Steeped in heritage and tradition, the district is  in the heart of Phoenix and dedicated to the  total  development  of  every  kindergarten  through eighth grade student enrolled by setting high expectations for each child and fostering academic  leadership. The district has  demonstrated its ability to adapt to the times  while keeping students needs’ at the forefront.  The history of Phoenix Elementary School  District #1 began in 1871, when it was created  by  the Arizona Legislative Assembly, acting  upon a school bill presented by Arizona’s third  governor, Anson P. K. Safford. At  the  time,  this free public school system had neither a  schoolhouse, books or teachers. Twenty students attended class in the county courthouse.  By 1873, a one  room adobe  structure,  named  ‘‘Little Adobe,’’ had been built with  public funds, and Mr. W.A. Glover was hired  to teach for $100 per month. The school was  600-square  feet and  located  in what  is now  downtown Phoenix. The District was  formed  10 years before the city of Phoenix was even  incorporated.  Just after it began operations, schools were  closed from 1883 until 1885 due to a smallpox  epidemic. Student enrollment was 374. By  1913,  the  district  had  expanded  to  nine  schools and 4,860 students.  In 1920, Kenilworth School opened, offering great relief to  the overcrowded district. Sens. Barry Goldwater and Paul Fannin enrolled in Kenilworth  that year. In 1957, a new school was named  after the only living Arizonan to be awarded  the Congressional Medal of Honor: Silvestre  Herrera. Early in the 1960s the exodus from  city  to suburbs began  in earnest.  Inner-city  dwellers were on a modest socio-economic  level,  thus qualifying  the district  for  federal  funding including support for both Title I and  Title  II. The decade began with 25 schools  and burgeoning classes. A Spanish language  program also was added at Heard and Grand  Avenue schools. The  late 1960s brought on  concerns about the lack of Mexican-Americans  working  in  the district. Soon, Mr. Louis P.  Rodriguez was  named  principal  of Grant  School and Mr. Adam Diaz was declared the  elected Trustee of the Board.  From  1970  on,  the District’s  enrollment  began to show a steady decline due to commercial rezoning of property.

739,4,2006-05-17,Mrs. MYRICK.," Mr. Speaker, Monday  marked the cut-off date for all seniors  to sign up for the new Medicare prescription drug plan. And I am happy to  announce that more than 38 million  seniors, representing more than 90 percent of all seniors on Medicare, now  have coverage for prescription drugs.  We created this program because seniors were having to choose between  their prescriptions and paying  their  bills, and now they do not have to  make those sacrifices to get the medicines that they need.  I also want to take a moment to  thank the countless organizations who  helped them and made sure that they  signed up  for  the  right plan. They  walked them through the process, and  I applaud them for that. It was very  helpful. And, again, now more than 38  million seniors have coverage for prescription drugs. They have it because  we made a promise, and we kept it.  f  DARFUR, SUDAN  (Mr. AL GREEN of Texas asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)  ",2006
740,4,2006-05-17,Mr. AL GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, a tragedy of the highest magnitude  exists in Darfur in Sudan, Africa.  Mr. Speaker, over 450,000 have died;  2.5 million have been displaced internally; 200,000 have fled to Chad; 3 million, Mr. Speaker, are living on emergency aid.  Mr. Speaker, this tragedy exists for  two reasons: One, people of ill will, the  actions of these people of ill will; and  two, the inactions of people of goodwill.  Mr. Speaker, it is time for people of  goodwill to take a stand and realize  that injustice anywhere, as Dr. King  put  it,  is a threat to  justice everywhere. And injustice in Sudan in Africa  is a threat to justice in America.  f  BORDER SECURITY  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2006
741,4,2006-05-17,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker, the  American people have reached a consensus on the border security issue; so  I find it very hard to understand why  we here in Washington are having trouble doing the same.  Outside the Beltway people think it  is perfectly reasonable to build a wall  to protect the border. They do not see  a problem with installing surveillance  technology  to monitor  the  border.  They do not support amnesty.  It  is only here where the pundits  rule, and in the New York newsrooms,  that we see such hand wringing on the  border security issue. An op-ed in The  Washington Post  called people  concerned about illegal immigration ‘‘nativists.’’ Apparently, worrying about  border security and the rule of  law  makes one a nativist. I find that it is a  sad statement on the attitude of those  opposed to beefing up our border security.  I ask my colleagues to join me to  look past the pundits, past the liberal  editorial pages, and do what the vast  majority of Americans want done: Secure the border and do it without amnesty.  structing fences, bolstering our Border  Patrols, and  improving our  surveillance capabilities.  Additionally, a guest worker program is nothing more than amnesty  wearing makeup. It is easier to look at,  but  it  is still ugly underneath. The  simple truth is that if you break the  law to come to this country, you will  not respect it once you are here.  f  f  REPUBLICAN BUDGET  INCREASES  DEBT WITH NO PLAN TO BALANCE BUDGET  (Mr. SALAZAR asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2006
742,4,2006-05-17,Mr. SALAZAR.," Mr. Speaker, 6 years  ago our Nation was in a secure financial position. We had a balanced budget, a pay-as-you-go system for funding  government programs, and a  record  surplus of $5.6 trillion.  Now after years of  imposing their  reckless fiscal policies on this country,  the administration and Congress have  squandered our reserves, and their policies have created a record $3.2 trillion  debt.  Not only that, but under this watch  the cost of living for average Americans has gone up significantly. In just  the  last  few years alone, gas prices  have reached $3 a gallon, fuel costs for  farmers have gone up 113 percent, and  the interest rate has risen more than 16  times.  But just when you think things cannot get any worse, the leaders of this  body put forward a shameful budget  resolution that makes no attempt to  bring our Nation’s finances back into  balance.  Instead,  their  irresponsible  fiscal  record  continues  full  steam  ahead. The proposed 2007 budget will  increase the deficit even further with  no plan to ever return to balance in the  future.

743,4,2006-05-17,Mr. MCHENRY.," Mr. Speaker, the U.S.  House last year in December did the  right thing and passed a strong immigration reform bill that increases border security and takes amnesty off the  table.  Now it is time for the Senate to respond to the growing problem of illegal  immigration and do what is best for  legal immigrants and citizens of this  country.  I am encouraged by President Bush’s  plan to increase our security by positioning National Guard troops on our  southern border. This will provide essential, but temporary, security along  our porous and vulnerable borders.  However, the better alternative is to  enact a comprehensive border security  program like the House bill by conSTROKE AWARENESS MONTH/STOP  STROKE ACT  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

744,4,2006-05-17,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to  remind my colleagues today that May  is Stroke Awareness Month.  Throughout this month we recognize  the millions of Americans struggling  with the effects of stroke, and we recommit ourselves to helping them. We  also acknowledge the efforts of organizations, like the American Stroke Association, which  provide  leadership,  helping all of us to prevent and treat  stroke.  On average every 45 seconds, someone  in the United States has a stroke, and  someone dies from stroke every 3 minutes. Representative PICKERING and I  have introduced the Stroke Treatment  and Ongoing Prevention Stroke Act,  H.R. 898, the STOP Stroke Act, which  now has the support of 132 of our colleagues. This legislation will increase  awareness, provide critical resources to  implement stroke care systems. The  legislation will help ensure that patients  recognize  the  symptoms  of  stroke and treat it as a medical emergency. We want to ensure that hospitals and other health care providers  provide  timely,  lifesaving  treatment  that reduces disability from stroke and  the need for extensive rehabilitation.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill and all efforts which address the  scourge of stroke.  f  HYPOCRISY HAS CROSSED THE  BORDER  (Mr. KELLER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2006
745,4,2006-05-17,Mr. KELLER.," Mr. Speaker, hypocrisy  has crossed the border. Mexico has its  own serious illegal immigration problem. Hundreds of thousands of illegal  immigrants are coming across Mexico’s  southern border from Guatemala and  other Central American countries.  What  do Mexico’s  politicians  say  about it? They say these illegals are  overcrowding Mexico’s hospitals and  schools. They say they are taking away  jobs from Mexican citizens. They say it  poses a security threat to Mexico.  In other words, they sound like the  Minutemen.  What did Mexico do about it? Did  they put out a welcome mat? Did they  grant everyone citizenship? No. They  got tough. Mexico put their military at  the southern border to stop illegals.

747,18,2006-05-17,Mr.  SALAZAR.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  thank  the gentleman  from Washington and the gentleman  from Oregon for bringing forth this important legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support  of the Forest Emergency Recovery and  Research Act. Our Nation’s forests are  providing so many benefits to the public and we have that responsibility to  pass this measure which will give forest managers the tools to maintain  healthy forest. It will allow them to rehabilitate and reforest areas that have  been hit by catastrophic events like ice  storms, wildfires and disease.  Out West we are battling a huge insect epidemic that is destroying our  forests, especially in Colorado. In 2005,  over 425,000 acres in Colorado forests  were infested with mountain pine beetle. And  this means  that we have  425,000 acres of prime real estate for  forest fires.  Reducing wildfire hazard is critical if  we are to maintain  forests as a resource for communities. Forest management,  including tree cutting and  prescribed fire, can help return Colorado’s forests to good health.  The previously passed healthy forest  legislation provided  forest managers  with some of the tools needed. What  this bill does, it adds to the tool box  and strengthens their ability to restore  forests across the country.  b1200  This legislation is vital to the West,  and I urge my colleagues to support  the passage of this bill.

749,18,2006-05-17,Mr. HAYWORTH.," Madam Chairman,  I thank my colleague from Oregon for  this time.  I rise in strong support of the Forest  Emergency Recovery and Research Act  and would like to highlight a few of the  more than 100 diverse groups that share  in my support of this legislation. While  these groups range in background and  represent  interests  from  across  the  country, they all strongly support the  timely restoration of our precious public lands.

750,25,2006-05-17,Mr. DUNCAN.," Madam Chairman, I  am pleased that the gentleman from  Washington, who is a really good Member and a good friend of mine, that he  mentioned the small  logging companies. I remember in 1978, we had 157  small  coal  companies  in  east Tennessee, and then they opened up a Federal mining office and now there are  none of those small companies left.  When you overregulate anything, it  helps the big giants, but it first runs  the small companies out and then even  the medium-sized companies. And I am  told that is what is happening all over  the country to our small logging companies. And I remember, I was told  years ago that in the mid-eighties that  Congress passed a bill that the environmentalists wanted  that would  not  allow cutting of more than 80 percent  of the new growth in our national forests. Today, we are cutting less than  one-seventh of the new growth in our  national forests, and we have two or  three or four times as much dead and  dying  trees, and under  the present  rules we can’t even go in there and get  some of these dead and dying trees out.  Like he said earlier, I said this bill is  just another of many things that we  are trying to not only help the environment but to help the poor and the  lower income and the working people  by not driving up prices and not destroying jobs in the way that we have  been doing. But also this is a bill that  would help some of the small businesses, some of the small logging companies maybe to survive instead of all  having to go out.  H.R. 4200, this Forest Emergency Research and Recovery Act, would allow  land managers to move swiftly after a  disaster  to  stabilize  soils,  protect  streams and riparian areas and reforest  the land. The bill allows for the establishment of preapproved management  practices  and  emergency  procedures  that  could be  implemented quickly  after a fire or other catastrophic event.  This bill, H.R. 4200, allows for compliance with the Clean Water Act requirements to occur simultaneously with  the  implementation  of  these  preapproved management practices or  emergency procedures.  H.R. 4200 is essential, I think, to ensuring our national forests are forested  for future generations. This is a good  bill. It is good for the environment, it  is good for business, and it is good for  the  average  ordinary  citizen  who  doesn’t need for wood product prices to  just go out of sight. And so I urge passage.  ",2006
751,25,2006-05-17,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous  consent to revise and extend my remarks.  Mr. Chairman, I want to voice my support  for H.R. 4200.  The catastrophic wildfires  that devastated  southern California in late 2003 are proof that  forest health and recovery are essential. We  must expand these tools however possible to  protect the lives and property of our constituents.  I only wish  the agency and administration  would have heeded our demands  from  then  Governor Davis, Senators BOXER and FEINSTEIN, and many others  including myself  for  emergency fuels reduction funding.  The  fact  is  that many  forests  in southern  California continue to be matches waiting to  set ablaze. Bark Beetle infestations have ravaged the San Bernardino National Forest and  many populated rural areas.  Either we learn the lessons of the past or  we are condemned to repeat those mistakes  in the future.  By the time the 14 major wildfires in southern California were extinguished in November  2003, 24 lives were lost, 3,710 homes were  destroyed, and 750,043 acres were blackened—70,000  of  those  acres  in  San  Bernardino County.  We must also remember the post-fire flooding in the erosion-prone mountain watersheds,  and how 17 lives were lost in San Bernardino  County alone. Sixteen of these lives were lost  on Christmas Day, including those of two constituents.  Mr. Chairman,  I completely agree  that recovery is essential, but I am also very interested  in ensuring  that  the contractors doing  this recovery are not engaging in criminal violations of health, safety and labor law.  At the December hearing on this bill in the  Agriculture Committee,  I  introduced  into  the  record an expose´by the Sacramento Bee on  the deplorable, and often criminal, conditions  to which  these H2B and other contract employees are subjected.  Some are not paid their full wage, denied  safety equipment, or made  to  live  in subhuman  conditions  because  of  their H2B  guestworker status.  Mr. Chairman, that is why I will be holding  a briefing tomorrow at 2 p.m. in the Science  Committee room on these forest workers and  how agencies can improve their oversight of  wage and workplace safety violations.  Mr. Chairman, I agree that we need to protect the lives and property of our constituents  by maintaining healthy forests and recovering  after disasters and pest  infestations. That  is  why I am voting in favor of this legislation. I  urge my colleagues to do the same.  ",2006
752,25,2006-05-17,Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in favor of H.R. 4200, the Forest  Emergency  Recovery  and  Research  Act  (FERRA).  Many of you are supporting this bill because  of wild fires. My state and I have a different,  but just as important need. Hurricane Katrina  caused  the  largest single  forest and wildlife  habitat devastation in our Nation’s history—5  million acres—and it did not discriminate between public or private land or the rich, poor  or the middle class. She was an equal opportunity destroyer. By the way, this represents  19 billion board feet of timber with a value of  $5 billion. This  is enough  timber  to build  800,000 homes and make 25 million tons of  paper and paperboard.)  National Wildlife Refuges, National Parks  and National Forests were all severely damaged. The DeSoto National Forest was hit the  hardest. But besides trees, we had a diversity  of plants and animals  that  lost  their homes  too. In fact, the damage left by Katrina is the  largest single devastation of fish and wildlife  habitat since the Exxon Valdez.  I have witnessed the devastated, high quality forests of the DeSoto degrade to a point  that we must appropriate many millions  to  clean up  the debris and recover  this  forest.  That was not necessary.  By acting in a timely manner as FERRA will  allow, we can salvage valuable wood products  before  they deteriorate. This will generate  much needed dollars for rural schools and return more dollars to federal and state treasuries. It will also generate funds to restore the  homes of wildlife and  the citizens of places  like the Gulf Coast and New Orleans.  We don’t need to cut down live trees that  are valuable at producing oxygen, sequestering carbon dioxide and providing fish and  wildlife habitat when we can use ones that are  already damaged. It’s just common sense.  As the first member of my party to co-sponsor the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, I ask  you to vote in favor of H.R. 4200.  ",2006

754,32,2006-05-17,Mr. WALDEN  of  Oregon.," Why,  Madam Chairman, indeed I do. I rise in  opposition and seek the time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2006
755,32,2006-05-17,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," I would like  to take a moment to outline just how  Forest Emergency Recovery and Research Act complies with the NEPA  standards  and  often  exceeds  those  standards.  The Forest Emergency Recovery and  Research Act requires public notice,  public  collaboration, and an opportunity for the public to object to any  proposed action. Read the bill: Pages  22, 23, 24, 25, 33, and 34. It is right there  in black and white.  The  judicial  review  requirement  under this bill is identical to those in  the Healthy Forest Restoration Act  which Congress passed last year. See  page 35. Now, we actually passed that a  couple years ago, and I know my friend  and colleague from West Virginia voted  against it when it was in the House and  voted against  the conference  report  when it came back. So it is no surprise  because he doesn’t like this bill because he hated the Healthy Forest Restoration Act even after  the Senate  voice-voted  it, as did my colleague  from New Mexico, Mr. UDALL, opposed  the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. So  some of the same people who are here  today saying we are going to do all  these awful things said the same thing  a couple years ago when we passed the  Healthy Forest Restoration Act. Ironically, some of those same Members  now say, oh, we are not fully implementing the Healthy Forest Restoration Act and we should be doing more  on that. We wouldn’t have it if they  had been in charge because they voted  against it every time they had an opportunity.  b1300  The Forest Emergency Recovery and  Research Act also requires disclosure  of  the decision  rationale,  economic  analysis, and analysis of the environmental effects of the project which  leads  to a very  transparent agency  process,  page  32. We  require  independent, third-party, scientific peer review of recovery practices. See page 13  and page 24.  These are just a few examples of how  this legislation complies with the intent of NEPA, and if the agency fails to  comply with all these things, we prescribe in the law they can be sued. If  they fail to comply with the very laws  that have been identified by my colleague, they can be sued.  These projects can be halted. We do  not say do anything you want, notwithstanding any other Federal  law,  including all the ones you have heard  listed repeatedly. Those laws still have  to be complied with.  Currently there are bills that actually go  further than where this bill  goes. They would waive environmental  documentation altogether. My  friend  and colleague, the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. UDALL), one of the most  vocal critics of this legislation, has introduced H.R. 4875, which, through categorical exclusion, would waive environmental documentation completely  for insect emergency areas in Colorado.  We do not do that here.  I read where one of the opponents of  this legislation worked on the sale in  the Biscuit fire, and said we do not  need  this  bill, we  did  16 million  boardfeet of harvest, and we did  it  using existing laws. Yeah, they used a  categorical exclusion which you cannot  even do now.  We have a balanced bill here. It involves the public. It tracks with what  we did with the Healthy Forest Restoration  Act  to  allow  for  free  decisional appeals and for judicial appeal.  It is backed by all kinds of groups  that love to be in the outdoors, the  Bear Trust International, Boone and  Crockett Club, the Bow Hunting Preservation Alliance, the Archery Trade,  the Congressional Sportsmen Caucus,  you go through it, people are out there  enjoying the woods, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the Deer Management Association,  and  professional  firefighters groups and the Society of  American Foresters.  We are trying to give our Federal  land managers  the  troops  that our  State and tribal land managers have,  and we are trying to allow them to be  able to move quicker and still involve  the public because this Member of Congress believes fundamentally the public  should have the right to appeal a decision of the government, and this bill  allows that.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2006
756,32,2006-05-17,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  As I conclude, the bottom line here is  whether we are for NEPA or whether  we are against it, whether we are for  the Clean Water Act or whether we are  against it, whether we are for the historic preservation laws of our land or  whether we are against them, whether  we are for the Endangered Species Act  or whether we are against it.  We have got to be for these premier  preservation laws that have guided our  country so well over many years. We  cannot willy-nilly pick at the edges  and  try  to  exempt  special-interest  groups on every piece of  legislation  that the Republican leadership in this  body wants to consider. We cannot continue to do that or we will not have  any of it.  Let us make that decision, whether  we are going to have these  laws or  whether we are not going to have these  laws.  This amendment is an effort to preserve NEPA and all of our premier conservation  laws that have worked so  well for our country and for our future  generations. I would urge adoption of  my amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.  ",2006

758,32,2006-05-17,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding, especially under these time constraints.  On July 4, 1999, a powerful storm, 100-  mile-an-hour winds, blew through the  boundary waters canoe area of the Superior National Forest in my district,  blew down 26 million trees over a huge  area. The  loss was estimated somewhere between $12 million and $18 million in timber value, but the problem  was cleanup.  The State, the county all were able  to get in and clean up their lands within weeks, but I had to take the supervisor of the Superior National Forest  out here to Washington, meet with the  Council  on  Environmental  Quality,  with the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, gentleman  from  Ohio, and work things out laboriously;  took us months to get that salvage operation by  the Federal Government  under way to protect the homes and  residences and resorts outside the wilderness area along the Gunflint Trail  to be protected against fire. This legislation will help us move that along.  Mr. Chairman, on July 4, 1999, a widespread convective windstorm called a ‘‘derecho’’ swept across  the arrowhead region of  northeastern Minnesota.  The  straight  line  winds reached 90 to 100 miles an hour, causing serious damage  to nearly 600 square  miles of  forest  in and around Minnesota’s  Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness  (BWCAW). The aftermath left 30 million toppled trees on the forest floor; in some areas  the downed trees were stacked 10 and 12 feet  high. This area approximately 30 miles  long  and 12 miles wide, or about a quarter million  acres, was leveled. The timber loss was estimated at 500,000  to 750,000 million cords,  valued between $12 and $18 million. The  State of Minnesota estimated the cost of other  damage and debris clearance  for Lake and  Cook counties at nearly $5 million.  This powerful storm created near perfect  conditions  for a major  forest  fire. Only  two  questions remain: When will the major forest  fire happen, and how destructive will  it be?  The blowdown quadrupled the amount of fuel  per acre that can readily burn and the fire risk  is expected  to  increase  in  the next several  years as the timber continues to dry out.  Under H.R. 4200,  the Forest Emergency  Recovery and Research Act, an expedited review process will be established to provide our  Federal  land managers  the  resources  they  need to complete a quick, thorough evaluation  of forest conditions after catastrophic events.

It applies the waiver  to any resolution reported on the legislative day of May 17, 2006, providing for  consideration of the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 376, establishing the  congressional budget  for  the United  States Government for fiscal year 2007  and  setting  forth appropriate budgetary  levels  for  fiscal  years  2008  through 2011.  Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we  pass this same-day rule. This resolution will prepare the ground so that  the House may complete its business  and pass a budget resolution. We are  working to moving this process along  toward the goal of setting the spending  priorities for the next fiscal year.  The House is prepared to begin consideration  of  several  appropriations  measures to fund our government’s activities, but we must pass this budget  first. We must set the priorities  in  funding levels before we proceed with  the appropriations process. The budget  is  our  congressional  spending  blueprint. We must complete its consideration to move on with the business of  the House.  The Committee on Rules will meet  later today to provide a rule for the  consideration of H. Con. Res. 376, the  budget for fiscal year 2007, and I am  pleased that this same-day rule facilitates the timely deliberation of this  important legislation.  I urge my colleagues to support the  same-day rule so that we can move forward to a serious discussion about the  budget legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
760,39,2006-05-17,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. PUTNAM), my very good friend, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes,  and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this martial law rule and in opposition to the outrageous process that  continues to plague this House. Apparently  the Republican  leadership has  twisted  enough  arms  and  broken  enough  legs to try to ram through  their mystery budget package. And I  call it a mystery because, aside from a  select few chosen by the leadership, no  one has actually seen this budget.  We are not talking about naming a  post office here, Mr. Speaker, or congratulating a sports team. What we are  talking about is the budget priorities  that will affect every single American  on issues like health care, education,  veterans care, environmental protection, national defense, and it goes on  and on and on.  So what is in this thing that we are  going to see sometime later today? If it  is anything like the last version of the  budget, which came up a few weeks ago  that was pulled, it is probably full of  misplaced priorities, broken promises,  and empty rhetoric. If it is anything  like the last version, it will bankrupt  our children and our grandchildren at  the expense of the very wealthy. If it is  anything like the last version, it will  be an assault on our veterans. And if it  is anything  like the  last version,  it  slashes critical programs in the areas  of  education,  job  training,  environmental  protection  and  conservation  funding, public health programs, medical research, and social services.  But, Mr. Speaker, we do not really  know what is in this budget because  the leadership of this House would prefer us not to know. They would prefer  the American people not to know.  To make a bad situation even worse,  we have before us a martial law rule  that allows  the  leadership  to once  again ignore the rules of the House and  the procedures and the traditions of  this House. Martial law is no way to  run a democracy. Mr. Speaker, no matter what your  ideology, no matter  what your party affiliation, no matter  what you believe about what the budget priorities of this Nation should be,  every  single Member of  this House  should have the opportunity to review  a bill of this magnitude before voting  on it.  Mr. Speaker, we really are  in the  Land of Oz here with the leadership  saying, pay no attention to that man  behind the curtain. We know somebody  is back there, and we know they are  putting together a budget, in my opinion probably a lousy budget, but we  really do not want anyone to know the  truth. We do not want anyone to know  the facts.  Mr. Speaker, those across this country who are watching these proceedings  on their television must be wondering  how and why the House of Representatives, the greatest deliberative body in  the world, could be bringing a budget  to the House floor without allowing all  Members, even supporters and those  who probably will oppose this bill, the  opportunity to be able to look at it, to  be able to understand what the implications are. But the fact is this much  talked about budget, this much talked  about but rarely seen budget, will be  working  its way to the House  floor  sometime today. I hope the Members  will have an opportunity to look at the  budget. They are not going to be given  enough time, but I hope they will be  given some time to see what it is before we begin the debate.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
761,39,2006-05-17,Mr. PUTNAM.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I agree with my friend from Massachusetts about the magnitude of this  budget process and its importance and  how we establish priorities in this government, how we lay out a spending  blueprint.  My friend from Massachusetts has referred to this as the greatest deliberative body in the world on a couple of  occasions, and  I would  just offer a  slight correction that perhaps the Senate is the greatest deliberative body in  the world, and we are the greatest legislative body in the world. They talk  about it, and we act. We move forward  on the agendas that are important to  Americans, and we do it in a bold and  decisive way, while perhaps the more  deliberative body talks things to death  and produces nothing.  The budget of the Federal Government works a bit differently than it  does for those Members who came from  a State legislative background or from  local government background. It is a  two-step process. The budget lays down  the markers, the  fence  lines,  if you  will,  around  the  big  numbers:  X  amount  for Defense, X amount  for  Transportation, X amount for Health  and Human Services. And the second  step of the process then is the appropriations process, which consists of 11  separate bills moving to  fill  in the  blanks: How many tanks and jeeps and  bullets and bombs do you buy within  the budget framework for defense? How  many post offices do you construct or  repair  within  the  Postal  Subcommittee? How many  bridges  and  roads do you get within the Transportation? They put  the meat on  the  bones.  The skeletal framework is this budget, this blueprint, this spending priority for the Federal Government. And  the rule that we are here to debate, and  I suspect that this will become a proxy  debate on the budget itself, which is  not what we are considering before the  Speaker today; what we are considering is the procedure that allows us to  move forward with the budget that is a  hugely important blueprint for this Nation. It is important that we get going  on it. We have now been considering it  for  several weeks.  The  committee  mark has been available  for over a  month. The  substitute  amendments  that undoubtedly will be presented to  the Rules Committee as alternatives  have been available for weeks.  So there is no mystery here. There is  no secret. We are attempting to facilitate the work of the House.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006

But to be the greatest legislative body  in the world, I think, requires some deliberation. And that is  why so many of us have strong objections to this martial law rule.

765,53,2006-05-17,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, we are here today to observe  a surrender. Once again, our moderate  Republican colleagues will hand over  their  tin  swords  to  the Republican  leadership. They are very predictable,  and they are my friends, and it is nice  to have predictable friends. On every  important issue, the moderate Republicans have an unfailing three-step approach to the  issue:  ineffectual protests, abject surrender, and denial.  Now, they told us for a long time  that this budget did not have enough  funding  for  important domestic programs. Indeed, as part of this rule, we  have what  is called a self-executing  rule, which adopts a resolution to mollify the consciences of the Republican  moderates. Those are easily mollified.  My  colleague  from Massachusetts  said the gentleman from Florida said  facts are stubborn things. Facts are  very different from the moderate Republicans. They are the very opposite  of stubborn things. They are among the  most pliable thing known to man or  woman.  So they have a resolution which says,  in the summary, it recognizes the need  to increase the President’s Labor-HHS  appropriation by not less than $7 billion. It recognizes it. It does not do it.  It just recognizes it, and on the basis of  being  able  to  recognize what  they  claim is a defect, they are going to  vote for this, and that is the deal that  is made. Now, I would have liked to  have debated their resolution, but it is  self-executing.  People watching, I know we are not  supposed to refer to them, but we do  not address them directly, but we can  explain things to them. It gets a little  complicated.  People might  wonder  what do we mean by a self-executing  resolution. In this case, it allows the  moderate Republicans to execute their  own moral principles. That is what is  self-executing. It allows them to come  forward and say, we wish we had more  money for poor people, and we have a  resolution  that  says  there  is  not  enough money for poor people, and we  will vote for that budget that does not  have enough money for poor people because we said it does not have enough  money. On that, some people consider  themselves to have shown  independence.  If that was the spirit of independence  that motivated this country 250 years  ago, that would be the British flag up  there and  the  representative of  the  Crown. So I hope we defeat this sham,  and maybe the moderate Republicans  will grow some spines.  ",2006
766,53,2006-05-17,Mr. PUTNAM.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  The gentleman from Massachusetts  has had some very harsh words  for  some Members of this body. I would  query the gentleman from Massachusetts, if he would agree, how much is  enough  spending  for  the gentleman  from Massachusetts?  ",2006
767,53,2006-05-17,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, will the gentleman yield?  ",2006
768,53,2006-05-17,Mr. PUTNAM., I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.  ,2006
769,53,2006-05-17,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, well, I will say this. I would  say enough would be what the moderate Republicans said, $7 billion more  for Labor-HHS. The problem  is that  they said that was enough, but it is not  there. So I would be satisfied if my  moderate Republican  friends  simply  lived up to their own declaration.  ",2006
770,53,2006-05-17,Mr. PUTNAM.," Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my  time,  this negotiation,  this  process that yields this budget, recognizes that we have a number of challenges at this point in time, and all  points of view recognize that we have  to create an environment, a climate for  economic growth and strength, and we  have to have fiscal restraint.  There is not a blank checkbook, as  some, perhaps some  from Massachusetts or other parts, might  suggest  where it is just an ongoing, empty, bottomless pit of spending. You have to be  responsible  about  the  taxpayers’  money. You have to draw lines around  it and prioritize, and we have done that  in this budget.  In the minority, you have the luxury  of not having to rally behind any one  particular proposal.  In  fact, that  is  why there are two different substitutes  offered that offer at least two very different viewpoints from your own caucus.  We have the obligation, we have the  responsibility to actually move a product that changes lives. We have the responsibility to actually pass a budget  that implements spending controls on  an over $2 trillion Federal budget and  put us on a path to cutting the deficit  while still securing a climate that allows economic growth and prosperity  to continue.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006

772,53,2006-05-17,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, again, I was simply quoting  the moderate Republicans,  for  one  thing.  Secondly,  that claim  for  responsibility and this assumption that they  would get the job done would be more  impressive if we thought that they in  the Senate were going  to agree  to  something.  So, in fact, we had a problem earlier  this year where bills passed in somewhat different form in the House and  the Senate were signed into law despite  the Constitution, and we now know  why, because whether  it  is  lobbying  and ethics reform or the budget or immigration, the Republican House and  the Republican Senate cannot get together.  I will have to say to the gentleman  from Florida that beating of your chest  and talking about how responsive you  are as to beat the moderates into submission would be more impressive if I  thought you had any chance of getting  an actual budget signed by the Senate.  ",2006
773,53,2006-05-17,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY), the ranking member  on the Appropriations Committee.  ",2006
774,53,2006-05-17,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, for weeks we  have been wondering whether the Republican moderates were going to stick  to their guns when they said they knew  that it was wrong to pass a budget that  provided $40 billion in tax cuts for people making $1 million a year while you  are squeezing the guts out of education  and health programs. We now know the  answer. They are doing a poor imitation of Bert Lahr, the Cowardly Lion in  ‘‘The Wizard of Oz.’’ I wish Bert were  here. He would cry at their performance.  The fact is they are now selling out  for a promise that if sometime in the  deep, dark, distant  future somebody  does something to change this budget  resolution, then there might be a table  scrap or two left for additional education and health care. There is about  as much chance of that happening as  there is of the Chicago Cubs winning  the pennant this year.  With respect to what the gentleman  from Florida said on education, the  fact  is  the Congress  promised  the  States that on special education we  would pay for 40 percent of the costs.  Each year for the last 3 years, the Federal share of the cost of special education has been cut by budgets that  you have voted for.  You talk about Pell Grants. The fact  is it costs $3,400 more to go to a 4-year  public college today than it did 5 years  ago. The President wanted to solve  that by adding $100 to the Pell Grant  program. House Republicans said, no,  that was too much. You cut it to $50,  and then when you sent it to the Senate, you cut out the rest of the 50  bucks.  So, in 5 years you have not done one  whit to make it easier for people to go  to  college  by  increasing  the Pell  Grants.  So do not give us your crocodile  tears, and do not brag  incidentally  about how much you have increased  education for the last 6 years, because  there are $16 billion in the education  budget today that would not be there if  we had not dragged you kicking and  screaming  into  supporting  Labor-  Health budgets that in the end were  higher than the original House Republican budget.  So I do not mind if the gentleman  wants to live in the Land of Oz. Just do  not take us there with you.

791,67,2006-05-17,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, it looks  like we are beginning to make some  progress. About  4 weeks  ago,  this  amendment was introduced in its original form, and unfortunately debate was  derailed. We were unsuccessful in moving on for further amendments and debate. Fortunately, it looks as if things  have gotten back on track. We are  starting to see votes and debate on  amendments. I don’t necessarily like  the way all of the votes are turning  out, but this is the Senate and majority rules and I accept that.  All of us who are interested in comprehensive immigration reform want to  see this bill continue to move, to have  amendments laid down, debated, and  have them voted on. I am very pleased  that it appears that we are very close  to having, if not unanimous agreement,  at least majority support on a bipartisan basis  for the amendment that  Senator KYLand I laid down about a  month ago and which has now been  modified slightly to bring more people  on board.  This amendment, quite simply, is designed to make sure that convicted felons and people who have committed at  least three misdemeanors do not get  the benefit of the  legalization track  contained in the underlying bill, whatever it may be. There will be other  amendments  later  on  that  perhaps  won’t share the same sort of bipartisan  and majority support. But this one at  least seems to have gathered a solid  group of Senators to support it.  In addition to convicted felons, those  who have committed at  least  three  misdemeanors would not be given the  benefit of earned legalization under the  bill. It would also exclude absconders.  By that, I mean people who have actually had their day in court and have  been ordered deported from the country but have simply gone underground,  hunkered down in the hope they might  be able to stay.  There have been some motions made  regarding this amendment for waiver  by the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security  for extraordinary  circumstances. For example, if someone is able to establish that they didn’t  actually get notified, then as a matter  of fundamental due process considerations they ought to be able to revisit  that and to show that they did not get  notice of the removal proceedings. We  agreed that would be a fair basis to  waive this provision.  Finally,  it also appears  that  the  other basis for waiver would be if the  alien’s failure to appear was due to exceptional  circumstances  beyond  the  control of the alien—a very narrow exception; and, finally, if the alien’s departure from the United States would  result  in  extreme  hardship  to  the  alien’s spouse, parent, or child who is a  citizen of the United States or an alien  lawfully permitted to have permanent  status.  We move it in the right direction. It  is a fundamentally fair and commonsense amendment. I am pleased to support it and announce what appears to  be a growing consensus that it should  be accepted.  I reserve the remainder of our time.  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who  yields time?  ",2006

793,67,2006-05-17,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, for the  benefit of my colleagues, I would like  to point out that we spent the better  part of yesterday negotiating with Senator KYL and Senator CORNYN, along  with Senator KENNEDY and others, a  group of us. We have been trying to  modify the original Kyl-Cornyn amendment so that it would be broadly acceptable. I think we have succeeded,  thanks to the goodwill of all parties  concerned.  Fundamentally, the purpose, which  we are all in agreement with, is we  don’t want people who are convicted  felons or criminals guilty of crimes to  be eligible for citizenship in this country. We have enough problems without  opening up that avenue. Yet, at the  same time, we didn’t want to go too far  to exclude people from eligibility for  citizenship who,  frankly, may have  committed  incidental crimes or  the  crime was associated with their attempt to enter this country.  For example, in order to obtain asylum, when people flee oppressive and  repressive regimes in which their lives  are at risk, and they had to use a bogus  or counterfeit document in order to expedite their entrance into this country,  of course, we don’t think that should  make them ineligible for citizenship or  application for citizenship.  I think we have reached a careful balance. There are categories of people  under conditions of extreme hardship  or danger who are seeking asylum and  would be exempted, but at the same  time  the  thrust of  the Kyl-Cornyn  amendment, which is the prevention of  people who have committed  felonies  and  numbers  of misdemeanors  and  other crimes would not be eligible for a  path to citizenship as outlined in the  legislation that would apply to the others who have not committed crimes.  I am aware there is some concern  about this on both sides of this issue. I  want to assure everyone that this is  the product of a long, arduous series of  negotiations and discussions among all  involved in this issue.  I hope there is an understanding that  we have come up with what most of us  think is a reasonable compromise to  address very  legitimate concerns on  both sides. People who are fleeing oppression may have used a bogus document, and on the other side of the coin,  obviously, someone who has committed  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:59 May 18, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G17MY6.001 S17MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006
794,81,2006-05-17,Mr. KENNEDY.," Madam President, I  want to bring some relevant and important facts to the debate. As we have  pointed out, we are for security of the  border. We have outlined, in my earlier  comments, the provisions in this legislation which would help  to achieve  that. I want to point out some of the  history of the building of a fence and  the cost of the building of a fence.  When the first fence was going to be  built,  Congressman  the  House’s largest proponent of fencing,  originally estimated the cost of completing the 14 miles of fencing in San  Diego at $14 million, the same as the  current estimate, I believe, of the Senator from Alabama. Fencing was completed over 11 miles, and the cost was  more  than  200 percent over budget,  costing $42 million. The real cost of  construction ended up being more than  $3.8 million per mile. At that rate, a  complete fence across the U.S.-Mexican  border would cost $7.6 billion.  As was referenced, the House of Representatives position calls  for a 700-  mile  fence.  Congressman  boasts of securing an additional $35  million for the last 3 miles of fencing  in San Diego, approximately $12 million per mile. These costs are significantly higher because of difficult terrain. Much of the U.S. border with  Mexico crosses mountain terrain such  as these 3 miles, potentially driving up  the cost of borderwide security.  Let’s look at what happened in terms  of people. Currently, there are 70 miles  of fencing along the U.S.- Mexican border,  including 40 miles  in California  and 25 in Arizona. Partial fencing of  the U.S.-Mexican border  shifted migrant  traffic  from one area  to  the  other. The apprehensions dropped  in  San Diego from a high of 450,000 in 1994,  when fencing construction began, to a  low of 136,000 in 2005, a reduction of 70  percent. Over the same period, the apprehensions in the Tucson sector, covering most of Arizona, rose from 137,000  in 1994 to 489,000, almost an exact shift  in migrant traffic from San Diego to  Arizona. So the number of apprehensions along the U.S. border from 1994 to  2005 has  barely  fluctuated,  ranging  from 900,000 to well over a million per  year.  What the facts show is that having  large-scale fences has been grossly inadequate, if we are talking about security. We need to have real, effective security, as we discussed earlier, the virtual fence, using the latest in technology, and also enforcement of laws in  the workplace which will discourage  people from coming and which those  who have studied this believe to be the  most effective.  We are talking about a cost of billions of dollars for something that has  not been  shown  to be  effective  in  achieving an outcome. There are ways  of securing the border, but this is not  the way to do so, for the reasons I outlined earlier and the reasons I cited at  this time. We have evaluations of fencing in our legislation. We ought to find  out what is the most effective way,  whether we use the virtual fence, the  newer technologies, what is having the  best and most positive result, and invest in that. That is what we ought to  do.  What we are doing this afternoon is a  good-feeling vote, in terms of trying to  give some assurances to the American  people, which history has  shown  is  highly costly, and  in  terms of  the  amount of resources we are likely to  expend has not been effective.  For the reason of raising the kinds of  conflicts that we are going to have  with our neighbors to the south rather  than working with them effectively,  there are better and more effective  ways of securing the border.  I hope this amendment will be defeated.  As I understand it, there is a desire  to vote at 2:30. I think I have used  about all my time. I would be glad to  yield back the time, maybe move on to  another amendment.  ",2006

796,81,2006-05-17,Mr. SPECTER.," Madam President, we  are talking about a possible 2:30 vote.  The day is badly fragmented with a  signing ceremony at the White House  at  1:45,  a  briefing  by  Director  Negroponte at 3, and a social at the  White House at 5. It is pretty hard to  see how we get any business done when  we dodge in and out of the raindrops in  a hurricane. But we are talking about  a 2:30 vote. If we are to have it, I wanted to stack three votes at that time.  We are going to respect what Senator  REIDwants to do, to take them up one  at a time, but we are asking Senator  VITTERto come over right now because  we are about to wrap up. Senator SESSIONSwants 10 more minutes. I will  speak briefly. Then we will yield back  the remainder of the time. Then after  Senator  amendment  is  heard—we have already argued Senator  INHOFE’s amendment—we may be in a  position to stack three votes at 2:30 or  very close to that time. That is what  we are looking toward.  I yield to Senator SESSIONS for his  final 10 minutes and yield back the remainder of the time to move on to Senator VITTER’s amendment.  ",2006
797,81,2006-05-17,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Alabama.  ,2006
798,81,2006-05-17,Mr. SESSIONS.," Madam President, we  are at a point where everybody in this  body—and overwhelmingly, the American people—wants to see a lawful system of  immigration  in America. We  can all disagree about what to do about  the people who have come here illegally already. There are a lot of ideas  about  that. We  can disagree about  what our policy should be in the future, but we pretty well have been unified on that point. The 370 miles of  fencing that we are talking about, plus  barriers for vehicle traffic in a larger  amount, has the support of Secretary  VITTER’s  of Homeland Security Chertoff and the  administration. They believe  it  is a  good expenditure, and they are prepared to help find the money to fund it  because it will save money in the long  run. It is a one-time expenditure and  will be a multiplier of the effectiveness  of every single Border Patrol agent.  As we have heard  from Senators  CORNYNand KYL, who have visited the  border on a regular basis, we have borders that run right through the middle  of towns and communities. How could  we possibly put enough agents at every  corner, every street to guard it? We  need to do better and we can do better.  I am amused by my colleague from  Illinois, Senator DURBIN, saying there  is going to be 1,000 miles of fencing. I  had originally offered in committee 700  miles. That is what the House passed.  We have now come in and listened to  the  administration  and  proposed  a  modest  figure of 370 total, counting  portions of the fence already built in  San Diego, and those being refurbished  in Arizona. The House is at 700. So the  argument that it is going to be a fence  across the whole border or the argument that we are going to build 1,000  miles of fence is not very plausible.  Frankly, if the Senate is at 370 and the  House is at 700, we are not likely to  come out with a compromise at 1,000.  What kind of argument is that?  Then we heard the argument that it  is  going  to  bankrupt America. We  spend over $800 billion a year. We can’t  find a billion dollars to fix this problem? We certainly can. They ask: Will  it work? I say  let them go to San  Diego. Let them go there and talk to  the people on both sides of the border  where the whole county showed a 56-  percent  reduction  in crime, and on  both sides of that fence the economy is  booming. It  is safe and secure. The  smugglers and dope dealers are gone,  and things are much better off. It is a  positive development. Why are we having opposition to it?  Senator KYLcame close to the truth  when he said: Whenever anything gets  proposed—I  am  paraphrasing—that  might actually work, we get an objection to it. What about a good identifier  card? They say something  like that  makes sense, but every time we get  close to having a good biometric identifier card that would actually work,  we get all kinds of objections.  There is no doubt that some people  believe in open borders. There are people who do not want to see this immigration system become a lawful system. I will repeat, we are a nation of  immigrants. We are going to increase  the number of immigrants. I will support increasing the number of lawful  immigrants into our country by a reasonable amount, not three to five times  the current level that is in this bill  today, even after we reduced the numbers last night. Three to five times is  way out of the range of what should be  accepted. But we are going to increase  immigration. We are not against immigration. I reject that.

800,88,2006-05-17,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President, before I give my remarks, I would like to  extend a thank you to the Senator  from Arizona and to the Senator from  Massachusetts. During the debate on  this issue a couple of weeks ago, it became pretty obvious that there were  some Members in this body who did not  want to see the Senate function the  way it always has, with respect to legislation, and that is to give all Members of this body the opportunity to debate an issue, to submit amendments,  and to ultimately have a vote on those  amendments and a vote on the legislation. Were it not for the efforts of Senator MCCAINand Senator KENNEDY, we  would have been at a deadlock, once  again, and those of us who object to  this underlying bill would not have had  the opportunity to see the Senate work  its will. So I do extend a thank you to  these Senators  for  the very professional way  in which  they handled  themselves during the course of the debate a couple of weeks ago, as well as  right now.  I rise in strong support of Senator  VITTER’s amendment, and I am proud  to be a cosponsor of it. I think this  amendment crystalizes the whole debate we are having in the Senate on  this bill. It all comes down to the simple question of whether you oppose or  you favor amnesty.  I think the way Senators vote on this  amendment will tell you where they  stand on this issue, so I hope the American people will take careful note of  how every Senator in this body votes  on this amendment. I am in favor of a  comprehensive  immigration  reform  bill. The way I see it, there are three  areas that must be addressed in accomplishing  comprehensive  reform. The  first and foremost is border security. If  we do not have operational control of  our borders and serious interior worksite  enforcement,  then  there  is no  point in trying to address the other  issues relative to comprehensive reform.  The second key component we must  address is to have a viable temporary  guestworker program for those outside  of the country who want to come to  this country and work in a job that  needs to be filled that cannot, or will  not, be filled by an American worker.  The third component we must address is the reality of the 11 million, 12  million—whatever the number is—of illegal immigrants who are currently in  the United States.  I think we can address all three of  these issues without providing a new  path to citizenship for those who are  currently here  illegally. There have  been  a  number  of  alternative  approaches mentioned  throughout  this  debate. I had one for agricultural workers, for example, which would have allowed those workers to remain working  for a period of 2 years before returning  to their home country and have them  reenter the United States on a valid  and viable guest worker program. This  would allow employers  to  structure  their workforce in a way that they can  send their  illegal workers home and  have them return  in a manner that  does not result  in a complete work  stoppage on our Nation’s farms.  My main opposition to amnesty is  that it has been tried before and it has  been proven that it does not work.  As  chairman of  the Senate Agriculture Committee, my main focus in  this debate has been on agricultural  workers. I firmly believe that an amnesty is not in the best interests of agriculture in the United States. The agricultural amnesty in this bill is so  similar  to  the Special Agricultural  Worker Program that was enacted as  the mechanism for the 1986 amnesty  bill that it is really startling. We have  heard many Senators talk about all  that illegal aliens have to do in order  to adjust their status. However, I don’t  think many people realize that the requirements are not the same for illegal  agricultural workers, under the base  bill. For illegal agricultural workers to  take advantage of the amnesty in this  bill, they must have worked at least  150 hours in agriculture over a 2-year  period, ending  in December of  2005.  Meeting  that  threshold  requirement  will allow the illegal worker to obtain  a blue card.  Once in possession of a blue card—  which is a new process, a new card—  that currently  illegal worker has a  choice of two different paths to a green  card. In addition to paying back taxes,  he can work 100 hours per year for 5  years or work 150 hours per year for 3  years and get a green card. There is not  even a requirement to learn English for  agricultural workers to take advantage  of the amnesty provision in the base  bill.  I think the requirements for illegal  workers to take advantage of the agricultural amnesty are so low that I fear  a repeat of what happened, and failed,  in 1986. We should not repeat the mistakes we made before.  I am not the only one who feels this  way. Several months ago, as we were  ramping up toward bringing this bill to  the  floor,  I had the opportunity to  speak to 135 brand new American citizens who came from 125 different countries. They were sworn in at the Federal building in Atlanta, GA. After my  comments to them and their swearing-  in ceremony, I had about two dozen of  these 133 individuals come up to me,  one at a time, and say: Senator, whatever you do, please don’t allow those  folks who came into this country illegally to get a pathway to citizenship  that is different from the path I had to  follow.  In some instances, these individuals  took 5 years; in some instances 8; in  some instances 12. In one instance, 22  years that individual had to work to  become a citizen of the United States.  For all 133 of those individuals who  stood up that morning and raised their  right hand and swore to uphold the  Constitution of the United States, it  was the proudest day of their  lives.  You can understand why they do not  want somebody who came  into this  country illegally to get a leg up on people who were in the position that they  were in for so many years, trying to  earn citizenship.  The people I saw at that naturalization ceremony truly did earn their citizenship, and  it means something to  them, as it should to everybody who  becomes an American citizen. It does  not seem fair to me to call the process  those  newly  naturalized  individuals  followed earned citizenship and also  call the provision for illegal agricultural workers in this bill earned citizenship. There  is a  fundamental difference between the two that should be  recognized in the rhetoric of this debate.  Another problem I have with the agricultural amnesty provision is that it  does not  remedy  the problem with  fraud that was prevalent in the 1986  Special Agricultural Worker Program.  Under the 1986 program, illegal farm  workers who did at least 90 days of  farm work during a 12-month period  could earn a legal status. The illegal  immigrants had  to present evidence  that they did at least 90 days of farm  work, such as pay stubs or a letter  from an employer or even fellow workers. Because it was assumed that many  unauthorized farm workers were employed by labor contractors, who did  not keep accurate records, after a farm  worker had presented evidence that he  had done qualifying  farm work, the  burden of proof shifted to the Government to disprove the claimed work.  The Government was not prepared  for the flood of SAW applicants and  had  little expertise on  typical harvesting seasons. Therefore, an applicant who  told  a  story  such  as:  I  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:25 May 18, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G17MY6.037 S17MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006

It is estimated that there are currently around 12 million illegal immigrants in this country. And I do not  support the proposition that everyone  of those 12 million illegal immigrants  currently in the United States should  be given the right to a green card and  eventual citizenship.  However,  there  are  certain  cases  where  illegal  immigrants have been  here  for a very  long time—in some  cases, for decades. Some of these people have families here and deep ties to  their local communities.  The Vitter amendment would have  made no exception for such cases at all.  And I do think that we need some flexibility for humanitarian reasons.  For this reason, I voted against the  Vitter amendment. But I would like to  emphasize that I am not in favor of a  broad, blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants.  AMENDMENTNO. 4018  ",2006

836,102,2006-05-17,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, it is a  very fundamental reason why. You are  talking about the H–1B. You are talking about  the most highly  skilled,  highly educated, and highly competent  individuals in the world—H–1B—going  on to universities, going into the high-  tech areas, individuals for which the  world is their oyster. They do not suffer the kind of exploitation, the kind of  humiliation that other workers suffer.  These workers are taking  jobs that  American workers will not take.  There is a big difference between that  and going  to  the  top companies of  America and working  for  the CEO,  when you have all the education, the  professional degrees. Those individuals  are not the ones being exploited. They  never have been, and  they are not  today. It is an entirely different situation.  We are talking about the tough, difficult work  that no American will  take. We are talking about the history  of these kinds of jobs. We have seen it.  We have read about it. We have experienced it. I did, certainly, in the early  1960s, going across the Southwest in  the Bracero Program. Exploitation is  one of the sad aspects of American employment history. We do not want to  go there.  The H–2Bs  in my State are doing  very well at universities and colleges  and enormously successful businesses.  The idea behind the H–2Bs was getting  the very able and gifted people. As history has shown, that results in the hiring of additional people because of  their abilities. They end up, as a result  of these programs, adding key elements  of success to various businesses and  employment expands. Generally, those  are good jobs with good benefits and  good retirement. That is an entirely  different situation. I am glad we were  able to clear that up.  I yield the floor.  ",2006
837,102,2006-05-17,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Texas.  ,2006
838,102,2006-05-17,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts  candidly responding to the questions I  asked. What his answers established  was that in order for guest workers  under his proposal to come into the  country in the first place, they have to  have an employer, someone who has indicated that there is a job available for  them. Under  the  amendment,  they  could work in that job for a cumulative  period of up to 4 years. But for some  reason, under the current bill, after 4  years, you would no  longer have to  have an employer who would certify  that they had a job available for that  guest worker to do and that no American was available to do it.  I also appreciate the Senator’s candor in answering the question about  highly skilled workers. As his answer  indicated, highly skilled workers cannot come into the country unless there  is an employer who is willing to sponsor them. My point is that we ought to  make our  immigration  law uniform  across  the  employment  spectrum,  whether you are a high-skilled worker  or whether you are a low-skilled worker.  The Senator mentioned the Bracero  Program and reports of exploitation of  workers in America’s past. I won’t debate that with him. I have read of reports of problems with  the Bracero  Program. While the program as a whole  was pretty good, I won’t debate whether there were some problems associated  with it. But America, in 2006, is not  America in the 1950s. The legal protection that is available for guest workers  under this program, the vigilance of  the media and advocacy groups, will  make it virtually impossible for the  kind of exploitation the Senator talks  about to occur. What happens is, in  spite of the protections offered to the  guest workers under our labor laws and  despite the vigilance of the media and  advocacy groups that would likely disclose any problems with a relationship  between a guest worker and that employer, what we are finding out is that  the one who ultimately has to pay the  price for this concern, that I believe  will not be realized and is not real, is  the American worker who can’t find a  job because we have offered that job to  a guest worker who has come into the  United States.  At bottom, we ought to be as sure as  we possibly can that whatever we do  doesn’t  create more  problems  for  American workers. The answer is, let’s  give American workers every opportunity to find jobs and then, if we can’t  find a sufficient workforce, let’s give  guest workers an opportunity to fill in  those gaps. That is a worthy objective.  But we should not be blind to the potential dangers to American workers  losing jobs to guest workers under this  program, unless the protections in this  amendment are adopted—that an employer attest that the employer will  employ the alien in the offered job position and the Secretary of Labor determines and certifies that there are  not sufficient U.S. workers who are  able, willing, qualified, and available  to fill the job position.  I don’t know whether there are others who want to speak either for or  against the amendment.  I know we  agreed to an hour between us. Depending on whether the distinguished manager of the bill on the minority side  would be interested in yielding time  back, I think we have had a chance to  cover  the merits of  this particular  The  The  amendment.

853,109,2006-05-17,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President, in 2002  Congress  passed  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act, providing  important  safeguards  against unscrupulous accounting practices. In the wake of significant corporate accounting scandals, Congress  created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board overseen by the  Securities and Exchange Commission.  It restricted the actions of accounting  firms who perform audits—specifically  preventing  them  from  undertaking  other activities which lead to conflicts  of interest. At the end of the day, this  legislation  is  important  to  protect  shareholders and employees from dishonest accounting practices that can  cost them their futures and, in extreme  cases, even their businesses.  Section  404 of Sarbanes-Oxley  requires the Commission to create rules  for annual reports and to prescribe internal control reports to ensure that financial reporting is accurate and ethical. The goals of this provision are  warranted but the burden on smaller  publicly held companies has come at a  great cost.  Unfortunately, they are also incredibly and unnecessarily burdensome for  small- and medium-sized businesses. In  my State of Montana, it is these small-  and medium-sized businesses that fuel  the engine of our economy. Small businesses are collectively the largest employer in Montana, and it has always  been important to me that the Federal  Government consider the  impact  its  regulatory policies have on small businesses.  For this reason, I am proud to be  added as an original cosponsor of legislation that will reduce some of the burden  facing  small businesses,  specifically in section 404. S. 2824, the Competitive and Open Markets that Protect and Enhance Treatment of Entrepreneurs Act, or COMPETE Act, will  not remove the important safeguards  that Sarbanes-Oxley created, but  it  will increase the flexibility of the law  to allow businesses to comply with the  law with less hardship.  In 2004, the average cost for a public  company to be public was $3.4 million.  One out of every three dollars spent  were for audits performed even if there  was little or no value of those audits to  the investors. It defies common sense  to have the same requirements for the  largest public companies as we do for  the smallest, and the COMPETE Act  will  offer  small-  and medium-sized  companies the option to comply with  standard  internal  control guidelines  with enhanced internal controls, greater transparency, and specific restrictions against conflicts of interest.  One of the things I have learned here  in Washington, DC,  is that one-size-  fits-all solutions don’t work. American  innovation is too diverse to encompass  through  inflexible  regulations. When  we passed Sarbanes-Oxley, our intentions were to protect investors and employees from the minority of companies that abused accounting practices  to mislead their shareholders. This intention remains important, but in the  past years  I have heard  from Montanans about the unforeseen and unintended consequences of this legislation.  The COMPETE Act can sort these out,  keeping the goals of Sarbanes-Oxley intact, while  increasing the  flexibility  needed  to make  the  regulation  as  harmless as possible to honest businesses.  f  COMMENDING THE USTR  ",2006
854,109,2006-05-17,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, I  rise today because, as you may know,  for several years now there have been  ongoing  negotiations  between  the  State of Israel and the Office of the  United States Trade Representative,  USTR, regarding Israel’s protections of  U.S.  intellectual  property  rights.  I  commend the USTR for so vigorously  protecting these very valuable assets  to the U.S. economy. However, what  has caused my colleagues and I concern  has been the treatment of Israel in this  process; a process that we hope will become more transparent. This year, I  was joined by Senators SCHUMER and  WYDEN on a letter to the U.S. Trade  Representative  expressing  our  hope  that  the  positive  steps  Israel  has  taken, particularly in the context of  how many of our other trading partners have acted, would be granted the  recognition it deserves. Unfortunately,  when this year’s Special 301 report was  released, Israel was put on par with  countries such as China and Russia  while other countries, which have little  or no intellectual property protections,  were given a much less egregious designation.  Ron Dermer, the  Israel Embassy’s  Minister for Economic Affairs, recently  stated that ‘‘countries with a record of  much more severe breaches of intellectual property than those attributed to  Israel, are not included in these lists.’’  I do look forward to continuing our  work with the Office of the USTR on  this issue and to make sure that those  countries that are working towards our  mutual goals are met with the recognition and support from our government  they deserve.  f  AMERICAN UNIVERSITY  ",2006

856,116,2006-05-17,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to  introduce  legislation  that  would temporarily reduce the duty on  automatic shower cleaners on behalf of  S.C. Johnson, a company headquartered in Racine, WI.  I understand the importance of manufacturing and the role it plays in our  everyday lives. It is no secret that the  Bush administration has enfeebled the  manufacturing sector, cutting needed  funding that helps manufacturers stay  competitive. Since 2000, Wisconsin has  been hit hard, losing 90,000 manufacturing jobs. A healthy manufacturing  sector is key to better jobs, rising productivity, and higher standards of living. Every individual and industry depends on manufactured goods. And the  production of those goods creates the  quality jobs that keep so many American families healthy and strong.  This  legislation would  reduce  the  duty on automatic shower cleaners, an  input S.C. Johnson refines to make  high  quality  and  affordable  shower  cleaners that eliminate the build-up of  tough soap scum, mold, and mildew  stains for the U.S. market. S.C. Johnson was created in 1886 as a parquet  flooring company and today is one of  the world’s leading manufacturers of  household products  including Ziploc  storage containers, Windex glass cleaner, Raid insect repellant, and Glade fragrances. Today, S.C. Johnson employs  12,000 people and provides products in  more than 110 countries around the  world. In January of 2006, S.C. Johnson  was awarded the Ron Brown Award for  Corporate  Leadership  for  its  outstanding  achievements  in  employee  and community relations. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  text of the legislation be printed in the  RECORD.

889,151,2006-05-17,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of H. Res. 499, condemning the murder of American  journalist Paul Klebnikov  in  Moscow and the murders of other members of  the media in the Russian Federation.  Less than two weeks ago, on World Press  Freedom Day, my colleague MIKEPENCEand  I launched the new Congressional Caucus for  Freedom of the Press. Representatives from a  variety  of  non-governmental  organizations  came to extend their endorsement of this undertaking and several other Members of Congress spoke about  the  importance of press  freedom for promoting democracy and human  rights around the world.  The guests of honor, however—and the reason we were all  there—were  the  journalists  who came to share their stories of persecution  and harassment. He Qinglian spent a year  under 24-hour surveillance when the Chinese  Propaganda Department accused her of ‘inciting antagonism between the different strata of  Chinese society’ with her exposes of government corruption. After trying to investigate the  presence of Taliban and AI-Qaeda elements in  tribal areas in the autonomous zone between  Pakistan and Afghanistan, Khawar Mehdi Rizvi  was detained and tortured by Pakistani security  forces  for almost  three months, before  human rights groups and media organizations  helped  secure  his  escape  to  the United  States.  We were also joined by Musa Klebnikov, the  widow of American journalist, Paul Klebnikov,  whose unresolved murder this resolution condemns. Mrs. Klebnikov told us that Paul believed that without freedom of the press there  is no civil society, and can be no true democracy. He died for this ideal, becoming one of  the  fallen heroes of  this ongoing worldwide  struggle.  Paul committed himself to revealing the corrupt underside of Russia as well as celebrating its successes. His murder reveals both  the importance of this type of work as well as  the dangers facing journalists in the Russian  Federation. Paul was the twelfth reporter to be  killed in Russia since President Putin came to  power  in 2000. Russia’s press  laws  remain  very far below European standards and in the  nearly two years since Paul’s murder, working  conditions for journalists continued to worsen  alarmingly.  Paul’s murder stimulated the Russian government to dedicate real effort to prosecuting  the hit men who shot him, and this resolution  commends that effort. Unfortunately, two days  after expressing her hope that this trial would  set a standard for future cases of media persecution, the Russian court acquitted his killers. This resolution calls upon the Government  of Russia to continue its inquiries into Paul’s  murder and to take appropriate action to protect the independence and freedom of journalists in the country.  Paul Klebnikov’s murder exposed the problem of violence against journalists in Russia  and  increased  the awareness of widespread  threats to press freedom. The Congressional  Caucus for Freedom of the Press was created  to highlight and condemn media censorship  and the persecution of journalists around the  world. This Resolution is an important affirmation of these objectives, and I commend my  colleague, Mr. MCCOTTER, for bringing it to the  floor, and encourage broad support for its passage.  f  RECOGNIZING  CULTURAL  AND  EDUCATIONAL  CONTRIBUTIONS  OF AMERICAN BALLET THEATRE  SPEECHOF  HON.

890,151,2006-05-17,Mr. SHAYS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in  support of H. Res. 751, recognizing American  Ballet Theatre as a cultural and educational  resource for our Nation.  Over  the  last 65 years, American Ballet  Theatre has elevated the artistry and talent of  classical dance in the United States, and has  brought a greater appreciation and understanding of the arts to countless people in all  50 States and around the world.  American Ballet Theatre has developed a  special relationship with Connecticut  through  the award-winning Make a Ballet Program.  Since 2002, ABT has been offering this program at The Waterside School, an  independent,  private  day  school  in Stamford,  which introduces low-income children to ballet.  ABT Teaching Artists come to the school twice  a week and provide a thorough introduction to  the arts and high-quality dance  instruction.  This long-term, in-depth exposure to the arts  leaves indelible impacts on the students, instilling a sense of confidence and accomplishment, and planting seeds that will reap appreciation for the arts for years to come.  American Ballet Theatre also holds a Ballet  for the Young Dancer program at the YWCA  in Greenwich each year, providing children between the ages of 5 and 12 with weekly ballet  classes with some of the finest dancers in the  world.  While  the grand performances  that American Ballet Theatre presents have established  it as one of the world’s great ballet companies,  it  is  the  interactions with  local communities  across America that truly distinguish ABT as a  national treasure.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  f  IN HONOR OF ARNOLD R. PINKNEY  HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 17, 2006  ",2006

Mr. Pinkney was born and raised in Youngstown and graduated  from  the Youngstown  Public Schools. His quest for higher education  led him to Michigan, where he graduated from  Albion College with a Bachelor of Arts degree  in Political Science and History.

The focus on hard work and giving back to  others continues to frame Mr. Pinkney’s life.  He  is  the Chairman of Pinkney-Perry  Insurance Agency, a 41-year-old business located  in Cleveland. He is also Senior Consultant and  CEO of Betpin & Associates, a consulting firm  established by his wife of 45 years, Betty  Thompson Pinkney. His dedication to his wife  and daughter, Traci Lynne Pinkney, extends  outward into the community, where his spirit of  volunteerism, leadership and energy continues  to empower and support numerous local civic,  educational, political and business agencies,  including the Urban League, 100 Black Men,  Inc., Cleveland Musical Arts Association, University Circle Incorporated, and the Race for  Success, Inc.

893,158,2006-05-17,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute  to Florence Ricketts Gaynor, my constituent, who will celebrate her birthday on  May 18, 2006. She will be 105 years of age.  I offer my congratulations to her on this special day, and my hearty wishes that she celebrate many more.  Born on May 18, 1901, Mrs. Gaynor was  one of eight children of Frances Drake and  James Ricketts who resided in Crooked River,  Clarendon,  Jamaica, West  Indies.  In  the  1920’s, she married Gilbert Gaynor  in May  Pen, Clarendon, where they had six children.  Throughout her life, Mrs. Gaynor remained  active in the church, especially the Mother’s  Union. She worked as a sales clerk and a  seamstress. She was also employed  in  the  laundry at the U.S. Air Base at Vernon Field,  Jamaica. Her husband, Gilbert Gaynor, died in  1978.  Mrs. Gaynor immigrated to New York City in  May 2001, shortly after her 100th birthday, to  live with two of her daughters—Violet Morgan  and Enid Gaynor. They reside on Riverside  Drive in the Washington Heights neighborhood  of my congressional district.  Mrs. Gaynor has 14 grandchildren, 14 great  grandchildren and one great, great granddaughter.  Mrs. Gaynor attributes her long life to her  faith in God and uses white rum as part of her  final hair rinse to prevent colds. As a proud  resident of  the United States, she  is very  happy  to have a permanent  resident card  even though she has no plans to work.  It  is my great privilege  to  represent Mrs.  Gaynor in the Congress of the United States,  and I call upon my colleagues to join with me  in wishing her a happy birthday and joyous reunion with her  family  to celebrate  the occasion.  f  TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH (JOE) F.

894,158,2006-05-17,Mr. MCCOTTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  honor  and  recognize  Joseph  (Joe)  F.  Dunnabeck, Sr. as he celebrates the arrival of  his 90th birthday, May 20, 2006.  An adventurous and spirited  leader, Joe  dedicated his life to helping others. Joe and  Lillian, his wife of 30 years, have led by example, spreading their ‘‘no such thing as can’t’’  philosophy. With tireless effort, Joe served his  Michigan community as a mechanic at  the  American Standard before retirement; and he  still donates time to support the local Neighborhood Watch.  A  devout Catholic,  Joe  personifies  the  teachings of his church through fairness, humility, and  love. His pure and adventurous  spirit has challenged  the boundaries of age  with his  legendary exploits of hang gliding,  and riding in hot-air balloons and on air-boats.  As he nears his ninth decade of  life, Joe’s  kindheartedness and bravery continues to inspire and ennoble his family and friends.  Mr. Speaker, in honor of his lifetime of benevolence and courage, I ask my colleagues  to  join me  in celebrating Joe’s birthday and  thanking him for his contributions to our community and our country.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE  80TH ANNIVERSARY OF WHALEY CHILDREN’S  CENTER  HON. DALE E. KILDEE  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 17, 2006  ",2006
895,158,2006-05-17,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, today I ask the  House of Representatives to join me in congratulating the Whaley Children’s Center as it  celebrates 80 years helping children  in my  hometown  of  Flint,  Michigan.  Whaley  Chlldren’s Center will hold an open house on  May 18 to showcase their services and commemorate their anniversary.  Robert J. Whaley, then President of Citizens  Bank, decided  to organize a home  for neglected,  forgotten children during  the 1880s.  He made his decision to honor the memory of  his deceased I son, Donald M. Whaley. At the  time of his death at the age of eleven, Donald  was saving money to send to an orphanage in  the Detroit area. His father conceived of the  idea to create a home for less fortunate children and bequeathed in his will the funds to  build the Donald M. Whaley Home. On January 26, 1924 the Whaley Foundation was organized under the trusteeship of the wardens  and vestry of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church.  After  consulting  with  the  Child Welfare  League, the Memorial Home was built in 1926.  The Memorial Home has metamorphosed  into the Whaley Children’s Center, dedicated  to helping troubled children achieve self-sufficiency at the same time meeting their everyday needs. Using the four pillars of the ‘‘Circle  of  Courage’’ model:  Independence, Generosity, Mastery, and Belonging; Whaley Children’s Center strives to serve the whole child.  At  the present  time  the Whaley Children’s  Center can serve 51 children  through  their  18th birthday and high  school graduation.  They have a separate unit, the McDonald Cottage, for children ages 6 through 10.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the outstanding efforts of the community, volunteers, board and  staff of  the Whaley Children’s Center. Their  steadfast devotion to the children they serve is  to be commended. I am glad that I have had  this opportunity to recognize their hard work  and  their exceptional achievements helping  our troubled youth attain a better future.  f  NOMINATION OF GEN. MICHAEL  HAYDEN AS DIRECTOR OF THE CIA  HON. TERRY EVERETT  OFALABAMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 17, 2006  ",2006
896,158,2006-05-17,Mr. EVERETT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of  the nomination of Gen. Michael  Hayden as the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I have known Gen. Hayden  for years and believe he is the most qualified  candidate in the country for this critical position.  To further illustrate this point, I would like to  call your attention to a recent editorial by retired Gen. Charles Boyd that appeared in the  Wall Street Journal on May 11 which makes a  convincing case for the Hayden nomination.  Mr. Speaker, Gen. Boyd served 35 years in  the Air Force. As a combat pilot in Vietnam,  he was shot down on his 105th mission and  survived 2,488 days as a prisoner of war. The  only POW from that war to achieve the four-  star rank, General Boyd’s final military assignment was as deputy commander  in chief of  U.S.  forces  in Europe. Prior  to  this assignment, Gen. Boyd was the commander of Air  University at Maxwell Air Force Base, in my  congressional district.  With  that, Mr. Speaker,  I ask unanimous  consent  to place  in  the RECORD a copy of  Gen. Boyd’s editorial.  [From the Wall Street Journal, May 11, 2006]  A HAYDENSYMPHONYATTHECIA  (By Charles G. Boyd)  Our political disagreements are often obtuse for the simple reason that it is difficult  to discern motives. Do disputants put the interests of the country ahead of partisan and  personal concerns? Moreover, disagreements  about intelligence issues are doubly hard to  parse, since—despite leaks and rampant gossip—most of what goes on inside the Central  Intelligence Agency remains opaque even to  high-paid journalists and other Washington  sophisticates. And so, amid partisan positioning and an imposing ignorance, is the  scene set for the already dismaying dispute  over the president’s nomination of Michael  Hayden to be CIA director.  The arguments (to use a generous term)  being made against Gen. Hayden are so without merit or even serious content that one  cannot help but suspect partisan stratagems  at work. Of these, three are most common.

898,2,2006-05-23,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, the Do-  Nothing Congress of 1948 is about to be  replaced as the most ineffective Congress in recent times. Today, just as in  1948, the American people are looking  to Congress to tackle some very important issues: The war in Iraq, rising gas  prices, rising college and health care  costs, the economic uncertainty resulting from the outsourcing of high-paying American jobs, and a record deficit  that continues to spiral out of control.  There is so much that this Congress  could be working on right now, but  House Republicans refuse to address  any of these concerns. In fact, it is difficult to address the concerns of the  American  people when Congress  is  never in session.  I am sure the American people will  be shocked to hear that this is only the  36th day the House is scheduled to hold  votes this year. With only 57 scheduled  voting days until adjournment,  the  House is now on track to meet 15 days  less than the first Do-Nothing Congress  of 1948. And it is no wonder the American people are so disgusted with Congress.  Mr. Speaker, the House Republican  majority is simply out of new ideas.  Any time that a crisis hits, they throw  out the same old ideas that haven’t  worked for them in the past and will  not work for them in the future. And  let me give you a case in point. This  week, House Republicans say they are  finally ready to address the record gas  prices Americans have been forced to  pay every time they go to the gas station. So what is the new idea House Republicans will bring to the floor this  week? Drilling in the Alaska wilderness, the area known as the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge. Well,  that  sounds familiar. That’s right. You’ve  heard it before. It’s nothing new. And  it will do absolutely nothing to help  American  consumers with  the  pain  they now face at the pump. In fact,  they wouldn’t even be able to start  drilling for oil out in this Alaska wilderness until a decade after Congress  gives its approval. Worse yet, ANWR  only holds enough oil  to provide  6  months of oil to the American consumer. This is simply not an energy solution. It is the same old idea.  So then why do Washington Republicans choose to ignore the problem?  Could it be that they have built such a  cozy relationship with the CEOs of Big  Oil that they are simply unwilling to  break these bonds? Let’s not  forget  that with two oil men in the White  House and a rubber-stamp Republican  Congress always ready to back them  up, big oil companies have seen their  profits quadruple in the past 4 years.  At the same time the price of gasoline  has doubled and our dependence on foreign oil has increased substantially.  As American  families  struggle  to  deal with  falling wages  and  rising  prices at the pump, the Republicans in  this body continue to deliver billions of  dollars in tax breaks to big oil companies.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is no wonder the  American  people  are  demanding  change. They want results, and they  aren’t getting them from this Republican majority.  Unlike  our Republican  colleagues,  House Democrats have offered some innovative and new ideas that are worth  exploring. Last week, the Democratic  Rural Working Group unveiled its ambitious plan to reduce our dependence  on foreign petroleum and promote the  production and use of clean renewable  energy here at home. In other words,  promote  the production and use of  clean renewable energy here at home  so we are not so dependent on foreign  oil.  Our proposal, the Democratic proposal, provides tax incentives to encourage increased biofuels production,  expands  the  ethanol  and  biodiesel  pumps at gas stations, and increases  the number of flex fuel vehicles on the  road.  The Democrats have also introduced  legislation that would rescind the tax  breaks to big oil companies. At a time  when they are breaking record profits  every quarter, why should the Federal  Government hand out tax breaks to  these companies? We shouldn’t. It is  simply not fair.  As Americans prepare to travel this  weekend for the Memorial Day holiday,  they should know that Democrats are  offering  real  solutions  to high gas  prices to protect the American consumer, not Big Oil.  Mr. Speaker, the American people  are  fed up with the Republican Do-  Nothing Congress and are demanding  change here in Washington, something  that Republicans  simply cannot deliver. It is time for fresh ideas. It is  time for Democrats to take control of  this House so that the needs of all  Americans are once again addressed on  this House floor rather than just the  corporate interests such as Big Oil.  f  109TH CONGRESS HAS UNFINISHED  BUSINESS  ",2006
899,2,2006-05-23,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Pursuant to the order of the House of January 31, 2006, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COOPER) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 minutes.  ",2006
900,2,2006-05-23,Mr. COOPER.," Mr. Speaker, my colleague from New Jersey who just spoke  is exactly right. This Congress, this  year,  this House of Representatives  will probably meet fewer days, fewer  hours than any Congress since 1948.  President Harry Truman called that  Congress the Do-Nothing Congress because it did almost nothing, and it only  tried to work for about 110 days out of  the whole year of 365 days. We will  meet for substantially fewer days than  the Do-Nothing Congress. So how do  you do less than nothing? Sadly, the  American public is about to find out.  Now, how does the schedule happen?  Well, in the House of Representatives,  it is set by the majority party. They  can choose. They can make us work a  long year or a short year, or a very  short year as they have decided to do  this year.  Now, why are we meeting for so few  days? Well, it is not because taxpayers  back home aren’t paying us a full-time,  full-year salary. We are making the  same pay. But yet we are able to spend  9 or 10 months of the year back home  in our districts. And I love that.

902,9,2006-05-23,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  6 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY), the  ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.  ",2006
903,9,2006-05-23,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker,  I had originally  intended to vote for this bill and for this  rule; but the action of the Rules Committee on one  item  last night has  changed all of that, at least for me, and  I would like to alert Members of the  House as to the reasons why.  In the farm bill that passed several  years ago, the expiration date for various programs wound up not being  identical; and  that meant  that  the  dairy program was hugely at a disadvantage after the expiration of the  dairy title of the farm bill. Last year  the Congress renewed the dairy section  of the bill that related to the milk program, but it contained a budget gimmick which ended the dairy program  one month before the end of the fiscal  year and one month before the other  farm programs in that bill.  As a result, when the next farm program is put together next year, dairy  will be at a huge disadvantage because  there will be nothing included in the  budget baseline for dairy. That will not  only be a problem for dairy farmers;  that will be a problem for all other  farmers, because if in the end the Congress  decides  under  those  circumstances to extend the milk program, the funding for that will come  out of the hide of each and every other  farm program, all because of this 1-  month gimmick that we tried to correct in the Appropriations Committee.  Now, the Appropriations Committee  adopted an amendment that I offered  last week which attempted to correct  that problem by simply extending the  milk program by 1 month so that it  would expire at the same time as the  other programs in the farm bill. But  now our  friends on  the authorizing  committee have insisted that the Rules  Committee not protect that provision  from being stricken on a point of order.  As a result, if such a motion is made  and upheld by the Chair, it will mean  that we are going to create the conditions for a billion dollar war between  farm groups all over this country. That  could easily be avoided by the $40 million provision represented by section  752 of the appropriations bill that will  shortly be before us.  That $40 million correction is fully  paid for so that at this point there is  no budget problem associated with 752.  So I would simply want to alert every  Member of this House who represents  dairy farmers that they will be at a  substantial  disadvantage  in  considering the farm bill a year and a half  from now if this section 752 of this bill  is stricken.  And I want to alert Members who  represent other kinds of farmers that  lest they think this is only a problem  only affecting dairy farmers, I’m sorry,  it will affect all farmers because financing  for whatever dairy program  that eventually emerges from that authorization bill will come out of reductions for other farm programs.  Now, this may not be a big problem  for persons who have  thousand-cow  dairy herds, but it is a huge problem if  you  represent  a  district  like mine  where the average herd is 50 or 60 cows.  The extension to the milk program will  determine whether or not many of  those farmers stay in business. And I  would submit that the House would be  doing itself a great favor if they could  prevail upon our friends on the authorizing committee not to lodge a point of  order against this provision in this bill.  There is another provision in this bill  which affects an extension of the peanut program for storage. It seems to  me that there are good reasons for extending both of those programs. So I  would urge any Member of this House  who is concerned about being able to  pass a decent farm bill down the line to  recognize  that  if  this action  takes  place today, if this action takes place  today, anyone who votes for the farm  bill, if this is stricken today, anyone  who votes for this agriculture appropriations bill will be voting to put  dairy farmers at a huge disadvantage a  year and a half from now when the reauthorization  is considered and they  will be inviting a very nasty war between different commodity groups and  different regions of the country.  That  is what  the milk  program  sought to end 3 years ago when we  wanted to end all of these regional  fights on dairy, and I would suggest  that the House would be ill advised if it  produces that result by allowing this  provision to be knocked out on a point  of order.  So I will be calling for a roll call on  the rule to protest the action of the  Rules Committee, and I will urge Members from farm country to vote ‘‘no’’  on the rule and ‘‘no’’ on the bill if that  provision is stricken.  ",2006
904,9,2006-05-23,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I appreciate  the  remarks of  the distinguished  ranking  member of the Appropriations Committee, but we have a long-standing  tradition in the Rules Committee that  when the authorizing committee has a  problem with amendments or policies  that are put on  the Appropriations  Committee that they feel is under their  jurisdiction, they ask that that not be  protected. That was the case here as  you pointed out in your remarks with  the peanut program and the milk program.  So as you suggested,  if somebody  from the Agriculture Committee or the  chairman stands up and asks  for a  point of order  then, of course,  the  Chair will have to make his ruling by  what the rules are.  I will also say this, and I know that  the gentleman from Wisconsin has been  working just because of the nature of  his committee on a lot of milk programs, I too have a lot of dairies in my  district. There has been a gravitation  towards those dairies in my district.  When I talk to my dairy farmers, I  have essentially one message for them  and that message is at some point, and  I know this is a very difficult thing to  do, but at some point the dairy industry in this country has got to try to  speak with one voice as much as they  possibly can. I know that is very, very  difficult. They are cognizant of that.  When this provision was put in place  several years ago, there was an attempt to do that. So we will have to  see. But the Rules Committee has a  tradition and that is the reason why we  did not protect that portion of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006

The  spirit of  this  amendment is to protect the organic  label through making sure that there  is a consumer representative.  I would ask if the gentleman would  be willing to work with me to make  sure as we move through this process  that, in fact, we will have a real consumer representative, whoever he or  she may be, and not someone who is  necessarily part of the industry.

912,37,2006-05-23,Mr. WEINER.," Mr. Chairman, there  are  a  great many  people who  are  watching with rapt attention what we  do in this appropriations bill. There are  many  people watching, well, many  might be a strong word, but there are  some people watching on C–SPAN and  many of our colleagues are very interested to see the outcome of this bill.  But I can tell you there is a whole  group of other creatures that really  don’t mind at all what we do here because they are going about the business of ravaging our economy.  I am talking about the invasive insects,  the  invasive  species  like  the  Asian longhorn beetle which because of  the lack of funding in this budget and  in past budgets are on course to do an  estimated $268 billion worth of damage  to the economy. It is insects like the  Asian longhorn beetle that is eating  away at Illinois and Pennsylvania and  New York and New Jersey. It is insects  like the emerald ash borer that my colleague Mr. SCHWARZ is so concerned  about and folks in Indiana and Ohio.  The sudden oak death disease in California and Oregon, all kinds of different insects are right now creating  havoc in our economy.  We have over the course of time been  frankly funding less and less and less  for these invasive species. Sometimes  it is a matter of surveillance like it is  with the Asian longhorn beetle. You  have to find it in order to stamp it out.  Sometimes  it  is a matter of taking  steps like we did successfully in Illinois to poison these pests before they  do any more damage.  b1245  But I am going to tell you what the  cost is if we do not pass the Weiner-  Schwarz-Crowley-Maloney amendment  today.  These insects will continue to move  from neighborhood  to neighborhood,  city to city, State to State. This very  same insect, which has cost over 4,000  trees in New York City, yes, Mr. OBEY,  a tree does grow in Brooklyn; more  than 4,000 trees have been eaten by the  Asian longhorned beetle. It is on a path  going north. Think of what is north of  New York City. It is the Adirondacks.  It is Vermont. This pest likes maple  trees more than we like maple syrup. If  it starts to infect that part of the U.S.  economy, there will be no stopping it.  But we do have a plan now. If we provide about  $23 million,  it does not  eliminate the problem overnight, but it  does put us on a glide course to stopping this problem and these pests in  their tracks.  This is a moment. This is kind of like  a ripple in a pond. Right now, the problem is relatively concentrated. This is  what it looks like in New York City. It  started about 3 years ago, just in this  neighborhood of Greenpoint, and now it  is moving further and further and further out. At the same time that is happening, we have been  reducing our  funding, and the President has underfunded this bill appreciably.  My amendment  is very simple.  It  would take $23 million from the common computing account and move it  into this line which would help stamp  out this bug and so many others. There  is a list of States that this impacts, everything from the southern U.S. where  the cactus moth is, all the way up to  the  northeast  where  the  Asian  longhorned beetle is, and Mr. SCHWARZ  is going to talk about the effect it is  having on Michigan.  Look, I want to upgrade the computers at  the Department of Agriculture as much as anyone, but a slow  computer is the least of our problems  when up against this fellow. I want to  tell you, as dangerous as this bug is, in  all truth, this is not life size. It is a little bit smaller than this, but this bug  will continue plowing away through  our  trees. They have already eaten  4,000 trees in New York City alone, and  the only way to stop it after a while is  just to raise entire forests. We simply  cannot do that.  In conclusion, let me just say this,  Mr. Chairman, we have  shown  that  when the office of APHIS at the Department of Agriculture goes  into a  problem  like they did with the boll  weevil, jumps into a problem like they  did with the Asian longhorned beetle in  Illinois, we can stop this problem, and  we can do it for relatively pennies on  the dollar.

916,44,2006-05-23,Mr. KENNEDY of Minnesota.," Mr.  Chairman, the concern that we have,  having met with the administrator, the  funds have run out for this year some  time ago. They have other diseases  where they have sort of known expiration funds that they can give assurance.  But there is no assurance that funds  would be released by OMB from CCC to  provide this. Our farmers are telling  us, as you know, farmers can take time  to be concerned, that they just don’t  even want to test their animals because they know there isn’t assured indemnity funds out there. So given the  current status we are at today, where  we are out of indemnity funds, farmers  are concerned that their concern and  their lack of confidence in the program  being there could result in them making decisions that would delay identification of TB.  I recognize the issues that the chairman has brought up, but I do believe  that given the heightened importance  of this, that I think we need to proceed. I would also point out, as I mentioned, that when Texas was vitally  concerned, we had $44 million back in  2000. Yes I do commend the increase,  but I do believe this further increase  remains being called for.  ",2006

928,51,2006-05-23,Ms. DELAURO.,"  Thank you Mr. Chairman, Chairman BONILLA  and Ranking Member DELAUROand the staff  on  the  Agriculture  Appropriations  Subcommittee.  My amendment would simply strike the word  ‘‘after’’ and insert ‘‘before’’ in the section of the  bill dealing with the Farm Service Agency. The  amendment at hand would allow for the public  hearing to take place no later than 30 days  before—and not after—the Secretary of Agriculture allows for an office closure.  In this section of the current bill, language  had been put in place to safeguard local FSA  offices from inappropriate closure and relocation. In current form, the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture would be able to propose an office closure—and then after the closure is proposed, then hold a public hearing.  This  language was  in  last years Agriculture  Appropriations Bill—and we thought this would  help  the process and allow  for  local public  input before any office closures were proposed.  The reason for this amendment is due to my  profound concerns of what is currently taking  place in Ohio. Last month I was contacted by  local producers in my district concerned that  their local FSA office would be closed.  My office received a copy of the proposed  ‘‘county office reorganization’’ as provided by  the Ohio State FSA Committee, and I was surprised to see this proposal as there has been  no  involvement  from my  local county FSA  committees or local producers.  In a memo sent from Administrator Teresa  Lasseter (USDA) to all State FSA Executive  Directors on January 13, 2006, she states,  ‘‘Further, USDA agrees with the long-standing  intent of Congress that office closures and relocations should occur based on rigorous analysis to ensure actions are cost-effective and  will better serve the public.’’  The bottom  line  is  that we need  to have  complete information about the needs of family farmers and ranchers before we or the Department makes radical decisions about FSA  Personnel levels.  This process should start at the county committees and involve an office-by-office and regional analysis. Only then, can our State FSA  offices and the USDA make the best decisions  on office closures and relocations.  I understand the need for efficiency, but we  must be concerned about how this will impact  our  family  farmers and agricultural communities.  In most of our counties, our  farmers  know that they can drive to one place to access their FSA, NRCS, SWCD and Extension.  This is the place where they access the Internet, the fax machine and socialize with others  in their community.  Again, my amendment only says  that  the  public hearing be 30 days prior  to closure,  rather  than after  the closure has been proposed. Please help  in supporting  the  family  farmers  in your district and support  this  fair  and simple amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by  the gentleman from Ohio.  The amendment was agreed to.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk  will read.

933,65,2006-05-23,Mr. TIAHRT.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, my  amendment  is  very simple. It just says that none of  the funds made available in this act  will be used to promulgate regulations  without  consideration  of  the  effect  that such regulations would have on  the competitiveness of American businesses.  Mr. Chairman, over the last generation, Congress has created barriers to  keeping and creating jobs in America.  There are at least eight major barriers  in which our policies have been preventative of keeping jobs in America.  They consist of health care policy that  is driving the fastest growth in costs in  America, making it more difficult to  keep and create jobs. It includes a tax  policy  that punishes  success.  It  includes litigation costs that result in  court costs, lawyer fees and higher liability insurance costs. It includes an  energy policy that has prevented exploration, expansion of refinement capability, and new renewable energy resources. It includes trade policy that  hasn’t been properly enforced. And it  has allowed American companies to be  targeted by foreign-owned government  businesses.  It  includes an education  policy that is not meeting the needs of  the next more technological economy.  It includes research and development  funding that is not focused on the ideas  that will move us into a strong position  for tomorrow’s products  in the  next economy. And it includes a regulatory policy that slows the growth of  our economy by taking an adversarial  role which works against those that  create and keep jobs in America.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to explain  just one example of how the funding in  this bill has been used by government  agencies to prevent us from creating  and keeping jobs in America.  Creekstone Farms is a small Kansas  beef processing plant in my congressional district that has sought permission from the United States Department of Agriculture since early 2004 to  voluntarily  conduct  BSE  tests  or  screening tests on cattle. USDA has repeatedly refused to allow BSE test kit  manufacturers to sell the test kits to  companies who want  to voluntarily  test for BSE.  Let me say, Mr. Chairman, the American  food system  is completely safe  with many checks and balances built  into our production, processing, distribution, and retail system. Mad cow  disease has never made it into our markets. In December of 2003, USDA detected the first case of mad cow disease, but that case never made it into  our system. It is completely safe. Our  food supply is completely safe.  But concerns developed overseas in  several of our export markets, specifically in Japan and South Korea. They  banned our meat products from their  markets. Since then, we have lost over  $4 billion  in sales and thousands of  jobs, some of them right in Kansas.  South Korea and Japan are looking  for more confidence in their meat supply. We believe it is perfectly safe, but  they want something to tell their consumers.  Creekstone proposed a screening test  on a voluntary basis of each carcass so  that they could provide that level of  confidence to the consumers in South  Korea and in Japan. But when they  went to the United States Department  of Agriculture to get permission to do  this screening, they were told no. Not  only was Creekstone told no, but the  company that manufactured these test  kits for BSE was told, no, you cannot  sell these kits to Creekstone.  Whatever happened to the old adage  that the consumer is always right? In  America, we have built a strong economy by meeting the needs of the consumers, by opening new markets to a  developing level of confidence.  For example, the side air bags in an  automobile: an automobile  that has  side air bags, gives some people more  confidence that it is safe and therefore  they are willing to spend a little extra  money on buying a car with side air  bags. But not all cars have side air  bags. The Department of Transportation said, yes, it is fine. If you want  to meet those customers’ needs and  they want to pay a little more, then go  ahead and voluntarily put side air bags  in automobiles.  Unlike the Department of Transportation, USDA has said that you cannot  use this type of voluntarily based marketing to meet consumers needs, so  they have completely shut off this area  of letting us develop this new market,  and the consumers in South Korea and  Japan  still don’t have enough confidence to buy American beef. We have  lost that market now to Australia and  New Zealand, and it is going to be difficult for us to gain it back.  Creekstone has an idea to regain this  market, but it is the government-regulation bureaucracy that is preventing  us from opening that market and keeping and creating jobs in America.  Mr. Chairman, this is just one example of how regulations can keep us  from expanding and preparing for the  next economy. Other nations are preparing for the next economy, but we  are not.  Mr. Chairman, I realize this is authorization on an appropriations bill  and it is my I intent to ask unanimous  consent to withdraw this amendment,  but I will not withdraw from the fight  of creating a strong economy for tomorrow’s future.  Mr. Chairman, I respectfully withdraw this amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection,  the amendment is withdrawn.  There was no objection.  AMENDMENTOFFEREDBYMR. KINGOFIOWA  ",2006

937,72,2006-05-23,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself 90 second.  Mr. Chairman,  the United States  sugar program is one of the most archaic and misguided Federal policies  that we have. It artificially raises the  prices of  sugar.  It harms U.S. customers and consumers, and prevents  developing nations from competing in  the global market place.  One of the deep concerns I have is  that people are circulating here with a  straight face the assertion that this is  a no-cost program. Nothing could be  further from the truth. It drives up the  price  for American  consumers  each  year, upwards of $2 billion a year. It  undercuts industries that use sugar as  a means of production like the confectionery industry. And it is part of an  enormous environmental damage, like  the everglades, where we are spending  $7.5 billion in clean-up.  In the course of the debate this afternoon, we will have opportunities for  people to focus on the need to eliminate this program. This amendment is  a small step towards sanity, making a  6 percent reduction in the guaranteed  price if it is adopted.  I strongly urge that my colleagues  look at the facts surrounding this, look  at what is going to be good for the consumer,  for the environment,  for the  taxpayer, and taking a step toward a  rational agriculture policy.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2006

939,72,2006-05-23,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in opposition to the Blumenauer  amendment which calls for reductions  of the loan rates established in the 2002  farm bill for both refined beet sugar  and raw cane sugar.  Mr. Chairman, farmers have crafted  their business plans based on the assurances of the 2002 farm bill. Farmers  have invested time and money in that  crop often with capital borrowed from  the bank. It is unfair now to reduce the  returns that farmers counted on when  planning, financing, and planting that  crop.  This debate  concerning  the  sugar  program is an important one. However,  it is a debate that my committee will  conduct at the appropriate time during  the authorization of the new farm bill.  As chairman of the House Agriculture  Committee, I have already held farm  bill field hearings this year and will be  holding additional farm bill hearings  this summer and fall.  During this process, and not when we  are on the floor debating an appropriations bill, is the correct time for discussing and making possible changes to  U.S. sugar policy.  Mr. Chairman,  in my capacity as  chairman  of  the House Agriculture  Committee, it is my responsibility to  look at all of agriculture and consider  what is best for the United States and  our farmers and ranchers. The policy  that was put in place by the 2002 farm  bill must remain intact. I stand by this  commitment to farmers and ranchers  and  urge  a  ‘‘no’’  vote  on  the  Blumenauer-Flake amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  b1615  ",2006

941,72,2006-05-23,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Chairman, I am here to confess my  reading  incomprehension. I have  listened  to many of my  conservative  friends talk about the wonders of the  free market, of the importance of letting the consumers make their best  choices, of keeping government out of  economic activity, of the virtues of  free trade, but then I look at various  agricultural programs  like this one.  Now, it violates every principle of free  market economics known to man and  two or three not yet discovered.  So I have been forced to conclude  that in all of those great free market  texts by Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich  Hayek and all the others that there is  a footnote that says, by the way, none  of this applies to agriculture. Now, it  may be written in high German, and  that may be why I have not been able  to discern it, but there is no greater  contrast  in America today than between the free enterprise rhetoric of so  many conservatives and  the  statist,  subsidized, inflationary, protectionist,  anti-consumer  agricultural  policies,  and this is one of them.  In particular, I have listened to people, and some of us have said let us protect workers and the environment in  trade; let us not have unrestricted free  trade; but let us have trade that respects worker  rights  and  environmental rights. And we have been excoriated for our lack of concern for poor  countries.  There is no greater obstacle, as it is  now clear in the Doha round, to the  completion of a comprehensive trade  policy than the American agricultural  policy, with one exception, European  agricultural  policy, which  is much  worse and just as phony.  Sugar is an example. This program is  an interference with the legitimate efforts at economic self-help  in many  foreign nations.  So I appreciate the leadership of the  gentleman from Arizona and the gentleman from Oregon. Here is a chance  for  some  of my  free-enterprise-professing  friends  to  get  honest with  themselves, and now maybe we will see  some born-again  free enterprisers  in  the agricultural field.

954,86,2006-05-23,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, on the immediately  preceding amendment  that was  just  withdrawn, this is an issue I have followed closely for a long time, and I  have questioned USDA officials about  this. I offered a motion to instruct conferees on the 2006 conference report on  this issue. There is no question that  this  ill-considered plan must comply  with all of our civil rights laws.  I applaud the gentleman for his effort. I would also like to tell Members  about what a mess the Texas effort to  privatize not only the Food Stamp Program but other critical social services  is in.  Just  last week, Texas  announced  that the work by the company awarded  the $899 million privatization contract,  Accenture, was so bad it was putting  the privatization effort on, what was  described in the press, and I quote, ‘‘indefinite hold.’’  Texas also announced it was going to  give 1,000 State employees that it had  planned to lay off bonuses of $1,800 so  they would stay to help fix the mess  created by Accenture. Accenture’s mismanagement of the State’s CHIP program was so bad that 28,000 children  were scheduled to lose their coverage  in May, on top of an already large drop  in enrollment since privatization occurred. The State had to intervene to  keep the children enrolled.  As part of the 2006 conference report,  USDA  is required to send the committee quarterly reports on the Texas  situation. The second and most recent  report from the USDA, like the first, is  very blunt  in  its assessment of the  problems they see with what Texas has  done with respect to the food stamp  portion of this.  The report says: ‘‘The following concerns give pause to expansion without  substantial  improvements  in  system  functionality to support a more ambitious implementation agenda.’’  Among  the  concerns:  Long wait  times  for  calls;  high  abandonment  rates by callers; vendor performance is  questionable as evidenced by the high  percentage of cases that are returned  to the vendor because of missing information  and  errors;  case  file  documentation needs to be substantially  improved to support program access  and integrity; vendor performance on  handling calls shows problems with the  staffing and training resulting in information to the extent that it is unclear  whether applicants will know how to  apply.  The simple truth is that this effort is  a disaster and it threatens the right of  Texans to get the benefits to which  they are entitled.  AMENDMENTOFFEREDBYMR. FLAKE  ",2006

None of the funds made available  by this Act may be used to fund dairy education in Iowa.  The Acting CHAIRMAN.

The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection,  the Clerk will  report  the  amendment.  There was no objection.  The Clerk read the amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5  minutes.  ",2006
957,86,2006-05-23,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Before addressing this particular earmark, let me make a few general comments about what we are going to do  today.  Today we will engage  in a debate  that has been a long time in coming. I  plan to offer several amendments to  this bill to block funding for a series of  Member earmarks that are contained  in the committee report that accompanies the bill.  Let me point out that the House has  already voted in the lobby reform bill a  few weeks ago to require that Members  attach their names to their earmarks;  yet this committee report has come to  the floor with more than 400 earmarks  and not one name. They are not required to do so until the bill passes  both Chambers, but it would be nice to  have the names attached.  Let me state from the outset I am  under no illusion that I can block funding for any of these earmarks we will  discuss. I am well acquainted with the  process of log rolling where one Member agrees to support another Member’s earmarks  if that Member will  agree to do the same. I suspect that log  rolling will prevail here today.  But it is about time that we provide  a little window into the process. Is it  the Federal Government’s  responsibility to recruit dairy  farmers  from  other regions to move to northeast  Iowa, as one of the earmarks we will  discuss today purports to do?  Is the need so great this year to fund  the National Grape and Wine Initiative  that we should add $100,000  in debt  owed by future generations?  Since our responsibility as Members  of Congress is to prioritize limited resources, do we really want to tell taxpayers that we believe that spending  $180,000 on hydroponic tomato production  is more  pressing  than  other  issues?  I expect that a few of the amendments I will offer today will be successfully blocked because of a point of  order. The reason: because we have no  documentation that a Federal agency  that will fund the project knows anything about the project that is to be  funded.  b1845  To  successfully challenge  the earmark requires an assumption that the  agency  is  familiar with the project.  Otherwise, we might be legislating on  an appropriation bill, a violation of our  rules. The  incentive,  therefore,  for  Members looking to protect their earmarks, is to be either vague or silent  about the project’s goals and its oversight.  Let us think about that for a minute.  How are we supposed to exercise oversight  for  these earmarked projects?  Who is to be held accountable? Not the  government agency. By upholding the  point of order, we are stipulating that  the agency might as well not even  know that the project exists.  In the end, since rank-and-file Members can’t even challenge those earmarks without being subject to a point  of order and the agencies don’t know  VerDate Aug 31 2005  07:25 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H23MY6.REC H23MY6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2006

959,93,2006-05-23,Mr. BONILLA.," Mr. Chairman, historically when Members target projects  in this body, everybody understands  the game. When you talk about tomatoes and aquaculture and programs  that have names that do not immediately jump out to people with a true  purpose, the press releases go out, the  media circles when you walk out of the  House Chamber, and there you have  your name in the paper as a great slayer of funding programs.  But again, the hard work when you  talk about fiscal conservatism as we  have again last year cutting spending,  trimming this bill down almost $100  million, cutting back on the Member  requests, all of those things, that is the  work that is done in the trenches day  in and day out.  So, again, we all realize in this body  what makes a headline. So if you make  fun of the tomato and you make fun of  the research project that is in a particular State, more power to you. But  I think for the most part we are going  to find that the Members of this body  understand that again there is not a  single dime that is going to be cut out  of this amendment. True reform comes  from the kind of work in the trenches  that I have been suggesting, entitlement reform, budget reform, those are  the processes that really matter. Or  again, in the end, amendments that actually make a difference in terms of  spending or cutting the budget.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2006
960,93,2006-05-23,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, in response I would  simply say I reject the premise that we  cannot cut spending. This notion again  that we will not save anybody by getting rid of earmarks. It is valid. This  isn’t a debate in a vacuum that really  does not matter. If we reform the way  we do earmarks, we will save significant money. I do not know about you,  but $29 billion seems like a lot to me,  $29 billion last year in appropriation  earmarks. That is a lot of money. It  adds up. A billion here and a billion  there, soon enough you have got real  money.  So this notion that we cannot save  and we are just throwing out a couple  of names here, I would like to bring all  450 Member earmarks to the floor that  were in this bill. Simply we do not  have the time and we do not have the  patience and I understand that. But  how else can we highlight this? What  other forum do we have? Believe me, if  it is there we have used it. We have got  to start somewhere. I think we have  got to make a stand.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2006
961,93,2006-05-23,Mr. BONILLA.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would say to the  gentleman who is offering this amendment directly, it is not that we cannot  cut spending, because we have. The  issue here is that he cannot cut spending with any of the amendments that  he is proposing. So, again, I do not  know how much more clearly I could  say that or any other Member of this  body.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR).  ",2006
962,93,2006-05-23,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Chairman, I would  just like to put on the record that the  State of Ohio used to be one of the  leading tomato-growing States in the  Nation until subsidized western water,  and we lost our industry to the West.  Now, Arizona is one of the most irrigated States in the country. You are  draining water that is never going to  come back. And yet I look at our part  of the country that has to fight for  such a small part of the market right  now. I would just ask the gentleman, I  would love to look at the type of subsidies that attend to your agriculture  in Arizona  from major  government  agencies that do not come to Ohio  farmers.  b1945  We are trying to maintain a very  small market share. Hydroponic production is one of the ways in which we  are successfully doing it, but I would  just beg for the gentleman to take a  look at what has really happened to  the movement  of  agriculture. One  State in the Union now produces over  half the fruits and vegetables in the  country, most of it irrigated. Ohioans  have a right to compete in this market.  ",2006
963,93,2006-05-23,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  To the gentlewoman’s points, we do  in Arizona get subsidies. We should  not, particularly with cotton. Cotton is  very water intensive. We receive subsidies in cotton in many ways, particularly through the farm bill. I would ask  you, please  join me  in opposing the  farm bill next year. We will have an extension of the farm bill perhaps this  year. Please join me in opposing it for  subsidizing far too much as well.  We are spending too much money. It  is not just in earmarks here, but it is  other areas as well, but if we say we  are not going to cut it in earmarks or  other ways, where do we cut it? That is  why our budget is simply growing and  growing.  ",2006
964,93,2006-05-23,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",2006
965,93,2006-05-23,Mr. FLAKE., I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.  ,2006
966,93,2006-05-23,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Chairman, I just  want to say this may be the first year  America imports more food than she  exports. This is not just a problem inside the borders of the United States.  We have to keep our agriculture alive  in this country, and  it  is becoming  more and more difficult every year because of what is happening in the global economy and subsidies that are out  there in other countries. Thank you for  yielding.  ",2006
967,93,2006-05-23,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentlewoman  for that point.  We do have a problem entering into  free trade agreements because we subsidize our agriculture so much. It is  complicating  the Doha  round  right  now. We are limiting the markets that  we can sell into because of our own  subsidies.  The country of New Zealand a few  years ago thought they could never get  away from agriculture subsidies. They  just up and said one day, we are not  going to do it anymore; we cannot afford to anymore. People predicted that  their agriculture would drop considerably. It has not. They have thrived. If  we simply trust in the market here and  let the market take over, we would be  far better off.  But  in this point, again,  I would  make the point, we can save money  here. Earmarks are costing us a whale  of a lot of money, not just because of  the money in the earmarks themselves,  but in the amount of funding that they  leverage elsewhere because when you  have an earmark in an appropriations  bill, you had better not vote against  that appropriations bill or you might  see your earmark vanish. So it is not  just the money in the earmarks, it is  the money that is leveraged.  The CHAIRMAN. The  gentleman’s  time has expired.  ",2006

984,107,2006-05-23,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, America,  which should value our birthright of  independence, is all too quickly becoming America the dependent.  We are dangerously dependent,  for  example, on foreign oil for our energy  needs. Indeed, we import nearly 75 percent of it; a third of our trade deficit is  due to this oil dependency. We could  become  energy  independent here at  home with energy sources here that we  would invent and create and refine, and  what a  job-rich America that would  create.  America is becoming more and more  dependent upon imports from foreign  manufacturers  than we  are  exports  from our country in all fields: in appliances, in clothing, even food. This year  America may become for the first time  in its history a net food importer.  The balance of payments which had  been the pride of our country, more exports than imports, has been reduced  to red ink. The monthly trade deficit  for March was just in 1 month over $62  billion, and we are still on another  record annual trade deficit pace.  In fact, our monthly trade deficit figure is so huge it equals the entire annual budget of our Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans fought to make  us free from foreign tyranny, but the  new tyranny is taking a different form.  At the end of March, our overall publicly held debt was a staggering $4.6  trillion, not counting promises  that  the government has made to pay for retirement programs and health benefits  that are due to the American people in  the amount of over $8.4 trillion. Now,  would you believe that nearly half, 43  percent of this debt, overall debt, of  that amount, $2 trillion is now held by  foreigners.  We have already heard that it took  200 years for our Nation to accumulate  $1 trillion of debt. But would you believe we are now at the point where $1  trillion of our public debt is held by  Japan, China and Hong Kong? As this  chart illustrates, Japan is the largest  holder of our debt, followed by Europe,  followed by China and Hong Kong,  which are rising very quickly.  In fact, would you believe that between October of 2003 and March of this  year, China alone more than doubled  its holdings of our public debt from  $151 billion to $321 billion. The United  States government, our taxpayers this  year will pay more than $200 billion in  interest  on  publicly-held  debt with  nearly  $100 billion going  to  foreign  holders of our debt. That’s right. We  are going to pay interest to foreign  holders of U.S. debt, almost five times  as much as we appropriate on an annual basis for the entire U.S. Department of Energy. Imagine if we invested  those dollars in ourselves. We will pay  interest to foreign holders of U.S. debt  nearly three times as much as we spend  in a year on the Department of Housing and Urban Development to build  this country from coast-to-coast.  We will pay interest to foreign holders of U.S. debt nearly twice as much  as we appropriate for the entire Department of Labor. We have just had  more miners killed in Kentucky, God  rest their souls, because they didn’t  have oxygen equipment that would last  them long enough that would outlast  the monoxide until the rescue workers  could get there.  Yet we can pay this kind of money to  foreign holders of our debt. We will pay  about as much interest to foreign holders of U.S. debt as we will appropriate  for  fighting  the war  in  Iraq. Wow.  Think about it. What do we do about  it?  Without  a  doubt,  first  thing we  should do is clean up our fiscal house,  and  that  starts with balancing our  budgets and digging out of this red ink.  We cannot expect to continue in this  fashion and remain the leader of the  free world. Our currency is being devalued. We see the skittishness in the  stock market, and interest rates are  going up at the same time as gas prices  are going up. This is very clear.  There are certain rules of economics  that never fail you. We are either going  to have a currency devaluation, or we  are going to have inflation go out of  control.

986,114,2006-05-23,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, it  has just been truly a pleasure watching  you share not only with the Members,  Mr. Speaker, but also with the American people, and we wonder how we got  to where we are now. I am just wondering how did we got to where we are  now?  Mr. Speaker, I think we have gotten  there because of this rubber stamp that  is here. It is not just a rubber stamp. It  is  the Republican  Congress  rubber  stamp, and it is very, very unfortunate  that the people that are paying the  price  for this rubber stamp are the  American people at the gas pump. This  is graduation time. A lot of parents are  going to see their children walk across  the stage, but guess what, college assistance and affordable loans will not  be there for those children because we  are willing to give $42,000, $43,000 in tax  breaks to millionaires.  The Republican Congress says they  gave tax cuts for the American people.  Yes, they are American people, too, but  I am not talking about the middle  class. The middle class family does not  consider themselves millionaires.  I am holding this rubber stamp because this  is what got us here. Mr.  RYANtalks about paying for that. Let  us put that rubber stamp over here.  How we are paying for it is we are  making history in all the wrong places:  224 years, $1.01 trillion borrowed, Mr.  Speaker, over 224-year, 42 Presidents  combined,  $1.01  trillion. The Republican Congress and President Bush, he  could not do it without the Republican  Congress, has been able to borrow $1.05  trillion over  just 4 years. 224 years  versus 4 years, even though we are at  war, even though we have little health  care  for Americans,  if any, and Mr.  Speaker, we have given out tax breaks  to the oil companies.  ",2006
987,114,2006-05-23,Mr. RYAN of Ohio., So you are saying  that that money that we are borrowing  could pay for tax cuts.  ,2006
988,114,2006-05-23,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," And the special  giveaways and special interests.  Let me just quickly, I just want to  make the point here. Oil companies,  look at the subsidies and look at the  profits. They have reaped $113 billion in  record breaking profits in 2005; 2004, $84  billion; 2003, $59 billion; 2002, $34 billion. It is coincidental, Mr. Speaker,  that after the meeting at the White  House with the oil companies, that was  uncovered, after they denied all of this,  that they were a part of the working  group, that the profit level went up.  Now, I am not just a Member with a  conspiracy theory, but just the other  day in the Democratic Caucus, we had  a gentleman that came to speak to us  about  alternative  fuel  sources. The  question was asked, well, is not the oil  companies, I mean, they have commercials going on talking about how they  are investing in alternative fuels. This  is an actual shot of a pump at an  ExxonMobil  station. Here you have  regular, you have special and then you  have super plus.  But this is the interesting part, Mr.  Speaker, because this is the ethanol  part here that says E–85 which is an alternative fuel. Guess what is happening  here. This sign here, and I hope that,  Mr. Speaker, the Members can see it.  You cannot use your Mobil credit card.  So basically what they are saying is  that you can use your credit card for  the gas because we want to keep you  on this stuff, but if you get a vehicle  with alternative fuels, even though you  are a customer of ours, you cannot use  our card for that fuel. Now, I guarantee  you I can walk into the little food mart  here at that ExxonMobil and buy a  case of sodas if I wanted to with my  ExxonMobil card. Someone who  is a  smoker can buy eight packs of cigarettes.  ",2006
989,114,2006-05-23,Mr. RYAN of Ohio., Sunflower seeds.  ,2006
990,114,2006-05-23,Mr. MEEK  of Florida.," Sunflower  seeds, what have you, but we cannot  buy alternative fuels.  Now, meanwhile, back at the ranch, I  see the ExxonMobil CEO on The Today  Show, and he is saying, oh, we believe  in innovation and alternative fuels, but  that is not what it is saying at the  pump, Mr. Speaker.  So I think that when we start looking at what is wrong with the Republican majority and what we are willing  to do, if the American people sees fit to  put Democrats in control of this House,  that we will fight the big oil companies. We will make sure that there is  no price gouging. It will not be a question of having to appoint a group to go  out and look at this issue. They will no  longer have the kind of open access  special interests has had in this House  and that is a fact. That is not fiction;  that is fact.  So I think it is important when you  start looking at all the money that is  being borrowed to fund the millionaire  tax break, all the money that is being  borrowed to make sure that special interests get their tax cut and their subsidies and all these things, meanwhile  the American people are paying for it.  I am not going to pull this stuff off  the chart tonight, but these are the  countries that are owning a part of the  American apple pie due to the fact they  want to have the great American giveaway.  ",2006
991,114,2006-05-23,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  just want to make one point as you  were talking about the oil companies.  They have really become, and I do not  say this in a derogatory way, they have  become dinosaurs, and the Republican  majority  has  just  consistently  reaffirmed their prehistoric nature because we are in a new economy. We are  in a knowledge-based economy. We are  in an economy that can figure out how  to not use fossil fuels, how to figure  out how to use different things. They  run the gamut.

992,128,2006-05-23,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President, let  me state why I think the Hagel-Martinez compromise is not workable. The  Hagel-Martinez compromise essentially  creates three tiers of people  in this  country  in undocumented or  illegal  status. The first is 6.7 million who have  been here more than 5 years; the second is 1.6 million who have been here  less than 2 years; and the third is 2.8  million who have been here from 2 to 5  years. People here less than 2 years are  subject  to  immediate  deportation.  Someone has to  find them, go  into  their workplace or their homes, pick  them up, and deport them. Then one  has to consider the likelihood that in  about 3 days, which is often the case in  California,  they will  come back  to  their families and their job.  The second  is the 2.8 million who  must leave, touch back, get in a guest  worker program or some other visa  program, come back, be in this country, and then, after a period of time,  get an employer to sponsor them for a  green card or leave. They have a kind  of mandatory  departure. The  guest  worker program they would be eligible  for is the H–2C program, which we reduced in size from 325,000 to 200,000 in  an earlier amendment. The cap of the  program is removed for them. Therefore, what is created for this group is a  3 million-person guest worker program,  but they cannot earn a path to legalization unless they have an employer  who will petition for them. They are  limited in the time they can stay in  the country, and they must return.  My sense, based on the reality of the  largest  immigration  State  in  the  Union, is that these two tiers in Hagel-  Martinez simply will not work. We will  have large-scale fraud. The people here  slightly less than 2 years will present  fraudulent documents  to  show  they  have been here for at least 2 years.  That is what happens now. There is a  wide market in fraudulent documents  for the undocumented. And those here  less than 5 years will shortly realize  that when they have to go back they  face a precarious situation of whether  they can come back legally. If they  can’t come back  legally, I hazard a  guess they will come back and find a  way to come back illegally. That is a  major problem.  What we have tried to do is create a  program, based on McCain-Kennedy,  and to an extent on Hagel-Martinez,  saying let’s be realistic, let’s understand what the situation is, that there  is no way it is good to create another  illegal class of up to 4.4 million people.  It does not make sense to spend the  time trying to seek out people living  clandestinely.  It is much better to create the process for earned legalization which has  some meaning and substance, and tests  that individuals must pass. So we have  created a three-step test for something  we would call an orange card. That orange card is like this chart.

996,135,2006-05-23,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  would like to make a couple of comments.  I very much appreciate my service  and Senator CORNYN’s service on the  same committee and have great respect  for him and also  for Senator  who  has  introduced  the  Hagel-Martinez plan with the best of  motives.  Senator  said  we  shouldn’t throw up our hands. I am not  throwing up my hands. I want strong  borders. I voted for a fence. I believe we  should put National Guard on the borders. We provide 12,500 additional Border Patrol, 2,500 border inspectors, over  $1 billion of equipment for the border.  We should have our border enforced.  We should get the help of Mexico to enforce it.  Secondly, with this plan, there is no  jumping in line ahead of anyone waiting legally for a green card.  The line begins for the orange card  recipients, if such should ever be, when  that line is expunged. What we do is  recognize the reality, learn from the  streets, understand what happens, and  then try to build a comprehensive solution to deal with the real world—border control, increase practical numbers  of visas, as well as providing a path for  earned  legalization  for  those people  who are here now.  That path has several hurdles. It will  weed out those who should not receive  an orange card from those who should.  It is an electronic process. It is doable,  and it is practical. It recognizes that if  you  leave  4.4 million undocumented  immigrants  subject  to  deportation,  whether it is this year or 4 years down  the pike, you create another  illegal  pool of workers in this country, which  I think destroys the comprehensive approach.  Therefore, I just want to say that  this orange card has specific requirements that have to be met over a 6-  year period of work, of  learning to  speak English, of paying a fine, of paying taxes, of work history. That has to  be met on an annual basis, submitting  work history receipts on an annual  basis. The program financially takes  care of itself with the fines and fees. I  believe it is a practical, humane way to  go which can, in fact, with the other  components of the bill, create a comprehensive solution to immigration reform which has a chance to stop illegal  immigration into our country.  I am concerned that should Hagel-  Martinez become the law, we are back  where we started with a huge group of  people subject to deportation at one  point or another. We know that creates  the underground labor pool, which then  creates the incentive for an addition to  that underground labor pool. I believe  the orange card proposal we have before the Senate now does not do that.  But the devil is in the details of all of  this. We will see.  How much time do I have remaining?  ",2006
997,135,2006-05-23,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,  Less  than 1 minute 50 seconds.  ,2006
998,135,2006-05-23,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I yield  whatever time I have to the Senator  from California.  ",2006
999,135,2006-05-23,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  would like to say one other thing. A lot  of people come to me in desperate circumstances  for private bills.  I have  tried to meet some of the  families.  What I have seen in these families is  truly amazing. I have seen a legacy of  work over a period of time that  is  amazing for any human being. I have  actually seen families whose children  are valedictorians of their high school  class. I have seen them hide, but they  pay their taxes, and they own a home.  Some are even supervisors of companies.  If you  look around America,  the  meatpacking  industry,  the  chicken-  processing industry, virtually all of the  manufacturing  and  production,  you  will see these people as a dominant  part of that workforce. I look at the  great bread basket that is California,  the largest agricultural State in the  Union, and I know at least 600,000 of  our workforce are undocumented and  illegal. I know they come here because  of the absence of any hope or opportunity or ability to make a decent living where they were living before.  I think this whole dialog we are having puts an enormous obligation on  Mexico  to begin  to understand  the  needs of their people and do something  to help  them  become  economically  more upwardly mobile because this is  certainly the main problem that leads  to the cross-border immigration that is  illegal into our country. So we have  tried to solve this with a comprehensive bill. I think it makes sense. It says  to everybody that you have to earn  this legalization. You have to get out  there and work  for at  least 6 more  years. You have to report in, but you  have a card which identifies that you  are in an adjusted status, you are not  subject to deportation. You can raise  your children. You can volunteer for  community activities. You can become  a constructive member of society. I believe that is worth a lot.  Enabling people to live to their fullest is worth a lot. I hazard a guess that  there is not one person who is going to  go home because of what we do in a  bill. They are going to stay, they are  going to continue, but the lifestyle is  going to be clandestine, and they are  never going to be able to reach their  full potential. This amendment allows  them to do so. I urge the Senate to  vote yes.  I yield the floor and the remainder of  my time.  ",2006

1001,135,2006-05-23,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, it is  with  reluctance  that  I  oppose  the  amendment  offered  by  the Senator  from California because if this amendment were to be adopted, I believe the  very delicate and fragile coalition we  have for this bill would fail. We are  going to be looking for a cloture vote  tomorrow, and if we were to go back to  before the tenuous agreement that has  been worked out to date with the three  subdivisions—those here  5 years  or  more, those here 2 to 5 years, and those  here less than 2 years—I think our efforts at cloture would fail and the prospects for failure of the bill would be  very high.  We have structured the bill on a matter of principle, that those who are  here the longest have the most roots  and deserve the most consideration.  The top tier was those who have been  here 5 years or more. Selecting the  date of January 7, 2004, as a cutoff date  was done because that was the date of  the President’s speech on immigration  reform. And anybody who came to the  United States was on notice that they  would be treated differently.  Under  ideal  circumstances,  if we  didn’t have a tenuous coalition and we  didn’t have a conference prospectively  with the House, I would be very sympathetic and inclined to support what the  Senator from California has done. The  reality is that it is going to be very difficult to find people who are here and  not turn them into a fugitive class.  The theory is that those people will  not be able to find jobs and that they  will, therefore, return.  But this legislation is on the edge of  the ledge as it is. To keep the coalition  intact—and I think that was the thrust  of what Senator KENNEDYhad to say, if  I understood him, and I think others in  the coalition are of the same mind—it  is with reluctance that I oppose what  the Senator from California has said.  As a nation of immigrants, it would be  nice to include everybody on the path  to citizenship, but we face a lot of opposition, realistically, on the charge of  amnesty, which I have dealt with on  the floor. The bill is not amnesty; it is  earned citizenship.  How much time do I have?  ",2006

1009,142,2006-05-23,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I rise  in  strong opposition to the Leahy amendment and just warn my colleagues that  this is not a benign amendment but is  one of the most serious amendments  that has been proposed to this legislation and,  if  it  is adopted,  literally  would allow us to take somebody from  the Taliban into the United States.  There is already a law that provides  full waiver authority to the Secretary  of State to allow entry into this country for someone who happened to be  caught up in terrorist activity, albeit  innocently—the villager who is forced  to give rice and water to a Taliban  member. There  is nothing that prevents the Secretary of State from allowing that person to come into this  country.  This is literally a solution looking  for a problem. And it is pernicious because it literally allows entry into this  country of members of the Taliban beOFFICER. Who  cause the Taliban is not a designated  terrorist organization or a person who  assists an organization which threatens other countries and peoples but not  the United States.  Under the specific language of the  amendment, there are three specific  exceptions. One  is  the Secretary of  State, in consultation with or upon the  request of the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security, has determined that these activities threaten  the security of United States nationals  or the national security of the United  States. So you can threaten the security of Israel or Sri Lanka or India or  some other country and support that  terrorist organization but be permitted  to come into the United States. What  sense does that make?  There is no problem here that cannot  be dealt with under existing law. Show  me where in existing law the Secretary  of State does not have complete and  unfettered authority to waive the provisions of the law. This is a law about  terrorists, people who provide material  support to terrorist organizations not  being allowed into the United States. I  know the good intentions of the sponsors of the amendment, but the fact is,  some villager who is forced to provide  aid and comfort to a terrorist organization can get entry  into the United  States without  this  language which  opens a huge loophole. Never in the  past have we said it is OK to let a  member of the Taliban come in simply  because the Taliban is not a designated  organization.  You might ask: Why, with all of the  other terrorist organizations, isn’t the  Taliban a designated organization? Of  the 42 groups in the world that have  been  certified  by  the Secretary  of  State, it is not. The reason is because  it  is a  serious matter  to designate  someone. For example, once they are  designated,  then giving anything of  value to that group constitutes a Federal felony punishable by 15 years in  prison. And as a result, the failure to  designate the Taliban would be the  type of group that if you give material  support or aid to would permit you  entry into the United States. Because  the Department of State  is conservative with these certifications and they  have  substantial  collateral  consequences, not every group that would  fall  into the category of a terrorist  group is going to be designated, and  the Taliban is a perfect example.  I urge my colleagues, simply because  your heart yearns to help someone who  might have been forced under a concept  of duress to support a terrorist organization  or  an  organization  like  the  Taliban that is not designated as a terrorist organization, don’t adopt this  amendment under the mistaken view  that there is no other remedy. There is  a remedy. Clearly, under circumstances  of duress, that remedy can be invoked.  I urge my colleagues to reject this  very dangerous amendment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MARTINEZ).

1014,142,2006-05-23,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, this is  the third version of this amendment  that has been circulated on this bill. It  may well be that an earlier version of  this basic  idea would merit support  from Senators, but in its present form,  it is not worthy of support because it  redefines what  is material  support.  What constitutes material support is a  complex  issue.  Before  the  Senate  passes on it, there ought to be an analysis and hearings. The Judiciary Committee has had a whole series of hearings but none on this subject.  The amendment further narrows the  definition of what constitutes a terrorist organization. There, again, it is  a complicated subject. It ought to be  analyzed and considered at a hearing so  that Senators have a record basis for  making a determination as to whether  it ought to be adopted. These are hardly the kinds of complex issues which  can be decided without a record, without a hearing, and without analysis.  The Senator from Arizona has cited  the Taliban, but there are many other  citations that could be given. Kurdish  terrorists in Turkey might be admitted  under this amendment because they  pose no threat to the United States of  America. Basque terrorists  in Spain  might be admitted because they pose  no  threat  to  the United States of  America. Hamas, which poses a deadly  threat to Israel, might be admitted to  the United States because they arguably pose no threat on the face of it to  our national security. So we have an  amendment which is very broad and  changes  really  fundamental  definitions, in redefining material support.  In the collateral field of what is a material witness,  the  definition  takes  enormous analysis, which I have seen  in the criminal law. And to narrow the  definition of what is a terrorist organization,  so  that organizations which  would be considered terrorist without  this  amendment  but  not  terrorist  under this amendment, is just not the  sort of thing that ought to be done by  the U.S. Senate without a full hearing,  without analysis and a record basis for  making such a broad, important distinction.  I reserve the remainder of my time.  ",2006

1019,149,2006-05-23,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President,  this  amendment would authorize the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant a humanitarian  waiver to an immigrant if deportation  would create extreme hardship for an  immediate family member of the immigrant who is a U.S. citizen or a legal  permanent resident.  The Senate is considering a bill that  takes a  comprehensive approach  to  solving the problem of illegal immigration. One aspect of the bill is strengthening enforcement of our immigration  laws.  I  support  that. We  need  to  strengthen enforcement to restore integrity to our immigration system. No  one will believe we are serious about  immigration  reform  unless  enforcement is a critical element.  But as we make our laws tougher, we  must make certain we hold true to  American values. We should treat people fairly. We shouldn’t separate families if it would cause extreme hardship  to American citizens.  I am concerned that some of the enforcement provisions in this bill are so  broad they may have unintended consequences. These provisions have the  potential to sweep up long-term legal  permanent residents and separate them  from their American families.  Let me give one example which will  surprise most Members of the Senate.  It illustrates the need for this amendment. Under current immigration law,  a legal permanent resident convicted of  an  ‘‘aggravated felony’’ is subject to  mandatory detention and deportation.  The definition of aggravated felony in  the Immigration and Nationality Act  is very broad. It includes nonviolent  crimes such as shoplifting. Section 203  of this bill would expand the definition  of aggravated felony even further. It  would now be an aggravated felony to  aid or abet the commission of many  nonviolent crimes.  Under this provision, a teenager who  is a lawful permanent resident and has  lived in this country most of her life,  could be subject to mandatory detention and deportation  if she drives a  friend home from the mall after the  friend shoplifts a DVD.  Let’s take another example. The bill  greatly expands the definition of document fraud to include potentially innocent activities such as omitting immaterial information from an immigration application. The bill would make  such an omission a ground for deportation for the first time, so we are creating a new avenue for deporting people who are currently in the United  States legally.  For  example, a  lawful permanent  resident who inadvertently fails to include information about her parent’s  birthplace and address on her citizenCORNYN ship application could be convicted of  document fraud and deported.  My amendment would  follow very  closely what Senator KYLand Senator  accomplished last week. The  Senate approved a Kyl-Cornyn amendment  that  under  very  strict  circumstances will allow a humanitarian  waiver for undocumented immigrants  who apply for legal status under this  bill. We are following to the word the  Kyl-Cornyn amendment for the cases of  legal immigrants who might be deportable as a result of changes in the law  made by this bill.  In my Chicago office, 80 percent of  the casework relates to immigration. I  can tell you we encounter case after  case that would break your heart. In so  many cases, people who have lived and  worked in the United States for a long  period of  time and have  immediate  family members who are Americans  are falling between the cracks of the  law.  Most often, when we present these  cases to Homeland Security they say  that they are powerless to do anything  because our immigration laws allow so  little flexibility.  Every Member of  the Senate has  heard the pleas of a constituent or a  friend or someone who has faced this  kind of a dilemma. In most cases, we  have no ability to help them.  My amendment would follow the Kyl-  Cornyn amendment and create a very  limited waiver that would apply only  in the most compelling cases—where  deportation of an  immediate  family  member would cause extreme hardship  to an American citizen or legal permanent resident. The waiver would not be  automatic. The burden would fall on  the immigrant to prove that extreme  hardship would occur if he or she were  deported.  In every case, the Government has  complete discretion to deny the waiver.  To quote my amendment, the decision  to grant a waiver would be in the ‘‘sole  and unreviewable discretion’’ of the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security—the identical language  used  in the Kyl-Cornyn amendment.  This same strict standard was enacted  last week by the Senate in the Kyl-Cornyn amendment by a vote of 99 to 0.  The Kyl-Cornyn waiver would apply  in cases where undocumented  immigrants are seeking  legal status. The  waiver in my amendment would apply  in cases where an immigrant who was  previously in legal status is subject to  deportation only because of a change in  the law made by this bill.  Shouldn’t we give the same chance to  a legal immigrant facing deportation  that we give to an undocumented immigrant seeking legal status? Deportation is very serious. For an immigrant,  it means permanent exile from family  and home. And in some situations, it  may even be a matter of life and death.  I think  it  is appropriate that we  build on the good work of Senators KYL  and CORNYN. Their standard is tough,  but it is fair, and it certainly is not an  easy standard to meet.  It is also important to note that the  discretionary waiver in my amendment  is limited only to new penalties that  are a consequence of this bill. In other  words, it only applies to deportations  that are a direct result of the changes  in law made by this bill.  I should also point out that in no circumstances would this waiver apply to  cases  involving  suspected  terrorists.  The text of the amendment makes that  explicit.  We  already  give  the Government  broad discretion to apprehend, detain,  and deport undocumented immigrants.  My amendment would give the Government limited discretion—very limited  discretion—to show mercy in only the  most compelling cases.  The supporters of this amendment include the U.S. Conference of Catholic  Bishops, Catholic Charities USA, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, American  Jewish Committee, League of United  Latin  American  Citizens,  National  Council of La Raza, Hispanic National  Bar Association, Service Employees  International Union, National  Immigration Forum, American Immigration  Lawyers Association, Asian American  Justice  Center, Mexican  American  Legal Defense and Education Fund,  Human Rights Watch, and National  Immigration Law Center.  Mr. President, I will close by saying  this: most Members  of  the Senate  would be surprised to learn that under  this bill a young person who is guilty  of aiding a shoplifter could be deported  from the United States. In light of this,  you can see why there ought to be a  very limited option for the Secretary  of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to grant a humanitarian  waiver to an  immigrant  if  it would  cause extreme hardship to an immediate relative who is an American. We  followed the same standard in the Kyl-  Cornyn amendment, which was adopted  earlier, and I hope my colleagues will  support this amendment.  Mr. President, at this point, I withhold the remainder of my time and  yield to the chairman.  ",2006

1024,170,2006-05-23,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce legislation to establish the Land Between the Rivers National Heritage Area in southern Illinois. I am pleased that my colleague,  Senator OBAMA, is an original cosponsor of this legislation.  The unique landscape of southern Illinois helped to shape the history of  our Nation,  from  the Revolutionary  War through the Civil War, from westward expansion to trade along the rivers. Designating this area a National  Heritage Area will help to provide assistance in both the conservation and  historic preservation of southern Illinois and many areas that influenced  events in our Nation’s history.  The name  ‘‘Land Between the Rivers’’ was a phrase first used by Native  Americans to describe the area covered  by this bill. It includes 17 counties in  the southernmost region of Illinois located between the Mississippi and the  Ohio Rivers  and  between  the Mississippi  and Wabash Rivers. Native  Americans arrived in southern Illinois  about 10,000 years ago and formed the  largest settlement north of the Mayan/  Aztec civilization.  The arrival of the Europeans, including French, British and Spanish explorers, began a period of settlements and  fortifications in the area. The Spanish  first explored the Mississippi River in  1542, followed by the French in 1673.

1049,247,2006-05-23,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, for decades this  Nation has been researching, debating, drafting, and redrafting national energy policy. Unfortunately,  the  long gas  lines of  the 1970’s  that motivated  the kind of original  thought  needed to end our dependency on foreign oil  slipped  from our memories as supplies  increased and prices dropped. Today, we are  punished with oil prices floating in the range of  $75 a barrel, record prices at the pump, and  an unstable world market for the foreseeable  future.  At the same time, according to the Department of Energy, $35–$45 a barrel oil is attainable from a source within our borders. It is our  most abundant domestic energy  resource—  coal. With  technology  that has been around  for decades, coal can be liquefied and turned  into a liquid fuel, and eventually sold for approximately half of what we are paying now  per barrel.  The true value of coal is misunderstood and  many ignore its potential to free us from foreign oil at our own peril. We risk stepping into  the same trap that has caught so many promising energy policy advances by the ankle for  decades.  Research has brought us a long, long way  from the days of smokestacks and gray skies.  True, there remain many less efficient, older  generation power plants  in  this Nation, but  largely because, while the Government draped  oil companies  in rich  tax advantages,  it devoted mere dribbles of money to providing incentives for clean burning coal plants.  Thirty years of government and private-sector research and development has created a  product, according to the Department of Energy, that is cleaner than required under EPA  Tier II fuel standards. And with this Nation’s  refinery capacity operating on all cylinders,  these fuels would fit right into our energy mix  as  they would  require very  little additional  processing. Coal-to-liquids can curb our appetite for foreign fuel.  Dtsturbingly, however, for all of our Nation’s  pride  in our competitiveness and  innovation,  we stand behind a number of other countries  in  liquefying coal  to end our  foreign oil dependence.  For  instance,  these  fuels  represent about  one-third of the consumption in South Africa,  which began  its production and use  in  the  1950’s using the Fischer-Tropsch process developed during the 1920’s by two German researchers. China, India, and Indonesia, recognizing  the problems of  relying on  foreign  sources of oil, are all aggressively pursuing  coal liquefaction as key components of their  energy production. For the U.S., our continued  myopia about coal  liquefaction  is particularly  numb-headed, since coal  is our most abundant natural energy resource.  In order to catch up to the rest of the world,  a position to which the U.S. is unaccustomed,  we must  invest  in our  future and Congress  began to travel down this road with the reauthorization of  the Nation’s surface  transportation laws last year by including two new excise tax credits aimed at promoting the use of  alternative transportation fuels, including liquid  fuel derived from coal.  While a helpful first step, due to the restrictive nature of  the existing  tax credit,  I am  pleased  to  join my colleague JOHNSHIMKUS  and others in introducing legislation aimed at  helping  far-sighted  firms better afford  their  foray into coal liquefaction. Our bill would reduce some of  the risk  that  these  firms and  their investors take as they try to lead our Nation into a new energy frontier.  Simply put, our legislation would extend until  2020 the 50 cents per gallon tax credit for liquid fuel derived from coal that is set to expire  in 2009. The  legislation does not address  other alternative transportation fuels, just coal-  to-liquids.  The aim is to provide a level of predictability  for a number of years to those willing to put  money into coal-to-liquids production. It would  help  to smooth out some of  the ups and  downs associated with  fluctuating oil prices  and the gamble investors make in the financing of these high-tech energy ventures.  Unfortunately,  while  other  governments  have been footing the bill for this kind of research and development  for decades, our  Government has been  ‘‘playing  footsie’’ with  Big Oil.  In comparison  to  the big  tax giveaways enjoyed by  the oil  industry, precious  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:29 May 24, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A23MY8.015 E23MYPT1 S K R A M E R M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

1052,254,2006-05-23,Mr. JINDAL.," Mr. Speaker,  recently more  than 1,200 students from across the country  participated in the national finals competition  of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution. This  is one of  the most extensive  educational programs  in  the country developed specifically to educate young men and  women about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of  Rights. The program  is administered by  the  Center for Civic Education and funded by the  U.S. Department of Education. It is my distinct  pleasure to announce the competition’s Unit 5  Award winner: Grace King High School from  Metairie, LA.  The national  finals are an arduous 3-day  academic competition  that simulates a congressional hearing in which the students testify  before a panel of judges on constitutional topics. Students from many schools demonstrate  their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as  they evaluate,  take, and  defend positions on  relevant historical and  contemporary  issues.  This  year’s  winner,  Grace King High School, is an educational institution known for high standards of academic  achievement that has produced many talented  students. The winners of this competition have  proven through their hard work and meticulous  study of our Constitution that they are no exception.  Mr. Speaker,  the  names  of  these  outstanding  students  from Grace King High  School are as follows:  Aaron Baer-Harsha, Patrick Berrigan, Jaime  Bruno,  Lily Chen, Caitlyn Clarke, Paulius  Donauskas, Janice Fan, Rebecca Felix, Jeremy Finnegan, Alice Ho, Tony Huang, Thomas Lambert, Krysten Le, Donald Leverson, Ali  Mahbod, Elise Murphy-Mejia, Jacob O’Neil,  Sean Olsen, Veronica Oro, Anna Plaksiy,  Rachelle Ross, Olivia Saito, Sara Sands, and  Murielle Telio.  I also wish to commend Jamie Staub, the  teacher who was responsible for preparing the  student class for the national finals competition. Also worthy of special recognition is John  Alexander,  the State  coordinator, who  is  among those responsible for implementing the  program in my district.  Mr. Speaker and my  colleagues  in  the  House, please join me in congratulating these  young constitutional experts from Louisiana for  their outstanding achievement.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

GEORGE MILLER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 22, 2006  ",2006
1054,254,2006-05-23,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.," Madam  Speaker, the January victory of Hamas in parliamentary elections  in  the Palestinian  territories was a shock  to observers worldwide  and to the many of us in the United States  and abroad who have repudiated violence between the Palestinians and the Jews and have  repudiated attacks on the state of Israel.  The election was a shock to the peace efforts in the Middle East because its outcome  resulted in the Palestinian government being  controlled by a party  that was  legitimately  elected by the voters of the Palestinian territories but that also is a party that sponsors  terrorist acts against  the  Israeli-people and  whose doctrine is based upon the notion that  the existence of Israel is an affront to Islam.  For there to be any progress towards peace  under a Hamas-led Palestinian government,  Hamas must immediately acknowledge Israel’s  right to exist; uphold all previous agreements  including the Roadmap for Peace; rid itself of  all terrorist ties and dismantle its terrorist infrastructure; ensure  the continuation of democratic institutions; and how fiscal transparency.  If they do not, Hamas cannot expect the support and recognition of the United States and  other governments.  However, any actions carried out by  the  U.S. Government against Hamas must address Hamas specifically and not the Palestinian people generally and must not undermine our goals  in  the Middle East. The bill  being voted on today by the House would undermine the U.S. Government’s ability to further  the peace process and  it would clearly  hurt the Palestinian people. It could also lead  to chaos  in  the Palestinian  territories, which  would be counter to both American and Israeli  interests.  I am not alone in saying that denying all aid,  except in the most isolated of instances, to the  Palestinian people runs counter to both American and Israeli security interests. If we provoke a humanitarian crisis there, it may very  well lead to the collapse of the Hamas government but not without potentially severe costs  to both law abiding Palestinians and the peace  process at the same time. And it could also  erode civil order.  We do not and must not ever support terrorists in the Palestinian government. However,  the United States must continue  to support  programs providing  the Palestinian people’s  basic needs such as  food, water and medicine; programs supporting democracy, human  rights, freedom of the press and non-violence;  as well as peaceful co-existence with Israel.  That is why I voted against H.R. 4681. The  United States has already cut off direct aid to  the Hamas government. This bill would not  have brought additional penalties directly  to  Hamas.  That  objective  has  already  been  achieved. But it would penalize the Palestinian  people and greatly  limit  the Administration’s  diplomatic options in pursuing peace between  Israel and the Palestinians.  I hope that a conference committee with the  Senate might produce legislation that addresses my concerns and the concerns of my other  colleagues and of many well-regarded organizations and  individuals who are deeply pro-  Israel and who are great supporters of humanitarian efforts in the Middle East. I look forward  to being able to support a revised bill that will  send the proper message to Hamas that its violence toward Israel will never be supported  and to the Palestinian people that the United  States stands ready to work with them to resolve this most difficult and important conflict  in peace.

1060,3,2006-06-06,Mr. CULBERSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  bring this amendment to the House  today to  focus the attention of the  House, of the White House, of the country on an urgent and very serious problem with  the  Citizen  Immigration  Service.  CIS is responsible for reviewing and  approving any application for citizenship, for green cards, for visas, for I–90s  for people entering the United States  temporarily or permanently.  Yet this agency  is so  incompetent  and so poorly run, all of us know, those  of us representing border States, that  the level of illegal immigration in the  country is overwhelming. We have got  people entering the country literally at  will over our borders.  Based on my own investigation, what  I have learned from visiting the border  firsthand, it is possible for terrorists to  enter the United States just walking  over the border, or frankly they can  come right through the front door at  the Citizenship and Immigration Service offices, the CIS offices, because the  agency is not running criminal background checks on people applying for  visas or green cards or I–90s or citizenship.  The agency, when they do run background checks, the Inspector General  reports, that among people who are applying to enter the United States temporarily, there  is a 90 percent error  rate in security checks being run on  these folks. If you are entering as a refugee, there is a 64 percent error rate.  Now,  this  is on  running criminal  background checks on foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States,  at a time when we are at war with terrorists who we know are seeking to  enter the United States to hurt us. The  terrorists who attacked us on September 11 were using dozens and dozens  and dozens of  fraudulent driver’s  licenses, phony IDs; they were, many of  them, visa overstays.  This agency  is so  incompetent, so  poorly run that in fact they even hired  an Iraqi spy and swore him in as an officer of the United States to interview  foreign nationals applying to enter the  United States. This was reported first  in the Washington Times on April 6.  After this was confirmed that this  guy was an Iraqi spy, he flew to Baghdad and walked out of the Green Zone  and disappeared. This  is a huge national security problem, Mr. Chairman.  And the problem  is really systemic  throughout CIS, because their focus is  not on national security, but customer  service.  This agency’s sole primary motivation is on the convenience of the foreign  national,  to make  sure  that  Osama bin Laden’s cousin out in the  lobby is not hindered or slowed down in  any  way,  that  his  application  is  stamped and approved as rapidly as  possible.  Chairman ROGERShas done a superb  job in doing everything that he can to  bring the CIS, and ICE and Homeland  Security, to heel. I know he is aware of  the severity of this problem.  My amendment would stop the use of  any funds for CIS to process immigration applications other than H1Bs for 1  year, so they can catch up and catch  their breath. We know the backlog is  so bad right now that they are simply  overwhelmed, they are years behind.  We know they are not running criminal  background checks, and the criminal  background checks  they do  run on  these foreign nationals are just riddled  with errors.  My amendment is intended to shut  that process down for a year to allow  them to catch up. The Homeland Security reauthorization is coming up this  summer. I intend to pursue this very  aggressively with Chairman KING.  I  bring this amendment to the attention  of the House today and do intend to  withdraw it.  I  understand  we  need  to  work  through  the Homeland Security authorization bill on this, Mr. Chairman.  But it is an extraordinarily serious and  dangerous problem that the country  needs to be aware of. There has even  been information brought to my attention and to the chairman’s attention  that the foreign intelligence agencies  have probably penetrated CIS at very  high levels and are able to remotely  print out visas, I–90s, passports, citizenships to fraudulent individuals remotely on command using laptop computers from anywhere in the world.  This agency I think poses a very serious threat to the national security of  the United States. I intend to pursue it  very aggressively with the reauthorization of the homeland security bill.  Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment to the House today to focus the  House’s attention on it, bring it to the  attention of the Nation. And I thank  the chairman, Chairman ROGERS, on  trying to clear up this agency and  homeland security.  ",2006

The Department of Homeland Security awarded a contract to a private  company  for  limousine  and  shuttle  services for its employees for $22 million. All of our budget discussions are  indeed discussions about priorities, and  Mr. KUHLand I would suggest that this  simply is an issue of priorities.

Created  by Congress  in  2003,  the  SAFER Grants are meant to help communities with career, volunteer, and  combination fire departments to meet  industry minimum standards and attain 24-hour staffing to provide adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards, and to fulfill traditional  missions of fire departments that antedate the creation of the Department of  Homeland  Security.  These  SAFER  Grants will help fire departments meet  these minimum industry standards prescribed by National Fire Protection Association Standards 1710 and 1720.  It seems to both Mr. KUHLand to me  that our priorities as a Nation should  be for FIRE and SAFER Grants and not  limousines, and I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2006
1064,10,2006-06-06,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, first, let me say that,  as written, this amendment does not  accomplish what  the  gentleman,  I  think, has described, but I do understand the  intent of the amendment,  and I agree with the gentleman’s concerns about  the various allegations  that have been made about this service.  However, I would like to point out  that the Inspector General’s office is  investigating this 5-year contract to  see if there is any impropriety. If there  is, the contract will be terminated.  The intent of this amendment is to  bar DHS employees from using ‘‘limousine services.’’ But it does not define  what that means. It could have some  wide-ranging impacts if it is not defined.  For example, with no definition, it  could be perhaps used to stop FEMA  crews from contracting buses to get to  disaster areas. It could shut down bus  shuttle  service between  the various  DHS campuses in the D.C. area. And it  could prevent employees from taking  taxis from airports while they are on  official travel. These are very impractical limitations for a department we  expect to act quickly in time of emergency.  So I would hope at some point in  time, if this amendment passes, that  there could be some way to define what  is prohibited. But even with these concerns and these reservations, I am willing to accept the gentleman’s amendment.  ",2006

AMENDMENTOFFEREDBYMR. GARRETTOFNEW  JERSEY  Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr.  Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk  will designate the amendment.

1066,10,2006-06-06,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Kentucky reserves a point  of order.  Pursuant to the order of the House of  May 25, 2006, the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. GARRETT) and a Member  opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from New Jersey.  Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.  Mr. Chairman,  I do  recognize  the  point of order, and I will address that  at the very end.  Mr. Chairman, I drafted an amendment here to highlight in essence the  mismanagement of money in two specific agencies or programs funded by  this bill, FEMA and the Homeland Security Grants program.  There is no one in this body that  knows our threat to this Nation better  than I. The district that I have the  honor and privilege of  representing  borders the Hudson River and downtown New York City is basically within  eyesight of our district. There were  tragically  far too many people  from  the Fifth District of New Jersey who  lost their lives on September 11. So my  top priority since coming to this body  has been and will remain homeland security.  The threat to our Nation and the  residents of northern New Jersey  is  still very real. Law enforcement agencies are stretching every penny to purchase  equipment,  vehicles, medical  supplies, and radios, but they do not  have enough resources. On too many  occasions in this body, I have fought  for more resources to be brought to  New Jersey and other high-risk areas.  With that being said,  it pains me  that as my neighbors and friends, living in my region of such high risk, the  Department of Homeland Security is  still using a portion of our limited resources for things that will keep no one  safer and make no taxpayer happier.  It has come to my attention that the  DHS has provided grants for example  to fire departments to pay for things  such as fitness equipment, nutritional  counseling, clown and puppet shows, no  less. Now, Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  clowns are as funny as the next guy,  but  I don’t think the ability to be  funny is what it is about when we are  trying to help people during the next  terrorist attack.  Looking next to FEMA, similar examples  illustrate the need  for additional oversight of FEMA, the Federal  Emergency Management Agency. Since  Hurricane Katrina tragically hit the  gulf coast, we have heard of numerous  examples of mismanagement, neglect,  wasteful spending, and even fraud that  has prevented hundreds of millions of  dollars from helping any of the victims  of the storm.  Now, my time is limited here, so I  will highlight just some of the most  egregious examples. There have been  five, five separate government reports  by the GAO and other bodies that detail these problems. They have provoked the universal outrage  in mismanagement, and here in this amendment we try to address it.  Specifically, my amendment calls attention to the utter mismanagement of  the debit card program. As you may recall, FEMA gave out $2,000 debit cards  with no verification process for eligibility. People took advantage of it.  b1515  Among the many ‘‘necessary’’ items  that people did for survival were adult  entertainment, bail bond services, jewelry, and of course what every victim  of a hurricane has to worry about, traffic tickets.  Another example of waste, FEMA  spent almost $900 million to store nearly 25,000 manufactured homes around  the country mainly because they prohibited themselves from putting them  in flood plains, such as New Orleans. In  addition, FEMA let almost 11,000 unused manufactured homes sit in open  fields in Arkansas, while at the same  time paying people’s hotel bills of $438  per night to stay in a hotel in New  York City.

1068,24,2006-06-06,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 5126, the ‘‘Truth in Caller ID Act.’’ And  I commend the Chairman of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce,  BARTON, and  Representative ELIOT for  introducing  this bipartisan bill.  Many  consumers  subscribe  to  caller  ID  services that let them know the number of an  incoming telephone call and the name of the  caller. Consumers often rely on this caller ID  information to decide whether to answer a call.  Consumers should be able  to  trust  that  the  caller ID information has not been changed for  fraudulent or harmful purposes.  Until recently, manipulating caller  ID  information, also called  ‘‘spoofing,’’ was difficult  JOE ENGEL and  required expensive equipment. Unfortunately, advances in technology have allowed  individuals with  fraudulent  intent, and others  seeking to do harm, to easily spoof their caller  ID  information, making calls appear  to originate from a different person, organization, or  location. As such, the recipient of a call that  has been spoofed may answer the call thinking that it is coming from someone from whom  it is not.  There are legitimate reasons to spoof caller  ID information. For example, a domestic violence clinic may alter its caller ID information  to mask its identity. This is important for the  safety of victims of domestic violence since  many victims seek help while they are still living with their abuser.  Caller  ID spoofing, however, can be used  for nefarious purposes.  In a widely reported  case, SWAT  teams were dispatched  to an  apartment building  in New Brunswick, New  Jersey, last year after authorities received a  call from a woman saying that she was being  held hostage. The caller had spoofed the caller ID information to make it appear as though  the call was coming from inside the building.  Caller ID spoofing is also used to gain personal information from a consumer so a criminal can more easily steal the consumer’s identity. Equally troubling is the use of such spoofing by predators  to cause physical or emotional harm to their victims.  H.R. 5126 will help put an end to caller ID  spoofing  for  fraudulent or harmful purposes.  Specifically,  the Act makes  it unlawful  for  someone to change their caller ID information  with the intent to defraud or cause harm to another person.  This bill is good consumer protection legislation. I am pleased to support it and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.  ",2006

1077,31,2006-06-06,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  H.R. 5449. Unfortunately, my very good  friend, Mr. LATOURETTE, the gentleman  from Ohio, and Mr. COSTELLO, the gentleman from Illinois, support this proposal, but this, unfortunately, is a very  seriously flawed bill and piece of legislation, and it comes at a time when we  are trying to do everything we can to  stabilize and provide economic reform  for the aviation industry.  Let me talk a little bit about the history of how we got to this situation.  Mr. LATOURETTEhas also spoken to the  increases that the air traffic controllers have received  from 1998 to  last  year. They did receive some 75 percent,  and maybe there was need to adjust the  salaries. That translates into about 10  percent per year. But that contract did  expire last year, and the air traffic controllers were required and FAA also  began negotiations for a new contract.  Unfortunately,  that  drug  out  for  some time, and by the terms of the existing contracts and agreement, as long  as no contract was in place, the terms  of  the old  contract prevailed, with  some pretty hefty increases in place.  What has taken place in fact is an  impasse occurred. Under existing law,  when that  impasse was declared by  FAA, the matter was sent to Congress.  That has all taken place. That is all  history. For some 60 days, Congress  had an opportunity to overturn that.  And it is true that there was legislation with many Republican cosponsors  sympathetic with changing some of the  procedures. However, that bill was not  retroactive, like the LaTourette proposal. This is a reach-back provision,  and it also takes Congress completely  out of the process, as opposed to the  bill that others had cosponsored.  So, this is a bill, again, H.R. 5449,  that, if enacted, will change the rules  of the game at the bottom of the ninth  inning just because one of the teams  does not like the outcome of fair negotiations, a legislative process that has  already been completed, and, again, we  take Congress out of the process.  The Constitution provides in Article  I that all bills relating to funding and  appropriations come out of the House  of Representatives,  emanate  in  the  House of Representatives. This legislation, again, reaches back and changes  the rules of the game. It allows a panel  that is not confirmed by Congress, by  the Senate, again, a panel of seven, to  make appropriations and also authorization decisions that are left to the  Congress.  So, I have great concern about this  procedure. I think it sets a horrible  precedent.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
1078,31,2006-06-06,Mr. COSTELLO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 5449, legislation that will send  the FAA and the air traffic controllers  back to the bargaining table. H.R. 5449  seeks to ensure a fair process to resolve  impasses that arise during collective  bargaining negotiations with the FAA  instead of the current one-sided process.  The FAA and NATCA started contract negotiations in July of 2005. The  FAA declared an impasse on April 5  and promptly sent the contract to Congress just days before we went out on  our April district work period. The 60-  day clock expired yesterday, June 5,  with the FAA imposing its last offer  immediately.  I believe the best way to get a fair  contract between the two sides is for  Members to sign Discharge Petition  No. 13 to bring H.R. 4755, a bipartisan  bill with 265 cosponsors, including 75  Republicans, to the House floor for a  vote. Congresswoman SUEKELLYand I  introduced H.R. 4755 which would insist  on binding arbitration, ensuring an end  to the dispute, protecting collective  bargaining rights and to promote good  faith, fair negotiations. One hundred  ninety-five Members, all Democrats,  signed the Costello discharge petition  to bring H.R. 4755 to the floor.  Because I  filed the discharge petition, the Republican leadership has decided to bring up H.R. 5449, introduced  by my good friend, Mr. LATOURETTE, to  the House  floor  today  for consideration. While I would have preferred to  see H.R. 4755 on the floor today, I support H.R. 5449, the legislation before  us, as a means of reversing the current  one-sided process that does not promote good faith negotiations.  I want to remind my colleagues as we  hear a lot about salaries and working  conditions and other issues that this  bill is about process only, plain and  simple. There are no mandates concerning salaries, benefits or anything  concerning working  conditions with  the air traffic controllers. It simply  gets both sides back to the bargaining  table.  Today’s debate really comes down to  whether Members support the rights of  workers and the rights of collective  bargaining. Anytime one side comes to  the bargaining table knowing that they  will get what they want at the end of  the day, which is exactly what the current law does, it gives the FAA what  they want, their last proposal at the  end of the day, then there is no incentive to reach an agreement.  The current law is grossly unfair and  needs to be permanently changed. If  you  truly believe  in collective bargaining, you will send both sides back  to the bargaining table by supporting  H.R. 5449.  I urge all Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006

1080,38,2006-06-06,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in strong objection to H.R. 5449, a bill  to modify bargaining  requirements  for proposed changes to the personnel management  system of the Federal Aviation Administration.  I currently serve as the Chairman of the Appropriations Sub-Committee on Transportation,  Treasury, HUD and other agencies. This legislation today would put an enormous strain on  my committee’s resources and force all programs under my jurisdiction into greater budgetary peril.  Simply put, a ‘‘yes’’ vote on H.R. 5449 could  cost  the FAA $1.9 billion over  the next 5  years. The FAA would be  forced  to divert  funds from critical safety initiatives—such as  air traffic control modernization—to cover the  cost of sky-rocketing controller salaries.  I understand that air-traffic controllers provide a valuable service to the flying public and  that they work hard to ensure safety and security. I also understand that due to the unique  ability of  their union—an ability  that  is not  available  to every other  federal employee  union—they have negotiated  some of  the  highest wages in federal service.  The  average  air-traffic  controller  earns  $173,000 per year, and  their salaries have  gone up 75 percent in the past 8 years. The  top 100 NATCA union members earn an average salary of $197,000.  How does this compare with other federal  employees? Well, quite well  I would  say.  These controllers make more than Members  of Congress ($165,200), Cabinet Secretaries  ($180,100), and almost as much as Supreme  Court Justices ($199,200) and the Vice President of the United States ($208,700).  The comparison is even more striking when  we weigh their salary levels against other critical safety, security, and health professions.  In my home area of Detroit, an average  NATCA member makes $118,490. Compare  that to the average firefighter ($42,100), police  officer  ($48,770),  or  registered  nurse  ($59,380). And, this kind of pay disparity is not  unique  to my home area, but  is consistent  across the Nation.  At a  time when our  federal workforce  is  stretched at home and abroad to protect our  Nation,  there  is no  justification  for air  traffic  controllers to enjoy unparalleled salary hikes,  especially when our military personnel, homeland security officials,  first  responders, and  other government employees do not receive  the same treatment.  Some may try to indicate that a ‘‘yes’’ vote  on H.R. 5449 would be a ‘‘free’’ vote to give  to the unions. However, nothing could be further from the truth.  If H.R. 5449  is enacted,  it will effectively  render the new FAA/NATCA control null and  void, and cause FAA costs and salaries to spiral out of control. The new NATCA/FAA contract would be superseded by  the previous  contract, reached between the Clinton Administration and NATCA in 1998, and the continuation of the 1998 contract would cost tax-payers $1.9 billion in the short-term, and $3.8 billion in the long-term.  It should be obvious that a cost of $3.8 billion tax-payer dollars is far from ‘‘free.’’  A vote  for  this bill  is not about protecting  workers wages and stopping  the FAA  from  slashing controllers’ salaries. To be crystal  clear: the FAA has offered to protect the compensation of each and every current controller.  A new contract would only apply to new hires,  and not affect the salaries of existing controllers.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 5449—  a bill that would ban the FAA from reigning in  out-of-control controllers’ salaries and cost tax-  payers and my committee billions of dollars. I  strongly urge a  ‘‘no’’ vote on  this  financially  reckless legislation that will set a dangerous  precedent for years to come.  ",2006
1081,38,2006-06-06,Mr.  FITZPATRICK  of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5449;  legislation that will strengthen the negotiation  process between unions and the federal governments. As many of my colleagues know,  the Federal Aviation Administration  recently  declared a deadlock in negotiations with the  National Air Traffic Controllers Association  (NATCA). The issue is simple; on one hand,  the air  traffic controllers unions want  to  increase the pay package for their employees  and on the other, the FAA wants to cut the  pay package. On June 5, 2006, the 60 day  period  for Congress  to  take action on  the  FAA’s contract offer  to  the NATCA officially  expired. Under current law the FAA would now  be able to unilaterally impose the contract because Congress has not acted.  The  legislation  being  considered  tonight  would provide air traffic controllers with a fair  negotiation process. H.R. 5449 would break  the current impasse by sending negotiators to  the Federal Service Impasse Panel (FSIP), a  neutral third party, for a final resolution instead  of keeping them bound to the FAA.  Mr. Speaker, American workers must be  provided with the opportunity to participate in  a fair bargaining process. Contracts should be  the result of a fair deliberate process that ensures that the rights of workers are protected  through a  full hearing of  their grievances  in  front of a neutral third party. Congressional inaction and the forced acceptance of one sided  contracts are not  the way  to settle employment disputes.  There has been a lot of talk about this bill  interfering with the FAA’s ability to budget its  compensation packages. Opponents say that  this  legislation will cost  the FAA $1.9 billion  over the next 5 years. This bill does none of  these things.  H.R. 5449 does nothing to modify or manipulate the compensation scheme of air traffic  controllers. It only deals directly with the bargaining process itself by reaffirming the meaning of good faith bargaining by requiring the  parties to submit their impasses to the Federal  Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) for final resolution—the natural course for employment disagreements and negotiations at  the  federal  level.  I call on my colleagues to cut through the  clutter that this issue has created. The ability  for American workers to fairly negotiate with  the federal government is at stake here and  Congress has a chance to stand up for our Air  Traffic Controllers. I call on my colleagues to  support and pass H.R. 5449.  ",2006
1082,38,2006-06-06,Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in support of H.R. 5449, which would  move current and future contract disputes between the FAA and the air traffic controllers to  the Federal Services Impasse Panel.  Current law has an extremely unusual disadvantage for our Nation’s air traffic controllers: if their union negotiators cannot reach a  contract agreement with FAA,  then  the FAA  can impose a contract unless Congress says  otherwise within 60 days.  The FAA declared an impasse in the negotiations and has stated that they will be imposing their terms unilaterally within a matter of  days in the face of majority opposition in Congress.  This  is an extreme burden  that  few other  American workers, if any, must meet in their  contract negotiations. Current FAA contract  law grants too much power to the FAA management and makes a mockery of the collective bargaining process.  H.R. 5449 is a good compromise, because  we as Congress are not taking sides and picking the air traffic controllers contract offer or  pick the FAA’s contract offer.  The bill is good policy because Congress is  not the best place to negotiate the details of  employment contracts. Instead, this legislation  would place  the decision  in a  specialized  board that has plenty of experience mediating  federal workers’ contract disputes.  The Federal Services  Impasse Panel  is  fair—they resolve numerous disputes in favor  of different sides, sometimes going with  the  agencies’ positions and sometimes with  federal employees.  The air  traffic controllers  in  the Houston  Center  and  the  Houston  TRACON  and  throughout Texas deserve the same fair shake  in arbitration  that other  federal workers  receive.  Much of  the opposition  to  this  legislation  and to air traffic controllers in general comes  from groups that voice knee-jerk opposition to  any and all federal spending. They fail to offer  any answers to the simple fact that air traffic  controllers have a hard, complicated job with  extremely high stakes.  I doubt that many of the opponents to this  bill have ever been  in an air  traffic control  tower, or a control center or a TRACON when  a large bank of flights comes into a major hub  airport.  We want our skies to be safe, and you don’t  get safety by cutting corners and nickel and  dimeing the workforce.  Our air traffic control system is about to experience a wave of retirements. If we want to  recruit quality employees to keep us and our  children flying safely into the future, we should  approve H.R. 5449.  ",2006

1088,45,2006-06-06,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H. Res. 729, resolution sponsored  by my friend and colleague MARKFOLEY, the  Co-Chair of the Travel and Tourism Caucus  along with members of the Caucus including  myself, in support of National Tourism Week.  It  is worth repeating, Mr. Speaker, as  the  resolution points out, Travel and Tourism as  the 3rd largest retail sales industry in the Nation, has a major impact on the economy of  the United States. One out of every 7 people  employed  in  the United States civilian  labor  force is directly or indirectly employed in the  travel and tourism industry. International travel  to the United States is the largest service export, generating a  trade surplus  for 16 consecutive years,  increasing 144 percent between 2003 and 2004 to over $4 billion. And,  in 2005 alone, travel and tourism-related expenditures reached $1 trillion, including $596  billion in direct sales and $445 billion in indirect sales, and supported 8 million jobs.  As someone who represents an area where  tourism  is our number one  industry,  I am  proud to report that despite increases in the  price of oil, the tourism industry in the Virgin  Islands have been doing exceptionally well  over the last couple of years.  According  to  the Virgin  Islands Bureau of  Economic Research, the industry was one of  the strongest performers and main contributor  to the economic performance during 2004 with  increases  in both air and cruise ship passengers. Total visitors in the Territory in fiscal  year 2004 reached a record 2.6 million, up 12  percent over 2003.  The BER projects, barring any significant  shocks, that visitor arrival will peak at 2.7 million by the end of fiscal year 2005 and 2.8 million in fiscal year 2006.  Mr. Speaker, the Travel and Tourism industry generates  trillions of dollars  in economic  activity in the U.S. and as such it deserves all  of our support. I urge my colleagues to support passage of H. Res. 729.  ",2006
1089,45,2006-06-06,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  offer my support for House Resolution 729, a  bill that I and Mr. FARR introduced recognizing  the 23rd Annual National Tourism Week.  First established by Congress in 1983, this  annual event gives us an opportunity to recognize the significant importance the Travel and  Tourism Industry has on our economy.  The travel and tourism industry is the lifeblood of many states around the country—including Florida, California, New York and Nevada,  to name a  few. Every Congressional  District is impacted—that is every district with  a  restaurant, hotel, museum, national park,  stadium, theater, campgrounds and beaches.  Domestic travel and tourism-related spending has reached $1 trillion a year. There are  over 8 million people in the food service, hospitality and travel-related industries that rely on  America’s vibrant and thriving travel industry.  As America’s third-largest retail sales industry, nearly $100 billion dollars was generated  in tax revenue for our local, state and federal  governments in 2004.  In addition, international travel to the United  States is now the largest service export with a  generated  trade surplus  for 16 consecutive  years.  For example, in my district there are visitors  from all over the world who are drawn to our  beautiful beaches, recreational  lakes, habitat  wildlife preserves and golf courses. In 2005,  Florida collected over $3 billion in tourism and  recreational sales, a reflection of $62 billion  that went into the state’s economy during the  year.  So as some of us begin our summer travel,  let us remember the tremendous impact the  travel and tourism industry makes on all of our  lives.  ",2006

1096,45,2006-06-06,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  Mr.  Speaker,  born  in  County  Wicklow, Ireland, Matthew Lyon was a  printer, farmer, soldier and politician  who came to America as an indentured  servant at the age of 14 in 1764. During  the Revolution, Matthew Lyon fought  with Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys to capture Fort Ticonderoga.  He later resigned from the Army in  1778, and became a member of  the  Vermont  House  of  Representatives  from 1779 to 1783.  During this time he built and operated various kinds of mills, including  one to manufacture paper. He also established a printing office in 1793 and  published the Farmers’ Library. In addition, he created the Fair Haven Gazette, a weekly newspaper, and served  as publisher and editor while using the  paper to express his political opinions  in the early years of our Republic.  Lyon was elected as a Republican to  the Fifth and Sixth Congresses, but  was not a candidate for renomination  in 1800. He then went on to relocate to  the State of Kentucky in 1801, and settled  in Caldwell County, now Lyon  County, and became a member of the  House of Representatives of Kentucky  in 1802.  He was then elected to the Eighth  Congress and to three successive Congresses until he was unsuccessful  in  seeking reelection in 1810. He is certainly one of our Founding Fathers,  and it is long overdue for him to be recognized with this post office.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  SANDERS BERNARD b2230  ",2006
1097,45,2006-06-06,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I might consume.  As a member of the Government Reform Committee, I am pleased to join  my colleague in consideration of H.R.  5245, legislation naming the postal facility at 1 Marble Street in Fair Haven,  Vermont, after Matthew Lyon. This  bill, which was  sponsored  by Representative  of  Vermont, was unanimously reported by  our committee on May 4, 2006.  Matthew Lyon was born in County  Wicklow, Ireland, and in 1764, at the  age of  14, emigrated  to  the United  States as an indentured servant. It was  not long before he was a free man and  fighting  alongside Ethan Allen  and  others in the famous battle of Ticonderoga. Lyon went on  to  settle  in  Vermont, founding the village of Fair  Haven and later representing Vermont  in Congress for two terms.  Lyon was a fierce Jeffersonian Republican and a staunch opponent of the  Sedition Act. Lyon’s public opposition  to the Sedition Act led him to be the  first person arrested under the guise of  the act. A dubious honor to some, perhaps, was a badge of honor to this protector of free speech and liberty. Lyon  would serve a 4-month prison sentence  and become a champion of the movement opposed to the Sedition Act.  After serving two terms as the Representative for Vermont and one term  in  the Kentucky State  legislature,  Lyon was elected to Congress again,  this time as a Representative for the  State of Kentucky, becoming one of  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:04 Jun 07, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A06JN7.087 H06JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2006

1099,52,2006-06-06,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker,  this  week, America, Texas and East Texas  mourn  the  loss of Federal District  Court Judge William Merritt Steger.  As former law clerk and good friend  Andy Tindel said, ‘‘Judge Steger was  one of the finest, fairest, most honest  man I have ever had the privilege of  practicing law before.’’  While  Bill  Steger  was  studying  prelaw,  the Japanese bombed Pearl  Harbor on December 7, 1941. And within  24 hours the 21-year-old had withdrawn  from Baylor University  and  volunteered for service. The Dallas native  has always wanted the opportunity to  become a pilot, and with the Nation entering World War II, he took a chance.  On November  9,  1942, he got his  wings. Then after training he was sent  to Casablanca and flew 56 combat missions  for which he  received an air  medal and four oak leaf clusters.  While  later  training  other  pilots,  Captain Steger also tested the  first  U.S. jet airplanes.  Once his Nation was  secure, Bill  Steger went back to school and received his law degree from Southern  Methodist University, that is, their law  school.  He  married  his  wife,  Ann  Hollandsworth Steger, on Valentine’s  Day in 1948. They had one child, the  late Merritt Reed Steger, who was one  of my younger brother David’s closest  friends.  Judge Steger entered and engaged in  private practice in Longview and Tyler  and headed up numerous east Texas  campaign clubs for Dwight D. Eisenhower for President. After the election,  President Eisenhower appointed Judge  Steger in 1953 to the position of U.S.  attorney for East Texas at the young  age of 32.  In 1960, he and a good friend debated  which one should run for governor and  which one should run for senator. Their  goal was to bring the Republican party  into popularity in the State of Texas.  Because Texas was  conservative,  it  seemed to Judge Steger that it would  be a good fit, but he was blazing a trail.  He ended up being the one to run for  governor against a very popular John  Connally,  and  Judge Steger’s  good  friend John Tower ran for senator. The  Republican party had never before then  received enough votes to hold a primary, and though Judge Steger knew  he would not win the race, he hoped he  would get the requisite 200,000 votes so  the Republican party could hold a primary  in  the  next  election.  Judge  Steger actually  received more  than  600,000 votes.  In 1962, Judge Steger was persuaded  to run for Congress and received 49 percent of the vote,  lacking only 1,300  votes to beat his Democratic opponent  who was the incumbent.  Bill Steger became a Federal district  judge for the Eastern District of Texas  in December of 1970 after President  Richard Nixon  nominated  him. He  truly loved being a jurist, and he was a  hardworking, dedicated, cerebral, no-  nonsense,  constitutional  constructionist judge whose discerning intellect  could always cut straight to the heart  of any issue.  In 1987, Judge Steger assumed senior  active status duty, but since then still  continued to handle a full docket. December 1, 2005, marked 35 years on the  Federal bench for Judge Steger, and  since his appointment in 1970, he had  handled more than 15,000 cases.  Judge Steger received the Justinian  Award May 7, 2004, at the annual Tyler  Law Day luncheon for his community  service,  legal  ethics  and  professionalism.  He was a Baptist, a charter member  and a deacon of Green Acres Baptist  Church, helping to nurse it through its  early days of going from nonexistent to  its current 12,000 members. He was a  confidant for me, a friend and a wise  sounding board.  He and Ann endured the worst heartache a couple can face in the loss of  their only child, Reed, in a tragic scuba  diving accident, but  the manner  in  which Judge Steger dealt with such  devastation  and  allowed  his  faith,  God’s help, and Ann’s companionship  to help overcome the horrendous blow  will help inspire me the rest of my life.  Judge Steger was a heroic patriot; a  caring  father; a  loving husband; an  even-handed, clear-thinking, constitutionally  reverent  judge;  a  personal  mentor; and a cherished friend whom I  came to know through my brother 25 to  30 years ago.  Always having had the courage of his  convictions despite the odds against  him, Judge Steger was and is a profile  in courage whose memory will continue to inspire me the rest of my life.  God bless the Stegers and God bless  America.  f  DANIEL E. LUNGREN REMEMBERING NORMANDY  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  of  California).

1107,66,2006-06-06,Mr. ISAKSON.," Mr. President, I would  like to call everybody’s attention to  the special day that today is. Today is  the 6th day of June. Sixty-two years  ago today on the shores of France and  Normandy,  Omaha  Beach,  Sword  Beach, American  troops  and  allied  forces invaded France, pushed back the  German Army,  pushed  through  the  Battle of the Bulge, and ultimately  into Germany, and today, you and I  enjoy freedom and liberty in this country, as Europe enjoys its freedom, and  as, in fact, the world enjoys its freedom  because of what those brave men and  women did.  This past week, I had a unique occasion to travel with the chairman of the  Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Senator  CRAIG from Idaho, and with GEN Jack  Nicholson, who is the chairman of the  American Battle Monuments Commission. We traveled through Europe and  northern Africa paying Memorial Day  tributes to the men and women buried  on those foreign shores.  I have to tell my colleagues, it was a  life-altering experience for me. I am a  patriotic American. I love this country  more than anything on the face of this  Earth. I have teared up more than once  at the funeral of a friend who died in  the service of this country. But I have  never seen the outpouring of love and  respect for our country or for our servicemen than I saw in the Netherlands  or in Belgium or outside of Paris or at  Bellewood outside of Paris or in Tunisia at the American cemetery in northern Africa.  I think it is appropriate for us to memorialize today what those of us who  traveled on this trip saw to hopefully  inspire other Members of the Senate,  and hopefully every American at one  point in time in their life, to travel to  these marvelous memorials.  I have  been in elected office for most of the  last 30 years. I have done more Memorial Day ceremonies than one would  want to count. They have all been  beautiful, they have all been meaningful, but, quite  frankly, they usually  aren’t  very well  attended  because  Americans more often than not take  Memorial Day as a 3-day vacation or a  3-day weekend. But I would like to tell  you what the people of Margraten in  the Netherlands take Memorial Day as.  When we went to the American cemetery in the Netherlands and saw the  over 6,000 graves of the American men  and women who died in liberating the  Netherlands, we were moved. We were  more moved by the fact that every one  of those graves is adopted by a citizen  of the Netherlands who cares for that  grave, leaves flowers at that grave, and  attends the ceremonies on Memorial  Day,  the American Memorial Day,  which we conduct. On that day in the  Netherlands there were over 7,000 citizens—7,000 Dutch—who came  to pay  tribute to the men and women of the  United States of America who died on  their soil so they could be free. The  royal Dutch Air Force did a missing  man fly-over formation, and the senior  men’s choir of Holland sang ‘‘God Bless  America.’’ It was a moving scene unlike anything I have personally seen. It  renewed, for me, the faith and pride I  have  in all that  is good about the  United States of America.  Following that visit, we went to Normandy. We  saw  the monument  the  French had erected to the Rangers who  stormed  the  Normandy  cliffs  and  moved in and rooted out the Germans.  We went to Omaha Beach and saw firsthand where the American troops came  across, where  the  Canadian  troops  came across, where the British troops  came across. We saw where in one day  2,500 men of America died on the beaches of Normandy so that all of us today  can live in freedom and in hope and in  peace.  I commend Chairman CRAIGfor making this delegation. We found out we  were the first delegation that anyone  could remember to ever do what we  did. Not only do I hope we are not the  last, I hope it is an annual occasion  where Members of the Senate go and  pay their respects to the brave Americans who died in the great wars of Europe, World War I and World War II; for  without  them, we would not  enjoy  what we do today, nor would the world  enjoy the peace and the freedom and  the liberty that it treasures and it enjoys.  So on this day of June 6, 2006, 62  years after 2,500 Americans died and  tens of thousands of Americans pursued the German Army in France, I  know what I will do tonight when I say  my prayers. I will say a special prayer  for those folks I never knew but without whom I never could have lived the  life that I have, and I will say thanks.  I will repeat the pledge I made to myself on the cemetery of Normandy. I  said: Before I die, I am going to see to  it that my children and my grandchildren get to visit this scene and  have  this  experience  because  only  through the preservation of the memory of what those men fought and died  for will we as Americans ever be able  to continue to make the commitments  we have around the world to preserve  liberty, preserve democracy, and protect the people of the world’s right to  determine their own future and their  own peace and their own liberty.  So, Mr. President, on this day, June  6, 2006, I thank God for the men and  women of the U.S. military, for the  leadership of  the  20th century, and  pray that all of us will have the courage they had to continue to preserve  the liberty we all treasure and enjoy.

1116,73,2006-06-06,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President, the  final point I want to make—and I will  try to come back to the floor when I  have more time—is regarding the impact of this movement in the country  by the courts on religious  freedom.  There was an article written, which  was on the front cover of the Weekly  Standard, called ‘‘Banned in Boston,’’  where Maggie Gallagher talks about  Catholic Charities in Boston having to  get out of the adoption business because  they will not consent, under  their Catholic orthodox faith, to place  children into same-sex couple homes.  It is against the Catholic faith to do so.  There  is a very clear message  from  Rome that this is not proper behavior.  They were refused their license, and  now one of the longest standing adoption  agencies  in Massachusetts  no  longer places children  for adoption.  Why? Because all around  faith, all  around churches and parachurch organizations,  and missionary  organizations is, whether we like it or not, the  Government.  When the Government comes down  with things that are contrary to that  faith group there will be friction.  In fact, Mark Stern, who is a lawyer  for the American Jewish Committee, is  quoted as saying:  It is going to be a train wreck, a very dangerous train wreck.  So not only will this new right that  the court has established in the follow-  on—the right of same-sex marriage—  going to cause problems with democracy and problems with marriage, it is  going to create huge problems for our  faith-based organizations. It is something that we need to address. Thank  you.  ",2006

1123,73,2006-06-06,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I just returned from my State of Nevada. For  example, I did an event that received a  lot of attention dealing with gas prices.  Gas prices are so significant. Nevada  has the third highest gas prices in all  the country. Unfortunately, we have  been in second place on occasion. It is  not unusual to drive by a service station in Nevada and see the three different prices and the bottom one  is  $3.40. The average price last week was  $3.19 a gallon.  What are we doing on the Senate  floor today? No matter how a person  feels about the marriage amendment,  everyone knows it is not going to pass.  It is not going to come close to passing. We voted on this a short time ago  and got 48 votes. It takes 67 votes for a  constitutional amendment to begin the  process. This is not what the American  people want to talk about. All you  have to do is listen to the conservative  talk shows, the liberal talk shows, read  the newspapers, the liberal columnists,  the conservative columnists. With rare  exception, they say we are wasting the  taxpayers’ time doing this.  We have a war in Iraq going on. Are  we having a discussion on the war in  Iraq, where yesterday 80 Iraqis were  killed, 7 having their heads cut off and  put in a marketplace in baskets? Are  we talking about that? We have soldiers valiantly fighting every day over  there, Mr. President. We have been  struggling to get a supplemental appropriations bill completed. They need our  help.  In Nevada, like every other State in  the Union, we have hundreds of thousands of people who have no health insurance. The State of Nevada leads the  country in uninsured. The prescription  drug bill was passed dealing with Medicare. It has been a nightmare for seniors and a gift  for HMOs, pharmaceuticals,  and  insurance  companies.  When I was in college, I studied, among  other things, political science. I don’t  know why, but it stuck in my mind.  A  professor  named Harmon  Judd  said: Let me explain this Federal system. What it means is, you have a central whole  divided  among  self-governing parts. That was his definition.  What are those self-governing parts?  The  50  States;  originally Thirteen  Colonies, now 50 States. They are doing  a pretty good job. Almost 50 States  have either passed  laws or constitutional amendments dealing with marriage. Over the top of that, we have the  Defense of Marriage Act, which has  been attacked numerous times by people trying to knock it out. It has been  upheld by Federal courts three times,  which basically says—not basically—it  says a State does not have to give full  faith and credit  to another State’s  marriage laws. It is up to the State to  determine what the marriage law is.  That is what federalism is all about, as  set forth, among other places, in the  Defense of Marriage Act.

1127,94,2006-06-06,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I have  come to the  floor today to add my  voice to the rising chorus of people  both here in the Senate and back in my  home State of Iowa who are fed up with  the misplaced priorities of the Republican leadership in this Congress. Our  country  faces mounting  challenges:  High  energy  prices,  skyrocketing  health care costs, tens of millions of  Americans without health  insurance,  the  cost  of  college  tuition  going  through the roof, individuals with minimum wage jobs going nearly a decade  without a raise. So how does the leadership here  respond  to  these  challenges? By squandering a week of the  Senate’s  time  debating  a  constitutional marriage amendment that has  already been soundly rejected by the  Senate and by debating repeal of the  estate tax which would benefit only  about 3 out of every 1,000 people in  America at the most and would add $1  trillion to the deficit in the coming  years, so that the superrich can get yet  another tax break, a tax break that  won’t  build  one  additional  school,  would not provide one new additional  job, while working families get absolutely nothing.  Again, the great majority of American people are getting madder and  madder about this. All you have to do  is look at the polls of Congress.

1133,108,2006-06-06,Mr.  SESSIONS.," Mr. President,  I  would just say this: that we are at a  point in our history where it is now the  opportunity of this Senate to allow the  American people an opportunity  to  have their views heard on the question  of the definition of marriage. It has  been eroded by courts improperly, in  my view, but it is being eroded nevertheless. By voting  for this constitutional amendment, we will not make  any constitutional amendment become  a reality. We will simply send the matter to the States. And if three-fourths  of the State legislatures agree, only  then will this amendment become law.  Why would we want to deny the American people the right through their representatives to adopt this amendment?  I do not know, and I do not think we  should. I think we should support the  amendment.  How should the people properly respond to this real or perceived abuse  and,  in particular, to this very real  threat to traditional marriage?  The proper answer is for the people  to ask their elected representatives to  pass a constitutional amendment to fix  the problem, or the potential problem.  It is the right way, the lawful way,  for the people and the Congress to respond.  Amazingly, it has been suggested by  those who oppose the right of the people to have their voice heard on this  matter, that the Marriage Protection  Act  violates  the Constitution. How  silly is that? The Marriage Protection  Act would become a part of the Constitution. How could it violate the Constitution?  More importantly, the court rulings  that have created this crisis are themselves,  in my view and the view of  many, contrary to the Constitution.  Regardless of whether such rulings are  sound, the people have a right to have  their voice heard on the matter of marriage.  Some here argue that we should not  have an amendment that decides the  question here in the Senate but should  allow the States to do it. But, that is  the problem.  The States, and the people, are having  their  decisions  overturned  by  courts. On May 16, a Georgia  judge  struck down that State’s law that prohibits same-sex marriage. At least nine  States are facing similar lawsuits. And  if Lawrence is any indication, the U.S.  Supreme Court seems poised to make a  similar ruling.  This is why the American people are  rightly concerned and want us to do  something to stop this trend by the undemocratic branch of government from  altering marriage, a cornerstone of our  civilization.  Of course, if this Congress were to  pass the Marriage Protection Amendment, it does not then become law. It  then would go to the States where  three-fourths of the State legislatures  would have to agree, for it to become  part of our Constitution.  Thus, our vote today is the key step  in allowing the States to express the  will of their people.  Thus vote against the Marriage Protection Amendment by those who say  they oppose same-sex marriage, would  deny the States the authority they  need to protect their laws from judicial  activism.  Finally, some argue that marriage is  not an issue of such importance that it  should be placed in our Constitution or  even have debate time allotted to it.  They are wrong. This is a huge issue,  one of great importance. The real question  is, why deny the right of the  American people through their legislatures the right to vote on this issue?  What harm is there in letting the people speak? I suspect the real concern of  many is that if this amendment were  to get to the States, it would pass.  Those who openly or surreptitiously  favor same-sex marriage surely would  not want  the Marriage Protection  Amendment to go to the States.  And, there is nothing unusual about  constitutional amendments  that address specific problems.  We have passed amendments that are  quite specific as well as broad.  The 27th amendment, ratified May 27,  1992, provides that Congress can’t raise  the pay of members of the House or  Senate until the next election in the  House.  The 26th amendment, ratified July 1,  1971, provides that eighteen-year-olds  must be allowed to vote.  The 25th amendment, ratified February 10, 1967, provides for presidential  succession.  The 24th amendment, ratified January 23, 1964, abolished the poll tax.  To my mind, the Marriage Protection  Act is a wonderful way to allow the  American people to have their voices  heard on a matter that is very important to them and our Nation.  The courts have gotten  it wrong.  Wrong as a matter of law and wrong as  to policy. They are not higher beings.  They make mistakes and they need to  be held to account so that good law and  good policy are restored. A narrowly  drafted constitutional amendment that  deals with this one, single issue, is the  proper way to give legitimate voice to  our citizens.  The  traditional understanding and  law of marriage are being overturned.  The sounds of the conflict can be heard  in Lexington and in Omaha. Why stand  we here idle? Let’s authorize the Marriage Protection Amendment to go to  the States so the people’s will may be  accomplished. After all, our founders  created a democracy, not an oligarchy.  I yield the floor.

1136,108,2006-06-06,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. President, my  friend from Alabama has just called for  the Senate to vote and the House to  vote, two-thirds majorities to vote to  send  to  the States  the question of  whether or not our U.S. Constitution  should be amended with  respect  to  marriage being only between a man  and a woman. Actually, in my State  and in 45 other States around the country, we have had the opportunity to debate this issue, to consider this issue,  and to pass laws with respect to marriage as between a man and a woman.  Personally, I believe that it is. As  Governor of Delaware, a number of  years ago I signed into law the Defense  of Marriage Act in my State that says  marriage is something that occurs between a man and a woman. Not only  did I sign that law, but I supported the  Federal law which was enacted here,  signed by  former President Clinton,  which said States  like my own and  those other 45 States, to the extent  that we define marriage as being between a man and a woman, our State  law, respective State laws, cannot be  violated by the actions of some other  State.  I will give an example. If we have a  same-sex couple in Delaware who decide to go to another country or another place where same-sex marriages  are allowed, and then that same-sex  couple comes back to Delaware and  claims they are married, they are not  married in my State. It is not a marriage that we recognize. In fact, for the  over  200 years  that we have  been  around as a country, States such as  Delaware or California or Georgia or  Alabama or Kansas have set the rules  for marriage. We don’t say to the Federal Government: You determine who  can get married, at what age people  can get married, or what kind of waiting period there has to be, or can first  cousins marry or second cousins; we  don’t say what the rules of the road are  with respect to divorce, with respect to  alimony, with respect to child support.  For over 200 years we have left those  issues to the States.  Today we have said very clearly in  my own State, marriage is between a  man and a woman, a view that is reflected in almost all of the other States  in this country.  If we get to the point where our ability to maintain that position in my  State or in the other 45 States that  have adopted similar laws, where those  laws are threatened or basically rendered ineffective, then I think the idea  of visiting a constitutional amendment  is something we may want to do.

1137,122,2006-06-06,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce  legislation  that  seeks  to  meet the mental health needs of children and adolescents.  I believe that the task of ensuring  the emotional well-being and resiliency  of our young people  is one of paramount importance. We all know that  mental health is a critical component  contributing to a child’s general health  and ability to grow—both intellectually and physically. Yet, the task of  ensuring the mental health of children  and adolescents is not an easy one. In  fact, it is arguably one of the most difficult and largely unspoken tasks facing our Nation today.  According to the Substance Abuse  and Mental Health Services Administration, one in ten children and adolescents suffers from mental health disorders serious enough to cause some  level  of  impairment. Out  of  these  young people, only one in five receives  the specialty mental health services  they require.  These startling statistics prompted  former Surgeon General Dr. David  Satcher to convene a conference in 1999  that examined the mental health needs  of children. The conference—composed  of some of the Nation’s leading experts  in mental and public health—published  a seminal report that concluded that  ‘‘ . . . the burden of suffering experienced by children with mental illness  and their families has created a health  crisis in this country.’’ The report further  concluded  that  ‘‘. . .  there  is  broad evidence that the Nation lacks a  unified infrastructure to help children  suffering from mental illness.’’  I would  like  to  submit  for  the  RECORDpersonal testimony offered by  three families in Connecticut. I believe  their words and experiences speak most  directly to the ‘‘burden of suffering’’  described in Surgeon General Satcher’s  report—a burden endured by millions  of children, adolescents, and then families nationwide. I ask unanimous consent that this testimony be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  TESTIMONY  DEARSENATORDODD, I wanted to take a  moment to share with you what my experience has been navigating services for my son  who has been diagnosed with severe psychosis and bipolar disorder. Due to the lack  of psychiatric services when the extended  day program my son attended was closed  down, my son as well as seven other kids  where left without the services they so needed. After a couple of weeks they started to  have meltdowns. My son was one of them.  The  fact  that he attended a  therapeutic  school didn’t at this point make a difference.  After two short hospitalizations (one was for  two weeks the other four weeks) my son, who  is 12 years old, has been sitting at [a mental  health services facility] for the past 9 weeks  awaiting availability for sub-acute care. In  the meantime he is not receiving the level of  care that he needs.  Services are so limited at this point in  time that because of time of delivery children who may have benefitted from less intensive intervention are being put in a position where by the time they receive care  they are in need of higher level care that to  me doesn’t seem very cost effective when  you look at long term care. I often think  about what would be different if my child  was diabetic. Would he only receive services  when available, and would they be appropriate to his medical needs?  I can’t explain in one letter what my son’s  illness has done to our family and how difficult it is for all of us. Mental Health is a  cruel monster who enters your life in sometimes undetected ways and when it finally  attacks the blow can be fatal. The media has  succeeded in painting a picture of individuals like my son as real dangers to society if  not in proper treatment but what they have  failed to shed light on is the lack of such  services. My son deserves a better quality of  services as well as a better quality of life.  DEARSENATORDODD, The following is to  share some of what my family is struggling  with due to my son’s mental illness. My son  has been diagnosed with severe depression  and mood disorder; he has mutilated himself  various times and is a cutter. [My son] has  been hospitalized three times due to this ongoing behavior; he is in need of sub-acute  treatment but has only received stabilization services and out-patient services because the level of treatment that he needs is  not available for boys 14 years or older. In  the meantime we have extended day programs, voluntary services as well as systems  of care in place yet the services he needs are  not available. For a mother with three additional children with special needs I have serious concerns for my son’s safety. Who will  be accountable if at some point my son succeeds in taking his own life when I have  seeked services and I am told over and over  again that they are not available?  I really would like Congress to take a look  at the great deal of families fighting our own  personal battles with these unseen enemies.

After 51 years of dedicated service, Joe DiMenna will retire from his  distinguished career in education.  I have often spoken of our Nation’s need for  talented, creative educators ready to help our  children  learn and grow. Joe DiMenna has  been  just  that kind of  teacher and administrator. After receiving a Bachelor’s Degree in  education  from Western Connecticut State  University, Mr. DiMenna began his  teaching  career at  the Eli Whitney School where he  taught  fourth grade. During his  time as a  teacher, he taught at a variety of levels as well  as  teaching Americanization  and  summer  school in Bridgeport. Upon being awarded a  National Science Fellowship  in Geology and  Astronomy, he spent a summer in class and  field  study  at  the Delaware Water Gap.  Through his unique dedication  to education,  both  for  his  students  and  himself,  Joe  DiMenna exemplified all that we look for in a  teacher.  After further pursuing his studies at the University of Connecticut and Southern Connecticut State University, Mr. DiMenna  received his masters and sixth year degrees  from Fairfield University. He would first serve  as principal of  the old Honeyspot School  in  Stratford where he oversaw the construction of  the new Honeyspot School. On moving day,  he  joined with his students as  they carried  their desks from the old building to the new.  Upon leaving Honeyspot, he would go on to  serve as principal at Eli Whitney School,  Chapel Street School, and Second Hill Lane  School. Over the course of his 51-year career,  Joe DiMenna has served with both  integrity  and distinction, earning him the respect of faculty, administrators, and Board of Education  members. His dedication, commitment, and  energy has touched the lives of thousands of  our young people, helping to shape not only  the  foundation of  their education but  their  character as well. We, as a community, owe  Joe DiMenna a great debt of gratitude for all  of his good work.  I am proud to stand today to join his wife of  47  years, Frances,  their  two  sons,  three  grandchildren, family, friends, colleagues and  community members  in extending my very  best wishes to Joseph DiMenna as he celebrates his retirement.  I understand  that Joe  and Frances plan to travel more extensively,  opening new opportunities  for  learning and  teaching. My very best wishes  to  them  for  many more years of health and happiness.  HON. SAM FARR  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 6, 2006  ",2006
1158,143,2006-06-06,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor Jennifer Tobias and Stanford University’s Green Dorm team for winning the Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  2006  P3  award.  Tobias and her colleagues designed a sustainable  facility  for  research, housing, and  community  space. The building  forges  together practical functionality while eliminating  carbon emissions, closing the water cycle, and  optimizing material resources.  This  national  competition,  sponsored  by  EPA’s Office of Research and Development,  enables college students to research, develop  and design scientific, technical, and policy solutions  to sustainability challenges. Sustainable solutions are environmentally friendly, efficiently use natural resources and are economically competitive. The P3 award includes  funding up to $75,000 that gives the students  an opportunity to further develop their designs  and move them to the marketplace.  I commend Jennifer and her colleagues for  their  innovative project design, and  I hope  they continue their important research and development on sustainable solutions to human  endeavors. Jennifer and her colleagues are  role-models who demonstrate  that environmental  and  economical  interests  can  be  brought together in tomorrow’s designs.  f  CELEBRATING  THE  140TH  ANNIVERSARY OF THE SANTA BARBARA SCHOOL DISTRICTS  HON. LOIS CAPPS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 6, 2006  ",2006
1159,143,2006-06-06,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  honor the Santa Barbara School Districts as  we celebrate  the 140th anniversary of  their  founding on June 6, 1866.  Santa Barbara’s educational tradition is one  of the oldest in the state. This tradition is rooted in the 18th century Spanish era where historical records indicate that in 1795 Santa Barbara had the second school in Alta, California  (San Jose had  the  first, which was opened  one year earlier). Santa Barbara’s first school  was located at the Presidio where the teacher  was paid $125 per year, with each soldier of  the Presidio paying a tribute of one dollar toward the teacher’s salary.  When  the Santa Barbara School District  was  formed  in 1866, County Superintendent  Alpheus B. Thompson  reported  that  there  were three school districts in Santa Barbara  County: San Buenaventura, Montecito and  Santa Barbara. By 1866,  the schools had  moved from county control to control by the  electorate of the city.  The three school districts had two schools  each and  together  there were a  total of six  teachers. By 1867, the three districts served  340 students, with 243 of them in the Santa  Barbara district. The average salary  in  the  county was $70 per month for male teachers  and $62 per month for female teachers and  the length of the school year varied from 3 to  5 months.  In 1870 a new school house was built on  Cota Street and the first playground was established  in  the city. The playground was  turned over to the school by the city council  after  the school  trustees agreed  to plant at  least 20 shade trees and care for their growth.  Voters decided, in April of 1870, to impose a  tax to construct Lincoln School. In 1884, Eugene Fawcett sold a tract of land to the school  district for the construction of Franklin School.  The school district paid $1,000 for the property  where Parma School is located.  As a former school nurse in the Santa Barbara school district, I am absolutely delighted  to celebrate  the 140 years of strong public  education that the district has provided. I am  proud of the district for its vision and dedication to quality over the years and I look forward to the continued success of the district  and  its many programs. Congratulations on  140 years well done!  f  TALL AFAR MAYOR AND TROOP  BRAVERY  HON. GINNY BROWN-WAITE  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 6, 2006  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr.  Speaker, I rise this evening to commend one  of the bravest acts of personal courage that I  have seen in many years.  In the face of deadly car bombings, suicide  attacks and assassination attempts, there are  some Iraqi leaders who are willing to tell the  truth about  the successes of our American  troops in Iraq and to share the stories of their  generosity and courage.  Earlier this month, one of my constituents  named Roger Hattersley sent me a letter written by the mayor of Tall Afar, Iraq. Roger’s  son is an enlisted soldier serving in Iraq as  part of  the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment,  and had sent his father a copy of this letter.  Having personally visited Tall Afar just this  winter on a CODEL with the Government Reform Committee, I was very interested to read  what the mayor had to say.  Mr. Speaker, I am going to read the letter  here on the House floor so that all Americans  can hear the bravery and courage of Mayor  Najim Abdullah Abid Al-Jibouri and also  the  good works of our young men and women in  uniform.  To the courageous men and women of the  3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, who have  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

1160,150,2006-06-06,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  pay tribute to Herman E. Warsh, and to honor  his life of dedicated service to his community  and to his country.  Born on March 28, 1924 in Calgary, Canada  to  Samuel  Warshovsky  and  Rebecca  Wietstinietski, originally of Poland, he emigrated with his parents, his sister and his  brother to the United States in 1925. The family made a home  in Los Angeles, California  and Herman attended public school until the  10th grade. In 1941, he married Lorraine Rack  and in 1942, enlisted in the Navy and served  in the South Pacific through 1945.  Upon his return, he passed the GED and in  only two years he received his BA while working full time. He went on to earn his Masters  degree in history at UCLA while working as a  teaching assistant and continued his education  by working on  three doctorates, eventually  earning his PhD  in Education  from Wayne  State University  in  1969. Herman Warsh  taught from 1952–1965, serving in many different capacities. He also taught at the college  level at USC, the University of Hawaii at Hilo  and at  the University of Michigan  in Ann  Arbor.  Mr. Warsh also taught literacy to the U.S.  troops in Germany, to First Nations’ peoples in  Alaska and to incarcerated men in the California penal system. Following the awarding of  his doctorate, he was recruited to be the Director of Educational Programs  for  the Mott  Program in the Flint Public School System. In  1974, he became head of the Department of  Elementary Education at the University of New  Mexico. In 1977, he moved to Santa Barbara  to work with and,  in 1980,  to wed Maryann  Mott. Together they devoted the bulk of their  philanthropic efforts to their two family foundations, C.S. Fund and Warsh Mott Legacy.  In addition  to  financial resources, Herman  Warsh gave selflessly of his time, serving on  the Board of the Fund for Santa Barbara and  of Pacifica Graduate  Institute. Nationally, he  served as Chair of the Environmental Policy  Institute, which under his leadership, merged  with Oceanic Society and Friends of the Earth  USA, to become a key progressive, national  environmental institution.  I am honored to recognize the life and work  of Herman E. Warsh and I believe, as many  do, that Santa Barbara is a better place for  having him a part of this community.  f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO MILITARY  ACADEMY APPOINTEES  HON. THOMAS G.

I would also  like  to  take  this  time  to  congratulate Christine Jaszlics of Lakewood  High School and Jeffrey Hathcote of Grandview High School on their appointment to the  United States Merchant Marine Academy, as  well  as  Madison  Stumpp  and  Richard  Shreffler, both of Eaglecrest High School, on  achieving appointments  to  the United States  Naval Academy. Finally, I would also like to  extend my hearty congratulations to Matthew  Bezzant of Columbine High School, Kyle Black  of Thunder Ridge High School, Meghan Booze  of Columbine High School, Daniel Hann of Dakota Ridge High School, Brock Logan of  Arapahoe High school, Millie Mays of Douglas  County High School, Trenton West of Grandview High School and Kelsey Yip of Dakota  Ridge High School on  their appointments  to  the United States Air Force Academy.  These young men and women have exhibited tremendous commitment and dedication in  making  it  through  the  rigorous nomination  process and I wish them all the best in their  future endeavors as they embark on their careers with  the United States Military. They  have excelled both  in and out of  the classroom, and I have no doubt they will represent  Colorado with distinction at these prestigious  academies.  f  HONORING KEN HAAS OF HAYS,  KANSAS  HON. JERRY MORAN  OFKANSAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 6, 2006  ",2006
1162,150,2006-06-06,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Ken Haas of Hays, Kansas for  his years of service to this community through  his diverse career in education.  Mr. Haas began teaching in 1964 at Kennedy Middle School as an industrial arts and  physical education  instructor. He also  influenced countless students by serving as  the  school’s guidance counselor. In 1999, after 35  years of work in the Hays school district, Ken  was approached by Father Mike Scully and  asked  to assume  the  role as principal of  Thomas More Prep-Marian High School, a private Christian high school in the Catholic tradition.  Ken was nearing the point of possible retirement in his current position and awaiting him  was  the well-deserved  free  time  that one  earns after working so long in a challenging  vocation. After a weekend of prayer and consideration, Ken decided that it was the Lord’s  desire for him to accept the position.  That was 7 years ago. After improving the  school’s  leadership structure, balancing  the  school’s budget, and sustaining enrollment,  Mr. Haas has chosen to retire from his current  position. Even in retirement Ken plans to be  involved where  he’s  needed  around  the  school.  Mr. Haas is a committed professional who is  well-regarded among his peers and students.  He  is known  for attending athletic events,  even the ones that don’t generate the largest  crowds. He still surprises many former pupils  with his unique ability to greet them by name  after not seeing them for many years. Just another sign of how much he cares.  Mr. Haas has served Hays students and  their parents well for over 40 years, and that  is why Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor him today.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  CITY  OF  LIGHTHOUSE POINT  HON.

1163,150,2006-06-06,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the wonderful  city of Lighthouse Point, Florida. I am proud to  have represented the residents of this city for  the 26 years I have served in Congress.  Incorporated on June 13, 1956, Lighthouse  Point derived its name from its location under  the beam of the famed Hillsboro Lighthouse.  Armed with a petition signed by over 100 residents favoring incorporation, community leaders traveled to Tallahassee to seek approval.  Story has  it  that 77 names on  the petition  were Republicans and they were required to  re-register before incorporation approval would  be given by the State’s Democrat leaders. All  77 agreed to re-register as Independents and  the incorporation of Lighthouse Point was approved.  In 1956, approximately 150 people resided  in the newly incorporated area. Most of these  residents had grown up in other parts of the  country during the 1920s and 1930s and many  had served in WWII. What had originally been  farm land was now a network of canals and  residential lots providing residents with waterfront living and easy access to the Intracoastal  Waterway and the ocean beyond. It was an  idyllic place  to make a new  life  for yourself  and your  family.  In 1956, Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected President and Leroy Collins was elected Governor of Florida, both for  second terms; a first class postage stamp was  three cents and Elvis Presley’s  ‘‘Don’t Be  Cruel’’ was the number-one record.  Today, Lighthouse Point is a thriving community of approximately 10,767 residents.  It  has moved from services provided by volunteers to a full service city with its own police,  fire, and public works departments. Although it  has grown dramatically, as has all of South  Florida, it has retained its feeling of a small  town community. Eighteen miles of canals,  parks and numerous recreational activities and  special annual events such as Keeper Days  and Lighthouse ‘‘A’’ Glow all contribute to the  hometown  feel of Lighthouse Point.  It continues to maintain its heritage and its standard  of striving  to be  the best place  to  live and  raise a family.  Mr. Speaker, Lighthouse Point is a jewel in  the landscape of South Florida. I am honored  to represent the city and her residents in the  U.S. House of Representatives.  I am also  pleased to take this opportunity to recognize  and congratulate Lighthouse Point on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.

1164,157,2006-06-06,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the  Senate Republican leadership renewed debate  on whether  the Constitution of  the United  States should  limit marriage and any civil  union to one man and one woman.  It is distressing to me that we live in an age  in which we still must fight to protect our civil  rights as Americans,  in which a hate crime  perpetrated against someone based their sexual orientation can go unpunished, and  in  which discrimination is being written into our  laws.  If this amendment were to pass, we would  rewrite discrimination into the Constitution, a  practice I thought we had done away with in  1868,  when  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  erased  the Constitution’s  reference  to  ‘‘the  whole number of free persons.’’ It appears that  some would condemn us to repeating history.  The only saving grace for this measure is  that it is doomed to failure, and the President  knows that. This amendment is being considered merely to throw red meat at conservative  voters in an election year. Just over a month  before the 2004 election, when his poll numbers were slipping,  the President stated his  support  for  this discriminatory measure. He  knew the amendment could not pass in Congress and that there was minimal public support for it. Republicans moved this discriminatory bill for the sole purpose of dividing voters  and inciting anti-gay sentiment in a hotly-contested election year.  Two years later, the Republicans are drowning in corruption and losing public support on  a mass scale. The White House wants to drive  its conservative base  to  the polls and has  asked the Senate Majority Leader to bring this  issue before the full Senate. Make no mistake  about it, we will win this fight again.  Then, hopefully we can turn to the issues  that  the American people want  the government to address. We have yet to investigate  the Administration’s  failed policy  in  Iraq  that  has led to the deaths of over 2,000 American  soldiers. We need  to know why  there has  been a steep rise in gas prices during a time  of record oil industry profits. We need to craft  a prescription drug bill for seniors that works  instead of keeping one that confuses seniors  and rewards large pharmaceutical companies.  We need to stop borrowing money from foreign countries, cease deficit spending, and return our economy  to  the surpluses  it had  under President Clinton.  With so many critical issues that need the  immediate attention of the Congress, Republicans need to reevaluate their priorities. It is  my hope that in the coming months we can  focus our energies on  the many  important  issues facing our country rather than on divisive and unproductive distractions.  f  HONORING THE GREEN ALBANY  PROJECT  HON. BARBARA LEE  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 6, 2006  ",2006
1165,157,2006-06-06,Ms. LEE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the Green Albany Project, which, in partnership with the Albany Chamber of Commerce,  the City of Albany, Alameda County Waste  Management, and Stopwaste.org has  successfully completed its goal of ‘‘greening’’ the  small business district  in Albany, California,  making it the first project in the nation in which  a chamber of commerce has taken the lead in  an effort such as this.  The Green Albany Project was launched on  Earth Day 2005 as a collaborative effort of the  Albany Chamber of Commerce, the City of Albany, and Stopwaste.org under the leadership  of James Carter. Upon receipt of a grant from  Stopwaste.org, the Albany Green Team was  assembled, comprised mostly of  local youth  from Albany High School and the surrounding  community. The Albany Green  team  then  began a yearlong outreach effort, working to  contact and educate local business owners on  the economic and environmental benefits of  going green.  With  the help of Stopwaste.org, Alameda  County Waste Management, Alameda County  Board of Supervisors President Keith Carson,  and in collaboration with Smartlights, East Bay  MUD, and other programs, the Albany Green  Team has  succeeded  in helping 26 businesses in Albany, which is most of the local  small business district,  to green  their operations and in turn, green our community. In so  doing, the Green Albany Project has successfully diverted 150  tons of solid waste  from  landfills  through  its  work  to  implement  composting practices at local businesses, and  it is projected that an additional 290 tons will  be diverted in the year to come.  The Green Albany Project celebrates  this  success only one year after  its  launch, and  furthermore, having achieved  its objectives  under budget, will be returning money to the  county for use in propelling other worthwhile  projects forward.  In addition, this project would not have been  possible without the support of the small business owners in Albany, who are a crucial driving force behind our local and regional economies, and who have provided an  immeasurable service  to  the community by  implementing  these new green systems with  the  help of the Albany Green Team.  The Green Albany Project is an outstanding  example of steps  that our communities can  take to address the national and global challenge of developing sustainable practices in a  time of diminishing natural resources.  The Green Albany Project has not only  made history as the first project of its kind to  be completed  in our country, but has demonstrated  to businesses  throughout California’s 9th Congressional District and across our  country that going green is not only possible  but profitable.  On behalf of the residents of California’s 9th  U.S. Congressional District, I join the Albany  community on this 5th day of June, 2006 in  saluting and thanking the Albany Green Team,  the Albany Chamber of Commerce, the City of  Albany,  Stopwaste.org,  Alameda  County  Waste Management,  the Albany small businesses  that have made  the decision  to go  green, and all  the other partners who have  made  the Green Albany Project a success.  Their work has contributed  immeasurably  to  California’s 9th Congressional District, to the  entire Bay Area and to our country, and represents an important step forward in the international effort to establish environmentally and  economically sustainable ways of living here in  our community and around the world.  f  IN HONOR OF THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DELAWARE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION  HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE  OFDELAWARE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 6, 2006  ",2006
1166,157,2006-06-06,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to the Delaware Community Foundation as it celebrates its 20th anniversary of  unparalleled service to the State. The Foundation was created in 1986 to provide a lasting  source of charitable funding by enabling donors and organizations  to effectively support  the causes that matter most to Delaware’s citizens.  In  the publication of  its  first newsletter  in  1990,  the Foundation noted  that  through  its  first grant making program it awarded roughly  $60,000 in grants to six agencies for use in  addressing homelessness. Other inaugural accomplishments included the creation of 8 new  charitable funds, and a total fund balance of  just over $6 million. Today,  the Foundation  manages nearly 600 charitable  funds, gives  from a total asset balance of more than $200  million, and has awarded more than $54 million in grants in its short 20-year history. This  exceptional growth stands as a testament to  the  important work done by  the Delaware  Community Foundation and how much  it  is  truly needed.  Through  its strong community  leadership,  and  both  competitive  and  non-competitive  grant programs, the Foundation is now able to  adapt to the needs of the community as they  emerge and evolve.

1167,3,2006-06-15,Ms. SOLIS.," Mr. Speaker, next week  the House will have its first vote to increase the minimum wage in over 10  years. This is good news for the more  than 7 million hardworking Americans  who today only make $5.15 an hour. It  could also be good news for millions of  middle class workers who could see  their hourly wage increase as a result  of the higher minimum wage.  Despite repeated efforts by the House  Democrats to expand economic opportunity for millions of Americans over  the last 9 years, the House Republican  leadership has  refused  to allow  the  floor vote on increasing the minimum  wage. Next week they have no choice,  however. Thanks  to  action  in  the  House Appropriations Committee on  Wednesday,  the committee voted  to  gradually increase the minimum wage  from $5.15 to $7.25.  The American people should not be  surprised that the out-of-touch House  Republican leadership is also voicing  strong opposition to the wage hike and  vows to kill it next week. This would  be shameful, and millions of Americans  will be affected. They need to have a  living wage.  I look forward to the vote next week  and hope that the House will finally  take action in a new direction to expand economic opportunity for all.  f  POLITICAL PROGRESS CONTINUES  IN IRAQ  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, in only 3 years, the world has  watched the nation of Iraq transform  from a brutal dictatorship to a promising  democracy.  Saddam’s  torture  chambers and mass graves have been  replaced  with  democracy’s  voting  booths and legislative referendums.  Today Iraqi citizens are working tirelessly to secure their freedoms. By participating in the election of the transitional assembly in January of 2005, the  drafting of an approval of the Constitution by October and the national elections  in December,  they have demonstrated that they refuse to allow terrorists to determine the fate of their  country. Last month, Iraqis achieved  another historic victory when they announced their new unity government.  EXPANDING  OPPORTUNITY  TO  MILLIONS OF AMERICANS BY INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2006
1168,3,2006-06-15,Ms. LEE.," Mr. Speaker, next week the  House will finally have an opportunity  to lift millions of hardworking Americans out of poverty. For the first time  in a decade, we will have a vote on the  House floor to increase the minimum  wage so that 7 million Americans can  finally make a  living wage. I think  most Americans, quite frankly, would  be stunned to hear that the House Republican  leadership  has  refused  to  allow a vote to increase the minimum  wage for over 10 years now.  Republican inaction has led to the  fact that the minimum wage is at its  lowest level in 50 years. In fact, if the  minimum wage had just kept up with  inflation since 1968, it would have been  $8.88 in 2005. That is still, quite frankly, a pittance for what people need to  live.  House Democrats are committed to  expanding  economic  opportunity  to  millions of Americans who are just trying to make a living wage. They want  to provide a better tomorrow for their  families. A majority of the House Appropriations Committee defied Republican leadership earlier this week and  supported an increase in the minimum  wage to $7.25. That is only fair.  Seven million Americans deserve a  minimum wage, an increase in the minimum wage, so let us make sure they  get it.  f  HONORING C.J. FOUTS  (Mr. GINGREY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1169,3,2006-06-15,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in memory of C.J. Fouts, a businessman and community leader in the  city of Smyrna, Georgia, in my district. Mr. Fouts passed away this week,  leaving behind his wife, Betty, three  children,  eight  grandchildren,  four  great-grandchildren, and a community  full of grateful citizens.  Mr. Fouts captured the essence of the  American  dream, Mr.  Speaker. He  came to Smyrna at age 18 from rural  Georgia in search of work. He started  his own business, a service station that  later grew into a sales shop for cars,  trucks and equipment.  Mr. Fouts gave his time, energy and  passion to the Smyrna business community. He has the distinction of possessing the longest active business license in the city of Smyrna, 54 years.  Just a few weeks ago the city honored  him with a plaque commemorating him  as a founding member of the Downtown  Development  Authority.  I  am  so  thankful to have been in attendance.  Mr. Speaker, our communities are  blessed with men like C.J. Fouts. Their  work ethic boosts our economy, and  their determination allows our towns  and our cities to flourish. Smyrna, indeed, and the State of Georgia, lost a  great man this week, but his work and  vision live on throughout the city.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to  join me  in honoring Mr.  Fouts’ memory.  f  THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  DEBATE ON THE GLOBAL WAR  ON TERROR  (Ms. KILPATRICK of Michigan asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute.)

Beginning  around noon this afternoon, the House  will debate for 10 hours the Iraq war.  The question will be should we continue on  the course  that President  Bush and the administration has set or  should we have a new plan? We will  have 10 hours of debate.  Consider, over 2,500 young men and  women killed, over  30,000 amputees,  blinded and the like, hundreds of thousands who will have mental health deficiencies when they return. Retired generals have spoken. We need a new direction. The  troops  should be  redeployed. They should be brought home  at the most practical time with a plan  that we don’t now have under this administration.  So, America, listen and look. Should  we stay the course, or should we have  a plan of redeployment to protect our  troops and to protect America?  f  DEBATING THE GLOBAL WAR ON  TERRORISM  IN THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)

1175,10,2006-06-15,Mr. PUTNAM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of American efforts to  rid the world of terrorism and help democracy take root  in a region  long  controlled  by hostile  dictators  and  murderous regimes.  All around the world we are working  to eradicate terrorists and their organizations. Iraq has emerged as a central battlefield of this war, a battlefield where Saddam was captured in a  hole and is now in jail, where Zarqawi  met his demise, and where insurgents  and jihadists are fighting and losing to  the might and skill of coalition forces.  Most importantly, it is a battlefield  far, far from the shores, schools, neighborhoods, and cities of America.  b1115  I recently traveled to Iraq with our  Speaker and was able to meet with the  Prime Minister and other key government officials, as well as our U.S. commanders overseeing the operations. I  was impressed by what I saw, but I was  more impressed by what I heard from  the servicemen and women themselves.  Morale is high, and they are confident  in the success of this mission.  Iraqi citizens have embraced freedom  and have now voted in three national  elections, each garnering wider and  broader support. Iraq now has a constitution, a parliament, a president, a  prime minister and a fully formed cabinet. What is more, this new government reflects a broad ethic and sectarian balance, a balance that will help  ensure  the needs and voices of all  Iraqis are represented.  Ultimately, it is that freely elected  government that is the most important  success of this effort, elected leaders  who are Iraqi first, and all other identities second, interested, invested in the  future of their own country, of their  own people. These Iraqi founding fathers face great challenges, no doubt.  But what opportunity is more powerful  than freedom from tyranny?  We must remain committed through  patience and hard work to help this  new government succeed.  I support this resolution. I support  the rule that is allowing this resolution to come forward and the manner  in which it was created. And I urge my  colleagues to join us in passing this important affirmation of the hard work of  America’s servicemen and women.  ",2006
1176,10,2006-06-15,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, let me  yield myself 10 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, let me correct something that has been said on this floor.  In the testimony before the Rules Committee, the Democrats not only asked  for an open rule, we asked for a substitute. We were denied that. We were  shut out. It is here in black and white  in the testimony.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT).  ",2006
1177,10,2006-06-15,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, this war  was  launched without an  imminent  threat to our  families. It endangers  them more every day, creating new  generations  of  terrorists.  Radical  ‘‘know it all’’ ideologues here in Washington  bent  facts,  distorted  intelligence, and perpetrated lies designed  to mislead the American people into  believing that a third rate thug had a  hand in the 9/11 tragedy and was soon  to unleash a mushroom cloud.  From  the  start, House Democrats  overwhelmingly voted against this war.  But radical ideologues rushed headlong  anyway, ignoring professional military  advice about the number of troops and  equipment needed. One general after  another has indicted this Administration  for  its misjudgment  and mismanagement.  But now, almost 3,000 Americans lie  dead, with about another 20,000 seriously injured. Every day, every single  day, American taxpayers are forced to  spend $229 million in Iraq, and they pay  again every time they go to the gas  pump. All that is in sight is an endless,  civil war quagmire.  Today’s resolution pins these Administration failures on the coattails of  our courageous servicemen and women.  Administration ineptness is falsely attached to a resolution honoring our  troops.  Americans are increasingly realizing  there  is a better way to honor our  troops than by sending more of them  off to be killed. Would that there were  more than a little of our troops’ courage  right here  in Washington  from  those, who refuse to challenge this Administration’s  arrogant, myth-based  policies and who choose instead to cut  and run from their responsibilities.  Instead of  staying  the course, we  need to chart a smarter course. It is  not weakness or retreat to recognize  the Administration offers us only an  endless ‘‘spend and bleed’’ policy.  When this talkathon ends, reject this  fraudulent resolution, which cannot be  amended or changed, to alter this Administration’s  deadly  pursuit  of  a  desert mirage. Neither paper resolutions, nor more Administration arrogance will defeat terrorism.  The harm from this Administration’s  disastrous decision to invade Iraq was  apparent  from  the  beginning.  The  warnings of many, as noted  in my  speeches, including those given on the  floor on September 22, 2002 (H6410), October 9, 2002 (H7328), and October 10,  2002 (H7772), and the contemporaneous  editorial below, went unheeded.  [From the Austin American-Statesman, Oct.  13, 2002]  OURVOICESMUSTWORKTOAVERTAN  INVASION  (By Rep. Lloyd Doggett, U.S. House of  Representatives)  I recently voted against what is really an  authorization for launching a massive land  invasion and military occupation of Iraq.  More  important  than  speaking with one  voice, the votes of 133 Congress members  against this rush to war underscored the importance of our continuing to speak as one  democracy.  I sought to give voice to the thousands of  Central Texans who  communicated  their  concerns about making the terrible weapon  of war a predominant instrument in our foreign policy.  With this grave decision on war and peace  though, I knew I would have to answer to  more than those  I am privileged to represent—I would have to answer to myself,  my children and to history.  War now would only increase the danger to  American  families.  The  house-to-house  urban combat that would likely result from  a land invasion in Iraq would kill thousands,  divert precious resources from our ongoing  war on terrorism and expose our families to  more terrorism from among the many who  would perceive this as a crusade against  Islam. From the  information provided to  Congress, I do have some insight into issues  about which so many are understandably uncertain and fearful. No evidence has been  shared to connect Iraq to the Sept. 11 tragedy, nor to show that Iraq now poses an imminent threat to American families.  As former National Security Adviser Brent  Scowcroft said, ‘‘Saddam Hussein is probably  on Osama bin Laden’s hit list.’’ From Central Intelligence Agency reports, secret until  last week, we know that the unfinished job  of overcoming al Qaida represents the real  threat. The CIA concluded that invading Iraq  is more likely to drive our now separate enemies  together against us and  certainly  more likely to make Saddam Hussein use  any weapons of mass destruction that he  may possess.  In addition to the cost in lives, the costs of  war, to differing degrees, will touch us all.  President Bush’s top economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, estimated that the cost of  waging this war may rise as high as $200 billion.

1178,24,2006-06-15,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I believe we send them  a message when we vote on the armed  services bill. Very  few people voted  against it. I believe we voted, in the defense subcommittee of appropriations,  only 15 or 16 people voted against it.  But Theodore Roosevelt said, ‘‘If you  disagree with a policy and you do not  say anything, you are actually treasonous.’’  I disagree with the policy. I do not  disagree with supporting the troops.  There  is no one  that  supports  the  troops better than the Members of this  Congress. And that is shown by the few  people that vote against the bill.  One other thing: I think the gentleman made a mistake when he said  we are for the war, against the war on  terror. We are actually fighting for the  war on terror is what we are doing. But  I appreciate what the gentleman is saying.  I appreciate the fact that he and I  both asked  for more  troops at one  point. He was the lead sponsor at that  particular time.  I recognize the gentleman from California for 13 minutes.  ",2006
1179,24,2006-06-15,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, before  we went to war, President Bush and  other  administration  officials made  three promises to the American people:  one, we would find weapons of mass destruction; two, we would be welcomed  as  liberators; and, three, the reconstruction of Iraq would pay for itself.  Well, all three promises proved to be  false. Today I will focus on the reconstruction effort in Iraq and the massive  waste, fraud, and abuse that have undermined our efforts.  Stuart Bowen is the Special Inspector General for Iraq reconstruction. He  often talks about the reconstruction  gap which is the chasm between the  President’s promises and reality.  Mr. Bowen is absolutely right: the  gap is enormous. But it is dwarfed by  the incompetency and corruption gaps  in  Iraq. The  consequences  of mismanagement and corruption are serious. Waste,  fraud,  and  abuse have  flourished. The taxpayer has been repeatedly gouged.  Iraq is not being rebuilt. We have  lost credibility and are now viewed in  Iraq as occupiers, and our troops did  not get essential equipment when they  needed it. We have now spent $50 billion on Iraq reconstruction, including  $30 billion from U.S. taxpayers.  Let’s look at what we got for the  money. Despite  spending  $2 billion,  Iraq’s oil production is still well below  prewar  levels, running about a half  million barrels below 2003 levels. We  have invested $4 billion into improving  electricity generation.  Not only is the administration 2,000  megawatts short of reaching its goal  for peak output, but generation is actually below prewar  levels. And we  spent $6 billion on oil production and  electricity generation. And we have actually lost ground.  The situation is the same for drinking water. In essence, we have squandered $50 billion. Profiteering has been  rampant, and the taxpayer has gotten  gouged and the work has not gotten  done. And what is especially shameful  about the wasteful spending is that we  needed  this money  for  our  troops.  When we  first went  into  Iraq, our  troops  did  not  have  enough  body  armor.  Families had to purchase armor off  the Internet and ship it to Iraq in a  desperate  attempt  to  protect  their  loved ones. On congressional delegations, individual servicemembers have  taken our staffs aside and begged for  more night vision goggles.  Patriotic Americans even had to donate their frequent flier miles so troops  who were dumped at the Baltimore airport by the Pentagon could make it  home  for  the holidays. This  should  never have happened. It is inexcusable  that our troops face desperate shortages of essential gear while billions of  dollars were frittered away.  To understand the magnitude of this,  there is no better place to start than  Halliburton. Halliburton is the largest  private contractor operating in Iraq.  The company has three contracts that  total more than $20 billion. We now  know that political appointees, not career civil servants, decided to give Halliburton a secret no-bid contract for $7  billion to operate Iraq’s oil fields.  As GAO has reported, the key decision that led to the award of the secret  contract violated Federal procurement  law. When a career attorney properly  objected, he was simply overruled. And  despite  statements  from  the  Vice  President, we know now that his chief  of staff, Scooter Libby, was personally  briefed on this entire plan months before the war.  The decision to give those lucrative  contracts to Halliburton has been expensive. According to Pentagon audits,  Halliburton’s total unreasonable and  unsupported charges exceed $1.4 billion.  Well, the examples of waste, fraud, and  abuse  are  numerous.  Halliburton  charged $45 for a case of soda; $100 for  a 15-pound bag of laundry.  When they had brand-new $85,000 Halliburton trucks, they abandoned them  or torched them if they got a flat tire  or experienced minor mechanical problems. Halliburton’s contracts are cost-  plus. That means that Halliburton is  reimbursed for all of its costs, and then  receives an extra percentage as additional profit.  In practical terms, this means that  the more Halliburton spends, the richer  it gets. Now we talked to former Halliburton employees who worked in Iraq.  They told us the  informal company  motto was: ‘‘Do not worry about price,  it is cost plus.’’  Halliburton was supposed to be  in  Iraq to provide support for the troops,  but the company used one standard for  the troops and a completely different  standard for its own executives. Halliburton employees stayed at the five-  star Kempinski Hotel in Kuwait, where  it costs taxpayers $10,000 per day. This  is the five-star Kempinski. This gorgeous hotel offered maid service, complimentary  fruit  baskets  to Halliburton employees.  Our troops stayed  in tents  in the  desert. At one point, a cost-conscious  Army  official  asked Halliburton  to  move  its  employees  into  air-conditioned tents, but they refused.  To their credit, career government  auditors identified these overcharges.  When they examined Halliburton’s second oil contract, they harshly criticized Halliburton’s performance, citing  profound systemic problems and exorbitant  indirect costs. But their recommendations were rejected.  After reviewing Halliburton’s first oil  contract  in  Iraq,  auditors  recommended that the Army not pay $263  million  in unreasonable and unsupported charges. But the Army ignored  those auditors and paid Halliburton  $254 million, over 95 percent of the disputed charges.  And in spite of the auditor’s findings,  Halliburton was paid nearly $100 million in profits and bonuses for overbilling taxpayers.  Well, Halliburton  symbolizes what  went astray in Iraq, but it is not the  only contractor abusing the system.  Parsons received the contract to rebuild health clinics throughout Iraq.  But despite spending $186 million, Parsons completed just 20 of 142 health  clinics they promised to build.  Another  firm, Custer Battles,  received two security contracts. A Federal jury recently found that the company committed 37 separate acts of  fraud. These are not isolated instances.  There are over 70 corruption investigations  currently under way  in  Iraq.  These  cases  involve  allegations  of  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:41 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H15JN6.REC H15JN6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2006

I was in Beirut the  day  after  the  attack,  and  I  recommended to President Reagan, I recommended  to  the President of  the  United States, get out of Beirut because we didn’t have enough troops; 2  months later he got out of Beirut because he didn’t have enough troops.  I know what rhetoric is, and I know  what fighting on the front lines are. I  know the difference between them. I  know that standing here does not solve  the problem, and it has gotten better,  it has gotten worse. That’s the problem. And you are not talking about  Iraq. The gentleman up there was talking about the war on terror. I am talking about Iraq. That’s what I am talking about.  Mr. Speaker,  I recognize the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN) for 4 minutes.  ",2006
1181,31,2006-06-15,Mr. CLYBURN.," I thank Mr. MURTHA  for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, last Saturday I visited  the Johnson VA Medical Center  in  Charleston, South Carolina. That medical center is named for a young man  who is the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor because just out  of high school he went off to fight in  Vietnam and he threw himself on a grenade to save the others in the foxhole  with him.  I went to the hospital last Saturday  to visit one of my heroes, Joseph Henry  Washington. Joseph Washington was  on the USS Arizona on that fateful day  at Pearl Harbor. I went because I wanted to report to Joseph Henry Washington on my recent trip to Iraq because he questioned the wisdom of my  going there.  I said to Joe that I was very pleased  with what I had found militarily in  Iraq. I told him that I thought that our  military  forces were doing an admirable  job, and  I thought they were  meeting with significant success.  But I said to him, Uncle Joe, I am  very, very disappointed in what I have  found on the domestic front. We are  not going to win the hearts and minds  of the people of Iraq until we can give  them a police force that believes and is  committed to law and order, not one  that is 80 percent corrupt.  I said to him that I did not think  that we were going to be successful in  Iraq until we involved the Iraqi people  in the reconstruction efforts. We see $9  billion that we can’t account for. We  see construction going on up in the  northern part of the country. But in  Baghdad, in and around that part of  the country, we see a  failed policy.  That is what is causing the problem in  Iraq. We must begin to  involve the  Iraqi people in the reconstruction of  their country.  Eighty-five percent of the country is  without electricity. Almost 60 percent  of  the country  is without drinking  water. We are never going to be successful until we tackle these problems,  and that is where we are failing because there is no accountability on the  domestic front in Iraq.  Mr. Speaker, I go back to Charleston  the day after tomorrow because we are  going to bury Uncle Joe. He stayed  alive long enough for me to make my  report to him. And for over 45 years in  my consultations with him, he never  wanted to talk about his experiences  on the USS Arizona or his experiences  after returning home. Why? Because he  was never sufficiently included in the  building of this great Nation. And the  people of Iraq are not being sufficiently  included  in  the  rebuilding of  their  country. Until we do  that, we will  never be successful with this policy.  ",2006
1182,31,2006-06-15,Mr. HOEKSTRA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  3 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. TIAHRT), my colleague from  the committee.  ",2006
1183,31,2006-06-15,Mr. TIAHRT.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Michigan.  Mr. Speaker, this  is an  important  week for us to have this debate on the  necessity of the global war on terror, a  war that we did not ask for, but a war  that came to us.  The gentleman  from Pennsylvania  pointed out that after Beirut, we left.  We did not react to it. Several other instances like that occurred during the  1990s. We were attacked at the Khobar  Towers; we did not react. We were attacked at the Kenya embassy; we did  not react. We were attacked the first  time at the World Trade Center; we did  not react. The Tanzania embassy was  bombed; we did not react. The USS Cole  was bombed; we did not react. What did  it yield us? A continuing battle against  terror around the globe.  I would remind my fellow colleagues  that one such  incident of attacking  Americans happened in the Philippines  when Gracia and Martin Burnham were  kidnapped, along with a constituent  from Representative BONO’s district.  The leader of the Abu Sayyaf Group,  ASG, was trained by al Qaeda in Afghanistan. That training occurred because we did not respond to these prior  attacks. We left them alone.  In the Indonesian al Qaeda training  papers they found, they said one of the  things  that America  is  vulnerable  about is they don’t follow up. You can  attack them, and they withdraw. They  withdrew from Vietnam, they withdrew  from Beirut, they withdrew from the  Cole, the Kenya embassy, and Khobar  Towers. They did not react the first  time when they attacked the World  Trade Tower. We have continued to  make ourselves vulnerable by not responding to the worldwide war on terror.  Thanks to American training and intelligence aid, the Philippine Government  was  able  to  rescue  Gracia  Burnham. Martin Burnham died in the  rescue attempt. It was probably because we couldn’t get close enough into  the fight.  But  the  important  thing  that we  need to remember is if we back off now,  according to the paper, or the letter  that was written from al Zawahiri to  the now-deceased al Zarqawi, it will be  considered a victory for al Qaeda if we  leave. Al Qaeda is the one that has decided to bring this war to Iraq and to  fight Americans. That information is  available on their Web sites and in the  information that we collect. It is what  the captives tell us when we interview  them.  They want to take this fight to the  Americans in Iraq. I tell you, if we are  going to have to  fight terrorists,  I  would rather  fight them at a place  where every American carries a gun  rather than on the streets of New York  or Washington or Wichita because they  have brought the fight to us. It is not  we who decided to do this.  I think it is very important as we  pursue this worldwide battle against  terrorism that we insist on doing it  with our full resources, with full dedication, and that we disrupt their finances, that we disrupt their places of  safe haven, that we disrupt the countries that are providing protection for  them, and that we go to the terrorists  and we find the root causes of this terrorism and sever the root.  I think the reason we have seen so  much money from al Qaeda going to  Iraq, the reason that they have sent so  many weapons into Iraq, the reason so  many foreign fighters have gone into  Iraq is because that is where they want  to fight this battle.  If we leave now, it would be giving  them a victory and we would be once  again putting another picture on the  board here  saying we  should have  fought harder; we should have stopped  it back in 2006.  ",2006
1184,31,2006-06-15,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 1 minute.  The problem is that the opposite is  happening. That  is  the problem we  have. We can stand here and say we  want to fight the terrorists in Iraq. Actually, al Qaeda we think is less than  1,000.  We think we are caught in a civil  war. It is the way that we are doing it.  The military cannot win this war. The  military  commanders,  even General  Pace admits we cannot win this militarily.  What we are caught in, we have become the target of the insurgency of  the sectarian violence. It is the way  that we are doing it is what I disagree  with.

1186,38,2006-06-15,Ms. HART.," Thank you Mr. Chairman,  for yielding me a few moments today  to speak with our colleagues and with  the American people.  As I traveled with seven colleagues  earlier this year to visit our troops in  the Middle East and Central Asia, I  learned a great deal about the American spirit, the spirit of our volunteer  servicemen and women and what drives  them to risk it all. It is the defense of  freedom. It is the understanding that  vigilance  and  sacrifice  are  requirements for our Nation’s security.  Back home in the comfort of their  living rooms though, many Americans  lack  that  focus. They  forgot about  Iraq’s violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and the mounting incidence of attacks on our Nation leading  up to 9/11. They began to loudly dissent  and doubt and distract from our mission in Iraq.  One of the generals who I spoke with  while I was in Kuwait took the opportunity in a quiet conversation to ask a  very  pointed  question. He  said,  is  America fighting this war, or is it just  our military who is fighting this war?  We today, together with all Americans, must  answer  that  general’s  thoughtful question. We must answer  it for him, for ourselves, for the rest of  the world, but especially for our enemies, so they know America is truly  committed to liberty and the victory of  civility and opportunity  for all who  love freedom and support democracy.  These enemies have long been committed to robbing the world of liberty.  The United States and others have  been targets of these terrorists many  times leading up to 9/11 because of our  commitment to the ideal of freedom.  These enemies include regimes which  harbor terrorists, but most especially  those loosely connected terrorist organizations operating outside a national  framework who share an ideology of  oppression, tyranny, control, hatred resentment. They value no life, no man,  no woman, no child.  We Americans cannot continue to be  free  if we spend all our time questioning our mission. Many Americans  want to debate the validity of prewar  intelligence or weapons of mass destruction. Whether one nation or another supported al Qaeda, how many  troops do we need? Americans have to  look beyond the tactical challenges.  We must do as Tony Blair did. The  people who are  fighting us, he said,  know what is at stake. The question is,  do we?  b1545  ",2006

1189,38,2006-06-15,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on this  resolution as the chairperson of the 72-  member Out of  Iraq Caucus of  the  House of Representatives. Tomorrow  will mark the 1-year anniversary of the  Out of Iraq Caucus.  My colleagues and I joined together  to form the Out of Iraq Caucus to pressure the Bush administration into telling the truth about what is going on in  Iraq, to admit their mistakes, and to  admit their misjudgments, and to force  them to devise a plan to bring our  troops home.  The  Bush  administration  cannot  deny that they misled the world about  the  reasons we  invaded  Iraq. There  were no weapons of mass destruction in  Iraq. There was no connection between  the unfortunate destruction of 9/11 and  Saddam Hussein. We have not been  welcomed with open arms in Iraq. We  have no substantial support  for this  war by other countries. Yet, Mr. Bush,  Mr. CHENEY, Mr. Rumsfeld, Ms. Rice,  Mr. Wolfowitz, and Mr. Karl Rove continue to squander the American taxpayers’ dollars on a war that cannot be  won with a military solution.  Here we are 3 years later, 2,500 American soldiers dead, 18,498 U.S. soldiers  seriously injured, and Congress has appropriated over $320 billion  for this  war, and the costs will only continue  to rise. Even Condoleezza Rice admitted  there  have  been  thousands  of  missteps. The American people are increasingly aware of this mismanaged,  corrupt, and bungled war.  The company  that Vice President  CHENEYserved as CEO of, Halliburton,  has been awarded no-bid contracts for  billions of dollars, and they have had  over $400 million in unsupported costs  and another $1 billion  in questioned  costs. In simple words, they are cheating the American people. Yet they are  not being held accountable for their  criminal actions, and the administration has  facilitated these  illegal actions.  However, Congress has done virtually  no oversight of this war, no hearing, no  acknowledging the generals that are  trying to tell us about Mr. Rumsfeld’s  mismanagement of this war. We have  not done the oversight, and today, we  find that we have this debate. It is not  sufficient, nor has  it been properly  characterized. This resolution we are  debating is a sham.  As a matter of fact, it is a trap. It is  an attempt to force Democrats to sign  on to a resolution that will do nothing  to bring our troops home. Oh, they  want to make us sound as if we are unpatriotic. They want to make us sound  as if we do not support our troops. We  love our troops. We are as patriotic as  anybody, and so I would implore my  colleagues not to get caught into this  trap.  This resolution  is not  intended to  solve any problems or chart a new  course that will permit us to preserve  the lives of our troops or to be successful in Iraq.  I know what is happening. My friends  on the opposite side of the aisle are  getting frightened. They went home on  the break, and they heard the American people. They saw the polls, and  they came back with a Karl Rove-constructed resolution to try and make it  seem as if now they get it. But this resolution does nothing. It will only continue to mislead.  We formed the Out of Iraq Caucus to  oppose any permanent bases in Iraq.  We support H.J. Res. 73 to redeploy  U.S. forces from Iraq, commonly referred to as the Murtha resolution.  There are a  lot of misconceptions  about what the Murtha resolution is.  So let us take a minute and explain  clearly what the resolution says.  Section 1 says: ‘‘The deployment of  United States forces in Iraq, by direction of Congress, is hereby terminated  and the forces involved are to be redeployed  at  the  earliest  practicable  date.’’ They would have you believe  this  is meant  to withdraw  immediately. That is not what it says, and  let us get that straight today. What  that means is there will be no more  U.S. troops sent to Iraq and that the  troops  in Iraq will be redeployed as  soon  as  possible,  a  judgment  that  should be made by military officials on  the ground. So stop misrepresenting  what this resolution is all about.  Section 2 says that ‘‘a quick-reaction  U.S.  force  and  an  over-the-horizon  presence of U.S. Marines shall be deployed in the region.’’ That means a  group of marines will remain in the  Middle East to respond to threats that  destabilize our allies in the region or  the national security of the United  States.  Section 3 says: ‘‘The United States of  America shall pursue security and stability in Iraq through diplomacy.’’ This  war cannot be won through military  means alone. We must put the  full  weight of the United States behind diplomacy in order to end bloodshed in  Iraq.

1191,52,2006-06-15,Mr. KUCINICH.," Thank you, Mr. MURTHA, and the Out of Iraq Caucus.  The President will not bring an end  to this war. He says it is a decision for  the next President. But he is building  permanent bases in Iraq, and he is determined to keep 50,000 troops in Iraq  into the distant future.  This Congress may not bring an end  to this war because the real power to  end the war is in a cutoff of funds. Congress keeps appropriating funds in the  name of the troops, and the troops will  stay in Iraq instead of coming home.  Only the American people can bring an  end to this war as they brought an end  to the Vietnam War. Let this be a time  of stirring of civic soul.  It is a time for a reawakening of civic  conscience. There were no weapons of  mass destruction in Iraq, but there are  WMDs in D.C. Lies are weapons of mass  destruction. 2,500 soldiers dead. Over  10,000 Iraqis, innocent Iraqis have died.  It is time for an end to our national  sleepwalk to the graveyard of the Iraq  war.  It is a time for truth, a time for clarity, a time for action, a time for teach-  ins, for meet-ups, for marches, for rallies about the war to begin at college  campuses, at churches, at labor halls,  at  libraries. It  is time to gather  in  civic centers, in town halls, to discuss  the truth about this war and to plan  civic action to end  it, time  for the  American people to exercise their first  amendment  right  to  stand up  and  speak out, time to redirect the policies  of this country, time to learn and practice peaceful, nonviolent conflict resolution, time to believe in our capacity  to evolve beyond war, to believe and  act under the belief that war is not inevitable and peace is inevitable if we  are ready to commit to the daily work  of peace building everywhere.  The global war on terror has become  a global war of error: attacking or  threatening countries which did not attack us, bombing neighborhoods  to  save neighborhoods, committing atrocities in the name of stopping atrocities,  losing our vision, losing our way in the  world,  sacrificing  our  children  and  their future, giving up their future resources for education, for health care,  for housing, piling it all high on the  altar of war and worshipping a false  god of destruction.  When we  begin  these  proceedings  with this remembrance, Thine is the  kingdom and the power and the glory,  we are not talking about any nation.  We are talking about a force which is  above all of us. The world is not ours to  conquer. There is no glory in the abuse  of power. This President will not bring  an end to this war after the Murtha  resolution,  this  Congress may  not  bring an end to this war, but the American people certainly will bring an end  to this war. They will do  it  in the  streets, and they will do it at the ballot box, and the American people will  become the Out of Iraq Caucus.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I  am pleased to yield 11⁄2minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WOLF),  the chairman of the subcommittee on  State, Justice and Commerce appropriations.  (Mr. WOLF asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1192,52,2006-06-15,Mr. WOLF.," The war on terror and  this whole thing began really in 1980  when our embassy was taken over in  Iran and the bombing of the Marine  barracks in 1983, Lebanon, embassy in  1983,  USS  Cole,  Khobar  Towers,  Nairobi, Tanzania.  I have so much that I want to say. I  will just say this. If we were to set a  date, the Mujahedin would say we defeated the Russians in Afghanistan, we  defeated America in Iraq and the jihad  would take place all over this world.  This would be a very, very dangerous  thing to say.  So I rise in strong, strong support of  this resolution and say we can and will  win this war. I remember when I read  the book by Whittaker Chambers. He  was a witness. He said when I left the  Communist Party,  I believed  I was  leaving the winning side and joining  the  losing side. Whittaker Chambers  was wrong because of people like Ronald Reagan. We must be resolute. I rise  in support of the resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.  Res. 861 and  to show my support  for our  troops serving  in  Iraq and Afghanistan who  are on the front lines in the global war on terrorism. I commend our forces for the recent  actions in targeting Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the  insurgent leader killed in an airstrike June 7.  I also commend President Bush for his visit  earlier this week to Iraq to meet with Prime  Minister Nouri al-Maliki and encourage  the  work of the new Iraqi government.  I share the deep concerns about the continuing violence in post-war Iraq, which is taking the lives of U.S. military personnel and civilians. I continue to pray for the protection of  the men and women who are putting  their  lives on the line every day to help the Iraqi  people as  they build  their own government,  and also for their families here at home who  continue to make tremendous sacrifices.  I recognize there were good and reasonable  people on both sides of the decision to send  U.S. armed forces to Iraq. But whether or not  you agreed with that decision, we are there  now and cannot just walk away. Too much is  at stake. The success of our efforts  in  Iraq  and the success of the Iraqi people in establishing their own government are critical to the  overall war against terror and to the security of  our country and the world.  Our efforts in Iraq, many believe, are an important campaign  in  the global war on  terrorism. Our world is a dangerous place, and  as we  learned on September 11, 2001,  terrorism is not something in a far away land. We  did not seek this war. We were attacked on  our own soil, and this war is a different kind  than any our Nation has ever fought. But it is  one we are fighting to make our own nation  and the world more secure. It is critical that  we remain resolute in this fight.  I believe a case can be made that the war  on terrorism really began more than 20 years  ago with the attacks against America at the  U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon. The bombing there in the spring of 1983 killed 63 and  wounded 120. Later that year, 241 U.S. servicemen—220 Marines, 18 Navy members and  three Army members—were killed when a  truck bomb exploded at their barracks in Beirut. Those attacks were followed in 1993 by  the first World Trade Center bombing in New  York City,  in 1996 by  the Khobar Towers  bombing in Saudi Arabia, in 1998 by the U.S.  embassy bombings  in Kenya and Tanzania,  and  in 2000  in  the attack  in Yemen on  the  USS Cole.  After the attacks on the two embassies in  Africa  in 1998,  I became  very  concerned  about the U.S. response to terrorism and authored  the  legislation creating  the National  Commission on Terrorism. On  the cover of  that report  is a photo of  the  twin  towers  in  New York on fire after the 1993 attack. The  foreboding nature of that photo is now all too  real as we relive the destruction of the World  Trade Center on September 11, 2001.  Late  last summer  I returned  to  Iraq  for a  third time. I have now visited all but the Kurdish areas in northern Iraq. With each successive  trip,  I have  seen  improvements—renovated schools, cleaner water systems, new  Iraqi army constituted. I also have seen the  continuing and serious security problems and  other challenges facing a liberated Iraq, and I  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:41 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H15JN6.REC H15JN6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2006
1193,59,2006-06-15,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," It is good that  the American people are able to hear  this debate and judge for themselves  who should be making the policies and  which policies are best for our country.  I have been through this before. I  worked in the White House with Ronald Reagan for 7 years, and I heard  some of the same shrill voices that we  hear today in those days. I heard the  same gutting of the President of the  United States  for political purposes,  but also for idealistic reasons during  those days.  I heard Ronald Reagan  called a warmonger. I heard all of the  charges that we hear today aimed at  our President aimed at Ronald Reagan,  and by some of the same people,  I  might add.  We have voices who are idealistically  opposed to war and are in fact affected  in their heart, perhaps more than others, when war does come, as it comes to  all  free  people  because  without  strength of purpose and willingness to  fight there will be no freedom in this  world.  But when we  fought  communism, President Reagan stood firm  when the shrill voices of defeatism and  retreat attacked him personally and  attacked our effort and tried to undermine that effort in the same way our  effort today  is being undermined by  nitpicking, backbiting, and defeatism.  Yet, he stood firm and, guess what?  The world was amazed when the evil of  communism collapsed.  Well, today we are in a war with radical Islam, which is every bit as much  a threat and hates Western democracy  every bit as much as the Communists  did. We have made a stand in Iraq, and  I would hope that people understand  that had Ronald Reagan backed down,  we would still be in the middle of the  Cold War. And if we back down today,  as is being advocated, what I consider  to be a cowardly retreat, it will have  consequences. It will not end the war.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I  yield to Mr. BUYER for the purposes of  a unanimous consent request.  (Mr. BUYER asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1194,59,2006-06-15,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the resolution.  Immediately  following  the attacks on September 11, 2001, this Nation’s focus was on  countering the fundamental ideals of terrorism  that spawned  the attack on our homeland.  Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network,  Saddam Hussein, and the Taliban, connected  together through the terror they inflicted, had  shared ambitions  to destroy our way of  life.  Five  years  later, we have witnessed  successes of historical proportions. Saddam—imprisoned and on trial for acts against humanity; Osama is on the run and we captured his  number two; the Taliban no longer exists—for  the first time in Afghanistan, their citizens are  free to hope and dream; women are receiving  an education. Al Qaeda is demonstrating what  comes from the crushing pains of defeat, left  only with cowardly acts of desperation  in a  weakening effort to survive the blows that we  have dealt it.  Today in Iraq we are on the verge of the  blossoming of a successful new republic, accomplished by the perseverance of its citizens,  and the sacrifices of many. Yet, some of our  own countrymen are showing a dangerous  tendency to waiver, their faith shaken by the  drive-through mentality of our society. They  are verbalizing their doubts at a time when we  need them to stand strong. The peace-doves  who turned hawks of circumstance after September 11 were predicted to not have the intestinal fortitude to see this fight through to its  necessary  resolution. They are  living up  to  that prediction despite the threat of terrorism  still lurking around the world.  We cannot forget that the goals of Al Qaeda  and Osama bin Laden are to destroy western  culture in all of its forms and manifestations.  All across America, our constituents live their  lives—take  their kids  to school, go  to work,  earn a living—and this is the strength of our  Nation. However, we still live in the shadow of  a real and looming threat to our way of life.  We must  remain vigilant of  that  threat and  stand firm in our vow to dismantle it. While we  have not been attacked on our own soil since  September 11, we cannot afford the ramifications of complacency. The  recent arrest of  bomb-building  terrorists across  the border  in  Canada  is clear evidence of  that. We have  forced the terrorists into making this an ‘‘away  game,’’ the battlefield pushed from our homeland, but nonetheless the outcome must be in  our favor. Yes, the victories in this battle are  many, but we must have the resolve and determination to defeat terrorism here at home  and abroad. To succeed we must be absolute  and have constancy of purpose.  For decades Saddam Hussein  ruled  Iraq  with an iron fist of repression. In the midst of  that oppression was  the  intense yearning of  the Iraqi people to taste freedom. They were  forced to keep their hopes hidden, wrapped in  a cocoon that they could one day blossom into  the living principles from which they could rebuild  their nation. They have emerged  from  that cocoon and are attempting to fly. The elements that were forming in it have manifested  themselves in the formation of their new government,  two  successful national elections,  and a successful national constitutional  referendum.  Iraq cannot continue to succeed in the transition from war to building their Nation without  our continued help. The people of Iraq have  appealed to us in this critically important period. We have pledged our commitment  to  them and we need to see it through. The Iraqi  people are proud of  their accomplishments  thus  far, but  they have asked  for a steady  hand of reassurance  from us  to help guide  them in this transition.  The pride and motivation that the Iraqi population has demonstrated to this point are key  elements to making their young government a  success. We must continue  to nurture  their  growth of confidence so that they can effectively govern, defend, and sustain themselves.  The motivation to man a completely volunteer  Iraqi army is one point of evidence that these  people have pride and faith in their new republic. We cannot fail the security of our own  Nation and the people of Iraq in a time of such  dire need. The consequences of walking away  at this point are too great to fathom. We must  maintain our resolve to follow through with our  commitment to the people of Iraq and in the  global fight to free ourselves from the grip and  fear of terrorism.

And I also might mention that all 29  Democrats sent a letter to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee,  from which we have not received an answer, recommending and asking that  the Investigations Or Oversight Subcommittee be reestablished.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  SMITH).  (Mr. SMITH of Washington asked and  was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1196,66,2006-06-15,Mr.  SMITH  of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, this debate on this resolution,  and the resolution itself, continues two  very dangerous patterns that have sort  of governed all of our actions in Iraq  for far, far too long.  First of all, there are no specifics, as  Congressman  said  quite  articulately, as to how we are going to  achieve this victory.  When this debate was billed, we were  told this was going to be the floor of  the House, the People’s House talking  about how to deal with the very tough  challenges  that  now  present  themselves in Iraq. Even the President admits that things have not gone the way  we had planned, and we need to step up  and figure out how to fix the problems.  And yet, this resolution doesn’t say a  thing about that. It says, terrorism is  bad, our troops are good, and we want  to win.  This House is failing in its mission  with such an open statement that does  not get at the how of winning. How are  we going to deal with an open-ended  commitment to Iraq? How are we going  to pay the price for that? Is it even in  the best interest of our goal of a stable  and peaceful  Iraq  to  say  that our  troops will stay there for as long as is  necessary?  SNYDER Those questions are not answered.  Unless we in this House are willing to  step up and put policy  forward, we  shouldn’t say that this  is a debate  about the future of Iraq. It is not. We  have many hard questions that need to  be answered. This resolution does not  do that.  And the second dangerous trend is  the pattern of the President and the  majority in this Congress to say anyone who disagrees with them is somehow unpatriotic and defeatist, which to  my mind means that we all need a refresher course on why democracy is important. We are all very good at saying  that it is important. It is important so  that we hear all the voices, not just  those who disagree with us. That way  we can learn from our mistakes, which  we desperately need to do in Iraq.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in disappointment—  though I must say, not in surprise—about the  exercise the House is engaged in today. This  is not a true debate about our policy in Iraq.  A real debate on Iraq would allow us to consider alternative proposals and vote on meaningful amendments that could help us improve  the very difficult situation  there.  Instead we  have before us an un-amendable, rhetorical  document about  the war on  terrorism  that  barely  focuses on  Iraq  itself, and certainly  doesn’t deal with the real challenges we face  there. This process is an offense to our democracy.  What is even more troubling, Mr. Speaker,  is that this kind of undemocratic approach is  precisely what led to the Bush administration’s  many costly mistakes in Iraq. Americans have  seen how the administration’s stubborn single-  mindedness and refusal to consider alternative  views and dissenting opinions have cost us  dearly  in  Iraq. The  facts  are  all-too-well-  known:  When General Shinseki said that far more  troops would be needed to secure the peace  in Iraq, he was ignored and soon retired—and  the result was  that  the  troops we did send  struggled unnecessarily to prevent and control  a massive insurgency.  When advisors warned  the administration  not to de-Baathify and disband the Iraqi military and security forces, they were ignored. As  Prime Minister Tony Blair has publicly admitted, this was a grave mistake that effectively  pushed  thousands  of  military-trained,  disempowered Sunnis into the streets, fueling  the post-war insurgency.  And the administration’s refusal to heed dissenting views on Iraq continues to this day.  Now  that  the Special  Inspector General  for  Iraq Reconstruction has brought to light massive amounts of waste,  fraud, and abuse  in  the  reconstruction contracting,  I understand  that the administration and the Republicans in  Congress are  trying  to prematurely end his  mandate.  This is a clear pattern, Mr. Speaker, and the  consequences of this arrogant, undemocratic  approach are real.  It has cost us dearly  in  American lives and resources, undermined our  efforts to build peace and stability in Iraq, and  delayed our departure from the country.  Mr. Speaker,  I supported  the use-of-force  authorization in October 2002 in order to give  the President  the  leverage  to hold Saddam  Hussein accountable  for his  threatening behavior and refusal to submit to weapons inspections. And that is what makes it all the  more  frustrating  that  the President misused  that authority by rushing to war and committing so many grave and costly mistakes  in  Iraq.  So no, Mr. Speaker, this is not a real debate. A real debate would allow us to consider  the important questions in Iraq: Can we afford  to make an open-ended commitment to staying  in  Iraq? Has our  troop presence  there  reached the point where it is inhibiting a successful transition to full Iraqi sovereignty? Can  our strained military and ballooning national  deficit handle it?  How can we accelerate  the  transition  to  Iraqi sovereignty and  responsibility  for  their  own country? How best can we engage  in  more robust diplomacy with our allies and key  regional players who can help bolster the new  Iraqi government and contribute to its reconstruction?  How can we  improve Congressional oversight so that we can identify and rectify the  enormous mistakes  the  administration  has  made in Iraq?  These are the questions we should be debating, Mr. Speaker, because they directly affect our ability to achieve success in Iraq. We  owe it to our brave men and women in uniform and to the American people to ask these  questions. But instead, we have a resolution  before us  today  that  is basically  irrelevant  when  it comes  to  the real  issues  in  Iraq.  It  says, essentially, that we support fighting terrorism and that we are committed to achieving  success  in  Iraq.  I agree with  that, but  that  doesn’t say anything about how we get there.  That is the important question.  Mr. Speaker, today Congress is continuing  to utterly abdicate its oversight responsibility.  Since the outbreak of war, this Congress has  done little more than endorse the administration’s policy  in  Iraq,  instead of asking  the  tough questions and scrutinizing that policy, as  the Constitution requires us to do.  Mr. Speaker, I hope, despite this Congress’  refusal to conduct oversight, that we can be  honest today as we look ahead in Iraq. We all  want to see an Iraq that is stable, secure, and  free. Our troops are doing an outstanding job,  and they deserve our full support and respect.  But the fact is that success or failure in Iraq  increasingly depends on the decisions of Iraqi  leaders, and  they must understand  that.  In  order to achieve success in Iraq we must accelerate the transition to Iraqi sovereignty.  I believe that significantly reducing our military footprint is critical for making that happen.  While we cannot simply abandon Iraq at this  point, drawing down our forces levels in a responsible way in the coming months will force  the Iraqis to take greater responsibility for their  own security and reduce their dependence on  U.S.  forces.  It will also send an  important  message  to  the  Iraqi people  that Americans  are not there to occupy the country, but rather  seek to begin leaving as Iraqis take control of  their own country.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, as we move forward in  Iraq, both the future and the past matter. We  must make the best of a difficult situation by  working diligently  to help  Iraqis  take  full responsibility  for running  their country so  that  our overburdened troops can come home.

1199,73,2006-06-15,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, it goes  without saying how proud I am of those  young men and women in uniform. I  know every Member in this body joins  me in saying how pleased and proud we  are of them.  A  sad moment  earlier  today was  when it was announced that 2,500 had  given their lives in Iraq. But what concerns me, Mr. Speaker, more than anything is the request that we made for  discussion on Iraq and this resolution  that before us today was the result.  Trying to blend and fudge together the  war in Iraq, which is separate and distinct from the war on terrorism, is disingenuous.  Mr. SCHIFF, the gentleman from California, a moment ago, referred to an  amendment  by  Senator  Armed Services chairman in the Senate. That amendment stayed in the law  last year. This is what we should be  discussing today about Iraq, as we were  told we would.  Calendar year 2006 should be a period  of significant transition to full Iraqi  sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces  taking the lead for the security of a  free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of the United States forces  from Iraq. That is where we should be  today.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2006
1200,73,2006-06-15,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 2 minutes.  I think it is important to remember  the two major provisions in this resolution, one that there is not going to be  an arbitrary cutoff, that that would  disserve the security interests of the  United States to have an arbitrary exit  date from Iraq; and, secondly, that we  are going to finish the mission, we are  going to fulfill this mission, and that  we support the mission that is being  undertaken by those 130,000 plus troops  who are in Iraq right now.  Mr. Speaker, I was thinking about  this question of who should determine  WARNER,  when we leave Iraq. Over the last week,  we have talked about the bringing to  justice of Mr. Zarqawi, and everyone,  Democrats and Republicans, have been  talking about the extreme competence  of the American military.  We have talked about the fact that  they are extremely effective, that they  know what they are doing, that they  may be the best military we have had  in decades, that we have great leadership. That is why their judgment on  the ground as they stand up and train  this Iraqi military should be the determinant of when that Iraqi military is  able to carry that load and take that  handoff  from the American military  and handle those security duties themselves. It shouldn’t be a Congressman  from California, it shouldn’t be a Senator from Minnesota, it shouldn’t be  subject to a committee vote by those of  us in Washington, D.C. It should be a  function of the collaboration and the  discussion and the analysis of the combat commanders on the ground listening to their captains and their majors  and their colonels who are training up  this Iraqi force. When they say they  are ready, that is when we make that  handoff.  Mr. Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time.  ",2006

1202,73,2006-06-15,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker,  instead of finding, capturing or killing  the man who viciously attacked our  country almost 5 years ago, the administration misled our country and sent  150,000 troops to war with a country  without any credible link to 9/11.  Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us  mentions Iraq 18 times, but it does not  mention Osama bin Laden even once.  Not only can we not find bin Laden in  Afghanistan, we cannot  find him  in  this resolution.  If the other side of the aisle is serious  about a resolution on the global war on  terror, they would be better served to  get their target correct.  ",2006

1206,73,2006-06-15,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, our country is at war.  Men and women of the U.S. Armed  Forces, Republicans and Democrats,  are making the ultimate sacrifice in  Iraq to defend our freedom with 2,500  men and women having lost their lives  in Iraq alone. They deserve our respect,  our gratitude and our admiration, but  we do not honor them with this debate  today.  Instead of discussing ideas and long  overdue  course  corrections, we  are  being confronted with slogans. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle  would like this country to believe that  their party will stay the course in Iraq,  while we want to cut and run. That  kind of gross distortion may resonate  on right-wing talk radio, but nothing  could be further from the truth. We  need to make sure the job is done right  in Iraq and leave as soon as possible.  Our men and women in uniform are  striving, sometimes without the necessary troop strength and without adequate equipment to make the effort in  Iraq a success. Here the House majority  is  undermining  the  democratic  process and the very principles that  these brave  servicemen and women  have gone abroad to defend.  b1915  The actions of the Republican leadership in the run-up to today would make  the Kremlin blush. Having made a decision to conduct a debate, the majority  should have enabled full participation,  allowing amendments to the proposed  resolution on  the House  floor, and  Democrats should have been afforded  the opportunity to offer a substitute  resolution.  Instead, the resolution before us is a  shameless, one-party manifesto. If the  debate  today were  about  substance  rather than this one-party manifesto,  we would focus on what staying the  course means. The misguided and mistake-ridden effort in Iraq up to now is  absolutely not the course to follow.  I am deeply disturbed by critical  issues concerning our efforts in Iraq  that this resolution does not address:  human  rights  violations;  appalling  shortcomings in planning for the post-  conflict period; pathetically weak congressional oversight.  Just consider the waste, fraud and  abuse of reconstruction efforts in Iraq.  The Special Inspector General for Iraq  Reconstruction, Mr. Stuart Bowen, testified before our committee last week.  I would like to pay tribute to the exceptional work that Mr. Bowen has  done in this area. After serving as a  senior member of George Bush’s gubernatorial campaign  team, as general  counsel to then-Governor Bush, deputy  counsel to the Bush transition team in  2000, and then associate counsel in the  Bush White House, he left for the private sector, only to be brought back  into service by the White House to  oversee  an  investigation  into mismanagement of funds in Iraq.  The facts from the President’s handpicked special Inspector General, Mr.  Bowen, are shocking. Billions of U.S.  taxpayer dollars have been wasted in  Iraq. The executive branch should not  have allowed  such  slipshod management. This Congress should have done  its utmost to expose it but it has not,  and the American people should not  and will not tolerate it.

1207,80,2006-06-15,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to yield to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. GINNYBROWN-WAITE) for  21⁄2minutes.  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker,  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, even those of us on this  side of the aisle sometimes wonder if  after 3 years we should still be in Iraq.  I recently traveled there, and  like  many of my colleagues, we met with  soldiers from Florida. We each asked to  meet with  soldiers  from our home  State.  I will never ever  forget this  young man. He was not from my district. He actually was from south Florida. And I asked each of them where  they were from and if they were married. This young man’s name was Joe.  And I said to him, ‘‘Joe, are you married?’’  He said, Yes, ma’am. I am married  and I have five children.’’  So right away  I said,  ‘‘Your wife  must be a saint to be home with five  children.’’  And he looked at me with all of the  conviction that you would ever ask for  in a soldier, and he said, ‘‘Ma’am, he  said,  ‘‘my wife who’s home with my  five children feel exactly the way that  I do, and that is until the children in  Iraq are safe on the streets, our children won’t be safe  in Florida or  in  America.’’  Obviously we are very proud of what  our soldiers are doing, as are their families. As Members of the Congress, I believe that we have an obligation to  honor every person’s service to our  country. Using words like ‘‘quagmire’’  and ‘‘mistaken war’’ do not honor our  military’s service. We can do this by  providing our soldiers with the support  that  they need and  the  recognition  that they deserve. The negacrats and  the media do nothing to make our children safer on the streets in America  like Joe and his buddies do. This kind  of rhetoric not only impacts our soldiers, but as I sat here tonight, I could  not help but think about the families  of the soldiers who are watching this at  home, the children of our very, very  brave soldiers who are in harm’s way.  In closing, I want to thank Joe and  all of our troops and those families,  and I want to convey my eternal gratitude for everything that they do. May  God bless them all. May God bless our  troops, who, together with God, will  keep our country safe.  ",2006

1209,80,2006-06-15,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, it  is sad that the greatest deliberative  body of the world’s democracies cannot  provide an opportunity to give voice to  the concerns that are shared by Americans. Instead, we are given a White  House press release against terror and  for staying the course. That is not a  plan. It is a bumper sticker.  Our troops won the war against Saddam Hussein over a thousand days ago,  and they have been paying the price  ever since their victory because they  were not properly managed,  staffed,  trained, or equipped. Of course, nobody  is in favor of an arbitrary cutoff. On  my Web site I detailed an approach  that I think ought to be taken to focus  our priorities and stop short-changing,  for instance, our battle in Afghanistan,  slowly spinning outside of control. But  it is sad that the Republicans can only  think of two choices: stay the course,  cut and run.  If the White House and the Republican leadership believed in democracy  in America as much as they say they  do in Iraq, we would be debating the  resolution of Mr. MURTHA’s, for example, here. Americans could see their  hopes and their concerns not just debated but acted upon.  But, sadly, it is going to take another day and different leadership to  give Americans that type of democracy  here in Congress. And in the meantime  every day our troops will continue to  pay the price in Iraq as American prestige is assaulted around the world.  It is sad and it is unnecessary, but it  is the hand that we have been dealt.  ",2006
1210,80,2006-06-15,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to yield 21⁄2minutes to the gentleman who represents Dyess Air Force  Base, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  NEUGEBAUER).  ",2006
1211,80,2006-06-15,Mr. NEUGEBAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I  have been amused at some of the rhetoric tonight, but one of the questions  that has been asked  is what  is our  strategy?  We have a strategy. The strategy is  to win. The strategy is to keep America safe.  We are winning the war on terrorism.  We have gotten Saddam Hussein. We  have gotten Zarqawi. But the problem  is  are  there  other Saddams,  other  Zarqawis out there that would threaten the very fabric of the life that we  live in America?  We have a choice. We can fight that  war  on  terrorism  in  other  places  around the world or we can fight it  here in America. The right choice is to  fight those terrorists where they are,  where they are beginning to thrive, and  keep them contained where they are.  If we get out too quickly, what are  we going to tell those families of those  young soldiers that paid the ultimate  price for the freedom and democracy  that we are sewing the seeds for in Iraq  today? What are we going to tell the  young men and women that are over  there today that have volunteered, I  repeat, volunteered, to come and serve  a noble purpose?  I got a letter from a young marine  named Kevin Hester. And Kevin enlisted, Mr. Speaker. He knew exactly  what he was getting into when he enlisted in the Marines. And Kevin is in  Iraq today. And Kevin wrote me a letter the other day, and he said, The  Iraqi people trust us, and they trust us  now and they are trying to help us help  them by telling us who the bad guys  are in their country.  We have been fighting the cause for  America and keeping America safe for  over 230 years coming this July 4. This  is a war on terrorism. This is a different war than we have fought before.  This is like the war on drugs. This is  like the war on crime. The war on terrorism is a war that we will be fighting  for many years to come, but it is a war  that we cannot afford to lose. We cannot disgrace  those young men and  women that are representing and defending our country so greatly.  And so, Mr. Speaker,  I encourage  people to support this resolution  in  order to say to the young men and  women around the world that are defending  freedom and democracy, we  love you, we appreciate you.  God bless them and God bless America.  ",2006

1218,87,2006-06-15,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to initially present an update  as to where we have been and where we  are in Iraq. Many months ago an Iraqi  citizen said to me, you all must remove  Saddam. We can’t do it, he said, because we know what he is capable of  doing to us in retaliation. I said to him  if we do remove him, will you embrace  us or will you kick us? He said, I don’t  know.  I responded, that is my concern. I  don’t know either. I believe his anti-  Saddam  remarks at  that  time  represented a majority view in Iraq, but  my concern proved prophetic. Our exercise  in  Iraq, Mr. Speaker, and colleagues, has not been without mistakes. Our entry strategy was superb.  Our post-entry strategy was tentative  at best, inept at worst.  A better response to the looting that  ensued in the early days should have  been in place. The disestablishment of  the Army, without an alternative plan,  in my opinion, was premature. Some  would blame the United States for the  delayed  political  development,  but  after all, our  forefathers were deliberate in forming our country’s operational apparatus, so I think the political complaint is probably unfounded.  Was Saddam an evil, brutal murderer, a  flagrant violator of human  rights? You bet. Was he involved in  international terrorism? You bet. Was  he directly or  indirectly  involved  in  the 9/11 attack? I don’t know. I can neither confirm nor reject that theory.  My point, Mr. Speaker, is that intelligence was  flawed. Mistakes were  made. But the cause for freedom is a  noble one, and progress has,  indeed,  been realized.  I am concerned, Mr. Speaker, and  colleagues, about the  lack of objectivity  in reporting the war on terrorism. Some liberal talk show host reports imply that no good has been accomplished. Conversely, some conservative talk show hosts portray Baghdad  as moonlight and roses. Clearly these  two  slanted versions are  inaccurate  and unfair.  b2100  Let me say a word about the PATRIOT Act, Mr. Speaker, and this will  be  discussed  in more  detail  subsequently.  But the PATRIOT Act was reported  in the full House by the Judiciary Committee, and it addressed the nexus of  the sale of illicit narcotics and terrorist  financing. These two shadowy  worlds of narcotics trafficking and terrorism is an element of terrorism that  I think  is  lost on many Americans.  They are joined at the hip, and I am  particularly pleased that the PATRIOT  Act did respond to that end.  Seventeen months ago, Mr. Speaker,  I publicly indicated that troop withdrawal was conspicuously absent when  the war on terrorism was discussed. Oh,  we spoke of appropriating more funds,  we  spoke  of  dispatching  additional  troops, but virtually no one ever even  remotely included troop withdrawal in  their discussions.  Now, I am not suggesting troop withdrawal tomorrow, but I want our armed  servicemen and -women home sooner  rather than later. Some may declare,  oh, we cannot cut and run. Cut and  run? We have had a presence in Iraq in  excess of 3 years. 2,500 armed services  Americans have given  the ultimate  sacrifice to the cause of freedom, Mr.  Speaker. Thousands of permanent and  disabling injuries have been inflicted  upon members of our armed services in  addition to the spending of billions of  dollars.  I do not know what constitutes cutting and running, but I do know that  when we have logged a wartime duration of 3 years, when 2,500 Americans  have given their lives for freedom, and  Lord only knows how many Americans  have been injured, this does not constitute cutting and running.  The time has come, it seems to me,  Mr. Speaker, to pass the baton to the  Iraqi Government. Now, this decision  will ultimately be made militarily, and  properly so, by the commanders on the  ground; but I do not want this matter  of withdrawal to be lost in the shuffle.  If freedom and peace prevail in Iraq,  Mr. Speaker, history will be generous  in its praise to President Bush and the  Congress.  Mr. Speaker I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006

1221,87,2006-06-15,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank my colleague on the Judiciary  Committee, the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. COBLE) and the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism  and Homeland Security,  for  yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this  global war on terror resolution. The  war on terror is being fought on two  fronts, both abroad and here at home.  We applaud the diplomatic and military achievements overseas, but we  also need to remain vigilant here in  our own country.  Until  the  terrorists  are  defeated,  Americans will continue to be their  targets as long as we stand for freedom  and democracy.  One of our weapons in the war on terror is the USA PATRIOT Act. That  bill, which originated in the Judiciary  Committee, gives law enforcement officials and intelligence officials the ability to cooperate during investigations.  More than 250 people in the United  States have been charged with crimes  tied to  international terrorist  investigations and have been convicted or  have pled guilty because of the USA  PATRIOT Act.  In response to the events of September 11, 2001, we also passed legislation that created a Director of National Intelligence so that all of our intelligence capabilities would be coordinated by one official.  We passed the REAL ID Act which  contains several antiterrorism provisions, including one that makes certain  foreign nationals deportable because of  their ties to terrorism.  We must continue to pass legislation  that makes it more difficult for terrorists to enter the United States. That  means enacting meaningful border security legislation like the bill that the  House passed last December.  Those who would do us harm, Mr.  Speaker, respect no borders. Potential  terrorists and thousands of others continue to enter our country  illegally  every day.  In America, we are blessed to have  the  freedom that others only dream  about, but  freedom  is never  free. It  must be nurtured and protected, sometimes at great cost in lives; but we will  not surrender to terrorists. That only  empowers them. We will  fight them  today so we can enjoy a better tomorrow. Any other course only resigns us  to an uncertain future.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me pay  tribute to the brave men and women of  the  21st  Congressional  District  of  Texas who are fighting this war overseas. The most difficult action I have  ever taken as an elected official is to  call the families of the 14 servicemembers from my district who have made  the ultimate sacrifice. Their families’  patriotism and love of country is almost indescribable. Their faith is great  because they know our cause is great.

1225,94,2006-06-15,Mr. KENNEDY of Minnesota.," Mr.  Speaker, for our families and country  to truly be secure, we must prevail in  the war on terror. Iraq is a central  front in that war.  Mistakes have been made, but  so  have corrections. But the fundamental  fact remains that John F. Kennedy’s  words have never been more true: ‘‘If  men and women are  in chains anywhere in the world, then freedom is in  endangered everywhere.’’  Men and women in the chains of tyranny, without hope, provide the breeding grounds for terrorists that endanger America and the entire civilized  world. Terrorism can only be defeated  by bringing hope to harsh places.  America has always found that the  best way to make our families secure is  to confront tyranny and expand the  frontiers of freedom. That is our mission in Iraq. And with a democratically  elected government and Iraqi troops increasingly taking over for our troops,  we are on a path to success.  Others offer a different path, a path  that says get out now no matter what  the commanders in the field say; get  out now, whether or not milestones  have  been  achieved;  get  out  now,  whether or not Iraq becomes a sanctuary for terrorists to regroup and attack America again; get out now no  matter what signal that sends to Iran.  Let me be clear. Cutting and running  is one path, but it is the wrong path.  The only path for security for our families is victory in the war on terror.  The troops that I visited in Iraq in  each of the last 3 years have told me  that they should come home as soon as  possible, after we have defeated the  terrorist threat and set out a lasting  peace.  I support this proposal and encourage  all my colleagues to do the same.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Resolution offered by the gentleman from Illinois, a man who has spent his life as a tireless advocate for freedom and respect for the  fundamental dignity of all human life.  It cannot be overstated how important it is  that we are here for today’s debate. There is  no more important issue facing this Congress  or this country than winning the War on Terror.  Our mission in Iraq is a central front in that  war.  At stake is not only the safety of our families  and our country but also the resolve of this  great Nation  to stand up and oppose  the  forces of terror wherever they may appear.  Make no mistake about it: there is more at  stake in our mission in Iraq than helping rebuild a country decimated by a despot for decades. We must defeat the terrorists overseas,  so we don’t have to fight them here at home.  Mistakes have been made, so have corrections, but  the  fundamental  fact remains  that  John F. Kennedy’s words have never been  more true: ‘‘If men and women are in chains  anywhere in the world, then freedom is endangered everywhere.’’  People in the chains of tyranny without hope  are the breeding ground for terrorists that endanger America and the entire civilized world.  Terrorism can only be defeated by bringing  hope to harsh places.  We must also remember our own proud historical tradition: America has always found that  the best way  to provide  for our security at  home is to confront tyranny and expand the  frontiers of freedom.  That is our mission in Iraq.  And with a democratically elected government and an Iraqi army and police force increasingly taking over for our troops, we are  on a path to success, and a path to bringing  our troops home.  Others offer a different path, a path  that  says, get out now, no matter what the commanders on  the ground  think; get out now  whether or not milestones are achieved; get  out now, whether or not Iraq becomes a sanctuary for terrorists to regroup and attack America again; get out now, no matter what signal  it sends to Iran and other countries that would  endanger our security.  Cutting and running is one path. But it is the  wrong path.  The only path that makes our families secure is victory in the War on Terror.  Mr. Speaker, beyond the lessons of history,  I look to what the soldiers on the ground are  saying.  The soldiers I have spoken to on the ground  in Iraq, at places like Camp Victory in Baghdad, many of them men and women from the  Minnesota Army National Guard, want  to  come home as soon as possible.  However, they realize better than most that  if they come home before they have defeated  the  terrorist  threat,  there will be no  lasting  peace—there will be no victory in the War on  Terror. They know that if we don’t finish the  job in Iraq, we’ll have to finish it someplace  else.  Like them, I want to finish the job in Iraq,  because if we don’t finish it there, the horror  of 9/11 should inform us that the war will be  brought to us here at home.  Mr.  Speaker,  let  us  remember  in  our  thoughts and prayers  those who have sacrificed, as well as those who continue to stand  in harm’s way around  the world  fighting  the  War on Terror. Let us deserve the bravery and  selflessness of our men and women  in uniform.  ",2006
1226,94,2006-06-15,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. PRICE).  (Mr. PRICE of North Carolina asked  and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, the American people are increasingly aware of where things stand  in Iraq, despite the glib assurances and  political spin we get from sources like  the whereas clauses of the resolution  before us and the Pentagon’s most recent quarterly report, which has been  so  devastatingly  refuted  by Middle  East expert Anthony Cordesman of the  Center for Strategic and International  Studies.  The real question before us and the  question most Americans are asking is,  how long must our troops stay in Iraq?  Our military’s  valiant  efforts  have  clearly  facilitated  such  important  steps as such as the formation of a  democratically elected government in  Iraq. But the troubling reality is that  our continued presence also makes success more elusive. It serves as a disincentive for Iraqi military and political leaders to take courageous risks to  stabilize their country and assume responsibility  for  their  government.  Equally important, our presence is a  magnet for international terrorism and  an incitement for the insurgency.  In order to jump-start progress, our  troops must begin to come home. We  must leave in a way that maximizes  Iraq’s chances to govern and defend  itself. At the same time, we cannot become hostages to the failures of administration policy, prolonging or staying  in a situation where our very presence  is a continuing provocation. How we  leave does matter, but we must leave.  That  is why Representative BRAD  MILLERand I introduced a resolution  last fall, H.J. Res. 70, which would require the President to deliver an exit  strategy for Iraq. Tonight I am renewing that call. Let me explain briefly in  clear terms what a responsible exit  strategy means.  First, we need to hear that the President has a plan for reducing our presence in Iraq within a reasonable time  frame. ‘‘As they stand up, we will stand  down’’ is not a strategy. It is a slogan.  Secondly, we need to hear that such a  plan would begin with an initial near-  term drawdown of U.S. forces to send a  clear message to the Iraqis that our  presence is coming to an end. We also  need to hear a pledge from the President that we will not establish long-  term bases on Iraqi soil.  And, finally, we need to hear that  there is a plan for filling the void left  behind when our troops depart, to mobilize  resources  within  the  international community, to ensure that  Iraq’s neighbors do not interfere in internal Iraqi affairs, and to support the  ongoing development of the Iraqi Government and security forces.  These are the elements of a responsible exit strategy. This is the type of  leadership that the President owes our  troops and the American people.  ",2006

1229,101,2006-06-15,Ms. DEGETTE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to House Resolution 861. Calling this a  true debate on Iraq is a joke, and the Republican majority knows  it. The Majority Leader  has admitted  the  true motive—to use  this  issue in the fall elections against the Democrats. Shame on him and shame on the Republican majority for callously restricting what  should be a full debate about the most important issue facing our country. Shame on them  for trying to set a political trap and not allowing amendments or a full debate. If we were  allowed a fair process, the facts would be revealed. And the facts are not pretty.  After the tragedy and horror of September  11, 2001, everyone saw the threat posed by  Al Qaeda.  I voted  for  the authorization  for  President George W. Bush  to  use  force  against the Taliban in Afghanistan who were  harboring Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. I  am a strong supporter of the war on terrorism.  When President Bush came  to Congress  and asked for authorization to invade Iraq, he  made no case that that country was an imminent threat to the United States, or, in fact, related  to our  international  fight against  terrorism. So,  I opposed  the authorization  for  President Bush  to use military  force against  Iraq in 2002, and that vote was the proudest  vote I have taken in nearly 10 years in Congress.  Despite the paucity of evidence to invade a  sovereign nation, Congress authorized President Bush to go forward and we invaded Iraq.  Instead of  remaining  focused on combating  terrorists, the true imminent threat to our country, we got detoured into Iraq. Our courageous  men and women in uniform did a tremendous  job in the effort to defeat Saddam Hussein. I  have supported them every step of the way  and continue to support them as I stand here  today.  Having toppled its government, I felt we had  an obligation to see Iraq transition to a new  democracy. Like most Americans I was patient  as Iraq struggled to establish a new civil society and government after years of oppression.  In the three years since the invasion, Americans have provided security and rebuilding assistance. Despite  the gross mistakes, mismanagement, and misjudgments of our civilian  leadership, Iraq is now a sovereign, free country, a country with a new constitution and a  new government. At  this point  in  time, we  have done what we can. We’ve given the Iraqi  people an opportunity. It is now their opportunity to grab freedom. It is now their country  to lose.  Unfortunately our efforts have come at a tremendous cost. Major General John Batiste, a  commander  in  Iraq and military aide  to Mr.  Paul Wolfowitz, noted that ‘‘Rumsfeld and his  team turned what should have been a deliberate victory  in  Iraq  into a prolonged challenge.’’ 2,500 of our best and brightest young  people have paid the ultimate sacrifice to our  country. About 18,000 have been wounded.  All Americans are forever in their debt. In addition to the heartbreaking human toll, there is  a financial one as well. We have now spent or  appropriated, according to the Congressional  Research Service, about $320 billion on the  war in Iraq.  Enough is enough. Enough devastation for  mothers and fathers who have lost children in  Iraq; enough heartache  for  their  loved ones  and  friends; enough young  lives cut short;  enough being forced to shortchange domestic  priorities like health care and homeland security because billions are being spent on Iraq.  We have given the Iraqis a chance. That is all  they can ask of us and that is all we can ask  of ourselves. As such, it is time to shift troops  to  the periphery of  the conflict and redirect  some resources currently being used in Iraq  back to America.  Despite what the Republican majority suggests through this Resolution, saying it is now  time  to begin  redeploying  troops and  that  President Bush needs to develop a plan to do  so is not arbitrary. It is, in fact, a reasonable  calculation that the cost of Iraq is no longer  worth any benefit we may achieve by continuing our armed presence there. The majority of the American people have made it clear  they feel it is simply not worth more blood to  achieve perfection in Iraq. They are right. It is  time we in Congress listened.  ",2006
1230,101,2006-06-15,Mr. TERRY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of the resolution to affirm the United  States of America will ultimately achieve victory in the Global War on Terror.  On September 11, 2001, 3,000 of our fellow  Americans were brutally killed by Islamic terrorists under  the  leadership of Osama bin  Laden. President Bush responded by declaring war against terrorism and its strongholds  throughout the world. He said we would fight  the enemy on their ground to prevent terrorists  from once again attacking our citizens on U.S.  soil.  The Bush Doctrine stated: ‘‘Any nation that  continues to harbor or support terrorism will be  regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.’’ U.S. and Coalition forces have verified  his words with  irrefutable action. The state-  sponsored ‘‘safe harbor’’ Al Qaeda enjoyed in  Afghanistan ended when U.S. and Northern  Alliance forces routed the Taliban in a decisive  military victory.  Afghanistan now has a newly elected parliament,  a market  economy,  equality  for  women, and millions of  children attending  school  for  the  first  time. We still  face challenges in this nation, but it is on its way to becoming a stable and secure democracy, freed  from the oppression of the Taliban extremists.  Most importantly, Al Qaeda can no longer use  this nation as a launching ground from which  to attack the United States.  In Iraq, Saddam Hussein repeatedly refused  to comply with U.N. weapons inspection. Sovereignty was turned over to Iraqis a year and  a half ago; a Constitution was drafted  last  summer and ratified  in October; and a new  government is being established. The seeds of  democracy are beginning to take root, and a  major  threat  of  state-sponsored  terrorism  against the U.S. was removed.  Despite the danger of violent retaliation from  radical extremists, 59 percent of Iraqi citizens  exercised their right to vote in January, and  approximately 70 percent in December. Iraq is  on its way to fully assuming responsibility for  its own security and governance.  The challenges we face are undeniable and  difficult. President Bush was correct when he  said  this war would come at great cost  in  blood and treasure. However, the cost would  be much higher—intolerably high—had we not  decisively acted to protect the security and interests of the United States.  Who can forget the cheering of Iraqi citizens  in the streets as Baghdad was liberated and  the statue of Saddam Hussein toppled to the  ground? Who can forget the courage of the  Iraqi’s who proudly displayed the purple ink on  their index finger after exercising their right to  vote? Who can  forget  the sight of Saddam  Hussein cowering  like a cornered  rat when  U.S. soldiers forced him from hiding? Above  all, who can forget the sight of the North and  South Towers of the World Trade Center collapsing, the burning embers of the attack on  the Pentagon, or the scorched field in Pennsylvania that will forever stand as a testament  to heroism and self-sacrifice. Our successes in  the Global War on Terror have prevented additional horrifying  images  from  filling our TV  screens,  saving  untold  innocent American  lives.  We may never  know what  catastrophes  have been averted by the dedication and vigilance of U.S. servicemen and women. Nearly  2,500 Americans have nobly given their lives  in exchange for the peace that we have enjoyed here at home these past four and one-  half years. The very fact that we have not endured another  terrorist attack on U.S. soil  proves their lives were not given in vain. We  have not seen additional attacks such as  those in London and Madrid, or experienced  the fear Israelis face on a daily basis. We owe  our safety and security to the soldiers who are  giving their all to protect our families, communities, lives and liberties.  Al Qaeda remains a persistent danger to the  United States. This terrorist network operates  in over 60 countries around the world. It brainwashes men and women into becoming suicide bombers; destroys religious sites; bombs  and beheads innocent civilians; and seeks the  destruction and overthrow of America, our values, our people, our freedoms and our way of  life.  We cannot allow Al Qaeda the opportunity  to establish a permanent base  in  Iraq  from  which  to attack  the United States. The collapse of  Iraq’s new democratic government  would be a huge victory for Al Qaeda, drawing  additional recruits for bin Laden’s brand of terrorism from the ranks of young Muslims. It is  well-known  that bin Laden  seeks nuclear,  chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction  to  inflict severe casualties on  the  United States and allied countries.  Al Qaeda  conducted poison gas experiments on dogs in Afghanistan, and the governments of Britain, France, and Jordan have  each foiled plans by Al Qaeda to use chemical  weapons. U.S. intelligence sources have documented repeated attempts by Al Qaeda  to  purchase nuclear material, including weapons  grade uranium. Nations such as  Iran and  North Korea are a potential risk for transferring  nuclear capabilities to terrorist insurgents.  We must not fall into a sense of complacency.

1231,108,2006-06-15,Mr.  LATOURETTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  very  much appreciate the leadership allowing this  important discussion on the war in Iraq and  the ongoing global war on terror.  We can all regret the faulty intelligence that  overestimated the presence of WMDs. We can  focus on the need to press the new Iraqi government to meet speedy and attainable goals  for  the  responsibility  for  their own security.  But, we should never underestimate what’s at  stake in Iraq for their people or ours.  Nor should we ever permit the use of propaganda or terrorist barbarism to signal to the  brave men and women serving this Nation in  uniform that the resolve of our country is wavering.  There are many  thoughts  that  I could  lay  upon the record of this body about the war on  terrorism, but sometimes it’s better to shut up  and  listen  to  the voices of  those who know  much more than you or I. One of the casualties of war in my district was a great Marine—  Lance Cpl. Andy  ‘‘Ace’’ Nowacki. Andy, 24,  was a member of the Grand River Police Department and was killed by an lED in Iraq on  February 26, 2005. His  family,  though  filled  with grief, determined that Andy’s spirit would  live on  in many ways. One way will come  through  the establishment of a scholarship  fund at Lakeland Community College.  On March 31st of this year, friends, comrades and  family gathered  to honor Andy’s  memory and raise funds for the scholarship.  One of the people to speak that evening was  Lt. Col. Mark A. Smith,  the  former battalion  commander of Andy’s unit—the 2nd Battalion,  24th Marines. Lt. Col. Smith’s remarks, which  I ask through unanimous consent to appear in  the Record  immediately  following my own,  centered on the question of ‘‘Why.’’ He stated  in part: ‘‘. . . think the part that’s most lost in  public discourse in the ongoing global war on  terror is really the ‘‘Why.’’ We all know how  Andy died . . . I’d like to spend a few minutes  talking about why Andy died.’’  Mr. Speaker, Lt. Col. Mark A. Smith, with  the eloquence of a soldier, said it better than  I could ever hope  to, and  I commend his  words to the House:  I got a call  last Saturday when  I was on  duty from Sheila Nowacki, Andy’s mom. And  she told me a part of the ceremony was going  to be a pretty moving video, and she had a  slight task for me. She asked me if I’d speak  for a few minutes after the video, and to be  positive.  Now, as the commanding officer of 2/24th,  I don’t get the option of saying no to the families of my KIAs for whom I was responsible,  but in Sheila’s and Dennis’s case, I was honored that they even asked me to, so I immediately rogered up to the mission. So, here we  go.  The only way I know to be positive in talking  about Andy is to talk about—from my perspective and from the Marines’ perspective in this  room who shared time with him in combat—  why Andy died. Because I think that the thing  that’s most lost in public discourse about the  ongoing global war on  terror  is  really  the  ‘‘Why.’’ We all know how Andy died. Unfortunately, he was struck by an improvised explosive device while on an ASR in our zone. I’d  like to spend just a few minutes talking about  why Andy died.  Andy died because he was out engaging  the enemy. The single most misunderstood  aspect of this war is the enemy. And a professional war-fighter  focuses on one  thing and  one thing only—the enemy. He doesn’t focus  on time-lines, he doesn’t focus on how fast he  can stand up Iraqi battalions. He focuses on  the enemy, and  there’s a particular  reason  why we need to focus on this enemy. Because  this enemy  is  real,  this enemy  is vile,  this  enemy is evil. And this enemy has a 100-year  plan to destroy the United States of America—  a one hundred year plan. We think in terms of  the next football season and they’re thinking in  terms of 100 years from now and how they’re  going to destroy this Nation.  Can  this enemy win  this war against us?  Unfortunately, I’m here to tell you absolutely  he can. He can if he continues to focus on two  things which he  focuses on every day. The  first thing this enemy focuses on is breaking  the will of the American people. He does that  through videos, he does that through propaganda, and he does that through information.  The second way he can win this war is to continue to recruit future generations of jihadists.  It’s  for  these  reasons, and because of  this  enemy, that Andy was in Iraq. And while so  many still fail to get it, the enemy doesn’t. The  enemy understands Iraq is the focus of effort,  because he understands that as long as Marines and warriors like Andy are in Iraq that  the will of  the American people  is  foremost  and in his face. He also understands that that  is a will that can and does, at every opportunity of battle, destroy this enemy. And then  the second thing is what us being there does  to this enemy. Contrary to some popular opinion, is it does not create jihadists by us being  there. Quite frankly, we deprive them of the  next generation of jihadists because no one is  more helped and/or more impressed with the  Gentle Giants of America than the kids of the  Arab world. If you’ll just let me tell you two  very quick stories, I’ll explain why that is.  One day we were going out to conduct a  raid  to arrest  the Sgt. Major and  the operations officer of the Iraqi Army battalion that  we were  training. Upon moving  into  our  cordoned positions  in  the  raid  force—hitting  the objective and seizing the Sgt. Major of the  Iraqi Army battalion—his very children,  the  children of the Sgt. Major that we had in flex  cuffs and blindfolded, were  running around  their front yard acting as if they were holding  weapons and shooting at the Marines. One of  the Marines went up to them, and he took the  interpreter with him, and he said, ‘‘Ask these  kids what they’re doing.’’ And the interpreter  asked  them, and  the kids said,  in English,  ‘‘Mistah, we play U.S. Marines, Mistah. We  U.S. Marines.’’  I don’t think those kids are going to grow up  to be jihadists. I think those kids are going to  grow up to be the honorable people that they  saw the U.S. Marines in their zone to be. Further proof of  that was mentioned by your  emcee tonight when she showed you that picture of Andy and those two Iraqi kids. They  say a picture  tells a  thousand stories  . . .  that’s not a staged picture. That is honest respect  for an American Marine, who  in  this  case was Andy Nowacki. And there are thousands of them out there affecting those Iraqi  kids every day.  The second story I want to tell you about is  the election—the very first Iraqi election that  occurred in our zone. In order to truly understand it, you have to back up to December of  2004. The election was scheduled for 31 January of 2005. Exactly two weeks before the  election was to be held, the Iraqi government  said there was no way an election would be  held in our zone because in that point in time  there were two triangles that were famous in  Iraq. One was the Sunni Triangle and one was  the Triangle of Death. The Triangle of Death  was our zone and it was so named because  for four months at that time, on a daily basis,  we had gone forward, we had seized terrain,  we had lived the misery of the Iraqi people.  We had become  their neighbors and,  in so  doing, we had slung steel and harsh language  with this enemy on a daily basis, and they did  not  like  that. They did not  like  the  fact  that  these Marines were forward—living and earning  the respect of  the  Iraqi people. But we  were able  to convince  the  Iraqi government  that as a result of the efforts of Marines like  Andy,  the  Iraqi people would come out and  vote. We  couldn’t guarantee  them  that  it  wouldn’t be violent, but we guaranteed them  they would come out and vote.  Now I ask you to picture, in two weeks, having to put together eight polling places. That  meant  that we had  to  tactically go out 48  hours prior and we had to seize the locations.  We had to set up all the force protection that  would allow the Marines to protect the Iraqis  from what we knew would be constant and  sure attacks on election day. And then most  importantly, we had to transport 500 workers  from the city of Baghdad to down to our Battalion FOB, house  them  for  two days, and  then move them safely to those eight polling  sites. You can rest assured that was one big,  juicy target that the terrorist wanted to hit. We  were able to accomplish all that, but the most  telling time in all of that is where we housed  these 500 election workers was  in our battalion chow hall. My battalion major . . . had  a section of our chow hall that was dedicated  to our fallen Marines. At that time, there were  12 of them. He had their pictures, and we had  an American and a Marine Corps flag. Now for  those of  you who’ve never been  to  Iraq,  who’ve never spent time with the Iraqi people,  when you get two of them together, the noise  level, the amount of smoking and the amount  of drinking that goes on is pretty mind-numbing. When you put 500 of them in a facility, it  borders on chaos. Now we accepted that that  was going  to have  to be  the cost—that our  chow hall was probably going  to get pretty  torn up. And it did, except for one spot.  Any time any of those Iraqi election workers  got anywhere near the Sgt. Major’s memorial,  absolute,  utter  respectful,  solemn  silence.  They  respected  the Marines and what  they  were doing for them, and that was a sight that  I will  take with me  to my grave, and  that  makes me challenge those who say we’re creating jihadists. I argue we are doing just the  opposite. On that very election day, the mortars flew, the mortars flew intently. All eight of  our sites started getting mortared and rocketed about 30 minutes before the polls were  supposed to open. I was sitting in my COC  thinking, ‘‘Well, there’s the end of my career.

1233,115,2006-06-15,Mr. FORTENBERRY.," Mr. Speaker,  on June 6 we commemorated D Day,  the day that American military forces  stormed the coast of France 62 years  ago to turn the tide in one of the most  brutal conflicts  the world has ever  known. The United States sustained  6,603 casualties that day, yet the final  victory over the forces of fascism remained nearly a year away.  Rows of silent graves at the American Military Cemetery in Normandy  bear witness to the high price of freedom. They solemnly remind us that  there is no substitute for perseverance  and sacrifice if we are to prevail over  the threats which challenge this Nation and the world today.  The global war on terror is a different war from the wars of the past.  This is not a war of uniformed armies  on clearly defined battlefields. It is a  war that  invades tranquil space and  time without warning, carried out by  those who hide among and behind civilian populations, seeking to exploit the  vulnerable for ruthless purposes.  While we have endured the sacrifice  of global wars during the past, we have  never waged  a war  in  an  age  of  globalization,  in an age when  technology eviscerates the concept of distance, magnifies our losses, trivializes  our accomplishments, and places our  adversaries in a far better position to  leverage the freedoms of our society  against us.  In seeking to prevent another 9/11,  the President and the United States  Congress would have been utterly irresponsible to ignore the threat posed by  Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It is important to note that  in 1998 President  Clinton ordered U.S. Armed Forces to  strike military and security targets in  Iraq because Iraq’s nuclear, chemical  and biological weapons programs posed  a credible and serious threat.  But I am not here to argue the case  for war today. The United States and  our coalition partners made judgments  to enter Iraq based upon the best available evidence, and now the commitment is ours to complete. We are all in  this together, and the successful progression of our commitment in Iraq,  from which I remain convinced that an  abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops would  do more harm than good, is vital to  achieving national security for America, stability and hope for all peoples of  the Middle East, and establishing the  prospects for civil reforms and long-  term  peace  throughout  the  entire  world.  While our mission continues to be  dangerous and costly, it continues to  make strong progress as well. The recent establishment of democratic institutions in Iraq is without cultural or  historical precedent. This  fact, combined with rapid progress in the deployment of Iraqi security forces, gives  us realistic hope of diminishing conflict and a stable foundation for the  prospects of long-term peace.  As we proceed with our obligation,  may each one of us endeavor to discharge our responsibilities in a manner  that is worthy of the sacrifices of the  United States Armed Forces.  And may each of us recall that this  obligation is ultimately connected to  the mantle of leadership that has fallen  to the United States, not only for our  own welfare, but for the welfare of the  entire world.  f  IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION  ",2006
1234,115,2006-06-15,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DAVIS) is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2006
1235,115,2006-06-15,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  on October 10, 2002, this Congress voted  to give the President of the United  States broad powers to engage in a unilateral  first strike war against Iraq  without a clearly demonstrated and  imminent  threat  of  attack  on  the  United States.  Our oath of office as Members of Congress, our constitutional charge, the  mandate laid upon us by the people,  does not permit us to delegate the responsibility of engaging the awesome  military power of the United States.  Our oath of office does not permit us  to delegate our responsibilities in placing our fighting men and women in the  field of battle, and I commend each and  every one of them for the sacrifices  they are making  for  freedom-loving  people throughout the world.  Our Constitution places the power to  declare war squarely and solely in the  Congress. This  issue rises  far above  partisan politics.  President Lincoln put our congressional responsibility this way, when he  said: ‘‘We cannot escape history. We of  this Congress and this administration  will be remembered  in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another  of us. The fiery trial through which we  pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation.’’  I opposed that initial resolution, and  I would later oppose because after all  of the  information I have seen, and  after all I have heard, neither I nor a  majority of the residents of my district, the 7th Congressional District of  Illinois, are convinced that the war is  our only, our best or was our most immediate option.  I was not convinced, and I am still  not  convinced,  that  the  resolution  would properly guide us to act cooperatively and legally through the United  Nations with the agreement and the involvement of the international community. In fact, it led us to pursue risky,  unilateral actions in defiance of international law and the United Nations  Charter.  As the American people are attempting to make sense of this complex situation, it is the duty of Congress to ask  some hard questions.  What are we accomplishing by keeping our troops in immediate danger in  Iraq? In my judgment, the answer is  not much.  b2300  In my judgment, commitment to the  peaceful solution of problems and conflict is an important part of what our  democracy should stand for, and that  does not necessitate or demand continuous military presence in Iraq.  I am a member of the Out of Iraq  Caucus, and we need to prepare for an  honorable way out. It is my profound  hope that as we press forward, we will  press forward towards the mark of a  high calling; that we will take the high  road; that we will take the road that  leads to peace and not to war, the road  to peace based on mutual security and  international cooperation.  Let us walk the road to peace knowing that it is also the road to the rights  we have defined in the United Nations  Charter for all humankind. Let us walk  the road to peace not because it is the  easiest road or the smoothest road or  the shortest road, but knowing that it  is the right road for the American people.  Sometimes in the pursuit of noble  and  inescapable goals  it takes more  courage and more vision not to fight or  to  fight  in a different way. We can  fight by arming, training, and equipping the Iraqi military and civilian police forces to provide security and protection for the Iraqi people in their  country. We can  fight by providing  clean water, food, and medicine to the  Iraqis.  This is one of those times when we  must take the road that leads to peace  and not down the path to continuous  destruction. Let us have the courage  and the vision to  find a permanent  peace and security, to remove the presence of terrorism and not just drive it  underground. Surely, if America has a  destiny, it is a responsibility to lead  the world to such peace.  This is a time of testing for all of us.  Let us not fail this great test. Let us  pursue peace, and not war.

1237,122,2006-06-15,Mr. GOHMERT., I certainly will yield.  ,2006
1238,122,2006-06-15,Mr. SHAYS.," What  is  important  in  your dialogue  is the terrorists. And  there was this argument: Well, the terrorists are not in Iraq. I am not going  to argue whether they were there before we went in, but no one can argue  that they are not there now. In fact,  the prince of the terrorists, al Zarqawi,  was killed. He was killed operating and  doing his handiwork in Iraq.  ",2006
1239,122,2006-06-15,Mr. GOHMERT.," Reclaiming the time,  it is such a great point. He was killed.  I will tell you, I do not know if the  gentleman has been hearing some of  the ridiculous reports. One thing we  have seen from this administration is  they cannot keep secrets too well. The  President went to Iraq without but a  handful of people knowing. But if they  try to keep a secret very long, somebody leaks from all over the place. And  so  there were  some  reports, and  I  couldn’t help but shake my head, that  said, We think they had Zarqawi on ice  in a freezer somewhere and they just  brought him out. And some have said  he was beaten to death, that a bomb  did not do that. Do you want to know  how absurd that is? Can you imagine  this administration having Zarqawi in  a  freezer  somewhere  for weeks and  somebody not leaking that? I am sorry.  That could not happen. That would  have been  leaked by somebody that  they have got Zarqawi on ice.  ",2006
1240,122,2006-06-15,Mr. SHAYS.," I do not know, if that is  the kind dialogue that has been happened in Texas. Most of my folks have  recognized that we got him and it was  due to good intelligence. But if I could,  you are talking about this administration. Let me just talk briefly about  what a former administration said, in  other words, what Bill Clinton said, according to John A. Torres  from the  Florida Today on June 13 in a meeting  he had on the 12th. He wrote, ‘‘Former  President Bill Clinton  told Florida  Democrats  on Monday  that  Iraq’s  fledgling government would  falter  if  the United States were to withdraw its  troops. He also said more terrorists  could emerge from that region without  an American military presence.’’  So he is arguing that without a presence it would be worse. Then he said,  and this is a quote: ‘‘ ‘The representative government  there  in  Iraq  is a  hopeful sign,’ ’’ Clinton said at a fundraising reception for the Florida Democratic Party at the Orlando Marriott  downtown. ‘But we need to stay there  long enough  for the politics to get  worked out,’ he said. ‘If we withdrew  tomorrow,  that government couldn’t  survive.’  ‘‘Clinton said he didn’t agree with  the original decision to invade Iraq before  finishing military operations  in  Afghanistan. However he said the focus  now needs to be on stabilizing Iraq and  he warned that occupying Iraq for too  long would  backfire.’’ Too  long  it  would backfire, but he is very clear: We  cannot leave until we stabilize Iraq.  ",2006
1241,122,2006-06-15,Mr. GOHMERT.," Those are important  words from our former President Clinton, who had said himself numerous  times that they did have weapons of  mass destruction in Iraq, that Saddam  did, and I am glad to hear that he is  recognizing  that an arbitrary withdrawal would be devastating.  There  are numerous  other  things  here in this document. If I could just  touch on a couple very briefly as our  time comes to a conclusion. He goes  through  about  how  the  picture  is  bleak, and he goes on to say: ‘‘Based on  the  above  points,’’  and  there were  seven of them,  ‘‘it became necessary  that these matters should be treated  one by one.’’ And he has a strategy.  The strategy is to use the media for  spreading  an  effective  and  creative  image of the resistance, or otherwise  the terrorists. Another point was to  create  division  and  strife  between  America  and  other  countries  and  among the elements disagreeing with  it. And then after seven more points,  he says:  ‘‘In general and despite the  current bleak situation, we think that  the best suggestions in order to get out  of this crisis,’’ he calls it a crisis, ‘‘is to  entangle the American forces into another war . . . ’’  ",2006
1242,122,2006-06-15,Mr. SHAYS., This is al Qaeda that is  saying that; correct?  ,2006
1243,122,2006-06-15,Mr. GOHMERT.," This would be al  Qaeda that is saying this. They realize  that they are in a crisis, they are big  trouble, and that we are prevailing and  that the situation looks bleak.  We believe the United States will  prevail in the global war on terror and  the noble struggle to protect freedom  from terrorist adversaries will be all  worthwhile.  f  LEAVE OF ABSENCE  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:  Mrs. MILLERof Michigan (at the request of Mr. BOEHNER) for June 12, 13  and 14 on account of a family emergency.

1245,129,2006-06-15,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, the conference report we have before us contains $94.5 billion in funding for the  war on terror, hurricane recovery in  the gulf coast, pandemic flu preparation, and border security.  We have to fund our troops. Therefore, I will support passage of this conference report. But I do so with reservations, mainly because resources for  the training and equipping of the Iraqi  army have been funded well below the  level requested by the President. As all  of my colleagues know, training and  equipping the Iraqi army is imperative  to the ultimate success of our mission  there. The security of the Iraqi people,  ensured  by  a  properly  trained  and  equipped Iraqi army, is our exit strategy.  Unfortunately, the must-pass nature  of this bill has led to the inclusion of  hundreds  of millions  of  dollars  in  unrequested, nonemergency  spending  and typical run-of-the-mill earmarks.  Examples  of  unrequested  and  nonemergency additions to this emergency  spending  bill  include  three Marine  Corps V–22 tilt rotor aircraft, two KC–  130J tanker aircraft, four C–130J cargo  aircraft, the advance procurement of  seven C–17  cargo  aircraft,  and  one  Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,  UAV. It also includes $975 million for  SINCGARS tactical radios, $675 million  in Army tank and Bradley Fighting  Vehicle  upgrades,  $130 million  for  Army STRYKER vehicles above combat losses, and $567 million for Army  trucks. None of these were requested  by the administration, and they are  not critically needed to aid in the war  on terror.  Let’s take a closer look at just one of  these add-ons. The conference report  includes $230 million to buy three Marine Corps V–22s. The President did not  request any money for the V–22 Osprey,  which is still in the development and  testing stage. In fact, the V–22 has not  even been deployed to an operational  squadron yet. If continued development  and testing goes well, the Marine Corps  will send the V–22 to an operational  squadron in the summer or fall of 2007.  I have to question why funding for a  nonoperational aircraft that is still in  the development stages is considered to  be an emergency in this bill. The answer is that there is no emergency need  for this aircraft—if there was, I am  more than confident that the President  would have requested the appropriate  funding in the emergency supplemental  submitted last February.  Additionally, the conference report  contains a provision which authorizes  the Secretary of the Navy to reimburse  shipbuilding contractors for ‘‘business  disruptions’’ that were incurred during  and after Hurricane Katrina. This provision may increase Navy shipbuilding  costs by $140 million over what the administration had requested. The provision is expected to primarily benefit  Northrop  Grumman’s  shipyard  in  Pascagoula, MS. This  language  substitutes Government funding for what  insurers would  pay  to  shipbuilders.  Northrop Grumman  is  suing  its  insurer, Factory Mutual, for those costs  associated with Hurricane Katrina.  However, in the near term, the appropriators have decided the best course is  to arrange a giveaway to an insurance  company and a shipbuilder.  Furthermore, the explanatory statement accompanying this conference report contains language stating that the  conferees agree with House and Senate  language delaying the Department of  Transportation,  DOT,  rulemaking  which proposes to give domestic air  carriers with  foreign  investors more  control over business matters. Yet this  legislative language does not include  any related provisions, and rightly so,  in my view. This greater control would  only be granted for business matters  that do not relate to safety or security  and only when  the  investors’ home  countries provide our airlines with investment and market access. I assure  my colleagues this statement was not  included by accident, and  its  intent  seems to be to signal to DOT that Congress does not approve of its proposed  rulemaking.  Here are some other notable projects  funded as ‘‘emergencies’’ in this measure: $16 million for hurricane repair in  the State of Pennsylvania; $40 million  for sugar and sugarcane disaster assistance  in Florida, which was not requested; $40 million for sugar and sugarcane  disaster  assistance  in Louisiana, which was not requested by the  President; $400,000 for disaster assistance to sugar cooperatives in Texas,  which was not requested by the President. $400,000 to the Chicago Sanitary  and Ship Canal Demonstration barrier,  which was not requested by the President; $9 million in drought emergency  assistance to communities in Nevada  and New Mexico; $225,000 to the Missouri Soybean Association for the purchase of a building for use as an incubation center in the Kansas City metropolitan statistical area; $100,000 to  the Boys and Girls Club of Greater  Washington in Silver Spring, MD for  renovation of Boys and Girls Clubs of  Greater Washington Clubhouse No. 2,  Clubhouse No.  4, Clubhouse No.  10,  Clubhouse No. 11, and Clubhouse No. 14  in the District of Columbia; $100,000 to  Wesleyan College in Macon, GA, for facility renovation, buildout, and construction; $125,000 to Craig County, VA,  for purchase, renovation, buildout, and  upgrade of a library.  I think we can fund this war—and indeed win this war—while also budgeting for this war. We know the war is  going to cost more than the over $400  billion we will have appropriated to  date upon enactment of this conference  report, and we know that the war is  not going to end as quickly as most of  us would prefer. But we need to continue our military operations until the  job is done. Withdrawing our military  presence prematurely is not an option  in my view, the view of many of my  colleagues, nor the view of the President or his advisers. We are in it to  win.  Instead of  fixing the problem, and  fixing it will not be easy, we have only  succeeded in making it bigger, more  unstable, more complicated, and much  more expensive. And adding hundreds  of billions of dollars that are more conveniently designated as emergency expenditures—so that they don’t have to  be budgeted for along with other national priorities—is only making the  fiscal problem that much greater.  Again, Mr. President, it is unfortunate that, at a time of war and with  such a huge deficit and burgeoning  debt, we continue to fund unnecessary  projects and load up emergency supplemental appropriations bills with nonemergency  items. We need  to  concentrate on providing  the  resources  necessary  for  our  young men  and  women swerving in Iraq to successfully  complete their mission, so that they  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:40 Dec 28, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\S15JN6.REC S15JN6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2006

1254,136,2006-06-15,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Madam President, I  was outraged this morning when I read  a Washington Post article that suggests that the Prime Minister of Iraq is  willing to allow an amnesty for those  who have taken American lives. In this  article, the Prime Minister of Iraq is  quoted as saying:  The  I  I  Reconciliation could include an amnesty  for those ‘‘who weren’t involved in the shedding of Iraqi blood. . . .’’  That is where his quote ends. Mr.  Prime Minister, how about American  blood? Are you willing to have reconciliation on the pool of American  blood that has been spilled to give your  people and your country a chance for  freedom?  Then to read on in this article, where  a top adviser to Prime Minister Maliki  is asked about clemency for those who  attack U.S. troops, he is quoted as saying:  ‘‘That’s an area where we can see a green  line. There’s some sort of preliminary understanding between us and the MNF-I,’’ the  U.S.-led Multi-National Force-Iraq,  ‘‘that  there is a patriotic feeling among the Iraqi  youth and the belief that those attacks are  legitimate acts of resistance and defending  their homeland. These people will be pardoned definitely, I believe.’’  Pardoned definitely? So those who  were armed and killed Iraqis, they will  not  be  pardoned. Those who were  armed and killed Americans, they will  be pardoned? That is outrageous. President Bush, you went to Iraq and you  said you wanted to look into the eyes  of Prime Minister Maliki to know that  he is a man you can trust, a man who  will move us forward. I don’t know how  deep you looked into his soul, but you  have to pick up the phone today and  tell Prime Minister Maliki that we will  not have the ability to pardon anyone  with the blood of American soldiers on  their hands.  Today we have hit the mark of 2,500  Americans who have given their lives  to give the Iraqi people a chance. We  have thousands of our young men and  women who have returned to America  wounded, who have lost their legs, who  have lost their limbs, lost their sight,  have had half of their faces blown off.  Their blood was shed in Iraq. Are we  going to stand by and permit an amnesty to be given to those who killed  our fellow countrymen?  I  intend to, with Senator NELSON,  offer a resolution that makes it very  clear that the Senate believes the Iraqi  Government should not grant amnesty  to persons who have attacked, killed,  or wounded members of the U.S. Armed  Forces serving heroically  in Iraq to  provide all Iraqis a better future, and  that President Bush  should  immediately notify the Government of Iraq  that  the U.S. Government  opposes  granting amnesty in the strongest possible terms. This has to end  immediately.  I hope, when we offer that resolution,  the Senate will speak with one clear  and unequivocal voice that the blood of  Americans and the lives of Americans  is not subject to any pardoning, and is  certainly not part of an offer that can  be made that stains the honor and the  sacrifices made by Americans.

1264,143,2006-06-15,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President,  I  will address the comments made by my  colleagues. I appreciate their thoughtful comments.  First, this  is not  just a sanctions  amendment. This is a sanctions amendment which imposes additional sanctions, but it also has a large prodemocracy component to support prodemocracy efforts and public diplomacy within Iran.  Second, with respect to the sanctions, I agree with some of the criticisms leveled by Senator LEVINthat it  adds things which were not in the previous versions. One thing it adds is a  nuclear components provision, which  says that if you are going to be a company that is doing business with Iran  in the development of their nuclear  weapons  capability,  you  cannot  do  business with us in America. If that is  objectionable to folks, I find it somewhat remarkable that we would want  companies doing business in Iran doing  business here. But that is a new sanction; he is correct.  What he is not correct about is that  we make  it more difficult to waive  these sanctions. In fact, we have made  it easier to waive sanctions. We have  given the President more time to waive  sanctions. In fact, the big difference  between the House bill and ours is we  are much more liberal with respect to  the waiver authority of the President.  In that respect, the House bill passed—  I have the exact vote—by a vote of 397  to 21. That is the bill which passed in  the House of Representatives  just 2  months ago. It has, with the exception  of what I have said, a more  liberal  waiver authority component that deals  with nuclear technology because of, obviously, this concern about the major  difference between the two. I suspect  that both the increased flexibility and  the nuclear component provision would  have very strong support in the Senate.  The other thing I wish to talk about  is what Senator WARNERreferred to in  the letter from the Secretary of State.  I remind everybody that the Secretary  and the State Department have opposed this legislation from the day I  have introduced it.  No. 2, I have had discussions with the  Secretary personally over at the State  Department, and we have had ongoing  discussions. They support aspects of  this bill. They don’t like some of the  sanction  provisions,  specifically  the  codification of Executive orders. I understand that. That has been sort of an  intractable problem we have had during these negotiations.  I also remind everybody here that I  bet I could pull out a letter identical to  the  letter  just read by the Senator  from Virginia on the issue of the Syrian Accountability Act, which passed  here after about 31⁄2years or 21⁄2years  of work, to try to get the administration on board with that  legislation.  The State Department opposed it, opposed it, opposed it. The President opposed  it. They  thought  it was  the  wrong time, something we shouldn’t  do.  I had three conversations with the  President on the Syrian Accountability  Act. The first two times, he about tore  my head off, saying how inappropriate  it was for Congress to act in this regard and try to impose sanctions and  mess around with foreign policy. The  third conversation I had with him was  a conversation where he said he would  sign it. Six months later, he gave the  State of the Union Address and took  credit  for the Syrian Accountability  Act as one of the great accomplishments of his administration in foreign  policy.  I believe the impact of the Syrian Accountability Act is pretty discernible—  what happened with the withdrawal of  Syrian troops from Lebanon. The Congress, when we act and do so in a responsible  fashion,  can make  a  difference. I believe this is an appropriate  time and appropriate subject for us to  make a difference.  Iran is the great threat before us. If  anyone believes that by being weak, by  not acting, by not stepping forward,  and by not getting involved and saying  we are going to hold those who cooperate with the Iranians accountable for  their cooperation, if we think that by  backing off on that somehow or another we will create some good will  with the hardliners who control Iran,  you have not been watching how the  Iranians  behave. They  respect  one  thing and one thing only—we are about  to give it to them, I hope—and that is  action, deeds, and a credible threat  that we will impose sanctions and we  will hurt their capability if they do not  change their course. That is what we  have an opportunity  to do here  in  about 2 minutes. I hope we take that  opportunity and do not simply say that  we like what the President is doing and  we are all for negotiation and we hope  everything goes well. It will be interpreted as stepping back, as weakness.  We cannot afford that.  ",2006

Now, the surprise here is that three  times before, when I had an amendment, the Senator from Pennsylvania  voted against it, would not include it,  didn’t want  to discriminate against  firms that do business with Iran and  that provide  revenues  that kill our  kids in Iraq. And now we have a flimsy  aspect. We say we are going to impose  sanctions; however, it will be out of  reach  of American  jurisdiction.  It,  therefore, will not apply to the company that owns it—in this case it happens to be a Halliburton—that has a  sham corporation operating in Dubai  based originally in the Cayman Islands.  That should not be allowed, that the  grasp of the U.S. Government cannot  reach these perpetrators of the kind of  indecency that places our soldiers at  risk because they are doing business  with an avowed enemy of the United  States that is providing funds that are  lethal to our troops over there.

1287,150,2006-06-15,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, I don’t  have a dog in this fight, you might say,  but I have been listening to this debate, and I wonder about history. I  wonder about the amendment of the  Senator  from Florida.  I  remember  reading so clearly that after the War  Between the States, the North lined up  those from the South and took their  guns and let some of them take them  home. I remember so well that after  World War II, we went through a process of trying to urge the governments  involved  in  the access  to obtain a  pledge from the former members of the  military that they would support the  new democracy. That was amnesty.  In Japan, we certainly had a period  under General MacArthur which was  probably the greatest period of amnesty that has ever been known. We  helped that country  immediately to  form a democracy and we never prosecuted the people who killed Americans.  I wonder seriously about what the  Senator from Florida is doing by telling this new fledgling democracy that  they cannot go through the process of  cleansing, go through the process of  trying to get people who were misguided, who were part of coalitions  that they now are willing to recant, if  they are, to come forward and support  this new democracy. What are we doing  anyway on the floor of the Senate trying to tell the new democracy what  they can and can’t do? I didn’t like  that story when I read it in the paper  this morning, but I was happy to see  the new statement from the security  people that clarified what they intend  to do.  But the time will come, if that democracy is going to succeed, when they  are going to have to fold into their population those who are willing now to  give up terrorism, those who are willing to put aside the activities of the  past which led them to attack Americans as well as any other—there are 34  other nations over there. Are we saying  just those who did kill Americans, they  can’t get amnesty, but the rest of them  can?  What are we doing on the floor of the  Senate trying to debate an issue as to  how this country is going to come back  together again? I am sort of appalled at  it, really. I don’t know if anyone else  is. But it seems to me that we ought to  do everything we can  to encourage  them to bring their people together, to  forget the sins of the past, to forget the  terrorists of the past, and to pledge  themselves to a new future of democracy and have people come forward and  say: I am willing to support this new  democracy. And if they do, and demonstrate that they do after a period of  time, shouldn’t they be recognized as  being loyal citizens of the new democracy?  This is a debate that disturbs me. It  disturbs me to think we are willing to  just seize the moment and make a political point—seize  the moment and  make a point—and not think. It is time  we started thinking about how we can  assure and take steps to help this country survive as a democracy. If it becomes a democracy in that part of the  world, it will be a marvelous success,  and I think it will lead to greater consideration by other countries of liberalization of their concepts and giving the  people more power.  I believe we ought to try to find some  way  to  encourage  that  country,  to  demonstrate to those people who have  been opposed to what we are trying to  do, that it is worthwhile for them and  their children to come forward and support this democracy. And if that is amnesty, I am for it, I would be for it. And  if those people who come forward and  want to obtain a better life for their  families in the future are willing to  support that democracy—if they bear  arms against our people, what is the  difference between those people who  bore arms against the Union in the War  Between the States? What is the difference between the Germans and the  Japanese and all the people we have  forgiven?  When I left the war and came home,  I had a deep hatred for the Japanese.  Today, Mr. President, I have a granddaughter who  is Japanese. I have a  daughter-in-law who is Japanese. And  her parents were involved in World War  II. Now, are we to understand that time  can heal, heal the pain of the past?  I really wish the Senator from Florida would have the courage to withdraw the amendment, just withdraw it  and say it was a political effort. This is  nothing but politics.  I will vote to  table it or vote against it in good conscience.  ",2006

On June 30–July 2, the  residents of Steele will gather to celebrate their community’s history and  founding.  Steele  is a thriving community  in  North Dakota. The city was founded by  Wilbur F. Steele in 1878. He purchased  the  land  from the railroad and had  hopes that the city would house the  State capitol. Mr. Steele constructed a  building in the city to serve as a place  for  the  legislature  to meet. Since  Steele was not chosen as the State’s  capital, the building became the Kidder  County Courthouse, which is still in  use today.  Steele is best known for its 381⁄2 foot  high Sandhill Crane. This piece of art  was inspired by the numerous birds and  ducks  that migrate  through Steele  each year. Steele has plenty to offer to  its residents and visitors, from the golf  course and parks to fishing, hunting,  and crosscountry skiing.  The community has planned a wonderful weekend  celebration  to  commemorate its 125th anniversary. The  celebration includes an all school reunion, parade, fireworks, auction, outdoor concert, a street dance, and much  more.  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to  join me in congratulating Steele, ND,  and its residents on their first 125 years  and in wishing them well through the  next century. By honoring Steele and  all the other historic small towns of  North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future  generations. It is places such as Steele  that have helped to shape this country  into what it is today, which is why this  fine community is deserving of our recognition.  Steele has a proud past and a bright  future.∑  f  ASSOCIATION OF ENERGY SERVICE  COMPANIES 50TH ANNIVERSARY  ∑",2006
1292,171,2006-06-15,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, today I  wish to recognize the 50th anniversary  of the Association of Energy Service  Companies and the beneficial contributions it has made to the oil and gas industry since February 1956. This organization has helped unite the oil and  gas industry and advocates the most  efficient production models for all of  the member companies, resulting  in  vastly superior oil and gas operations  across the Nation.  The  association  formed when  six  service contractors met and formed the  Association of Oil Well Servicing Companies to combat  increasing governmental  regulations,  rising  insurance  costs, and the rising difficulty in employee recruitment. With Mr. Frank  Poole appointed as the first president,  the  association  began  to  gradually  grow and gain prominence in the oil  and gas industry. Soon after formation,  the group grew to represent 35 wells  and 15 trucks and eventually placed an  association chapter in 17 oil-producing  States.  Over the past 50 years, the organization has blossomed from 6 members to  over  400. The  association  currently  boasts representation of over 70 percent of the well-servicing rigs in domestic oil production. In 1996, due to a  rapidly growing national membership  and expansive chapter representation,  the Association of Oil Well Servicing  Companies changed their name to the  Association of Energy Service Companies.  The AESC continues to lead the oil  and gas industry by providing a host of  services including safety training and  seminars on current and new  technology, environmental protection initiatives, monthly meetings of State  and local chapters, as well as national  meetings, conferences, and tradeshows.  Mr. President, as the members of the  AESC prepare to celebrate 50 years of  dedicated service,  I extend my congratulations to all of those members  who have remained committed to excellence in the oil and gas industry. In  a world driven by oil and gas production and consumption, this organization has provided guidance and regulation to maintain equal standards in a  competitive industry. For the next 50  years and beyond, I sincerely hope this  organization’s  leadership and dedication to fairness remains as strong as it  has been the past 50 years.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO ROGER MEIER  ∑",2006
1293,171,2006-06-15,Mr. SMITH.," Mr. President, today I  pay  tribute  to a great man, Roger  Meier.  The  late  Oregon  Governor  Tom  McCall once  said,  ‘‘Heroes are not  giant statues framed against a red sky.  They are people who say, ‘This is my  community and it is my responsibility  to make it better.’’’  When Roger Meier passed away on  June 5, I lost a trusted friend and Oregon lost a true hero. Through leadership,  vision,  and  generosity, Roger  made his community of Portland and  his State of Oregon a better place in  which to live, work, and raise a family.  Roger was a fourth-generation Oregonian and a descendant of the founders  of the Meier and Frank Company, one  of Oregon’s most beloved institutions.  Roger spent 13 years working in the  family business before venturing out  on his own and serving as president and  CEO of a privately owned investment  company for more than 30 years.  Roger earned a reputation as a savvy  analyst of the business and financial  scene. He  put his  intelligence  and  knowledge to work for all Oregonians,  serving for 13 years as chairman of the  Oregon  Investment  Council,  which  helps to manage pension funds for Oregon’s  public  employees. Under his  stewardship, Oregon’s portfolio of investments grew from $400 million to $7  billion.  Roger was also a tireless advocate for  and  a  generous  philanthropist  to  countless worthy causes and charitable  organizations,  including  the Oregon  Health Sciences University, Good Samaritan Hospital, and the Oregon Historical Society. Roger and his wonderful  and  gracious wife  of  54 years,  Laura, also had a special love of art.  Along with their good friends, Pete and  Mary Mark, Roger and Laura’s generosity has helped to make the Portland Art Museum into a world-class institution.  It was fitting that a memorial tribute to Roger was held at the Portland  Art Museum on June 11. My predecessor, Senator Mark Hatfield, spoke  at the service and said that there was  one word he believed best summed up  Roger: gentleman.  Senator Hatfield was right. A man of  courtesy, kindness, honesty and integrity, Roger Meier was a  true gentleman. He will be greatly missed by  Laura, by his daughters Alix and Jill  and their families, by his friends, and  by the community and State he served  so ably.∑  f  125TH ANNIVERSARY OF SOUTH  DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY  ∑",2006

1295,185,2006-06-15,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise to introduce legislation that enhances the innocent spouse equitable  relief provision of the Internal Revenue  Code. Through only minor legislative  modifications,  this bill clarifies  the  statute’s original intent, affording innocent spouses the necessary recourse  to  ensure  their  cases  and  circumstances are given a fair hearing.  According to section 6015(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS may relieve an innocent spouse of liability for  unpaid taxes generated through the filing of a joint tax return if ‘‘taking into  account  all  the  facts  and  circumstances’’ it would be inequitable to  hold the spouse responsible.  Little recourse exists, however, to  prevent the IRS from seizing assets or  garnishing wages if a petition for innocent spouse equitable relief is not approved.  Recent decisions of the Eighth and  Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals have  denied the Tax Court jurisdiction over  petitions for equitable relief under the  Innocent  Spouse  Statute.  Consequently, there is no mechanism for  review or appeal of these IRS decisions.  The story of one of my constituents  provides a  stunning example of  the  problem.  The IRS seized all of her husband’s  income to pay a tax liability incurred  20 years earlier, before they were married. Because the IRS seized the entirety of the income, the taxes on the  income remained unpaid.  When her husband died, the IRS pursued the innocent spouse for the taxes  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:40 Dec 28, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\S15JN6.REC S15JN6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2006

This year, The Bascom Mutual Telephone Company in Bascom, Ohio, celebrates  100 years of dedicated service.  Mr. Speaker, The Bascom Mutual Telephone Company in Bascom, Ohio, is one of  the oldest mutual telephone companies in the  State of Ohio. Founded in 1906, The Bascom  Mutual Telephone Company has succeeded in  providing quality telephone service to the residents of Bascom, Ohio.  Beginning operations on February 22, 1906,  The Bascom Mutual Telephone Company,  known as Bascom Farmers Mutual Telephone  Company from 1916 to 1953, began providing  telephone service to the residents of Bascom,  Ohio.  At  the  time of  its  inception  in 1906, The  Bascom Mutual Telephone Company began  operations with only eighteen members seeking  the  company’s  services.  Today,  The  Bascom Mutual Telephone Company, who is a  vital component to the telecommunications infrastructure of Northwest Ohio, proudly serves  over 940 members.  Throughout the decades, The Bascom Mutual Telephone Company, as a product of  Seneca County, has clearly distinguished itself  as an innovator and industry leader. Through  a dedicated workforce, top-notch facilities, and  excellent customer service, The Bascom Mutual Telephone Company has set a bench-  mark for how to run a successful business.  The  real success of The Bascom Mutual  Telephone Company comes not only from the  technological advancements of  its  facilities,  but from its employees. The management and  staff of The Bascom Mutual Telephone Company have  indeed provided  their customers  with the service and dependability that are expected of a first-class company.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in paying special tribute to the employees and  the legacy of The Bascom Mutual Telephone  Company. As all who benefit from this fine establishment gather to celebrate its 100th anniversary of service, I am confident that the excellent employees will continue the successes  of The Bascom Mutual Telephone Company  into the future.  TRIBUTE TO MOUNT PISGAH  BAPTIST CHURCH  HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN  OFSOUTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 15, 2006  ",2006
1297,213,2006-06-15,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to the historic Mount Pisgah Baptist  Church  in Orangeburg, South Carolina as  it  celebrates its 153rd anniversary on June 25,  2006. Mount Pisgah has been a beacon  in  times of  joy and sorrow  for  the Orangeburg  community, and  I congratulate Reverend D.  Edward Chaney and his congregation on this  significant milestone in the life of the church.  Mount Pisgah Baptist Church began as a  gathering of a small group of Christian slaves  in 1863. Two years later, this group broke off  from the First Baptist Church in Orangeburg.  They called their new church Sunny Side Baptist. By 1868, the congregation had grown to  fifty members,  and  two  years  later  they  changed  the name  to Mount Pisgah Baptist  Church. The renamed church began to grow  in size and its ministry. By 1877, Mount Pisgah boasted a congregation of 283 members.  The 20th century was momentous in the life  of Mount Pisgah. Remarkably from 1901 until  2000, the church had only three pastors. Reverend Nelson Nix presided over the congregation from 1900–1945. During his ministry, the  first church building burned in 1902. However,  Reverend Nix and the congregation rebuilt the  structure that is still in use today.  Reverend John D. Rhodes served as Mount  Pisgah’s pastor from 1945–1968, and was followed by Reverend F.G.S. Everett who led the  congregation  from 1969–2001. During Reverend Everett’s distinguished service, Mount  Pisgah was listed on the Registry of Historical  Places.  Today, Reverend Chaney presides over a  dynamic church  that  is among  the oldest  in  Orangeburg and South Carolina. The church  has added a multipurpose education complex,  and more property has been acquired for future expansion. Due to the enormous growth  in the church, Reverend Chaney has initiated  a Million Dollar Capital Campaign for church  improvements and new construction.  Mount Pisgah currently has 17 ministries  that include an outreach radio broadcast that  reaches  far beyond Orangeburg County  into  neighboring  Calhoun,  Colleton,  and  Dorchester counties. The church is also renowned  for  its music ministry  that performs  inspired  Christmas and Easter concerts.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating Mount Pisgah  Baptist Church on its 153rd anniversary. This  vibrant church has contributed to the rich history of Orangeburg and South Carolina, and I  offer my congratulations and wish Mount Pisgah continued success and Godspeed!  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE STEEL  FINANCING FAIRNESS ACT  HON. RON PAUL  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 15, 2006  ",2006
1298,213,2006-06-15,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce  the Steel Financing Fairness Act. This bill  helps our Nation’s beleaguered steel industry  by  stopping  the  government  from  forcing  American steel workers to subsidize their foreign competitors. Specifically, the bill prohibits  the Overseas Private Investment Corporation  (OPIC)  and  the  Export-Import  Bank  (EXIMBANK) from providing any assistance to  countries that subsidize their steel industries.  The Steel Financing Fairness Act also  instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to reduce  America’s  contribution  to  the  International  Monetary Fund (IMF) by a prorated share of  the  IMF’s assistance  to countries  that subsidize their steel industries.  One of the problems facing America’s domestic steel industry is that it must compete  with  foreign  industries  that receive subsidies  from their governments. Some of these subsidies are explicitly intended to provide these  companies with a non-market advantage over  American steel producers. The U.S. Government further compounds the damage caused  by  these subsidies by  forcing  the domestic  steel producers to support their major competitors through taxpayer-funded programs.  For example, according to the most recent  figures available,  the  five countries with  the  greatest EXIMBANK exposure are all among  the  top  ten exporters of steel and/or steel  products  to  the  United  States.  In  fact,  EXIMBANK has provided almost $20 billion of  U.S. taxpayer support to these countries.  Meanwhile, OPIC has provided almost $6  billion of the taxpayers’ money to leading steel  exporters. Thus,  the American  taxpayer has  provided at least $26 billion worth of support  to the countries that are the leading competitors of the domestic steel industry. This does  not count the funds provided these countries  by the IMF. Since money is fungible, the practical effect of providing aid to countries which  practice  industrial policy  is  to  free up  resources these governments can use to further  subsidize their steel industries. Thus, taxpayer  dollars sent to foreign governments and industries can benefit  foreign steel manufacturers  even if American taxpayer money is not sent  to directly benefit those industries.  However, hard as it may be to believe, organizations funded by American taxpayers actually use American tax dollars to directly assist  foreign  steel producers! For example,  among the projects funded by EXIMBANK in  recent years is an $18 million loan guarantee  to expand steel manufacturing in Red China.  Ironically, many of the supporters of these  foreign giveaways claim  to be promoters of  free trade. This claim makes as much sense  as a supporter of higher taxes and spending  claiming to be a fiscally conservative supporter  of  limited  government. Free  trade  is  the  peaceful exchange of goods and  services  across borders unhampered by government  interference. Taxing American workers to support  their overseas competitors  is not  free  trade.  Instead,  it  is corporatism designed  to  benefit certain politically powerful interests at  the expense of American entrepreneurs and  workers.  I have no doubt that America’s steel industry can out-compete the steel industry of any  country if allowed to compete on a level planning field. Unfortunately, due in part to government policy, today’s playing field is in no way  level. Congress must end  this economically  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:46 Jun 16, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15JN8.012 E15JNPT1 S K R A M E R M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o E R O O M H         ",2006

1306,6,2006-06-26,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4843, as amended,  is one of the more important bills the  committee brings  to  the  floor each  year.  On April 6 of this year, the Subcommittee  on Disability Assistance  and Memorial Affairs, chaired by Mr.  MILLERof Florida, took testimony on  H.R.  4843. The  subcommittee  then  marked this bill on June 8 and reported  the bill favorably to the full committee  by unanimous voice vote. The full committee reported the bill, as amended,  on June 22.  H.R. 4843, as amended, would provide  a cost-of-living adjustment, a COLA, to  disabled veterans and certain survivors  in the same amount given to Social Security recipients. All veterans who receive  disability  compensation  and  qualified survivors would receive the  adjustment beginning December 1 of  this year. Congress has acted on COLA  legislation every fiscal year since 1976.  More than 2.6 million veterans receive service-connected disability compensation. These  benefits  are  paid  monthly and range from $112 for a 10  percent disability to $2,393 for a 100  percent disability. Additional monetary benefits are available for our most  severely disabled veterans, as well as  those with dependents.  Spouses of veterans who died on active duty or as a result of a service-  connected disability may also be entitled to monetary compensation. The  amount of the dependency and indemnity compensation is $1,033.  Additional amounts are paid to survivors who are housebound or in need  of aid and attendants or have minor  children. Currently, about 340,000 surviving spouses and children are receiving survivors’ benefits.  The amendment to the bill by Ms.  BERKLEYwould also provide a COLA to  the dependency and  indemnity compensation transitional benefit. Established  in Public Law 108–454, transitional DIC is a 2-year benefit; and it is  intended to ease the family’s transition  following the death of a service member or veteran.  The Congressional Budget Office is  projecting a 2.2 percent COLA increase,  but it may be higher or lower depending upon the changes in the Consumer  Price Index. The exact percentage will  be calculated as of September 30, 2006.  The cost of providing a COLA is assumed in the administration’s budget  baseline; therefore, it will be budget  neutral. Additionally, H.R. 5385, the  Military Quality of Life and Veterans  Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill of 2007 fully funds a veterans’ COLA effective December 1, 2006.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. UDALL  of New Mexico. Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.

1307,20,2006-06-26,Mr. INSLEE.,  ,2006
1308,20,2006-06-26,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. LARSON’s leadership on this.  I wanted to talk about three hard realities in Iraq. It is very easy, tempting  when we are in the middle of a struggle, as our Armed Forces are, to forget  harsh  realities  and  to  become  emboldened by the rhetoric that is associated with war. But I think it is  very important for us, when our sons  and daughters and husbands and wives  are there, to  just take a very cold,  harsh, realistic look at what is really  going on in Iraq. This is not a moment  for rose-colored glasses. It is a moment  for reality. And I want to talk about  the three realities in Iraq today, because basically the debate over Iraq is  really twofold.  One side says that we should  just  keep doing what we are doing. We will  just trust the President to make the  decisions as he has made them in Iraq.  We won’t question them. We won’t ask  to accelerate them. We won’t question  the  strategy. Congress will  just  sit  back and let George Bush decide what  to do in Iraq.  Others of us  take a different approach that says the status quo is inadequate, that we cannot expect to keep  doing the same thing in Iraq and expect a different result. So we believe  we need some changes in Iraq. And I  want to talk about some three realities  about why we need a change, why the  status quo is unacceptable, unacceptable in Iraq.  Number one, the security situation.  The reality in Iraq is that the current  strategy proposed by the Bush administration is resulting in things not only  not  staying  the  same  but  getting  worse. If you take a look at the Brookings Institution, you can go online and  take a look at the Brookings Institution’s Web site. Anybody can Google  that to find Brookings. You will find  the statistics that I want to talk about  tonight.  Fatalities in Iraq of Armed Forces  are not only going down;  they are  going up. Compared to May 2003 and  May  2005, we are now experiencing  greater loss of our sons and daughters  in Iraq than we were 2 years ago, 3  years ago. Those are going up, regrettably. The Bush plan is not working  when it comes to protecting our men  and women in uniform.  When you looked at the wounded in  the Brookings Institution report, regrettably, they are not going down;  they are going up, compared to 21⁄2  years ago. When you look at Iraqi fatalities compared to the same time in  February, March, May 2005, they are  going up. When you look at the number  of car bombs in May 2004, to May 2006,  they are going up. When you look at  Iraqi civilians killed, in fact, the number of Iraqi civilians killed compared  to the same period about 3 years ago,  they are three times higher per month.  And I think we rightfully care about  Iraqi civilian fatalities from a sense of  humanity and  from a  sense of  the  American spirit.  When you look at the number of multiple fatality bombings, they are up by  a factor of 50 times higher than they  were 3 years ago, a 50 times increase in  multiple  fatality bombings  that  the  Iraqis are experiencing. When you look  at crime-related deaths, they are up 50  times what they were over 2 years ago.  When you look at the number of daily  attacks, they are up compared to May  2004. When you look at weekly attacks  on our service personnel, 2 years ago  they went from 185 to 620 now. Up substantially, unfortunately.  So the security situation under the  George Bush plan for security in Iraq,  all of the indicators are going in the  wrong direction. The status quo is not  adequate. We cannot  just  trust  the  President with making decisions  in  Iraq.  So I want to turn now to sort of the  life-style, if you call it that, in economic conditions in Iraq. We were told,  when we were briefed on this war by  Paul Wolfowitz and others of the President’s men and women, that oil would  be quickly restored in Iraq and that,  indeed, the Iraqis would pay for this  war by themselves. In fact, the production of oil today has still not reached  prewar  levels under that tyrannical,  abysmal dictator Saddam Hussein. We  still have not achieved oil and gas production records on one of the largest  pools of oil on Earth; they are still at  2.18 million barrels compared to 2.5 in  the prewar level. We still are not back  up to those levels. And we are paying  hundreds of billions of dollars today for  Iraq.  In electricity we, at best, are back to  prewar levels after 3 years and untold  tens of millions of dollars squandered,  American  taxpayer dollars. And,  in  fact, in Baghdad today I read they are  having a heat wave in Baghdad and  they still only have 3 to 4 hours a day  of electricity. You can imagine, after 3  years of sitting under a foreign army’s  occupation, with 3 hours of electricity  for your air conditioner. I read these  Iraqis said that, We basically sit and  look at each other. I read this comment by a middle-class Iraqi who said,  We are going crazy doing that. And I  can understand that.  The economic condition is not making substantial  improvement  in Iraq  under the harsh realities.  So now we turn to the political situation and ask ourselves if the George  Bush plan is adequate on Iraq. And,  yes, we have had elections and we were  all  thrilled by  elections. All of us  would like to see a democratic Iraq.  But there is a very harsh reality that  we think demands a change of plans in  Iraq.  b2030  That is, until the Shiia community  and  the Sunni  community and  the  Kurd community can strike the hard  bargains it takes to make a democracy  in Iraq, and particularly over access to  the oil resource, which they still have  not done after 3 years. It doesn’t matter what an outside force will do. The  current plan is not a plan for success.  Frankly, our continued presence in  Iraq is now acting as a security blanket to allow the politicians in Iraq to  refuse to move forward with hard compromises about oil revenues, which is  dooming our military to be there for  decades. That is why we need to send a  message to the Iraqi politicians that  we are not going to be there for decades and they must make the compromises necessary about oil revenues,  because they are shortly going to have  responsibility for their own country.  I am not the only one to think that.  There are some people with some skin  in this  fight besides Americans, and  that is the Iraqis. We went there to  help the Iraqis. It was based on false  information and deceit, but, nonetheless, Americans had I think the right  intentions. So I think  it pays some  heed to see what the Iraqis think about  this.  What the  Iraqis think about this,  when a poll was done January 31, 2006,  by the World Public Opinion Poll, and  that is not a group that has any particular dog in this fight, they went out  and asked the Iraqi people, do you approve  the  government  endorsing  a  timeline for U.S. withdrawal?  These are the people whose lives are  most dependent on obtaining a secure,  safe Iraq. They are not sitting thousands of miles away like we are, like  the President is. They are sitting in  these rooms with no electricity and 120  degrees temperature and bombs going  off next door where they can’t send  their kids out to play. They may be  considered perhaps the experts on this  issue. What do the Iraqis say about  that issue?  What they say is 87 percent of Iraqis  would approve of the government endorsing a timeline for U.S. redeployment. That is something we ought to  think about. I think there is a reason  for that. I think there is a reason that  87 percent of the Iraqis who are living  in such squalor and danger today believe that it makes sense for us to tell  Iraqis that the time is shortly coming  where the country will be theirs.  I  think the reason is they recognize that  their politicians aren’t going to get  around to disposing of really coming up  with an agreement on oil reserves until  they know that the day is coming that  the United States security blanket will  be removed. The Iraqis have  figured  this out. We should figure it out.  So we are here today saying it is not  enough  just to trust President Bush  with decisions in Iraq. Security is not  getting better, the economy is not getting better, the political situation still  really has not come to terms with the  necessary compromise, and it is time  for us to send a message to the Iraqi  government that they need to get serious about resolving  issues and redeploying our troops.

1310,48,2006-06-26,Mr. HATCH.," Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, this amendment is a  bipartisan  amendment.  It  is  overwhelmingly bipartisan. We have always  gotten over 60 votes. The House of Representatives passes it overwhelmingly  and gets the requisite two-thirds vote  every time. It has always been stopped  here in the Senate.  Bringing it up at this time is certainly not an election-year ploy, as we  have Democrats and Republicans who  feel very deeply about this issue. It is  bipartisan. The last time we brought it  up was in the year 2000. If I had my  way, we would have brought it up every  one of those intervening years so the  American people could really realize  what is involved here.  So today we begin the debate on the  flag protection amendment. This is an  important debate. This is a constitutional amendment. It ought to be difficult  to  pass  any  constitutional  amendment, and they truly make it  difficult, requiring a two-thirds vote of  both bodies. Assuming we get those  votes and it passes both bodies, it has  to be submitted to the States, and 38  States would have to ratify it, at least  38,  in other words, three-quarters of  the States.  I thank my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle for supporting this effort. I  especially  thank my  colleague,  the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  Senator SPECTER, for working so hard  to see this amendment through the  committee.  I  thank my dear  friend  from Alabama who just spoke because,  in his own cogent, very clear spoken  way, he has made it very clear this is  not  some  inconsequential,  inconsiderate, partisan thing that is going on  here. I also thank the majority leader,  Senator FRIST, for bringing it to the  floor.  Like I say, this is an important debate. A lot depends on this debate. In  fact, I would say it is a critical debate.  Should this amendment pass, we will  restore—that  is  a  very  important  word—the power of  the people over  their own Constitution. We will make  it clear that in America it is the people, not the judges, who are sovereign.  This is a debate worth having. There  has been a  lot of misunderstanding  about this amendment. I believe even  the distinguished ranking member on  the committee has misconstrued this  amendment in his remarks here today.  This is what the amendment says. It is  simple. It has nothing to do with free  speech. The amendment says:  The Congress shall have power to prohibit  the physical desecration of the flag of the  United States.  Let’s read that again. It does not ban  anything. It says:  The Congress shall have power to prohibit  the physical desecration of the flag of the  United States.  This body and the other body will  have the power. The other body has already voted it out of that body by a  two-thirds vote. Some say we are only  one vote short of having 67 votes. Some  want to make this a partisan debate. It  is not. Some want to make it an election-year debate. It is not. This is a bipartisan debate over whether we are  going to stand up and restore the Constitution to what  it was before  five  unelected Justices on the U.S. Supreme  Court—to four who totally disagreed  with them—decided to change the Constitution. Those who argue that this is  a change of the Bill of Rights have  failed to recognize there are millions in  this country—the vast majority—who  differ with those five unelected Justices. And there were  four with an  opinion, written by arguably one of the  most liberal Justices on the court, Justice Stevens, saying that desecrating  the flag is not free speech but offensive  conduct.  But even if you want to make that  argument, it does not belong here in  the context of this debate because what  we are arguing is whether we can restore the Constitution to what it was  before five unelected jurists, Justices,  on the Supreme Court changed it.  The Congress shall have power to prohibit  the physical desecration of the flag of the  United States.  I have heard Senators on this floor  criticize the administration and other  administrations on both sides of the  aisle saying that they have usurped the  powers of the Congress of the United  States. Yet some of them who are voting  against  this  amendment  turn  around and fail to stop the usurpation  of powers by the Supreme Court of the  United States in a 5 to 4 decision.  Well, don’t miss the point here.  The Congress shall have power to prohibit  the physical desecration of the flag of the  United States.  That is what this amendment says. It  is a simple statement of the power of  the people and of their Representatives  in Congress. So all the high-flown talk  about the Bill of Rights and this is  going to be the first time the Bill of  Rights will be overturned—come on,  the Bill of Rights was overturned when  five unelected jurists changed it and  changed the Constitution. Now we will  get it back to the people.  This amendment does not ban anything.  It does not amend  the  first  amendment.  It  does  not  prohibit  speech. What it does is simple. It restores the power of the people’s Representatives to protect the flag from  acts of physical desecration. That is it.  That is it. It is that simple.  The Congress shall have power to prohibit  the physical desecration of the flag of the  United States.  In the United States, we have government by the people. The Declaration of  Independence makes it clear that in  this country—for that matter, in any  just political community—the people  are sovereign.  Sometimes we need to be reminded of  this powerful truth. This is how Thomas Jefferson explained what he called  ‘‘the common sense of the matter.’’  We hold these Truths to be self-evident,  that all Men are created equal, that they are  endowed  by  their  Creator with  certain  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:02 Feb 06, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S26JN6.REC S26JN6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006

1312,69,2006-06-26,Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker,  it is a tremendous honor and privilege for me  to rise to honor four young members of the  AmeriCorps Program  for  their heroic assistance  to  the  individuals devastated by hurricanes along the Gulf Coast. The National Civilian Community Corps  (NCCC)  program,  under AmeriCorps, is a full-time, teamwork-encouraging, non-profit organization comprised  of individuals ages 18–24 who strive to serve  the community at large, wherever assistance  is needed. These four individuals, who so patriotically aided the residents of the Gulf Coast  area, reside in the 7th Congressional District  of Pennsylvania.  AmeriCorps was founded in 1994, through  the enactment of  the National Community  Service Trust Act. Members of the NCCC are  required to serve for a minimum of ten months  at a time, and are Red Cross-trained and certified in CPR, first-aid, and mass care. More  than 1,600 NCCC members have extended  their  relief efforts  to  residents of  the Gulf  Coast region since September 2005, and have  amassed  approximately  600,000  hours  of  service—a truly commendable effort.  Jaime Fabey, an NCCC Team Leader, led a  group of ten Corps members on two disaster  relief mission-projects along the Gulf Coast. In  partnership with  the First Baptist Church of  New Orleans, Jaime and her  team,  for  two  months helped save 16 homes as well as the  personal items of many families whose homes  were unsalvageable. Elizabeth Topham and  her  teammates spent  their  first assignment  helping with the construction of the Salvation  Army’s largest outreach center in New Orleans, which aided more than 12,000 local residents. Salil Gabale and teammates worked to  repair a warehouse that belonged to a non-  profit organization named the Green Project,  located in Covington, LA. Brian Beck offered  his support through carrying out damage assessments and recruiting for volunteers. Brian  and his team are currently building houses for  hurricane disaster victims in Slidell, Louisiana.  As the Vice-Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I have seen first-hand the  positive affects of  the NCCC. These  four  young members have no doubt played a large  role  in upholding  the excellent reputation of  this organization.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have within my  district four remarkably heroic and brave members of  the NCCC. Our Nation owes Jaime  Fabey, Elizabeth Topham, Salil Gabale and  Brian Beck and the rest of the NCCC volunteers our most sincere gratitude for their services. We are most certainly a safer country  because of their outstanding efforts. Again, I  have the great privilege of representing these  special individuals and honoring them for their  selfless service  to  those who needed  it  the  most during a time of national crisis.

Brookside Engine Company No.  1 was  founded on January 16, 1916, with 20 devoted  charter members. During  the  ensuing  90  years, Brookside Engine Company No. 1,  composed entirely of volunteers, has been dutifully serving the community and surrounding  towns.  Today, Brookside Engine Company No. 1 is  led by Fire Chief Sam Tolley, who presides  over a membership of 45 regular volunteers  and a junior division of more than 12 members  between 16 and 18 years of age.  The Mendham Township Police Department  was officially established on March 12, 1956.  During its 50 years of existence, the department has employed a total of seven chiefs, a  testament to its sterling reputation.  In 1994, Thomas J. Costanza was promoted  to chief, a position he holds today. To support  him, the department has 15 full-time officers.  These courageous police officers continue to  serve their community with integrity and honor,  providing safety and protection  to  the  residents of Mendham Township.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my colleagues  to join me in congratulating the volunteers of  Brookside Engine Company No. 1 on 90 years  of  rich  history,  and  the  officers  of  the  Mendham Township Police Department for 50  years of commendable service.  f  RECOGNIZING  AN  ARTICLE  BY  RABBI ISRAEL ZOBERMAN, SPIRITUAL LEADER OF CONGREGATION BETH CHAVERIM  IN VIRGINIA BEACH, VA  HON. J. RANDY FORBES  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 26, 2006  ",2006
1314,69,2006-06-26,Mr. FORBES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  introduce an article written by Rabbi  Israel  Zoberman, spiritual  leader of Congregation  Beth Chaverim in Virginia Beach, VA. The article by Rabbi Zoberman reads as follows:  Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s successful  first official visit recently to the United  States was an expected formality between  the leaders of two close and long-standing allies. It was also an essential opportunity for  the Israeli Prime Minister to extend the intimate bond between his predecessor Ariel  Sharon and President Bush, which Sharon  learned to carefully cultivate, to his own  budding relationship with a mighty and necessary friend.  Olmert, a skilled politician who has been  moving away from a somewhat abrasive demeanor, did find the right words of gratitude, deference and shared sentiment. In his  granted appearance as a special guest before  a joint session of Congress, he received no  less  than  17  standing ovations  reflecting  America’s genuine sympathy for the Jewish  state which transcends those who happen to  be in power on either side at a given time.  In fact, the vital alliance born of common  values and interest between the senior and  junior partners, has assumed a heightened  relevancy  following 9/11 with the complex  war on terrorism and the costly thrust to  bring democracy’s freedoms to the Middle  East and beyond. Who more than the ever beleaguered State of  Israel has experienced  what terrorizing onslaught on innocent civilians and a cherished way of life is all about?  The President gave his approving nod to  the Prime Minister’s unilateral plan of the  ‘‘realignment’’ (the latest term) of Israel’s  future borders in the absence of a peace partner. The Palestinian Hamas-led government  even rejects Israel’s right to exist and is  locked in a deadly struggle of a civil war nature with Fatah over running the Palestinian Authority. When will the Palestinians  stop the tragic cycle of never missing an opportunity to miss an opportunity? Olmert  voiced support for the seemingly moribund  Road Map which Bush welcomed, as  the  President reiterated his embrace of Israel’s  determination to hold onto its large settlement blocks on the West Bank while relinquishing control over sparsely populated territory to allow for the creation of a Palestinian state.  The Prime Minister, a former Mayor of  challenge-laden Jerusalem, is yet to be tested in Israel’s hot political crucible in his  country’s top position. It is doubtless that he  was given an extraordinary historic opportunity to affect Israel’s destiny and fully implement the vision of Sharon who was so  suddenly incapacitated at the height of his  popularity and on the threshold of fateful decisions having accomplished the controversial Gaza disengagement. But  likely  the  highlight of Olmert’s visit to the capital of  the world’s only remaining superpower was  the stern warning he poignantly delivered  concerning the impending threat from Iran,  and his revelation that the terror sponsoring  radical Muslim regime ghoulishly calling for  Israel’s elimination while denying the Holocaust is almost within reach, closer than anticipated of developing a nuclear capability.  One wonders if the Prime Minister personally presented  the priceless gift of  supporting intelligence reports, thus nailing the  unavoidable response that the United States  and the West are saddled with at this very  hour. The risks of hesitant inaction though  far outweighs those of resolute action, sending  a  powerful message  that  tyrannical  blackmail is unacceptable and that the resolve  of  free  nations  to  prevail  is  unshakeable. An ambiguous response invites  further aggression with rising costs. Iran’s  mullahs’ genocidal design on Israel, with Europe as a potential target as well while seeking hegemony in a critical region, ought to  alarm us enough. What should however be  clear is that Israel’s only option is to survive, it simply can not afford to absorb a  first nuclear strike. Have we not internalized  by now History’s painful  lessons, are we  doomed to forever repeat the past? I pray  not.  Rabbi  Israel Zoberman, spiritual  leader of  Congregation  Beth  Chaverim  in  Virginia  Beach, was born to Polish Holocaust survivors  in Chu, Kazakhstan,  in 1945 and  raised  in  Haifa, Israel.

1315,76,2006-06-26,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to announce that this past weekend  was designated by Best Friends Animals Society as Best Friends Kindness Weekend.  Best Friends Animal Society, based outside  Kanab, Utah, works with shelters and rescue  groups nationwide to bring about a time when  there will be no more homeless pets. Best  Friends operates  the country’s  largest sanctuary  for homeless animals, and provides  adoption, spay/neuter, and educational programs nationwide.  The purpose of Best Friends Weekend was  to remind all of us how animals enrich our  lives  through  their companionship,  friendship  and  love. Best Friends Animal Society believes that dedicating one weekend each year  to promoting kind acts  towards animals can  make our communities and our world a better  place.  Cruelty to animals often leads to cruelty to  people. I’ve been a strong and outspoken supporter of animal welfare issues since first coming to Congress, and I’ve authored legislation  to help protect animals and promote their welfare. Organizations like Best Friends serve as  a conscience to lawmakers and the country in  these matters and remind us that our first duty  is to protect the most vulnerable and innocent  among us.  This past weekend’s activities of kindness  inspired by Best Friends should serve as a reminder to all of us, that in this increasing fragmented society we need to be ever more compassionate about  the animals  in our world,  whether they are companion pets, service animals such as seeing-eye dogs,  livestock, or  nature’s wildlife. It also serves as a reminder  that the bond between humans and animals is  a vital one and is capable of bringing joy and  healing to people of all ages. Finally, it serves  to remind us  to be more kind and compassionate to our fellow man. We coexist in this  world—human  to human and human  to animal—and  those bonds must be maintained  and kept strong.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

JOSEPH CROWLEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 26, 2006  ",2006
1317,76,2006-06-26,Mr. CROWLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  wish a very special New Yorker, Mrs. Ozia  Mae Sturgis, a very happy 80th birthday. Mrs.  Sturgis commemorated this occasion with family members and friends at a birthday tea at  the William Hodson Senior Center. I would like  to join them in celebrating her life, her contributions, and her career of community service.  The eldest of 12 children, she was born  Ozia Mae Hammond on June 21, 1926, in Augusta, Georgia, and moved to New York City  in  the 1940s, where she met and married  Jimmie Sturgis.  Mrs. Sturgis and her husband raised seven  children  in  their Bronx home, where she  instilled in them the importance of education, a  strong work ethic, and  the value of  family.  Their children and seven grandchildren all still  reside in the New York Metropolitan Area.  She  is very active  in her church and her  community, serving as a past president and  current Board Member of the William Hodson  Senior Center  in  the Bronx. Last year, she  was the proud recipient of the Center’s ‘‘Mother of the Year’’ award.  On the occasion of Ozia Mae Sturgis’s 80th  birthday, I am pleased to join her family and  friends  in wishing her many happy years  to  come.

1318,2,2006-07-11,Mr.  BUTTERFIELD.,"  Madam Speaker.  Madam Speaker,  it  is my understanding that the House leadership has  agreed to bring to the floor this week  the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks,  and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights  Act Reauthorization and Amendments  Act of 2006. I want to thank the Speaker and the majority leader for their  willingness to go forward with this debate prior to our upcoming recess.  Madam Speaker,  the  1965 Voting  Rights Act changed America. It created the opportunity for minority citizens to fully participate in democracy.  Prior to the enactment and enforcement of the act, black citizens in the  South were disenfranchised, primarily  because of the literacy tests and because of the design of election systems  that  submerged  concentrations  of  black voters into large, majority-white  election districts. The result was that  African-American communities could  not elect candidates of their choice to  office.  Why? It was because black voters did  not comprise sufficient numbers within  the district and white voters refused to  vote  for  candidates who were  the  choice of  the minority  community.  And so the votes of black citizens were  diluted, which is a clear violation of  the principle of one-person, one-vote.  The Voting Rights Act permits minority citizens to bring Federal lawsuits when they feel their vote is being  diluted. Hundreds of  these  lawsuits  have been successfully litigated in the  Federal courts. In my prior life, I was  a voting rights attorney in North Carolina. As a result of court ordered remedies, local jurisdictions have been required to create election districts that  do not dilute minority voting strength.  When I was in law school 32 years ago,  there were virtually no black elected  officials in my congressional district.  Today, I count 302.  The Voting Rights Act also requires  some  jurisdictions to obtain Department of Justice pre-clearance to any  change in election procedure. This, at  first blush, may appear to be unfair to  those  jurisdictions, but the  jurisdictions that are covered have a significant history of vote dilution and this  requirement of pre-clearance  simply  assures that the jurisdiction does not  intentionally or unintentionally make  changes  in their election procedures  that will discriminate. This is called  section  5. Section  5 has  prevented  many, many  election  changes  that  would have disenfranchised minority  voters. It serves a useful purpose and  should be extended.  A short story, Madam Speaker, and  then I will close. In 1953 in my hometown of Wilson, NC, the African-American community worked very hard to  teach  the  literacy  test and qualify  black citizens to vote. They then organized and elected an African American  to the city council in a district with a  large concentration of black voters.  That was big news. When it was time  for reelection in 1957, the city council,  arbitrarily and without notice or debate, changed the election system from  district voting to at-large voting which  resulted  in the submerging of black  voters. The change also required voters  to vote for all city council seats on the  ballot. If not, the ballot was considered  spoiled. It was called the ‘‘vote for six  rule.’’  Needless to say, that candidate, Dr.  G.K. Butterfield, was handily defeated.  If section 5 had been in place in 1957,  this jurisdiction would not have been  able to implement the changes and this  community would have continued to  have representation.  Madam Speaker, we have made tremendous progress in this country with  respect  to  civil  rights  and  voting  rights. We must not turn back. I urge  my colleagues on Thursday to vote for  another 25-year extension of section 5  of the Voting Rights Act and require  covered jurisdictions to get the Department of Justice to analyze the voting  change to determine if it will have the  effect  of  diluting minority  voting  strength.  f  RECESS  ",2006

",2006
1322,2,2006-07-11,Ms.  FOXX.," Mr.  Speaker,  House  Democrats have been  talking a  lot  about their agenda lately, but each and  every time they fail to mention border  security or immigration reform, and I  suppose  for good reason. With their  lackluster record on immigration reform, I can understand why they hesitate to bring up the issue.  After all, Republicans voted to pass a  border security bill in December, but  Democrats, led by their minority leader, opposed the bill. Republicans voted  to pass the REAL ID Act to make sure  people who receive driver’s licenses are  here  legally, but Democrats,  led by  their minority leader, opposed the bill.  Republicans wanted to allow members of our Armed Forces to help perform certain border security protection  functions, but Democrats, led by their  minority  leader, opposed the amendment.  With a record like this, it is no wonder that the Democrats never mention  border security as a part of their agenda.  f  DEPARTMENT OF PEACE AND  NONVIOLENCE  (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

1323,2,2006-07-11,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, 5 years  ago today, on July 11, I introduced legislation to create a Cabinet-level Department of Peace and Nonviolence,  which would  employ  the  principles  taught by Christ, Gandhi, Dr. King,  Mother Teresa and others to create a  new  hope  for  violence-free  homes,  schools  and  communities  through  peace and character education, a new  hope that through peace education we  can even challenge the notion of the inevitability of war.  Today, thanks to hundreds of community groups, led by The Peace Alliance, momentum is building.

1324,9,2006-07-11,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, as I  said before, we don’t have any problem  with the rule that is before us today.  We have a problem with the priorities  of the Republican  leadership  in this  House.  As I look at the schedule today, as I  said before, we are out at 2 o’clock  today. We are dealing with the bill that  we are talking about right now and  then  some  suspensions  that  really  aren’t terribly significant. I am willing  to stay till 5 or 6 if we could debate the  minimum wage.  Let’s give the American workers an  increase in their salaries. The average  CEO  in the United States earns 821  times more than the minimum wage  worker, earning more before lunchtime  than a minimum wage worker earns all  year.  I think it is wrong to have millions  of Americans working  full time and  year round and still living in poverty.  I would like to think if you work in  this country you can get out of poverty. I think it is wrong to give Congress a raise when millions of workers  have not had a penny raise in 9 years.  Over 9 years, this House has given  themselves something  like $35,000  in  pay increases, and we have not even addressed  the  issue  of  the minimum  wage, and millions of our fellow citizens are  locked  into  this minimum  wage. It is wrong to give tax cut after  tax cut after tax cut after tax cut to  millionaires and to special  interests  when you do nothing  for minimum-  wage workers.  Nearly  15 million Americans will  benefit from a minimum wage increase  to $7.25 an hour, 6.6 million directly  and 8.3 million indirectly. Almost 60  percent of these workers are women.  Forty percent are people of color. Raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour  equals an additional $4,400 a year for a  family of three. That is 15 months of  groceries, over 2 years of health care, 2  years of college tuition at a public 2-  year college. I could go on and on and  on.  It is astounding to me that we find  ourselves back after the July 4 recess  and we are told we will get to these important issues like the minimum wage  when we can get to them. We have  nothing going on this week that will  keep us here beyond Thursday or keep  us here until 5 o’clock today or even  tomorrow.  What we are asking for is the opportunity to be able to debate the issue of  increasing the Federal minimum wage  and  letting people  in this Chamber,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  23:49 Jul 11, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11JY7.017 H11JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006

1330,23,2006-07-11,Ms. HOOLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 4  minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. FRANK),  the  ranking  member  on  the Financial Services  Committee.  ",2006
1331,23,2006-07-11,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, I strongly disagree with the  gentleman  from  Iowa with whom  I  often agree. I don’t disagree with him  entirely. I will stipulate that there is  nothing in the Bagavagida about gambling. But other than that,  I don’t  think he got much right.  He says that gambling on the Internet does not add to the GDP or make  America competitive. Has  it become  the role of this Congress to prohibit  any activity that an adult wants to engage in voluntarily if it doesn’t add to  the GDP or make us more competitive?  What  kind  of  social,  cultural  authoritarianism  are we  advocating  here?  Now,  I agree  there  is a practice  around today that causes a lot of problems, damages  families, people  lose  their jobs, they get in debt. They do it  to excess. It is called drinking. Are we  going to go back to Prohibition? Prohibition  didn’t work  for  alcohol;  it  doesn’t work for gambling.  When people abuse a particular practice, the sensible thing is to try to deal  with the abuse, not outlaw it.  By the way, this bill allows certain  kinds of Internet gambling to stay, so  apparently the notion is that those few  people who are obsessive and addicted  will not take advantage of those forms  which are still available to them.  But the fundamental point is this. If  an adult in this country, with his or  her own money, wants to engage in an  activity that harms no one, how dare  we prohibit it because it doesn’t add to  the GDP or it has no macroeconomic  benefit. Are we all to take home calculators and, until we have satisfied  the gentleman from Iowa that we are  being socially useful, we abstain from  recreational activities that we choose?  This Congress is well on the way to  getting  it absolutely backwards.  In  areas where we need to act together to  protect the quality of our life, in the  environment, in transportation, in public safety, we abstain; but  in those  areas where individuals ought to be allowed to make their own choices, we  intervene. And that is what this is.  Now, people have said, well, some  students abuse it. We should work to  try to diminish abuse. But if we were  to outlaw for adults everything that  college students abuse, we would all  just sit home and do nothing.  By the way, credit card abuse among  students is a more serious problem, I  believe, than gambling. Maybe gambling will catch up. But we have heard  many, many stories about young people who have credit cards that they  abuse. Do we ban  credit  cards  for  them?  But here is the fundamental issue.  Shouldn’t it be the principle in this  government that the burden of proof is  on those who want to prohibit adults  from their own free choices to show  that they are harming other people?  We ought to say that, if you decide  with your own money to engage in an  activity that harms no one else, you  ought to be allowed to do it. And once  you say, oh, no, but that doesn’t add to  the GDP, and that can lead to some  problems in families, then this is hardly the only thing you will end up banning.  The fundamental principle of the autonomy of the individual is at stake  today.  Now, I have to say, I understand a lot  of the conservatives don’t like it because there are people on the religious  side who don’t like it. Some of my liberal friends, I think, are being very inconsistent. We are for allowing a lot of  things. I mean, many of us vote to say,  You can burn the  flag;  I wish you  wouldn’t, but you can. It shouldn’t be a  crime.  You can look at certain things on  television  that maybe  other  people  think you shouldn’t. You can do other  things but you can’t gamble. There is a  fundamental inconsistency there.  I guess people  think gambling  is  tacky. They don’t like it. Well, fine,  then don’t do  it. But don’t prohibit  other individuals from engaging in it.  People have said, What is the value  of gambling? Here is the value. Some  human beings enjoy doing it. Shouldn’t  that be our principle? If  individuals  like doing something and they harm no  one, we will allow them to do it, even  if other people disapprove of what they  do.  And it is, of course, likely to be ineffective. The best thing that ever happens to illegal gamblers is when you do  a measure like this.  I hope the bill is defeated.

1332,37,2006-07-11,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to Mr. GOODLATTE  from Virginia.  ",2006
1333,37,2006-07-11,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in strong opposition to this amendment. A lot has been said here today  about motivations. Well, I won’t talk  about motivations,  but  I will  talk  about consequences of this legislation,  of this amendment.  The gentlewoman  from Las Vegas,  who has here on the floor lauded the  merits of gambling, or gaming as she  calls it, now offers an amendment to  make this bill that we have fought for  8 years tighter and tougher on gambling? I don’t think so. I will tell you  that this is all about undoing what was  done before.  The gentleman from Michigan tells  us that this  is what Jack Abramoff  would love to see. But this is exactly  the same method that Jack Abramoff  used to derail this bill 6 years ago and  5 years ago, by arguing that the legislation was not strong enough on prohibiting gambling, when he was representing gambling interests, a whole  host of gambling interests, offshore interests, lottery interests, a whole host  of gambling interests. And that is what  is being attempted here today.  This, Mr. Speaker, is an amendment  that is clearly a poison pill designed to  derail this  legislation. Regardless of  the intentions in offering it, 48 of 50  State attorneys general have come out  in support of a ban on Internet gambling. An amendment such as this that  restricts the right of States to continue to permit gambling within their  borders is nothing more than an attempt to derail the bill by undermining  the support from the States. That provision was in the previous versions of  the bill; that provision is in this bill  today, only it is even tighter.  The States have always had the right  to allow or prohibit gambling within  their borders. H.R. 4411 continues to  ensure that States have that right,  while imposing strict safeguards to ensure  that  the activity  stays within  State borders and does not extend to  other States. These safeguards include  requiring that the bettor, the gambling  business, and any entity acting with a  gambling business to process the bets  and wagers all be physically located  within the authorizing State, and that  age and residence requirements are effective and in place.  b1330  Everyone knows  that  technology  that enables  is no  to be  there  that  done on the Internet and, therefore,  there is no exception on this legislation for lotteries or any other form of  State gambling on the Internet.  Furthermore, H.R. 4411 gives new authority to State and Federal law enforcement to enforce the provisions of  this bill to ensure that States comply  with the safeguards established in the  bill and that the law is enforced to the  greatest extent possible.  The Berkley-Conyers-Wexler amendment would limit what a State can do  exclusively within its borders and infringes on the rights of the States that  have always had the opportunity to  create and enforce their own gambling  laws.  This amendment also deletes crucial  language in the bill supported by the  Department of Justice and the horse  racing  industry that maintains neutrality with respect to the Intrastate  Horse Racing Act, a separate Federal  statute that is not a part of this legislation unless you allow the supporters  of this amendment to inject it into this  bill.  This amendment  is nothing more  than a poison pill that would kill this  strong  bipartisan  legislation,  and  I  urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the  Berkley amendment.  ",2006
1334,37,2006-07-11,Ms. BERKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I absolutely am flabbergasted by the  righteous indignation being displayed  on the other side of the aisle, and it  shocks my conscience hearing what I  am hearing.  If the gentleman from Virginia is so  intent on banning  Internet gaming,  well, then he should be supporting my  amendment. Better yet, I should not  have had to introduce an amendment.  It should have been  included  in his  original legislation.  If we are serious about banning gaming, then we should ban all forms of  gaming, and I can’t possibly imagine  why he would be opposed to that. When  he says it is a poison pill, why, because  the horse racing association told him  they would fight this if he brought in  legislation that had this included and  didn’t make an exemption out of it?  I am absolutely astounded also by  the other gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  WOLF), whom I don’t think would be offended if I said that he was opposed to  gaming of any form. But I find it incomprehensible that in the year 2000  Congress approved a provision allowing  online betting on horse racing, and  during consideration of the bill on the  floor, Mr. WOLFmade a statement in  which he said, ‘‘This provision deeply  troubles me, and would expand gambling at a time when men and women  are becoming addicted to this process.’’  Now he seems to be okay with the  Leach-Goodlatte  amendment  which  specifically exempts the activity made  legal by this 2000 provision.  Now, if we want to let the States retain control of this issue, we should  not be voting on doing this bill at all.  It makes no sense. I would say that we  are interfering with the States’ rights,  not helping them out.  And if you are arguing that the bill is  neutral on horse racing, then why is it  even mentioned in this bill? And why  does the Thoroughbred Horse Racing  Association think they have an exemption?  Is Mr. GOODLATTE willing  to  stand up here and make a statement  for the record that the Thoroughbred  Horse Racing Association and horse  racing is exempt and the Department  of Justice can go after them and shut  them down? I don’t think so.  And if you had an opportunity to go  online, as  I did  just yesterday, and  looked at the horse racing  Internet  sites, it is page after page after page.  Anybody  can  log on. Anybody  can  place a bet. And I don’t see any way to  prevent children, and I don’t see any  way of keeping people from spending  their hard-earned money on that.  This creates a huge exemption which  we will have no control of, and totally,  in my opinion, undermines the bill and  makes a mockery and a farce of what  we are doing here today, or supposed to  be doing here today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
1335,37,2006-07-11,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speaker, to demonstrate that all of the opposition to the amendment doesn’t come  from this side of the aisle, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BOUCHER), a very loyal Democrat.  (Mr. BOUCHER asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1336,37,2006-07-11,Mr. BOUCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from Wisconsin  for  yielding to me, and I do rise in opposition to this amendment.  The underlying bill contains a carefully negotiated balance which reflects  existing laws that allow States to control gambling activities within their  borders. The  gentlewoman’s  amendment strikes that carefully negotiated  balance. Its adoption would doom the  bill. To those who support passage of  the bill and a ban on Internet gambling,  I urge a  ‘‘no’’ vote on  this  amendment.  Forty-eight of  50 State attorneys  general have announced support for a  ban on Internet gambling. But if the  amendment that is offered by the gentlewoman passes and States lose the  authority over gambling within their  borders, the bill will fail because State  support for it will be withdrawn.  The bill is very clear on what authorities States will  retain. States  have traditionally been empowered to  prohibit or allow gambling within their  borders. The bill  continues  to give  States that right while imposing strict  safeguards  to assure  that gambling  stays within a State’s border and does  not extend to other States.  Those  safeguards  require  that  the  bettor,  the business  conducting  the  gambling operation, any services that  support the wagerers and other support  services must be  in the authorizing  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:41 Jul 12, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11JY7.060 H11JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006

Notwithstanding any provision of this Act,  it shall be a violation of section 1084 of title  18 United States Code to knowingly use a  communication facility to accept any bet or  wager as defined in paragraph 6 as added by  section 101(3) of this Act, unless the Attorney General has certified that the person accepting the bet or wager eil1ploys a secure  and effective customer identity verification  system to assure compliance with applicable  age and residency requirements.

1344,44,2006-07-11,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, the motion  I offer  today  is a  simple and  straightforward  one.  It makes  sure  that underage kids cannot gamble on  the Internet, whether it is connection  to  interstate  or  intrastate  betting.  This is something that I hope that all  Members can agree on on a bipartisan  basis for, to me, protecting children  from being taken advantage of on the  Internet is one of the most important  things we can do as Members of the  Congress.  They should not be taken advantage  of whether it is with regard to gambling, pornography or any other respect. Children should be off limits to  predators of any form on the Internet.  The problem is, as currently drafted,  the bill has a loophole. Intrastate bets  have protections in general, but interstate bets are excluded. My concerns  are not hypothetical.  Two months ago, the Baltimore Sun  ran an article where the horse racing  industry admitted that they hoped to  prosper by reaching out to underage  children. I have made this article a  part of the RECORD, and I hope that you  will examine it.  b1445  To me, that  is not right, and we  ought to make sure that this legislation, which is purportedly designed to  limit Internet gambling, does not actually encourage it, especially for children.  Now, I would expect that the other  side may argue, for example, that my  amendment will gut the bill. But that  is not true. The amendment merely  serves  to  protect  against  underage  gambling  over  the  Internet.  Some  might also argue that there are already  protections  in the bill  for underage  gambling.  But  those  requirements  apply only intrastate. They left out the  more  important  interstate  requirements.  Finally, some may argue that the  amendment is a poison bill that will  kill the bill because it is opposed by  powerful interests, or powerful legislators. To that I say that if protecting  children from gambling is a poison pill,  than maybe this bill deserves to die.  The last thing we should be doing as  Members of Congress in the 109th session is putting children at risk on the  Internet. My motion would eliminate  the loophole in the bill for interstate  bets by children.  I ask my colleagues to join me on  both sides of the aisle in supporting  this commonsense motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2006

1347,44,2006-07-11,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speaker,  this motion  to  recommit was  dropped on us just a few minutes ago,  and we have had a very hasty analysis.  And it really is the Trojan horse. If  this Trojan horse is allowed to come  into the bill by amendment, there are  going to be three things that will happen.  First of all,  it would  require  the  States, every State that has gambling  in any form, to go to the Federal Attorney General to regulate gambling  within the State’s own borders. And  this really is a poison bill, because it  would mean that the States’ support of  this bill would disappear. Forty-nine  out of the 50 State attorneys general  support this bill, and they are gone if  this motion to recommit is passed.  The gentleman from Michigan says  that we ought to protect kids. We do  protect kids in this bill. And the language that is contained in his motion  to recommit  is unnecessary because  section 1084(c) of the bill does provide  age and location requirements. That is  ample protection, and it is enforceable  protection.  Finally, the motion to recommit is  confusing because it requires residency  requirements. Now, the bill has location requirements on where the Internet site is. It does not get to the residency requirements of the people who  are using the Internet. So there is an  entirely different definition, an  entirely different thing that will be almost impossible to verify.

1349,51,2006-07-11,Mrs. MCCARTHY.," Mr. Speaker, we  are hearing once again that there are  rumors going around that in January,  when we come back and there is a new  Congress, depending on who is in control, that we are going to be looking at  privatizing Social Security again. We  understand that the Republican Party  wants to make it their top priority.  The American people have already said  ‘‘no’’ to this shortsighted plan. The  money and trust fund belongs to the  people who put it there, and they are  entitled to guaranteed benefits. They  don’t want to use this money to gamble on the risky stock market.  Those in favor of the Republican plan  say that privatizing is the only way to  save Social Security. Granted, the fact  that people are growing older does  mean Social Security  needs  to  be  strengthened. But in reality, Social Security  can  be  saved  with  small  changes, and we have time to make  sure we do it right.  As it stands today, the Social Security trust fund will begin taking in less  in payroll taxes than it pays out in  benefits in 2018. That is 12 years from  now. But even if Congress doesn’t act,  the Social Security surplus won’t be  exhausted until the year 2040. That is  34 years  from today. And the worst  case scenario is that 74 percent of benefits would still be paid.  If  the Republican plan  is enacted  next year, they won’t be able to guarantee benefits in 2008, let alone 2040.  In addition,  these projections are  based on an anticipated lower rate of  productivity  and  economic  growth  than the U.S. has experienced during  the last 20 years. If the U.S. maintains  its current economic growth or grows  at a faster rate, the trust fund surplus  will expire at a later date.  While I believe Congress needs to act  soon, we don’t need to do it in haste.  Instead of radically changing our retirement safety net, we should follow  the lead of former President Reagan. In  1983, President Reagan  appointed  a  commission headed by Alan Greenspan  and saved Social Security for the next  60 years.  I urge President Bush to put aside his  dreams of privatizing and do the same.  Many Republicans won’t want to hear  this, but President Reagan’s commission raised payroll taxes to save Social  Security. But I believe we can come up  with a better solution today. There is a  middle ground between raising taxes  and privatizing. Let’s put our experts  to work on finding this middle ground  and creating a stronger Social Security.  Everybody  accepts  that  Congress  needs to act to strengthen Social Security for the next generation of seniors.  But any plan that cuts guaranteed benefits is a nonstarter. It is a nonstarter  because the centerpiece of the Republican plan, to privatize portions of Social Security does nothing to address  the  program’s  long-term  challenge,  which is to make sure Social Security  can pay full benefits for future generations.  Privatizing means less money going  into the Social Security trust  fund.  The President’s plan means fewer benefits for more retirees. The President  has yet to disclose how he would pay  for this plan. Conservative estimates  price the plan at over $2 trillion, driving the country deeper into debt and  burdening future generations with the  bill.  With our current national debt, a  multitrillion dollar expenditure would  almost certainly rely on selling bonds  to foreign countries for financing. I am  not comfortable with China, Japan and  the European Union controlling  the  purse strings of our retirement benefits, and neither are the American people.  We should encourage individuals to  invest money for retirement, but this  should be done outside of Social Security. Social Security was never  intended as the only source of income for  retirees. It was designed as a safety net  to ensure no retiree or disabled person  falls into poverty. We simply cannot  bet the future of Social Security on a  risky privatizing scheme.  Mr. Speaker, let’s not make a hasty  decision on Social Security that we  will live to regret. People have to understand that Social Security is a lifeline for so many of our seniors. When  we look at today, the people that are  working at minimum wage, when we  look where we see pensions not really  being there for the American people,  we need to certainly make sure that  Social Security is there. Widows with  children, it is the difference between  being able to stay in their home, feed  their children or becoming homeless.

I  also  want  to  thank  Congressman  TANCREDO for his tireless efforts over  about an 8-year period.  I was thinking the other day when  the Immigration Reform Caucus first  started that there was a handful of  Members, and I believe it was around  1998 or 1999 when it first began. And  now I think there are over 100 Members  in that caucus. Well over a third of the  House is in the Immigration Reform  Caucus. And the issue received very little attention prior to September 11.  After that the issue received greater  attention.  I will have to say that I remember  the days in the late 1990s when Mr.  TANCREDOwould come over here, and  others who would talk on this issue,  and it was almost as if he had leprosy.  They did not want to talk about the  issue. But the  issue  is probably the  burning issue in the country today. If  not, it is certainly in the top three.  And I want to thank Mr. KING, Mr.  TANCREDO, Mr. MILLER, Mr. GINGREY,  Mr. WILSON, and a number of other persons that are here tonight focusing on  this issue which is so crucial to the future of the United States of America.  If  the massive  invasion  is  not  stopped, we are going to be flooded to  the extent that we will drift into third  world status. For our children and for  our grandchildren, we cannot fail on  this issue.  You mentioned magnets, and that is  the reason so many come.  Let us talk for a minute about amnesty. In my district there are some  persons, I am pretty sure, here illegally, in the United States, and it is  common sense, street talk about why  they come. They say  if we can get  across  the  border,  swim  the  Rio  Grande, or walk across the mountains,  avoid the dangers and the pitfalls of  the gyrating temperatures, if we can  get to this country and we just stay  here a few years, history tells us we  will get an amnesty and we will be  okay. We can avoid the checks that all  the others go through. We can avoid  the background checks. We can avoid  the health checks. We can avoid the security reviews that going through a  regular visa process or becoming an H–  1B or an H–2B or an H–2A worker involves.  b1800  Amnesty  is  the magnet.  Other  magnets that you mentioned are anchor babies who get benefits in this  country and employer deductions for  employees, even if they are here illegally, which Mr. KING is addressing.  There are a number of other magnets,  but probably the biggest magnet is the  notion, if I can get there just for a little while and stay a couple of years, I  will be safe; I will never have to go  back.  There will be  some  in  that body  across the hall or  in the executive  branch down at Pennsylvania Avenue  saying there is nothing we can do; they  are here now, we cannot be firm. But I  would submit to you, as some of you on  this issue have stated in the past, if we  were to draw a line in the sand and say  the Senate bill that includes amnesty  would never become law, we will never  have it in this country, we are putting  a line in the sand tonight in saying no  amnesty under any conditions, those  that marched in by the tens of thousands would likely march out by the  tens of thousands because they would  know then that their hope for an amnesty like that which occurred in 1986  and  like that which occurred under  President Clinton would not happen  again.  Failure to address this  issue with  firmness and forcefulness is creating a  dangerous situation  in this country.  We have all talked about how those  who would do us harm can infiltrate  and become part of the flood that rolls  into America day after day, hour after  hour, and week after week. We must secure our borders.  We only have to look at the prison  population in the United States. I serve  on the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee of Appropriations. The head  of the Department of the Federal Bureau of Prisons testified before our subcommittee just a couple of months ago,  there are 189,000 persons incarcerated  in the Federal penal system. Of that  189,000, 50,000 of them, according to  him, are  illegal aliens. Think how  much we could reduce the Federal prison costs if we had no illegal aliens in  this country. Think how much you  could reduce local jail costs and State  prison costs. That percentage of incarcerated illegal aliens far exceeds the  percentage of illegal aliens in our current population.  I would like to close by mentioning  deficit reduction. I hear many persons  across  the  5th District of Virginia,  around  the  Commonwealth  and  in  other parts of our country say, we need  to get the deficit under control, we  need to be in a position in this country  of not having a deficit. When you add  up the impact of illegal immigration  on our local governments, our State  governments and our own Federal Government, you are talking around $70  billion per year, and that is probably a  low estimate.  Stop illegal immigration by saying  ‘‘no’’ to amnesty ever, and by adopting  a number of the measures that the  fighters  for border security support,  and we will go a long way towards ending the deficit in this country.  Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to address you.  ",2006

1354,72,2006-07-11,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," It is the same old  song, we don’t need a minimum wage  increase. Things are going  just  fine.  The President  said  the economy  is  doing great and  it  is benefiting all  Americans. Well, he hasn’t been to my  district, and I am sure he has not been  to a lot of districts around the country  where people are struggling.  I found it interesting, over the 4th of  July break where we do a lot of parades, and doing a parade is like taking  a poll in your district as to how people  feel. They will shout at you exactly  what they are thinking. As you are  going down and  shaking hands and  meeting people, you hear about the gas  prices and the lack of vision; you hear  about the trailers sitting in Hope, Arkansas. And you hear about the $9 billion being lost in Iraq. This is what average Americans are talking about.  And then the kicker is when the Republican Congress pushes a pay raise  for themselves, but not a pay raise for  the American people. Give me a break.  They raise the salary for Members of  Congress, but at the same time not at  least tie it to minimum wage and say  the American people need to be a part  of this, too? Come on. What is going  on?  No matter what issue you are talking  about, and this is the thread that ties  all of this together, the Republican majority is incapable of executing government as stated by our  friend, Newt  Gingrich.  Mr. Speaker, he said, ‘‘They are seen  by the country as being in charge of a  government that can’t function.’’ He,  the former Speaker of the House, the  father of the Republican revolution, is  now calling the leadership and the Republican Members of Congress ‘‘they’’  and also saying that they are in charge  of a government that can’t function.  Whether you are talking about negotiating down the drug prices or the $9  billion in Iraq, or FEMA, or any other  issue, I think time and time again they  are seen as being incapable of being  able to execute government.  ",2006
1355,72,2006-07-11,Mr. DELAHUNT., They don’t believe  in government. That is the truth. Their  version of government is simply the  smaller the better.  ,2006
1356,72,2006-07-11,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Unless,  of course,  it  involves their personal  life.  ",2006
1357,72,2006-07-11,Mr. DELAHUNT., Exactly. Unless it  involves involving the United States in  a quagmire.  ,2006
1358,72,2006-07-11,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. DELAHUNT,  I don’t want you to get too far away  from ‘‘they believe in smaller government.’’ They believe  in big government. The government has grown larger than any other time in recent history.  Out-of-control  discretionary  spending, pork barrel spending. An article I read last night, they said that  the President has dethroned President  Johnson as it relates to spending. What  they say and what they do, that is the  reason we are here on this floor. We are  saying  ‘‘they’’ because that  is what  Newt Gingrich called them, ‘‘they.’’  ",2006
1359,72,2006-07-11,Mr. DELAHUNT.," I was going to make  that point and you did it for me.  But let me say what we now see is big  government, big government promulgating and pursuing an agenda that is  not a conservative agenda. I think we  should make that distinction. It is a  neoconservative direction because traditionally Republicans have been committed to responsible government, pay  as you go, live within your means.  And government  is  important, but  there are areas where government does  not have a role. And yet here we are  today with this President and this Republican majority presiding over the  largest  expansion of government  in  American history. And the expansion  of government only benefits a small  segment of the American population.  That is what I would suggest is causing the anxiety and the negative reaction that we hear when we march in  those parades.  What about this Medicare drug program? It sounds good, but it is not  helping me. Who is it helping?  And how do you respond to a question: Why can’t you negotiate with the  large drug companies and secure discounts like you do through the Veterans Administration? Why can’t you  secure discounts of 40, 50, 60, 70 percent? Why can’t you do that? Why  can’t Congress insist?  And the answer is because the Republican leadership will not allow it. It  simply won’t allow it.  And, Congressman, we read about the  oil companies, the energy companies,  Big Oil, if you will. We understand that  in 2002 their combined net profit was  $35 billion; that’s a lot of money. Now  we see new figures that it exceeds $113  billion. It has tripled in about 3 years.  Congressman, can you explain to me  why you and your colleagues approve  of giving taxpayer money to Big Oil in  the amount of $14 billion? Can somebody help me answer that question?  ",2006
1360,72,2006-07-11,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ., Because they care more about the special  interests than they do about the people  they represent. It is as simple as that.  It is the only logical explanation.  ,2006
1361,72,2006-07-11,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Last night, and  Mr. Speaker, I hate to keep referring  back to last night for the folks who did  not see us here on this floor, the Members who did not see us here on this  floor last night, we talked about the  broke  out with minimum wage at zero, and  we talked about the White House meeting in the complex, and I am not going  to read The Washington Post article  chart Ms. WASSERMANSCHULTZ again, but  it happened  in 2001, ",2006
1362,72,2006-07-11,Mr.  DELAHUNT.," And these are the profits  that oil companies earned, record profits. In 2002 it paid off immediately at  $34 billion in new profits to oil companies. And in 2003, it went to $53 billion  in new profits.  This  is not something  just coincidental. There was a  strategy. They  wrote the energy bill. They came up  with the plan and they had access in  the White House and here in this House  of Representatives under the K Street  Project and got what they wanted. In  2004, $84 billion. In 2005, $113 billion.  Now these oil companies, as far as I  am concerned, they are just doing what  they have access to do. I am more concerned with those of us with voting  cards, Members of Congress, those of us  who have an A pass over at the White  House in the East Wing, that allow oil  companies to go in, say what they want  and get it on the backs of the American people.  Those profits don’t just come out of  the sky. They come out of the pocketbook and wallets of everyday Americans. While they are reaching into that  credit card and while they are reaching  in for that cash, they are passing their  voter registration card.  It can have  REP on it, it can have DEM on it, it  can have IND on it. Whatever the case  may be, the bottom line is it is the  same amount of money coming out of  those wallets, not because of  their  doing, the American people’s doing, but  because of the special interest influence over the Republican majority. So  that is what I am mainly concerned  about here.  The last chart I want to share, oil  companies, they are telling our friends  they are trying to head towards energy  independence. They will come to the  Hill and say this is what we are doing  with the money you’ve given us, the  taxpayers’ dollars.  I will tell you what they are doing. I  happen  to be one of  these  ‘‘Today  Show’’ watchers,  and  the  CEO  of  ExxonMobil was on there, a really nice  guy with a deep voice and everything:  ‘‘I thought I would come in.’’ This was  before Katie Couric left. ‘‘I thought I  would come in and give our side of the  story. We are for energy innovation.  We are for getting oil and gas prices  down.’’  This is what they are doing. This is  E–85, what we call ethanol. This is supposed to be the alternative to help us  with our energy independence. This is  regular, special, and super plus. This is  their deal. This is the old-school way of  doing things. This is the expensive way  of doing things. I am going to show you  how this discourages you from getting  ethanol.  You can use a Mobil credit card to  buy the three levels there where we invest in the Middle East versus the Midwest. This is the Midwest investment  using corn and other resources to make  it happen. But it says here ‘‘Cannot use  your Mobil credit card,’’ period.

1363,79,2006-07-11,Mr. GINGREY.,"  I  thank  the  tleman.  Indeed, it is true, Mr. Speaker, what  he is describing. In fact, I can relate  some personal experience to that.  I  think a lot of my colleagues know my  wife and I had our fifth grandchild, but  our oldest grandchildren are identical  twin girls; they are 8 years old, and  they were actually born at 26 weeks.  They  only weighed  one  pound,  12  ounces. And, Mr. Speaker, normally  that situation is fraught with a lot of  problems, and we were, of course, very  blessed that they did well.  But what Representative BARTLETT  is talking about is exactly right. And,  as he said, in human nature, you get  this division, and you may be dividing  at the eight-cell stage, you may be dividing at the four-cell stage or the 16-  gencell stage, and no harm is done. You  are basically taking away 50 percent; it  is almost like the wisdom of Solomon  in dividing a child without harming either. And it is amazing what human  nature can do.  And the gentleman said earlier that  preimplantation diagnoses biopsy of  the embryos so that you can avoid reimplanting an embryo that has a genetic defect that is incompatible with  life. And  these processes are being  done, the gentleman referred to maybe  a couple hundred cases that he was familiar with, with absolutely no harm.  So this is exactly the right track, and  so I do agree with your statement.  ",2006
1364,79,2006-07-11,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," I thank  the gentleman very much. I had forgotten that he had identical twins and is  very familiar with this, not just as a  physician but as a father.  I want to close with a note that a  very  fortuitous  thing has happened,  and let me put the next chart up that  simply is a page from this White Paper  that refers to this technique and that  credits me with this proposal early in  this process.  After I suggested this to the President, a very interesting thing had happened after that with a dialogue between Karl Rove and the White House,  and they were, in effect, carrying out  simultaneous monologues and thought  they were dialoguing. And that very  frequently happens, one of our big  problems in this world, which is why, I  guess, we have a State Department, because sometimes people think they are  dialoguing and they really are carrying  on simultaneous monologues.  But during this 5 years this technology has developed to the point that  the  British  now  are  doing  this  preimplantation genetic diagnosis. And  I am sure he won’t mind if I mention  his name. Richard Doerflinger made  one of the greatest contributions to  this dialogue of anybody when he suggested,  ‘‘Roscoe, the first thing that  you need to do with that cell that you  take from this eight-cell stage is to establish a repair kit for the baby.’’  Now, we are kind of trying to do that  with freezing cord blood. That is the  reason you freeze cord blood, because  later you may need it. That, by the  way, is not embryonic stem cell; those  are the adult stem cells. The baby’s is  an adult when it is born. As a matter of  fact, the day you are born, you start to  die. You are an adult when you are  born. The embryonic is when you are  first starting to develop; it is not an  embryo, it is a fetus at that time. And  the tissues are really in terms of the  genetic development; they are adult  tissues.  But if now the first thing that a parent does with that cell that is taken is  to establish a repair kit and take a second cell, because the six cells that were  implanted do just as well as the seven  that were implanted, with the second  cell, do a preimplantation genetic diagnosis,  if they wish. But the critical  thing is that we would get the stem  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:23 Jul 12, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11JY7.149 H11JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006

As required by law, the administration today releases  its updated estimates for this year’s Federal budget.  Compared to their estimate last winter  that the Federal deficit would top $423  billion, today’s news that the deficit  will decline to $296 billion is a testament to a dynamic and growing U.S.  economy. That is 30 percent less than  what had been forecast in just February.  It  is an economy that exceeds $13  trillion today, the largest of any country in the world. It is an economy with  an annual growth rate that has consistently exceeded that of the other advanced economies around the world—  England,  Japan,  Germany,  France,  Italy, and,  indeed,  the  entire Euro  area. It is an economy that has grown  $3.2 trillion since the end of 2000. It is  an  economy  battered  by  corporate  scandals,  the  terrible  devastation  wrought by September  11, and  the  worst natural disaster in centuries to  visit our shores. It is an economy that  has grown despite the more than tripling of oil prices in less than 5 years.  All this while  fighting an ongoing  battle to defeat global terrorism.  It  is an economy that has grown  steadily  for the  last 4 years and 8  months. It is an economy that has experienced job growth every month for  the  last  34 consecutive months and  added over 5.4 million jobs since September 2003. It is an economy that provided 151 million Americans jobs just  last month—the  largest ever  in history.

I don’t offhand know if those purchases are ordinarily subject to that seizure. I believe  most of what we are talking about is  personal seizure at border checkpoints  when individuals are crossing back into  the country, but the amendment would  cover any potential seizure by Customs  and Border Patrol.

1373,93,2006-07-11,Mr. GREGG.," If the Senator will yield  further, I think he may have answered  the question. As I understand it, it does  cover Internet purchases and purchases  by mail order. Customs has jurisdiction  over those should they come across the  border.  ",2006

1383,93,2006-07-11,Mr. GREGG.," If I could ask further,  the FDA position, as I understand it, is  that drugs which are unapproved for  sale which come across the border violate the FDA approval. The Senator, in  his statement, referred many times to  ‘‘FDA-approved drugs.’’ As  I understand the process today, the FDA views  any drug purchased outside the United  States, distributed outside the United  States, as being unapproved for sale  and therefore not meeting FDA standards. Is that not a correct analysis of  the FDA view of how it views drugs  that come into this country?  ",2006
1384,93,2006-07-11,Mr. VITTER.," I think it is an exactly  correct analysis of the FDA view based  on the fact that the FDA, at least in  this  administration,  is  completely  against reimportation, so they have defined FDA approval to specifically exclude reimportation.  ",2006
1385,93,2006-07-11,Mr. GREGG.," That is correct. But if  the Senator would yield further, the  Senator is making a point in his statement  that  these would be FDA-approved drugs the people are purchasing  when, in fact, they are not FDA-approved drugs because no drug that is  imported into the United States, distributed outside the United States, can  receive FDA approval under their rules  because the FDA decided they cannot  certify the efficacy and safety of those  drugs.  Isn’t  that  the FDA position  today?  ",2006
1386,93,2006-07-11,Mr. VITTER.," The FDA position is exactly as the Senator says. They are  against reimportation, so they have defined  FDA  approval  on  technical  grounds to exclude by definition anything that comes in from other countries. The point of my remarks is that  these are exactly the same as FDA-approved drugs.  ",2006
1387,93,2006-07-11,Mr. GREGG.," If I could inquire further, that is the essence of the difference. The FDA does not deem them  to be exactly the same because the  FDA cannot certify their efficacy and  safety. That is why the FDA has said  that because they are not manufactured here, because they do not have  control over the manufacturing process, because they do not know how  they have been adulterated or may or  may not have been adulterated or how  they have been synthesized, they are  not going to approve drugs coming into  this country. So there is a significant  difference between what someone buys  overseas and what someone buys  in  America.  ",2006
1388,93,2006-07-11,Mr. VITTER.," If I could respond, in  claiming my time, I disagree with that  wholeheartedly.  Yes, the FDA has refused to take any  action to do that. Can they? Absolutely, they can. Is it possible to do  that, particularly in the modern age of  packaging technology? Absolutely.  Most of the drugs we are talking  about, in fact, are manufactured either  in this country or in the same manufacturing points as the drugs that are  bought in this country. So I disagree  with the premise the Senator has laid  out. But that is certainly the FDA’s  position, not to attempt to do any of  that and to be completely, 1,000 percent  opposed to reimportation.

There is no question but that  the revenues of this country dropped  significantly at the beginning of this  administration. There  is obviously a  significant argument as to why those  revenues dropped. The point  that  I  made earlier, and which I think is very  valid, is that coming out of the 1990s  we had experienced an explosion of  growth, much of which was unsupported.  It was called a bubble,  the  Internet bubble. What  is a bubble?  That is when people are speculating irrationally—as at the time Chairman  Greenspan  said,  irrational  exuberance—irrationally in a way that is  basically creating stock,  in this  instance, which has no substance behind  it but is still being sold at a higher and  higher price.  That bubble burst. When a bubble  bursts, the history of economics is that  there  is a severe contraction  in the  economy that is experiencing the bubble. That is what happened to us. We  saw a severe recession begin.  We  followed  the  Internet  bubble  bursting with the attacks of 9/11. That  was a huge catastrophe for us as a nation, a vicious attack killing thousands  of Americans, but it was also an attack  on our economy.  These  two  events  together would  have led to a massive slowdown in our  economy had not the President had the  foresight to reduce the tax rates to a  more fair level so that entrepreneurs,  people who are willing to take risks,  were willing to go out and do exactly  that. The tax cuts were put in place,  and the tax cuts benefitted everybody  who paid taxes. It is hard to do a tax  cut to benefit people who do not pay  taxes, which seems to be the position  of the people on the other side of the  aisle. Essentially, the tax cuts benefitted all who pay taxes, but, importantly, it was to create an atmosphere  where the entrepreneurs in our Nation,  the people who are willing to take  risks and as a result create jobs, did exactly  that. They were  rewarded  for  being risk takers and job creators. As a  result a recession which should have  been severe in its slope ended up being  shallow.  We are now seeing ourselves coming  out of  that  recession. Now,  for  39  months, we have had a very strong recovery, a  recovery which  is played  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:41 Jul 12, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G11JY6.021 S11JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 2 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2006
1394,114,2006-07-11,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President, this  amendment criminalizes the unauthorized construction, financing, or reckless disregard which permits construction of a border tunnel that is a tunnel  between American  land and another  country’s  land;  namely, Canada  or  Mexico or any subterranean passageway along international borders.  This amendment is cosponsored by  Senators KYL, BOXER, TALENT, CANTWELL, SALAZAR, HUTCHISON, and BINGAMAN. This amendment was part of the  immigration bill. It was unanimously  added to the immigration bill by the  Judiciary Committee. I have tried to  hotline this amendment. It was cleared  on the Democratic side, and  it was  cleared on the Republican side with the  exception of one Senator. I believe it is  an important amendment. That is why  I am offering it today as an amendment to this bill.  Believe it or not, today the act of  constructing, financing, or using a tunnel between borders is not a Federal  crime. This amendment changes that.  In addition to criminalizing the unauthorized construction, financing, or use  of a border tunnel on one’s land, this  amendment also doubles the criminal  penalties for individuals caught using a  tunnel to unlawfully smuggle aliens,  goods, drugs, weapons of mass destruction, or  terrorists. The amendment  also allows for assets involved in the  offense or any property traceable to  the offense to be subject to forfeiture.  Finally, the amendment directs the  U.S. Sentencing Commission to promulgate or amend Federal sentencing  guidelines to provide for criminal penalties for persons convicted pursuant  to the language of the amendment and  to take into account the gravity of this  crime when considering base offense  levels.  One might ask: Why is this important? I will answer that. Since September 11, 43 tunnels and subterranean  passageways  into  the United States  have been discovered—26 tunnels along  the California-Mexican border, 16 tunnels along the Arizona-Mexican border,  and 1 tunnel along the Washington-Canadian border. The risk to national security that is raised by the use of these  tunnels  is one this body  is already  aware of. In fact, the Senate Appropriations Committee  included  report  language on this topic, which reads:  Policy on tunnels along the border: The  Committee  is concerned with the Department’s lack of a clear policy regarding which  agency is responsible for securing, closing,  and ultimately filling tunnels which are discovered crossing under our land borders. It  appears decisions regarding the handling of  tunnels are made on an ad hoc basis, depending on which agency discovers the tunnel  and has the resources to fill it. With nearly  four dozen known tunnels along our borders,  it is imperative a policy regarding tunnels be  developed.  And it goes on. It asks that this policy be developed not later than February 8.  This report language in the appropriations bill is a good first step, but it  is  just that. The cosponsors of this  amendment and I believe that we send  a further message that border tunnels  are a problem and they must be dealt  with. As I mentioned, 43 border tunnels  have been discovered  in  the United  States. These tunnels range in complexity from simple gopher holes a few  feet long at the border to massive drug-  cartel-built megatunnels costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to construct.  I recently visited a border tunnel on  the Mexican-San Diego border. Let me  tell you what I found. I found a tunnel  that was extraordinarily sophisticated.  It was six football fields long. It went  under other buildings. It went under  the border. The American side was a  large warehouse,  brand  new,  huge  warehouse, half a long square block,  kept empty, small rooms  inside the  warehouse. Inside one room, which I  will show you in a minute, was a hatch.  Down the hatch was a tunnel, a concrete  floor, ventilation, a pump  to  drain it, and electricity, as we can see.  This was the tunnel interior.  This is a picture of the interior. We  can see the concrete. At one end of the  tunnel was 2,000 pounds of marijuana,  and at the other end was 300 pounds of  marijuana.  This was the hatch in a room, and it  looked very benign. You simply lifted  up two  floor tiles, and under those  floor tiles, you descended about 10 feet  and  there was  this huge apparatus  which clearly had been functioning for  a substantial period of time. I found it  just amazing.  The building,  interestingly enough,  was sold about a year ago to an individual who never leased it out. I have  always wondered: Why wouldn’t you  lease out a warehouse? That question  still has not been answered to my satisfaction.  I also learned there is no law against  it. There is no law that says you have  to do due diligence on your property if  it is on the border to see that somebody doesn’t come along and dig a tunnel such as this and smuggle aliens,  smuggle drugs, possibly smuggle terrorists, possibly smuggle weapons. This  is a way to do it. Therefore, I believe  this amendment belongs in this bill.  My hope, given the  importance of  criminalizing this action, is that this  amendment will be  included  in  the  managers’ amendment. We will still be  delighted if that is the case. I am not  sure that is possible. I believe to allow  another period of time to go by with no  law that says it is illegal to build a  border tunnel unless you are authorized to do so, and has some sanctions  to it, is really long overdue. It would  be terrible if we found out one day that  a group of 15 or 16 terrorists came in  from Mexico or came in from Canada  to the State of Washington through a  border tunnel and we had done nothing  about it.  This amendment also says that the  owner of property along  the border  must be reasonably aware, must do  their due diligence to see that their  property is maintained and a border  tunnel is prevented.  I am hopeful this amendment will be  accepted and, if not, I will certainly  ask for the yeas and nays.  ",2006

1396,114,2006-07-11,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, I think  the Senator’s amendment  is a good  amendment and I would like to accept  it. There is an objection on our side to  our accepting  it at  this  time with  which the Senator is familiar. I am  hopeful we can resolve that objection.

If  her remarks are completed, the time  will begin to run against the Senator  from New Jersey.

1406,121,2006-07-11,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, I  come to the floor to quite literally say  amen to everything Senator COLLINS  has said on behalf of our amendment  and  in  respectful opposition  to  the  amendment that Senator CLINTONhas  proposed.  We had a disaster, a catastrophe last  year  in Hurricane Katrina that was  natural, and then we had a manmade  disaster which was the shockingly inadequate  response  of  the  Federal,  State, and local governments to that  catastrophe that was called Katrina.  So our committee spent months investigating, told the story, and considered  what we could do to make sure nothing  like the Federal Government’s  inadequate, incompetent reaction and response ever occurred again.  We considered the responsibility that  some have raised of taking FEMA, or a  replacement agency such as we are proposing, out of  the Department and  making it independent again. But it  made no sense to us. If you have a Department of Homeland Security, which  is supposed to be our major Department to prepare for and respond to disasters, natural  and manmade,  then  why would we want to take the emergency management agency, which is all  about responding to disasters, natural  and terrorist, out of that Department?  It would be, as I said at one of our  hearings, like taking the U.S. Army  out of the Department of Defense because you were not happy with the  management of the U.S. Army, so you  take it out. Or you had memories that  there used to be a Chief of the Army  who was good in a different time way  back when it was independent, and you  make  it  independent.  It makes no  sense. It is inefficient. I am afraid it  would compromise the ability of our  Government to prepare for and respond  to another disaster.  In some ways, this is a comparison  between James Lee Witt and Michael  Brown. I will be real specific about it.  I am happy to say in public that James  Lee Witt did a great job, and Michael  Brown did not, particularly in Katrina.  That shouldn’t lead us to think that  going back to the time when FEMA  was independent and James Lee Witt  was the Director would solve all of our  problems.  FEMA, under James Lee Witt, as  good as he was—and he was very good—  never  faced  a  catastrophe  such  as  Katrina. We heard testimony to this effect from people in the Department,  from inspectors general, from outside  authorities that FEMA never, no matter how good James Lee Witt was,  could have independently given an adequate response to a catastrophe such as  Hurricane Katrina or, God forbid, a catastrophe such as a significant terrorist attack. That  is why we kept  FEMA, our new USEMA, in the Department of Homeland Security.  We have  strengthened  it considerably. Senator LOTT, who was an initial  cosponsor of the amendment to take  FEMA out of the Department of Homeland Security, is now with us on keeping it in the Department because we  made  some  significant  changes. We  gave the U.S. Emergency Management  Agency that we would create, USEMA,  the special legal status that only the  Coast Guard and Secret Service have  within the Department of Homeland  Security. That means  it cannot be  changed except by statute. No executive action can change its status.  We also made clear that during a  time of crisis, though the head of the  U.S. Emergency Management Authority normally reports to the Secretary  of Homeland Security, that person reports directly to the President of the  United States.  I happen to have joined with Senator  SPECTER, my friend and colleague from  Pennsylvania, in introducing the original legislation to create the Department of Homeland Security. We did it  a month or two after 9/11 because we  felt we had entered a new age. We had  been attacked here at home, innocent  citizens were killed by terrorists, and  we needed a whole new structure to  prepare to defend the American people  against similar attacks in the future—  our enemies are  still obviously out  there—and to respond to those attacks.  We built our proposal on the work of  an independent commission headed by  our former colleagues Warren Rudman  and Gary Hart. They said loudly and  clearly that FEMA must be the heart  of this new Department if it is to adequately protect the American people  from disaster or terrorism.  It would be a profound mistake to  take it out. That is why I urge my colleagues to support the amendment that  Senator COLLINSand I are offering with  Senator CARPERand Senator LOTT, and  to oppose the amendment of Senator  CLINTON.  to  I thank the Chair, and I yield the  floor.  Mr. President, I saw Senator LAUTENBERGcome into the Chamber. I do not  see him now, so I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  CHAMBLISS). The clerk will call the  roll.  The  legislative clerk proceeded  call the roll.  ",2006

I  am trying to figure out why a name  change might be part of the plan to try  to make FEMA a more efficient agency. I think we are chasing our tail  around the tree because I don’t see how  we can do it under the present structure.  I want to start at the beginning. I  don’t plan to take all the time that is  available. I would like to go back a little bit.  When we  look at the structure of  DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, we see the complications that  exist even today with its general functioning: Are the screeners doing an effective  job?

George’s  tremendous spirit, dedication and  work  in  the agricultural  industry has greatly  helped  the citizens of Sampson County and  the State of North Carolina, and George  should be commended for his service.  George demonstrated a strong work ethic  and commitment to improving the agricultural  industry from an early age. After receiving his  degree in Animal Science from North Carolina  State University  in 1959, George began his  career as a 4–H agent with  the Sampson  County Agricultural Extension Service. Later,  George went on to become a livestock agent  and is now the Sampson County Cooperative  Extension director.  George has brought exemplary service and  visionary leadership to every position he has  held throughout his career. Not only has he  served  as  an  educator  and mentor,  but  George has helped make significant advancements in agriculture during the last 50 years.  For  instance, George has helped  implement  innovative programs, contributed to the utilization of new technologies in the livestock area,  and he has been instrumental in obtaining additional  funding  for agriculture. George has  been essential to the creation of the Sampson  County Friends of Agriculture.  George has received numerous awards recognizing his contribution to agriculture and to  Sampson County. He has  received awards  from the Cooperative Extension Service, has  been recognized by the beef and pork industry, and he has been inducted into the Sampson County Hall of Fame.  In addition,  the  Sales Arena and Show Ring at the Sampson  County Livestock Facility are named  in his  honor.  There may be no greater tribute to George,  however,  than  the  recent  creation by his  friends and colleagues of the George Upton,  Jr., Livestock Endowment for Sampson County. This endowment honors George’s outstanding 50 years of service and brings  together his commitment  to Sampson County  and its people with his passion for the livestock program. The endowment will be housed  by the North Carolina Cooperative Extension  Service  Foundation  and will  provide  programmatic  funding  for adult and youth  livestock programs, awards and  recognition  for  competitive activities, and educational scholarships in animal science. This endowment will  help ensure that George’s commitment to providing  improvement  to and opportunities  for  livestock programs  in Sampson County will  continue for generations to come.  We thank George, on behalf of the citizens  of Sampson County, NC, and the Nation for  his  remarkable  service  to agriculture. May  God’s strength, joy and peace be with him always.  f  HONORING THE STATE OF HAWAII  FOR  COMBATING  UNDERAGE  DRINKING  HON. NEIL ABERCROMBIE  OFHAWAII  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 11, 2006  ",2006
1415,163,2006-07-11,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to commend the Hawaii State Legislature  for  increasing penalties  for adults who  supply alcohol  to persons under  the  legal  drinking age of 21. I believe this is one important step  toward attacking  the supply chain  that  fuels  the national problem of underage  drinking.  According  to authorities, adults are by  far  the main source of alcohol for underage drinkers. A  report  to Congress by  the National  Academy of Sciences  identified  friends and  adult purchasers as the most frequent sources  of alcohol among college students and older  adolescents. Family members were cited as  the most frequent source for younger adolescents. The Century Council, a not-for-profit  educational organization dedicated to fighting  drunk driving and underage drinking,  found  that 65 percent of underage drinkers get their  alcohol from family and adult friends.  Hawaii’s new law is among 7 bills that have  passed into law and nearly 20 that have been  introduced in States throughout our great Nation that link underage drinking and providing  alcohol to those under 21 with a penalty relating to the revocation of driving privileges for  the offender. Diageo, a large beverage alcohol  company, in an example of enlightened corporate citizenship,  is among  the  firms  that  have led the effort to move this type of legislation in state legislatures throughout the country. As such, many have referred to bills like  Hawaii’s new law as a ‘‘Diageo Bill.’’  The American Legislative Exchange Council  has made the ‘‘Diageo Bill’’ one of their model  pieces of legislation for 2006. I urge all States  to pass this type of measure.  While only one piece of this important puzzle, the State of Hawaii along with the people  at Diageo and  those of similarly committed  companies should be commended for being a  leader in the fight against underage drinking.  f  TEXAS RANGER DREW CARTER—  TEXAS LAWMAN  HON. TED POE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 11, 2006  ",2006
1416,163,2006-07-11,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker, it was a scene out  of an old western movie: The villainous outlaw, realizing his defeat, surrenders in the hot  sun to the valiant lawman. For Texas Ranger  Drew Carter however, there was no mistaking  that  this scenario was not some Hollywood  fantasy, but a dangerous reality. On July 13,  1999, Ranger Carter was waiting, with a knot  in the pit of this stomach, at the center of a  bridge connecting El Paso, TX to Mexico. He  was waiting for true evil to show his face.  This tale begins 2 years earlier when a series of brutal murders occurred  in homes  along  the  railroad  tracks  in Texas. Texans  were paralyzed with  fear by a serial killer  dubbed  the  ‘‘Railroad Killer.’’ He baffled  law  enforcement because it seemed as if he randomly chose his victims and the times of the  attacks, making it impossible to know who and  when he would strike next. He used any  weapon available: a pickax, a sledgehammer,  a tire iron, a shotgun. The only common factor  was that each victim lived by railroad tracks.  Slowly, through cooperation of local, State,  and federal agencies, Angel Resendez Ramirez, an  illegal Mexican  immigrant would be  wanted for the brutal slayings. He was elusive,  slipping back and forth across the U.S./Mexican border more  than a dozen  times, and  evading several FBI arrest traps. It would finally  take  the unyielding efforts of Texas  Ranger Drew Cater to end Ramirez’s violent  reign.  The Texas Rangers are  the most well-  known and respected law enforcement officers  in the WorId, more famous than Scotland Yard  itself. Established in 1823 by Stephen F. Austin, the Rangers were the protectors of new  settlers in the untamed Spanish Province, of  what  is now Texas. They have done battle  with horse  thieves, bank robbers,  ‘‘Indians,’’  outlaws, and were even  instrumental  in  the  U.S.’ success in the Mexican-American War.  Over the next 150 years, the responsibilities of  Texas Rangers grew to include investigations,  fugitive apprehension, and assisting other law  enforcement across the State. They are elite;  there are only 118 commissioned Rangers,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:08 Jul 12, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A11JY8.023 E11JYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o y r r e h c y         ",2006
1417,170,2006-07-11,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my condolences to the families of those  who were killed  in  today’s  terrible bomb attacks on several Indian commuter trains. Reports indicate that these deadly attacks have  claimed the lives of at least 135 people and  injured more  than 250  Indian citizens. My  thoughts and prayers and  those of many  Americans are with the families of those affected. These attacks were perpetrated for an  unknown reason but, of course, there can be  no good  reason or  justification.  I hope  that  United States officials will assist  the  Indian  Government in tracking down those who are  responsible.  It was just over a year ago that a deadly terrorist bombing shut down London’s transportation system. In March of 2004, similar bombing attacks ripped apart the morning commute  in Madrid, killing 192  innocent civilians. We  have been fortunate in the United States not  to experience similar terrorist attacks on our  railways. We must not be lulled, however. It is  long past time to take the steps necessary to  keep the traveling public as safe as possible.  In this moment of grief, we must stand with  our longtime friend and support her and all the  Indian people.  f  WAR RESISTER NORMA BECKER  FOUGHT FOR PEACE  HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 11, 2006  ",2006
1418,170,2006-07-11,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to a truly outstanding woman, Ms.  Norma Becker. A teacher, civil rights activist,  and promoter of peace, Norma  touched  the  lives of everyone who came  in contact with  her. On June 17, 2006, at the age of 76, we  lost Ms. Becker to lung cancer.  Norma Becker started out her tremendous  career as a schoolteacher in New York City.  However, she soon moved  to  the South  to  teach, after hearing about Birmingham, AL,  Sheriff  ‘‘Bull’’ Connor’s use of dogs against  civil rights protesters. During that time, Norma  could not help but feel the growing anti-Vietnam war sentiment that surrounded her. But  instead of  idly watching others, Ms. Becker  took some of the biggest steps a single person could. She helped to start the Peace Parade Committee, a peace protesting movement in New York City.  Norma’s efforts did not die with the Vietnam  war, but rather her energy and intensity rose.  In 1977, she helped create the Mobilization for  Survival, which helped  to bridge  the broad  antiwar movement with  the  intensifying anti-  nuclear power sentiment.  However, Norma’s  favorite endeavor was  the War Resisters League, of which  she  served as chairwoman  from 1977  to 1983.  Staff members of the league have praised Ms.  Becker for her outstanding leadership. Others  commended her always present energy. She  had an innate ability to work well with everyone.  Peace activists across the country are devastated by  this  loss. But Norma’s spirit  remains with us and encourages us to continue  the fight for peace. I enter into the RECORD  with pleasure a piece by  the War Resisters  League as a reminder of the tremendous impact Norma Becker has had on our country. It  is critical that we keep her memory alive so  that many generations to come will know who  Ms. Becker was as well as all the great things  she accomplished. She set an example that  we should all be proud to mimic.  ANTIWARLEADERNORMABECKERDIES  Norma Becker, teacher, civil rights activist, and towering figure of the peace movement during the Vietnam War, died of lung  cancer in her New York City home June 17.  She was 76.  A founder of the Fifth Avenue Vietnam  Peace Parade Committee, which drew tens of  thousands to protest the Vietnam War, and a  founder of the Mobilization for Survival coalition, she was crucial to the antiwar movement. She served as chair of the pacifist War  Resisters League from 1977 to 1983.  ‘‘One of the truly great has passed,’’ said  longtime War Resisters League staffer David  McReynolds on hearing of her death.  ‘‘As  much as any, and more than most, she provided leadership in hard times and for the  long and horrific years of [the Vietnam] conflict.’’  Becker was a New York City schoolteacher  in 1963, when, as she said later, she was ‘‘recruited into the civil rights movement by  Sheriff ‘Bull’ Connor of Birmingham [AL].’’  Appalled by media accounts of Connor’s use  of dogs to subdue civil rights demonstrators,  Becker went South to teach in the summer  Freedom Schools.  Over the next couple of years, Becker—and  the burgeoning movement against the war in  Vietnam—found that she was as gifted an organizer as she was a teacher. In 1965, she  helped to start the Peace Parade Committee,  which organized massive antiwar protests in  New York City. Wendy Schwartz, a younger  WRL activist who  came  to  the antiwar  movement during those years, adds, ‘‘It was  Norma’s  energy,  intelligence,  and  charm  that helped make those demonstrations so  large and so peaceful. She worked as well  with the disparate peace movement factions  as she did with the police.’’  In 1977, after the Vietnam War had ended,  Becker helped create the Mobilization for  Survival, which linked the emerging movement against nuclear power to opponents of  nuclear weapons  and  the wider  antiwar  movement.  But whatever  other  organizations  she  worked with, Becker also remained involved  with the War Resisters League.

1419,3,2006-07-18,Mrs. MILLER  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, House Republicans have demonstrated their commitment to immigration  reform  by  passing  a  very  strong border security bill that focus  on strengthening our border and enforcing our law. I think that the House  Republican bill does reflect the majority of Americans.  Unfortunately, Democrats have decided to go a different way. The Reid-  Kennedy immigration bill would, one,  allow as many as 60 million more immigrants over the next 20 years; two,  Mexico would have to be consulted regarding construction of a barrier on  our border; and, three, guaranteed Social Security benefits would be provided  for  illegal  immigrants  for the  time they were  in the country  illegally.  So if an American citizen broke our  Social Security laws, he or she would  face jail time. But if an illegal immigrant broke the laws to get here and  then broke our Social Security laws,  we are going to reward them.  Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are  doing the right thing by taking this  issue to the Nation. We are holding  hearings around the country to gain  input from our citizens. Already a common theme we are hearing is that people would rather have no bill than a  bad bill.  So in the interim, as Congress remains in a stalemate with the Democratic Senate bill, how about this as a  concept: Enforce the current immigration laws.  f  REPUBLICAN CONGRESS IGNORES  MIDDLE CLASS NEEDS  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and  to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2006
1420,3,2006-07-18,Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California.," Mr. Speaker, we are more than  halfway through the year, and the Republican do-nothing Congress has yet  to pass any meaningful legislation that  will benefit America’s middle class.  For too long, President Bush and his  friends  here  in  the Congress  have  worked exclusively on behalf of the  CEOs and the most privileged in our  Nation. But Democrats believe  it  is  time to take our Nation in a new direction, one where America works for all  Americans.  Thanks to the misplaced priorities of  Washington Republicans, middle-class  Americans are working for less today  than  they were when  the  recovery  began in November 2001. While wages  are stagnant, monthly bills have gone  through the roof. College costs 40 percent more. Health care costs are 75 percent more, and gas prices have doubled.  These dramatic increases have forced  millions of hardworking Americans to  take on debt.  And  yet Washington Republicans  continue to tout this economy. They  really are out of touch. I think they  have been spending way too much time  at the country club. It is time that the  voices of all Americans are heard, and  that will only happen with a Democratic Congress.  f  RECOGNIZING EMILY LAWRIMORE  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, with the continuity of a congressional session, there is a normal  shuffling of staff positions. Today, it is  with mixed emotions that I announce  the departure of Emily Lawrimore.  For the past year and a half, Emily  has held one of the most difficult jobs  on Capitol Hill, serving as the communications director in the office of the  Second Congressional District of South  Carolina.  Emily has handled her position with  professionalism, grace and  integrity.  Her dedication and work ethic will be  difficult to replace.  Emily began her career  in Washington as a staff member of Congressman Charlie Norwood. She  left  the  halls of Congress last Friday to become  assistant press secretary for President  George W. Bush. I am confident that  Emily will be a welcome addition to  the President’s press office.  As a graduate of Clemson University,  Emily Lawrimore is one of two children of Marshall and Cindy Lawrimore  of Columbus, Georgia. She is a credit  to the people of South Carolina and  Georgia, and I wish her godspeed.  In conclusion, God bless our troops  and we will never forget September 11.  f  FILE FREEZE  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2006
1421,3,2006-07-18,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, in this  age of electronic transactions, we are  all highly vulnerable to having our  identity stolen and our credit ruined.  Americans deserve every tool available  to help protect  their  identities and  their credit.  And yet a data protection bill that  passed out of the Committee on Financial Services and that is moving to this  floor for a vote strips away the ability  that consumers in 18 States have to  control access to their credit reports at  all times. It would allow consumers to  freeze their files only after they are  victims of  identity  theft, and  that  would absolutely do no good.  File freeze works because it stops the  granting of new credit without the consumers’ expressed permission. I urge  my colleagues  to help protect consumers’ credit and  identities. I urge  them to cosponsor H.R. 5482 and join  me in fighting for consumers to have  the ability to freeze their own credit  information.  f  SMALL BUSINESS BILL OF RIGHTS  (Mr. KELLER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1422,3,2006-07-18,Mr. KELLER.," Mr. Speaker, today I  rise to give the American people an update  regarding what  the House has  done to implement the Small Business  Bill of Rights.  Small businesses create 70 percent of  all new jobs. In April of 2005, the House  passed  the Small Business Bill  of  Rights which provided a blueprint for  Congress to help small businesses create new jobs. As the author of this legislation, I am pleased to report that  the House has done its job in 2005.  In April, the House passed legislation  repealing the death tax to allow family-owned small businesses to survive.  In July, the House passed association  health plans to help small businesses  with the skyrocketing cost of health  insurance.  Also in July, the House passed four  OSHA reform bills to help small businesses with red tape relief.  In October, the House cracked down  on  frivolous  lawsuits by passing the  Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act and the  Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act, which I authored.  Currently, all of these bills are stuck  in the Senate and time is running out.  I urge the Senate to act now to help  small businesses by passing these legislative initiatives.  f  TIME TO MOVE IN A NEW  DIRECTION  (Ms. WATSON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

1423,3,2006-07-18,Ms. WATSON.," Mr. Speaker, it is becoming  an  election  year  tradition:  House Republicans bringing up hot-  button issues that have absolutely no  chance of ever becoming law.  This week, House Republicans will  use pledge protection and gay marriage  as a means to distract and divide our  Nation. Are these really the priorities  of the Republican majority when we  have a hot spot virtually spinning out  of control in the Middle East?  The truth is this is nothing but an  attempt to turn attention away from  their failures over the last year on the  issues that are the most important to  the majority of the American people.  Republicans have failed to join us in  increasing the minimum wage, they  have yet to provide any relief to the  American consumer at the gas pump,  they continue to stall negotiations on  comprehensive border security and immigration reform, and they have allowed the issue of lobbying reform to  fall off the legislative agenda after all  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:21 Jul 19, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K18JY7.005 H18JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 2 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2006

The gentleman from Massachusetts I  am sure is aware of the fact that in his  State, opponents have gathered 170,000  signatures supporting a constitutional  amendment they hope would end gay  marriage, despite what their supreme  court did.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr.  MCHENRY).  ",2006
1425,10,2006-07-18,Mr. MCHENRY.," Mr. Speaker, we  must defend traditional marriage. Marriage, family and community are not  catch phrases. They are the backbone  of our American society. Sadly, however, there is an organized effort by judicial activists and the radical left in  this country to destroy our traditional  American culture.  The Federal Marriage Amendment  provides a national definition of marriage and leaves marriage laws to the  State legislatures. It adds a layer of  protection against court-imposed arrangements other than marriage and  protects States from being forced to  recognize same-sex unions created by  other States.  Years of social science evidence confirms that children respond best when  their mom and dad are married and  live in the home. That is why it is important  that we  defend  traditional  marriage and this traditional notion of  family law that emphasizes the importance of the foundational principle of  family and to address the needs of children in the most positive and effective  way.  We must defend what is sacred in our  Nation against reckless actions of a  dangerous  few who  seek  to  impose  their  liberal  lunacy on our society.  That is why we must fight for families,  and this is a war worth fighting.  ",2006
1426,10,2006-07-18,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, let me say that I used  to think that what was sacred in this  country was defending civil rights and  civil liberties and fighting against discrimination. Apparently  I  am mistaken, based on the comments that I  have just heard.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman  from Wisconsin  (Ms.  BALDWIN).  ",2006
1427,10,2006-07-18,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman and rise this morning in  strong opposition to the rule before us.  I hope  later today to return to the  floor and address the substance of Federal Marriage Amendment. But now I  want to speak to this process, because  by bringing up this unnecessary and divisive amendment to write discrimination into the Constitution, the leadership of this House once again  illustrates just how out of step Congress is  with the rest of America.  With the defeat of the amendment in  the Senate a mere 5 weeks ago, this  legislation should have never reached  the  floor  of  the  House.  Yet,  unsurprisingly, politics  is prevailing  over common sense, and today we are  going to be hearing a lot of hurtful political rhetoric targeting gay and lesbian families, all for the purpose of  pandering to a narrow political base.  Mr. Speaker, America  faces great  challenges, both at home and abroad.  We are confronted with record high gas  prices, an endless and expensive war in  Iraq, skyrocketing health care costs,  and a growing international crisis in  the Middle East and North Korea. But  the Federal Marriage Amendment allowed under this rule, of course, does  nothing to address these very pressing  challenges.

You have had control  of the House of Representatives, you  control the Supreme Court, you control the United States Senate, you control the White House. What are you  going to do?  Seven million people in America are  unemployed.  There are 46 million Americans that  don’t have health insurance.  The minimum wage hasn’t been increased in nearly a decade. The gap between people who are wealthy and people who are poor is getting wider and  wider.  We have a war in Iraq that has killed  2,500 Americans, 20,000 Americans have  been seriously  injured, and a policy  going in the wrong direction.  You have a failed prescription drug  plan, written by the prescription drug  industry behind closed doors, that is  confusing seniors. It is going to cost  taxpayers $700 billion.  Gasoline is $3 a gallon at the pump.  b1200  Global warming  is threatening our  environment and our health. What are  you going to do? Let’s have a debate  about gay marriage again on the floor  of the House.  We are not going to debate an exit  strategy in Iraq. We don’t have a plan  to lower the cost of gasoline. We don’t  have a plan to provide health care or to  give American seniors the ability to  buy prescription drugs at a low cost in  bulk. Oh, no. Oh no, this is Tuesday in  Washington in the House of Representatives, and we are going to debate gay  marriage.  This debate is meant to do nothing  more than get the American people to  look at other issues, ignore gas prices,  ignore the unemployment rate. Let’s  talk about gay marriage.

1431,24,2006-07-18,Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J.  Res. 88.  I believe  that  the  institution of marriage  should consist of one man and one woman  and I voted for the 1996 Defense of Marriage  Act, but I cannot support this bill.  The Defense of Marriage Act has never  been challenged in the Supreme Court and it  seems like we are putting the cart before the  horse.  We should allow our system of checks and  balances to work as it has for over 200 years.  Our founding fathers created three branches  of government  to work  independently, but  equally.  In Texas, we already have a law that states  that the institution of marriage is between one  man and one woman. We also have a law that  states that Texas does not have to recognize  marriages that were performed outside of the  state of Texas.  Even if other states decide to change their  standards for issuing marriage licenses. It will  not change how marriage licenses are issued  in Texas.  The Defense of Marriage Act supports our  state  laws. Marriage  is a state  issue and  it  should remain so. When my wife and I married 36 years ago we went  to our county  courthouse, not our federal courthouse.  We do not seek marriage licenses from the  federal government.  ",2006

1433,24,2006-07-18,Mr. CLEAVER.," Mr. Speaker, in 1974,  I was ordained as an elder  in  the  United Methodist Church after having  completed 3 years of seminary, 4 years  of undergraduate work.  I have been  pastoring for 32 years. As of today, I  have never, ever been asked to perform  a wedding between same-sex partners. I  do not even know of a minister who has  ever been made that request.  And so I am not sure how significant  this is, except for the fact that I am  not here to defend anything except the  church. We have people sitting in the  gallery  and  people  looking  at  this  broadcast all across America. And the  chances are really high that almost 100  percent of them have marriage licenses  signed by a member of the clergy, and  not a Member of Congress.  Marriage was ordained by God, and in  all of the weddings the words are read,  ‘‘Marriage is an institution by God signifying the uniting of this man and  this woman in holy matrimony’’.  And then we go on to say that, in my  tradition,  ‘‘Christ adorned and beautified marriage when he performed his  first miracle at the wedding in Cana of  Galilee.  b1300  Marriage is sacred. It is holy. It is an  institution created by the church. Now,  the United States Congress is going to  trespass on the property of the church?  I am concerned that we have gone  too far. Every judicatory or denomination in the world is debating this issue,  and it should remain in that domain,  not on the floor of Congress. I don’t  want Congress to approve or disapprove  how we  perform marriages  in my  church.  I sat on the front row in December,  and  I thought about Exodus: For 6  days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a sabbath of rest for the Lord. Whoever does  any work on it must be put to death.  As I thought about that, we were sitting here on a Sunday morning debating the defense bill.  ",2006
1434,24,2006-07-18,Mr. KINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker, I wanted to point out to my friend from Missouri that in order to become States in  the United States of America, Arizona  and Utah had  to change  their own  State constitutions to recognize marriage as a union between one man and  one woman in order to do away with  polygamy.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. BEAUPREZ).  ",2006
1435,24,2006-07-18,Mr.  BEAUPREZ.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman and thank him  for bringing this amendment to the  floor and managing the time. I also  would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge  the leadership of my colleague from  Colorado  (Mrs. MUSGRAVE)  on  this  issue. She has been a true champion,  not only a champion inside this Chamber, but a champion for the values that  I think a vast majority of Americans  hold dear. For that she has paid what  has already been recognized as a significant personal price. Again, I applaud her and I certainly admire her  character and her tenacity.  Mr. Speaker, this debate seems to be  framed by talking about what we are  against. I think what we ought to be  talking about, frankly, is what we are  for. Too often  in society, especially  these days, it seems like we are against  the very institutions that made this  Nation great.  I see above your head, Mr. Speaker,  the words ‘‘in God we trust,’’ and directly opposite you over my left shoulder is the medallion of the very first  law giver, Moses. We all know where  those laws came from, the very hand of  God.  I think very often about the fact that  we proudly profess that we are founded  on Judeo-Christian principles. I think  it  is  indisputable where those principles come from and what the origin  of those principles is.  I believe that in the very beginning  He created us, yes, all equal. The distinguished minority leader mentioned  that a little bit ago, that we celebrate  the fact that we were all created equal  by our Creator, equal but different, and  for a purpose. He showed us that purpose in the Garden of Eden, Adam and  Eve. He showed us once again, and  blessed that difference, at Cana, as my  friend and colleague from Missouri just  referenced, by Jesus performing his  first miracle by blessing that wedding  feast between a man and a woman.  I think there is a reason why marriage has always been such a sacred institution. I believe some things, some  definitions in our society are absolute.  Up  isn’t down, dark  isn’t daylight,  black isn’t white, fish isn’t fowl, and  marriage, since the beginning of time,  as close as I can tell, has been between  a man and a woman. If it was, indeed,  good enough for our Creator, and it was  indeed our Creator’s plan, that we were  created different for an absolute divine  purpose, I think we best not be messing  with His plan today.  It is important, I will disagree with  my colleague from Missouri in this regard, it is very important that when a  nation is, indeed, founded upon Judeo-  Christian principles that we are willing  to stand and define what we are for,  lest we forget what we are about.  I strongly encourage the adoption of  this amendment.  ",2006

1437,24,2006-07-18,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today in strong opposition to the  constitutional amendment to prohibit  same-sex marriage. If this amendment  were to pass, it would mean the first  time in history that the Constitution  has been amended to include discrimination. I believe in marriage as a stabilizing force in our society, as a nurturing environment for our children, as  a public expression of the most profound love and devotion of a commitment between two people to take responsibility for one another, in a legal  and a personal sense, in sickness and in  health.  The vast majority of marriages are,  and, of course always will be, between  one man and one woman. But the same  virtues of couplehood apply to any loving adults.  Surely the 27-year relationship of my  dear friends Michael and Roger does  not threaten my marriage in any way.  The loving family that Ann and Jackie  expanded when  they adopted David,  giving him two adoring parents, is a  good  thing,  regardless what anyone  may say to the contrary, although they  are free to say it.  But  nothing  in  the  Constitution  should be established to exclude them  from  the  rights  that  they deserve.  There are so many pressing issues right  now that are working, that undermine  families.  Same-sex couples embrace the positive values of families.

DEARREPRESENTATIVE, I want you to know  that I am in fu11 support of your efforts and  appreciate your leadership role in helping to  defend traditional marriage by sponsoring  House Joint Resolution 88, a constitutional  amendment to define marriage as the union  of one man and one woman.  As a conservative, amending the Constitution is not something I or others should take  lightly, but with  the continuous assault  from the left on traditional marriage ‘‘day in  and day out’’ it is an issue that must be addressed, I believe, by amending the Constitution.  Sincerely,  PAULM. WEYRICH,  National Chairman.  POSITIONSTATEMENTOFFOCUSONTHEFAMILYONTHEMARRIAGEPROTECTIONAMENDMENT, H.J. RES. 88  Marriage  is a  sacred,  legal, and  social  union ordained by God to be a lifelong exclusive relationship between one man and one  woman. Focus on the Family holds this institution in the highest esteem, and strongly  opposes any legal sanction of marriage counterfeits, such as the legalization of same-sex  ‘‘marriage.’’ History, nature, social science,  anthropology, religion, and theology all coalesce in vigorous support of traditional marriage as it has always been understood: a  lifelong union of male and female for the  purpose of creating stable families.  The Marriage Protection Amendment  is  necessary to protect the institution of marriage. To date, three courts have overturned  state marriage protection amendments and  in one  state—Massachusetts—judicial  fiat  has forced the state to issue same-sex ‘‘marriage’’ licenses. Currently, ten states face  challenges to their marriage protection laws.  Just one such lawsuit needs to reach the Supreme Court before marriage is redefined for  all Americans.  A plethora of federal and state law including tax law, employment law, social security,  wills  and  estates,  depend  on  a  foundational definition of marriage for proper application. Without a national definition  of marriage upheld in the Constitution, consistent administration of law will soon be  impossible.  Due  to  the  foundational  importance of  marriage in American society it must be defined nationally. The only question is, Who  will define marriage? Will it be tyrannical  judges acting through the courts to write a  radical new definition of marriage or the  American people, acting through their elected legislators to pass a Marriage Protection  Amendment? We believe the people should  decide.  Focus on the Family calls on all Members  of Congress to cosponsor and vote in support  of the Marriage Protection Amendment, H.J.  Res. 88.

MUSGRAVE: We firmly believe  that marriage is more than a private emotional relationship. It  is  for the common  good of society that marriage remains exclusively the union of a man and a woman.  We agree that the Constitutional amendment process is a fair and democratic way of  putting this important question back in the  hands of the American people rather than in  the hands of a number of unelected judges,  whose bias leads them to redefine marriage  contrary to its basic meaning and structure.  Respectfully submitted,  Dr. GARYL. CASS,  Executive Director,  Center for Reclaiming America.  AMERICANASSOCIATION  OFCHRISTIANSCHOOLS,  Chattanooga, TN, July 14, 2006.  DEARCONGRESSMAN: Multiple studies have  shown that children are healthier when they  have both a mom and a dad married to each  other. Risks such as physical abuse, verbal  abuse, and poverty decrease when children  live in a family with a mother and a father.  To intentionally increase a child’s risk of  abuse by depriving him/her of a natural family structure  is unconscionable. A  federal  marriage amendment will protect this family structure, and thereby protect the institution that is foundational to our strong society.  Despite  the  overwhelming  support  of  Americans for the protection of marriage, a  few judges are taking liberties to change the  definition of marriage through the courts. As  President Bush said, ‘‘After more than two  centuries of American Jurisprudence, and  millennia of human experience, a few judges  and  local  authorities  are  presuming  to  change the most fundamental institution of  civilization.’’ The Founders did not intend  for the Judiciary to overrule the will of the  people by judicial fiat, especially when that  will extends to preserving a sacred and essential institution of our society.  The American Association of Christian  Schools urges you to join your colleagues in  supporting and voting  for a Federal Constitutional Amendment that protects marriage.  Yours for the children,  KEITHWIEBE,  President.  AMERICANVALUES,  DEARREPRESENTATIVEMUSGRAVE: Thank  Arlington, VA.  you for your leadership in defense of traditional marriage and  for sponsoring House  Joint Resolution 88, a constitutional amendment to define marriage as the union of one  man and one woman. While conservatives believe  amending  the  Constitution  should  never be taken lightly, the Constitution’s  framers created an amendment process for a  reason. Sometimes we must address issues  that affect us all, and marriage is just such  an issue.  I was encouraged to learn recently that  New York’s highest court upheld the legislature’s right to pass  laws protecting marriage, based largely on ‘‘. . . the undisputed  assumption that marriage is important to  the welfare of children.’’ As the court stated,  ‘‘. . . The Legislature could rationally believe that it is better, other things being  equal, for children to grow up with both a  mother and a father. Intuition and experience suggest that a child benefits from having before his or her eyes, every day, living  models of what both a man and woman are  like.’’  Today, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals  re-instated  Nebraska’s  popularly-enacted  marriage protection amendment based on  the recognition that marriage is ‘‘rationally  related to legitimate state interests.’’ While  this decision is good news, it also means that  this case might be headed to the United  States Supreme Court, which  raises  the  stakes in the upcoming vote on House Joint  Resolution 88.  I am hopeful that the House of Representatives will follow the lead of the American  people and respond decisively to the threat  posed by judicial activists to redefine traditional marriage. I look forward to working  with you in the future on this important  issue.  Sincerely,  GARYL. BAUER.  THEETHICS& RELIGIOUSLIBERTY  COMMISSION OF THE SOUTHERN  BAPTISTCONVENTION,  Nashville, TN, July 14, 2006.  Hon. MARILYNMUSGRAVE,  House of Representatives,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MUSGRAVE:  CONGRESSWOMAN Recently Alabama, by the approval of 81 percent of the people, became the 20th state to  affirm a state constitutional amendment on  marriage. A total of 45 states have now  passed  amendments  or  laws  prohibiting  same-sex marriage. Clearly, Americans do  not want to see this most basic institution  open to any arrangement other than that of  one man and one woman.  Unfortunately, recent court decisions have  demonstrated  that  state  constitutional  amendments can be struck down at the whim  of an overreaching judge. Last year, a federal  judge struck down Nebraska’s state marriage  amendment—despite its passage by over 70  percent of voters in 2000—and more recently,  a Georgia court deemed the state’s marriage  amendment unconstitutional—in the wake of  76 percent of voters favoring the amendment  in 2004. Fortunately, the Georgia ruling has  been overturned, but that case still serves as  a reminder that an amendment to the U.S.  Constitution is the only sure means to safeguard marriage from radical judges.  Respectfully,  RICHARDD. LAND,  President.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. WELDON).  ",2006

1441,38,2006-07-18,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I oppose  this constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. The legislation before us today is nothing more than an attempt by the Republican  leadership to exploit a wedge issue that panders to their political base and diverts attention  from their abysmal record of non-accomplishment and rubberstamping the incompetence of  the Bush Administration.  As we get closer  to  the end of  this Congress, we should be addressing  the urgent  needs of  the American people—the war  in  Iraq, affordable health care, a sensible energy  policy, quality education for our children, retirement security, and a sound and fair fiscal  policy.  Whatever one’s view is on same sex marriage, amending  the Constitution  is not  the  place  to address  this  issue. The  laws governing marriage fall under the domain of the  states and that is where this issue should be  addressed. Amendments  to  the Constitution  have historically expanded, not diminished, the  rights and  liberties of  the American people.  We should not use the Constitution as a political tool to divide us. The American people will  see  through  the motivations  behind  this  amendment—to distract the American people  from the failed record of the Republican leadership in the Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to work  to unite the American people, address the real  issues  facing  our Nation,  and  reject  this  amendment.  ",2006

RES. 498  Whereas  approximately  480,000  yellow  school buses carry 25 million children to and  from school every weekday;  Whereas America’s  480,000  school buses  comprise  the  largest mass  transportation  fleet in the country, 2.5 times the size of all  other forms of mass transportation—transit,  intercity buses, commercial airlines, and  rail—combined;  Whereas during the school year, school  buses make more than 50 million passenger  trips daily carrying the Nation’s future—our  children;  Whereas school bus transportation is eight  times safer than traveling in a passenger vehicle and is the safest form of ground transportation available;  Whereas school buses meet higher construction, equipment, and inspection standards than any other vehicle, and school bus  drivers meet higher qualification, training,  and testing standards than any other drivers;  Whereas according to the National Academy of Sciences, an average of 820 students  are killed annually during school transportation hours, but less than 2 percent of them  are school bus passengers;  Whereas despite the industry’s best efforts,  accidents still happen;  Whereas an average of seven school-age  passengers are killed in school bus crashes  each year, and an average of 19 children are  killed each year getting on and off the bus;  Whereas most of those killed are children  aged five to seven, and most often those children are killed in the area immediately surrounding the bus—either by a passing vehicle  or by the bus itself;  Whereas School Bus Safety Week, which is  celebrated in more than 40 States and sponsored by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), was created to  remind all students of the best ways to get  on and off the bus in an effort to enhance the  safety of the Nation’s children;  Whereas School Bus Safety Week, which  dates back to 1966, also recognizes the hard  work and dedication of school transportation  personnel, especially the many school bus  drivers who ensure a safe journey each and  every day; and  Whereas School Bus Safety Week, celebrated the third week in October, promotes  awareness through  local and State poster  and speech contests, lessons utilizing school  bus safety community awareness kits, and  other activities built around themes that  raise awareness of school bus safety issues:  Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the goals and ideals of School  Bus Safety Week.

1452,45,2006-07-18,Mr. MARCHANT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I might consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H. Res. 498 offered by the distinguished  gentleman  from  Tennessee  (Mr. DUNCAN). This resolution would  support the goals and ideals of a National School Bus Safety Week.  In our Nation, approximately  22.5  million children ride school buses to  and from school each day, which accounts for 54 percent of all students attending grade school. In fact, the more  than 440,000 public school buses travel  approximately  5  billion miles  each  year,  comprising  the  largest mass  transportation fleet in the country, 21⁄2  times the size of all other forms of  mass transportation, and according to  statistics, representing the safest form  of highway transportation.  Even so, according to the National  Highway Transportation Safety Administration, each year for the past 11  years, an average of 35 school-age children have died  in school bus-related  traffic accidents. This is why it is vital  that  drivers, mechanics  and  supervisors, as well as parents and children,  observe certain rules and regulations  pertaining  to all  the operations of  school bus safety.  The week of October 15 through October 21 will educate children around the  country about school bus safety precautions with special activities such as  poster contests to help bring the valuable information to our Nation’s children.  I urge all Members to come together  to encourage the educational  importance of a School Bus Safety Week by  adopting H. Res. 498.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
1453,45,2006-07-18,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, students are at a much  greater  risk while  traveling  to and  from school than at any other time  during their school day. During the  1997–98 school year, about 800 children  from the ages of 5 through 18 were  killed during normal school transportation hours, while traveling by passenger car, foot, bicycle, public transportation  or  school  bus. Although  school buses are the safest  form of  highway transportation, they are not  fail-safe.  The most  dangerous  part  of  the  school bus ride is getting on and off the  school bus. Fatalities that occur when  students board and exit school buses  account for approximately three times  as many school bus-related fatalities  than for fatalities that occur when the  school buses are occupied. The area  around the bus when the bus is loading  and unloading  is  called  the danger  zone. The danger zone is comprised of  the areas outside of the bus where the  children are in the most danger of not  being seen by the driver. It is the 10  feet in front of the bus where the driver  is too high to see a child, 10-foot-long  blind spots that run along both sides of  the bus, and the area behind the school  bus.  The goal of National School Bus  Safety Week is to ensure safe, efficient,  economical and high-quality transportation for school children on their trips  to and from school and school-related  activities. This is certainly a goal we  all can support, and I urge my colleagues to do so.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
1454,45,2006-07-18,Mr. MARCHANT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield as much time as he may consume  to my distinguished colleague, the Congressman  from Tennessee  (Mr. DUNCAN).  ",2006
1455,45,2006-07-18,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Texas for yielding  me this time and for managing this  resolution and  for his comments, as  well as those of our distinguished colleague from Missouri.  Mr. Speaker, last October, I introduced House Resolution 498, which supports the goals and ideals promoted by  School Bus Safety Week. This bill certainly has bipartisan support with 62  cosponsors. Also, all  three national  school bus associations are in support  of this resolution: the National Association of Pupil Transportation, the  National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation, and the  National School Transportation Association.  America’s 480,000 school buses comprise the largest mass transportation  fleet in the country, 21⁄2times the size  of all other forms of mass transportation, transit, intercity buses, commercial airlines, and rail combined.  During the school year, school buses  make more than 50 million passenger  trips daily. School Bus Safety Week,  which is celebrated in more than 40  States and sponsored by the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration, was created to remind all students of the best ways to get on and off  the bus and of other ways to enhance  the safety of our Nation’s children.

1456,59,2006-07-18,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in strong support of this bill, and yield  myself 11⁄2minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I would  first  like to  thank the gentlewoman from Florida  for all of her efforts. I want to especially single out the hard work of my  good friend and colleague from Texas,  SILVESTREREYES, for his steadfast efforts  to help  the Clint  Independent  School District improve the quality of  education for its students.  Mr. Speaker, this bill seeks to correct a technical error  in  legislation  which the 105th Congress passed. That  legislation  should have  relinquished  the Federal Government’s reversionary  interest in a tract of land that is owned  by the Clint Independent School District.  Unfortunately,  the wrong  coordinates for the land were included in the  bill. This bill, H.R. 860, completes the  transfer  of  property  rights  for  the  school district so that it can proceed  with a planned sale of the land.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support H.R. 860.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the author of the bill,  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. REYES).  ",2006
1457,59,2006-07-18,Mr. REYES.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my  good friend from New York for yielding  me time, and my good  friend  from  Florida, the gentlewoman, for her support in this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 860, a bill to provide for the  conveyance of reversionary interests of  the United States in certain lands in  my district of El Paso County, Texas  to the Clint Independent School District.  The passage of H.R. 860 comes on the  heels of an interesting footnote in our  history.  In  1940, Clint  Independent  School District received 20 acres of  land that the United States Government  had  obtained  from  Mexico  through the Convention of February 1,  1933.  In the treaty, the two governments  agreed to cooperate in the construction  and maintenance of the Rio Grande  Rectification  Project,  which  ultimately straightened and reinforced 155  miles  of  river  boundary  flowing  through the increasingly developed El  Paso, Texas-Juarez, Chihuahua area.  In addition to helping provide a more  stable  international  boundary,  the  project also helped occasional flooding  in that region. After giving the land to  the school district, the Department of  State retained reversionary interest in  the parcel.  In  1957 Federal  statutes  gave Clint Independent School District  the ability to trade that piece of land  for another, which it did, acquiring a  separate parcel  in which the United  States had also retained reversionary  interest.  Today, Clint Independent School District still owns that one piece of land.  Unfortunately,  because  the  land  in  question lies outside of Clint’s boundaries, district regulations prevent the  school district from developing it.  H.R. 860 will allow Clint to sell its  land in order to buy property within its  own district boundaries. All proceeds  from such a sale must and will be used  for public educational purposes. This  legislation has been approved by the  State Department and reported favorably by the House International Relations Committee. Of the nine school  districts in El Paso County, Clint is  the largest in square mileage, encompassing a diverse area in the fast-growing east El Paso County.  The district itself is one of the most  rapidly expanding in Texas, with an estimated  student population of  9,000-  plus, a figure that is expected to double  within the next 5 years.  All together, the district has 12 campuses, three high schools, two middle  schools, one junior high school and six  elementary schools. This bill will afford Clint the ability to help keep pace  with its growth and help the district  provide its students a high-quality educational experience.  I would like to thank the chairman  and  ranking member of  the House  International  Relations  Committee,  Mr. HYDEof Illinois and Mr. LANTOSof  California, as well as my friend from  New York and my friend from Florida,  for reporting this beneficial piece of  legislation out of their committee.  Mr. Speaker, I would also  like to  thank our leader, Ms. PELOSI, and minority whip, Mr. HOYER for their support and assistance in bringing this bill  to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 860.  ",2006

1460,66,2006-07-18,Mrs. SCHMIDT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of S. 3504, the Fetus  Farming Prohibition Act. As my colleagues know, researchers have already  published studies in which cloned animals were grown in utero to harvest  fetal tissue. Some researchers have indicated  that  cells  or  tissues  from  human fetuses are more desirable than  embryonic stem cells.  It is morally shocking to think that  someone would  engage  in  so-called  ‘‘fetus farming’’ of a human embryonic  embryo. It is essential that Congress  act today and pass the Fetus Farming  Prohibition Act to prevent and prohibit such gruesome research from ever  being  performed  on  a  developing  human child.  Congress has a moral obligation to  protect women and the unborn, and I  urge my colleagues to support S. 3504  to do just that.  ",2006

1462,66,2006-07-18,Mr.  CARNAHAN.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentlewoman from Colorado  for her leadership on this important  issue. I rise today to talk about S. 3504,  the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act of  2006. Sponsors of this bill say it is necessary  to ban  the practice of  fetal  farming, which is the development of  embryos  for the sole purpose of research in questionable ways.  I support this bill and intend to vote  for it, but at the end of the day this  bill does little more than ban researchers  from  taking actions  they don’t  want to take anyway. It does draw a  line in the sand which I think is important to have in our law, but it does  nothing to advance scientific research  in our country. It does nothing to fulfill the promise of stem cell research.  I understand  just minutes ago the  other body passed H.R. 810, a landmark  bill that would allow the kind of research necessary to help tens of millions of Americans who suffer with a  genetic sentence of disability or death.  H.R. 810, which passed this House last  year through an extraordinary bipartisan effort, would apply strict ethical  guidelines to and expand Federal funding for the most promising methods of  stem cell research.  H.R. 810 is the only bill this Congress  has debated that has the potential to  truly unlock the doors to treatments  and cures for so many who really need  them. I am bitterly disappointed that  the President has threatened to use his  first veto to stop this important scientific progress.  Unfortunately for some, the bill before us now has been a distraction, or  worse yet, a source of political cover  for those who do not support this landmark bill, H.R. 810.  I urge my colleagues to continue the  bipartisan spirit that this House started last year that could be so meaningful to millions of people around this  country. Let’s continue this work for  meaningful progress in stem cell research. Let’s not get sidetracked by political gamesmanship. The American  people demand it.  ",2006
1463,66,2006-07-18,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  we are so happy the Senate is working  today. It gives us something to do, but  I only have one more  speaker,  the  sponsor of the House companion bill,  Dr. WELDON.  ",2006
1464,66,2006-07-18,Ms. DEGETTE.," Mr.  Speaker, we  rushed over here  literally  from  the  Senate floor. I do have other Members  who would like to speak on this bill,  but they are not here yet. I intend to  close for my side.  ",2006
1465,66,2006-07-18,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," We only have  one other speaker, so if you would like  to close for your side.  ",2006
1466,66,2006-07-18,Ms. DEGETTE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, S. 3504, the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act of 2006, which as  we mentioned just passed the Senate a  few moments ago, is important in the  sense that it is Congress’ way of saying  that we need to ensure that the scientific research that we do is ethical,  that what we do to try to cure diseases  is always ethical.  I,  frankly, very rarely  find myself  agreeing with people like Mr. SMITH  and Mr. WELDONon this issue. But in  the case of S. 3504 I do, because I don’t  agree we should have  fetal  farming.  None of us agree that we should have  fetal farming. It is wrong, and it is unethical.  But nobody should again convince  themselves that this bill has anything  whatsoever to do with the great promise that embryonic stem cell research  holds. In addition, S. 2754 which came  over here just on the heels of the other  legislation, this bill is also attempting  to give cover to those who say that  they want  to  support  research, but  they don’t support embryonic stem cell  research.  As I will discuss moments from now  when we bring up that bill, that bill is  no substitute for embryonic stem cell  research. In fact, the greatest promise  for creating cures to diseases that affect millions of Americans is H.R. 810  which, as we just now learned moments  ago again, has now passed the Senate  by a solid majority, bipartisan Members who  consider  themselves  pro-  choice  and Members who  consider  themselves pro-life. The reason they  support embryonic stem cell research  is because the vast majority of scientists agree that research holds the  cure to potentially curing diseases that  affect 110 million Americans and their  families.  I have a  13-page  letter  signed by  many, many groups, universities, patient advocacy groups, all kinds of  folks, and this letter says: ‘‘We, the undersigned  patient  advocacy  groups,  health organizations, research universities,  scientific  societies,  religious  groups and other  interested  institutions  and  associations,  representing  millions of patients, scientists, health  care providers and advocates, write you  with our strong and unified support for  H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.  ‘‘Of the bills being considered simultaneously, only H.R.  810 will move  stem cell research forward in our country. This is the bill which holds promise  for  expanding medical  breakthroughs. The other two bills are not  substitutes for a  ‘‘yes’’ vote on H.R.  810.  ‘‘H.R. 810 is the pro-patient and pro-  research bill. A vote in support of H.R.  810 will be considered a vote in support  of more than 100 million patients in the  U.S. and substantial progress for research.’’  I include this letter for the RECORD.

We urge your  vote in favor of H.R. 810 when the Senate  considers the measure next week.  Of  the  bills  being  considered  simultaneously, only H.R. 810 will move stem cell research forward in our country. This is the  bill which holds promise for expanding medical breakthroughs. The other two bills—the  Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies  Enhancement Act (S. 2754) and the Fetus  Farming Prohibition Act (S. 3504)—are NOT  substitutes for a YES vote on H.R. 810.

1468,73,2006-07-18,Mr. OSBORNE.," Mr. Speaker, many of  us have been impacted, directly or indirectly, by diseases like juvenile diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Lou  Gehrig’s disease, and so on.  I have  friends, as many people here do, who  have had these diseases, and my heart  goes out to these families. And on the  other hand, many oppose embryonic  stem cell research because they see the  embryo as a human life, which I do as  well.  So where do we go with this? I mean  on the one hand we are going to create  a huge problem for those who believe in  life beginning at conception, and we  have a desire to also help people who  need the stem cell research that think  that these are the solutions. So I would  differ with some of my friends here, in  that the British have done more than  2,000 replications where they have extracted stem cells without destroying  the embryo. It has been done. This is  not something that has never occurred  before. This is not pie in the sky. This  is a very real possibility to resolve this  dilemma: Are you going to try to preserve human life, as many of us who  are pro-life see it, and also have stem  cell research? The Senate saw it 100–0.  So why over here now, in order to pass  a particular bill, are we trying to destroy this bill? It makes no sense to  me.  So with that, I certainly urge passage of Senate 2754.  ",2006
1469,73,2006-07-18,Ms. DEGETTE.," Mr. Speaker, I would  just correct the gentleman from Nebraska. I was in England over the Memorial Day recess, meeting with all of  the major researchers. None of them  have found clinical application in just  taking cells out of embryos. They all  agree  that embryonic  stem cell  research shows the most promise.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my  distinguished  colleague  from Massachusetts (Mr. MARKEY).  ",2006
1470,73,2006-07-18,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlewoman for yielding and for  her great work on this issue.  The real debate here today in Congress is about whether or not the President is going to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.  What the Republicans have done is to  bring out so many red herrings that we  might as well put an aquarium out  here in the well of the House. It is to  distract. It is to divert.  The central issue is whether or not  this body this week is going to vote for  a victory  for science, a victory  for  progress,  a  victory  for millions  of  Americans who are struggling to survive in the face of a devastating disease. This bill, as it passes the House  and has already passed the Senate and  we vote on it later on this week, is a  magnificent milestone in our journey  to realizing the life-giving potential of  stem cells. Twenty-one million Americans have diabetes; 4.5 million Americans  have Alzheimer’s;  1.5 million  Americans suffer from Parkinson’s disease; and more than 1 million people in  our country have muscular dystrophy.  You can go down the list: spinal cord,  heart disease. You can go through all  of those diseases. Just take one, Alzheimer’s. By the time all of the baby  boomers have retired, 15 million Americans will have had Alzheimer’s, 15 million baby boomers.  Embryonic stem cell research is one  of the most promising paths to the  treatment and cure of all of these devastating diseases.  b1745  Nevertheless, President Bush is now  threatening to use his very first veto  to prevent scientists from using Federal funds to search for these cures. He  is threatening to use his very first veto  to dash the hopes of patients and their  families.

Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the conflict between  Hezbollah,  the  infamous  Lebanese-  based  terrorist group, and  Israel  is  nothing new.  But over the weekend Hezbollah has  upped the ante. They have kidnapped  Israeli soldiers and launched countless  rocket attacks against  Israeli civilians.  With the support of Iran and Syria,  Hezbollah is heavily armed and ready  for an all-out war.  Obviously, this issue is not new. In  1990 the peace treaty that ended the  hostilities  in Lebanon called on the  Lebanese Government  to deploy  its  army along the border with Israel. This  has not been done.  In 2004, the United Nations called on  Lebanon  to disarm Hezbollah. Once  again, this has not been done.  With this in mind, Israel not only has  the right to defend itself against terrorist acts; it has the responsibility to  do so. Allowing Hezbollah to terrorize  Israel without fear of reprisal would be  tantamount to appeasement.  Throughout  history,  this  strategy  has repeatedly proven itself a failure.  f  MOURNING THE PASSING OF ARKANSAS  LT.

Lieutenant Governor  Win Rockefeller dedicated his life to  public service and to the people of our  State.  As Lieutenant Governor, Governor  Rockefeller focused on economic development, education and literacy. Let me  give you just an example of the many  great  contributions  that Lieutenant  Governor Rockefeller made, not just as  an elected official, but as a citizen. The  Lieutenant Governor created a program  called  ‘‘Books  in  the Attic’’  where Boy Scouts collected used children’s books  to distribute  to needy  families. This was a little thing, but  Lieutenant Governor Rockefeller was  always willing to use his resources to  do  good,  but more  importantly he  wanted to get other people involved in  doing good as well.  The passing of Lieutenant Governor  Rockefeller is a great loss for the State  of Arkansas. We will all be grateful  that he chose to make Arkansas his  home. Our hearts and prayers go out to  his family and friends who loved him so  much.  f  HONORING WIN ROCKEFELLER  (Mr. BERRY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

I have met  few men with such an enthusiasm for  service and will miss his  leadership  greatly.  Win Paul Rockefeller displayed one  of his favorite quotes on a plaque outside his home. The quote comes from  Micah 6:8 and says: ‘‘And what doth the  Lord require of thee, but to do justly,  to love mercy and to walk humbly with  thy God?’’ I can think of no better way  to honor a man with so many accomplishments and a great appreciation for  the people of Arkansas.

1476,87,2006-07-18,Mr. ROSS.," Mr. Speaker, this evening  as I do each Tuesday evening that the  United States House of Representatives  is in session, I rise on behalf of the 37-  Member-strong  fiscally  conservative  Democratic Blue Dog Coalition.  As you walk the halls of Congress, as  you walk  the halls of  the Cannon  House Office Building, the Longworth  House Office Building and the Rayburn  House Office Building, it is easy to spot  an office that belongs to one of the 37  Members of the fiscally conservative  Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, because you will find this poster as a welcome mat by each door of a Blue Dog  member.  As you can see, today the U.S. national debt is $8,419,147,820,878 and some  change. Your  share of  the national  debt, that is every living man, woman  and child, including the children born  today, every American citizen’s share  of the national debt is $28,134.  As Members of the Blue Dog Coalition, it is what we call the debt tax, d-  e-b-t, and that is one tax that cannot  go away until this Republican Congress  and this administration gets our Nation’s fiscal house in order.  Last week, the President made a big  announcement about how the deficit  really was not as bad as what his White  House had first thought and reported it  would be. I think the best way to sum  up the events of last week can be found  in an editorial, July 11, 2006, from the  Los Angeles Times entitled ‘‘Another  Mission Accomplished,’’  And I will not read the entire editorial, but I think it sets the stage for  what we plan the spend the next hour  discussing this evening. It starts off  like this:  ‘‘The release of the White  House mid-session budget review is an  annual event normally marked by a  few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets,  not by a full-dressed Presidential dog-  and-pony  show. But President Bush  plans to preside today with Members of  Congress and invited guests in attendance. By all indications, including his  own, in his weekly radio address last  Saturday, he plans to turn this into a  celebration just in time for the fall  campaign.’’  The editorial from the Los Angeles  times dated July 11, 2006 continues.  ‘‘This is proof, if anyone still needs it,  that this administration is desperate  for something to boast about. On Mr.  Bush’s watch, triple-digit budget surpluses have turned into annual triple-  digit budget deficits.  ‘‘There is no information in the mid-  session  report  to alter  that utterly  dispiriting fact. Yes, the report is expected to project that this year’s deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan  than last year’s, probably somewhere  between $280 and $300 billion versus a  $318 billion shortfall in 2005.’’  And it concludes, that part of the  editorial, by saying, ‘‘That is not much  to crow about.’’ Well, they are right.  Last week the administration released  its mid-session review of the budget.  And after  further examination,  let’s  take a closer look at what the report  actually tells us.  The  report actually  tells us  that  what we have here is another record  deficit. The administration’s updated  estimate of $296 billion deficit makes  2006 one of the four largest deficits in  our Nation’s history. It is hard now to  believe that we had a balanced budget  in this country from 1998 to 2001. But it  did not take this administration and  this Republican-led Congress very long  to turn fiscal responsibility into record  deficits.  b2000  As you can see, the largest deficit  ever in our Nation’s history occurred  in  2004 when  the Republicans  controlled the White House, the House,  and the Senate. It was $413 billion in  red ink, in hot checks, if you will.  The year 2003 was the second largest  deficit ever  in our Nation’s history,  where,  for the  first time  in over 50  years, the Republicans controlled the  White House, the House and Senate,  and they gave us the second largest  deficit ever  in our Nation’s history,  $378 billion.  The third largest record deficit ever  in our Nation’s history again occurred  while the Republicans controlled the  White House, the House, and the Senate. It was in 2005, and it was $318 billion deficit, the third largest deficit  ever in our Nation’s history.  Then this year, the President has a  press conference, has a grand ceremony  and event to announce that the deficit  for fiscal year 2006 is only $296 billion,  the fourth largest deficit ever in our  Nation’s history. I think the editorial  in the Los Angeles Times had it right  when it said that is not much to crow  about.  The administration’s updated estimate of $296 billion deficit, as I indicated, makes 2006 the fourth largest  deficit ever in our Nation’s history.  While this number represents an improvement over the 2005 deficit of $318  billion, it still ranks as the fourth largest deficit ever in our Nation’s history.  These revised estimates do not account  for the extent of our budget problems,  because they include in the calculation  the annual surpluses in Social Security.  The first bill I filed as a Member of  Congress when I got here in 2001 was a  bill to tell the politicians  in Washington to keep their hands off the Social Security trust fund. This Republican Congress refused to give me a  hearing or a vote on that bill, and now  we know why, because they are raiding  the Social Security trust fund to fund  tax cuts for those earning over $400,000  a year.  They are raiding the Social Security  trust fund to fund this out-of-control  deficit, this out-of-control debt, this  reckless spending that we are seeing  occurring in our Nation’s capital and  the way the Republican leadership is  running our government and this country. In fact, when the Social Security  surplus is excluded, as it should be, the  2006 deficit is not $296 billion; it is $473  billion.  Now, throughout the evening we are  going to be talking more about this, including projected surpluses, and how  they became huge deficits. I will talk  more about that in a little bit, but I  have been joined this evening by the  cochair for policy for the Blue Dog Coalition, JIM COOPER from Tennessee.  Glad to have you with us this evening.  ",2006

The President  and the administration certainly built  it up as if it was good news. I am glad  that  the deficit  is  looking a  little  smaller than the White House had predicted. That is good news, and I appreciate that.  But  it  is still very  important  for  Americans to put that in perspective.  As my  friend  from Arkansas points  out, it is good news, and it is not the  largest deficit in American history; it  is only the  fourth  largest deficit  in  American history. So that  is something to be grateful for.  But it reminded me a little bit of  telling somebody, hey, the good news is  your cancer is in remission. Well, that  is good news. It is good news the cancer  is in remission, but the bad news is you  still have cancer.  What we are concerned about as Blue  Dogs is not a temporary deficit. Sometimes the Nation has to run a temporary deficit. What we are concerned  about are permanent structural deficits, deficits that grow beyond our possible ability to repay the debt, deficits  that strangle economic growth, that  prevent us  from building a stronger  country for our kids and grandkids.  We are worried about deficits that  hurt the middle class, because as my  friend from Arkansas mentioned, there  is a $28,000 per citizen tax on everyone  in America, man, woman or child. That  is a lot of money to be born owing the  country before you even have a chance  to grow up or earn a living.  But I know there are some folks out  there who are watching us, and they  are saying, well, the Blue Dogs, they  are only mentioning absolute deficit  dollars. They are not putting it in perspective with gross domestic product. I  would agree that is a percent of GDP;  we should look at it that way too. You  can say, well, this is not a percent of  GDP, the largest or even the fourth  largest deficit in American history.

1493,115,2006-07-18,Mr. KOHL.," I thank the Senator.  I rise today in support of H.R. 810,  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement  Act of 2005, which is a bill that will expand the number of stem cell lines that  are eligible  for  federally  funded  research ensuring that scientists at NIH  and  laboratories around the country  have access to new, uncontaminated  stem cell  lines. America’s best  scientific minds have told us that harnessing the power of these cells could  one day lead to a cure for a number of  diseases that afflict families all across  our country.  Nearly every family in America has  experienced the tragedy of watching a  loved one suffer through a deadly or debilitating illness. Diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s take a terrible toll on families’ lives and livelihoods. While we  have made  great  strides in biomedical research in recent  years, we still do not have all the keys  to unlock the secrets of disease.  Today  the Senate has  the opportunity to reach across partisan lines  and touch the millions of individuals  and families who suffer the ravages of  diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. We are not researchers, but  today we can give our best researchers  the material they need to understand  these diseases. We are not doctors, but  today we can give our best doctors the  weapons to fight back for their dying  patients. And we are not patients—at  least not yet—but today we can give  patients hope for not just relief but a  cure.  The University of Wisconsin at Madison was the first to isolate the human  embryonic stem cells that have the  ability to develop into virtually any  cell type in the human body. They have  stated unequivocally that they need  H.R. 810  in order to continue their  groundbreaking work. Without H.R.  810, they fear America will fall behind  the rest of the world in medical and  biotechnical research.  We all understand that this research  is not without controversy. I respect  the concerns that some have about the  use of embryonic stem cells. We must  closely monitor this research to ensure  that it is done ethically, and our passage today of S. 3504 and S. 2754 demonstrates  the  unanimous  bipartisan  commitment to do just that.  We must step carefully, but we also  must step forward, and that is what  H.R. 810 is all about, opening new cell  lines so we can move forward toward  new understanding, new hope, and new  cures.  Last year, the House took that step  forward decisively and in a bipartisan  manner, and so this year it is our turn.  It would be unconscionable  for our  Government to turn its back to the discoveries that expanding stem cell research promises. Now more than ever it  is important to grasp this opportunity  in an ethical manner by making sure  that  potentially  lifesaving  research  does not slow or stall.  We may not be in the laboratories  where scientists are working around  the clock  to develop new vaccines,  treatments, and cures. We may not be  in the hospitals diagnosing and caring  for the sick and the infirm. But today  the Senate will openly decide to stand  with the scientists, doctors, and patients. I urge my colleagues to look  past the politics of this debate and embrace a promise of progress.  With that I yield the floor.  ",2006

I, too, Mr. President, come to the  floor today with tremendous respect  for the sensitivity of this very critical  issue that we in the Senate and in the  Congress have worked so diligently to  ensure—that we not only respect the  sensitive nature but that we also look  toward the possibilities of what we can  do for the constituents we represent.  I am very pleased that the Senate is  debating stem cell research, and particularly H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, and I thank  the majority leader, Senator FRIST, for  scheduling a vote on this very important bill today.  I am a proud cosponsor of the Senate  companion bill, S. 471, because it offers  new  hope  for  patients,  for  grandmothers  and  grandfathers,  children,  daughters, mothers,  fathers, and  for  their families who love them so dearly.  Four years ago I watched my mother  give her utmost of devotion to the man  she had  loved—and  still  loves—and  shared her life with for more than 52  years. She had pledged to care for him  and to honor his life until he departed  this world, even if he no longer remembered her name or could recognize her  face.

1499,129,2006-07-18,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, today we  must reach across the aisle and make a  strong bipartisan statement supporting  embryonic stem cell research and challenge our scientists to use embryonic  stem cells to see  if the promise of  treatments and cures can be made a reality for the many around our country  and around the world who look to this  research for hope.  The Web site of the National Institutes of Health says it most clearly.  That Web site states embryonic ‘‘stem  cells have potential in many different  areas of health and medical research.  To start with studying stem cells will  help us to understand how they transform into the dazzling array of specialized cells that make us what we are.  Some of the most serious medical conditions such as cancer and birth defects  are due to problems that occur somewhere in this process. . . . Pluripotent  stem cells offer the possibility of a renewable  source of  replacement cells  and tissues to treat a myriad of diseases, conditions and disabilities  including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s  diseases,  spinal cord  injury,  stroke,  burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.’’  Scientists believe that Parkinson’s  disease, Alzheimer’s, and spinal cord  injuries are some of the areas that  could be helped  through  embryonic  stem cell research. I see no reason embryonic stem cell research should be  treated any differently than other research.  Some say embryonic stem cell research has not helped to date. Some  point out that there has not been much  success in stem cell research since it  began in 1998. This kind of research has  been only done for less than 10 years.  That is a nanosecond when it comes to  scientific  research.  In  comparison,  Congress passed the National Cancer  Act  in 1971. This was  legislation to  make  ‘‘the conquest of cancer a national crusade.’’ That legislation greatly accelerated the pace of cancer research and its translation into treatment. However it was not until 2005,  when  cancer  deaths  in  the United  States declined for the first time since  1930, when the United States started  tracking cancer deaths. In the intervening years  treatments  evolved  to  help people fight cancer and live longer  and better with the disease.  Those opposed to this research say  that supporters of embryonic stem cell  research have overpromised the benefits of the research. Without expanding  the research beyond the bounds of current policy, people will never know  what might have been.  California, New Jersey, Illinois, and a  few other States have stepped up to  help fund research, but they should not  be expected to carry this burden alone.  H.R. 810 will give clear the way for researchers to use Federal funding to access other cell lines than the 22 currently approved lines and provide access to other critical tools needed so  research  in this promising new area  can be accelerated to the benefit of all.  I urge support for H.R. 810.  ",2006
1500,129,2006-07-18,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of this long overdue legislation  to expand stem cell research.  When this issue first came up with  President Bush in 2001, he had a choice  between helping scientists conduct lifesaving research or putting politics before science. To the detriment of the  millions of Americans suffering from  diseases and conditions for which there  is no cure, the President chose politics  and decided that Federal funds could  only be used for research on existing  stem cell lines.  At the time, there were 78 existing  stem cell lines—only 22 of which were  usable. Scientists agreed that this was  nowhere near  enough  to  fulfill  the  promise that stem cell research provides. To make matters worse,  scientists at the University of California  San Diego and the Salk Institute for  Biological Studies  in La Jolla conducted an extensive study showing that  even those lines are contaminated by  mouse feeder cells—and unsuitable for  human therapies. So the President’s  policy—painted as a compromise at the  time—left scientists with little to no  chance to advance their research.  At least 10 countries have made significant  financial  commitments  to  stem cell research. Our commitment is  less than one quarter of Australia’s.  Our country’s failure to lead on this is  having significant consequences. Here  is one example:  After the President’s announcement  in 2001, Roger Pedersen, one of the  world’s leading stem cell researchers,  announced that he was leaving his faculty position at the University of California San Francisco  for one at the  University of Cambridge. He  saw a  promising future for stem cell research  in the United Kingdom, yet saw none  in the United States.  We need to change this.  I am proud to say that California recognized that our Federal policy was unacceptable. The State has enacted the  Nation’s first law to permit research  involving human embryonic and adult  stem cells while facilitating the voluntary donation of embryos for stem  cell research. Now how did this happen  in California? It started with one man  and one family.  Roman Reed was 19 years old when he  broke his neck in a college football  game and became paralyzed.

1501,136,2006-07-18,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, America  needs a new direction not only in what  is going on in Iraq but what is going on  with medical research. We will take a  step in that direction by passing H.R.  810.  A vote against H.R. 810, regardless of  how Members vote on the other two  measures, is a vote against research  and cures. A vote for it is a vote for  millions of Americans who are looking  to us right new for help. A vote for  H.R. 810 is a vote to keep hope alive.  Let’s keep hope alive.  ",2006

I  know we are about to close out this debate, and I am appreciative of him allowing me this time to express my  strong support for this legislation. I  commend the majority  leader, along  with my colleagues from Pennsylvania  and Iowa, Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN,  and  others who have  championed this issue. I commend the  other body for passing this legislation,  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement  Act, over a year ago and by a fairly  substantial majority vote.  My hope is that my colleagues, in a  significant vote, will endorse and support what has already been done in the  House. Then we can finally deliver on  promising stem cell research that may  one day provide relief to the more than  100 million Americans suffering from  Parkinson’s, diabetes, spinal cord injury, ALS, cancer, and many other devastating conditions for which there is  still no cure.  This  is controversial,  there  is no  question about it. But as the distinguished minority  leader,  the Democratic leader, pointed out, we are talking about embryos that would otherwise be discarded but can now be used  to one day make a difference in the  lives of literally millions and millions  of Americans.  I am the godfather of a child with juvenile diabetes. I cannot begin to state  how my friend’s family in Connecticut  feels about legislation. I don’t know  what their politics are on this. I know  they are a family with deep values and  a  deep  sense  of  support  for  their  church. They are also a family whose  child’s life could be made profoundly  different if it were possible to examine  embryonic  stem cells  thoroughly  so  that one day we can find a cure for juvenile diabetes. But, obviously there  are others diseases, including Parkinson’s, ALS,  cancer, and other devastating conditions we can make a difference on. With the passage of this  bill, we can say to these children and  these  families we can make a difference.  I emphasize, again, these 400,000 embryos would otherwise be discarded.  Strict ethical requirements apply to  the use of these embryos. In fact, I believe these ethical requirements are  one of the most essential provisions of  the bill. Since the HELP Committee  first began consideration of the President’s policy on embryonic stem cell  research  in  2001,  I have maintained  that the pursuit of scientific research  that may benefit millions of Americans  and their families was as important as  ensuring that science did not outpace  ethics.  Under this legislation, the only embryonic stem cells that can be used for  federally-funded  research  are  those  that were derived  through  embryos  from in vitro fertilization clinics that  were created  for  fertility  treatment  purposes and were donated for research  with the written, informed consent of  the individuals seeking that treatment.  Any financial or other inducements to  make  this  donation  are  prohibited.  Their embryos will never be implanted  in a woman and would otherwise have  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:52 Feb 05, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S18JY6.REC S18JY6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006

I thank all of these people who support the bill. I thank my colleagues  and their staffs for the hard work devoted  to  this bill and  the difficult  issues it presents. I particularly thank  Chairman INHOFE for his forbearance. I  look forward to the debate on this bill  and final passage.  I hope my colleagues listen carefully  to the debate because we have included  significant  Corps  reform  that will  achieve all the benefits that legitimate  requests for Corps reform entail, but it  will  not  subject  the  process  to  unending, wasteful delays and further  redtape that sank the bill the last time  we tried to send it to the House.

1510,178,2006-07-18,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President,  I  thank the chairman and ranking member and the Senator from Michigan for  providing me this opportunity to speak  for a few minutes about the importance  of this legislation to my State.  As many know, the State of Pennsylvania over the last several weeks has  experienced catastrophic floods. FEMA  has now  issued  individual assistance  declarations for 22 of our 67 counties  and declarations of public assistance  for 24 counties. It could have been a lot  worse but  for  flood control projects  that this Congress authorized and approved  in the WRDA process  in the  past, particularly the Wyoming Valley  levee-raising project, which I will address in a moment.  I thank the chairman and ranking  member for including a provision for a  flood control project for the town of  Bloomsburg.  It  is the only town  in  Pennsylvania. What you see was 25 percent underwater from the Susquehanna  River  just  a  couple  weeks  ago.  Bloomsburg State University is there.  It  is a beautiful  little town. It was  completely submerged as a result of  the flash flooding and then the raising  of the Susquehanna River subsequent  to the rains. So I appreciate the fact  there is a flood control project in this  legislation for the town of Bloomsburg.  In addition, we have had another  problem upstream  from Bloomsburg,  an area where we have had a tremendous success, and that is the Wyoming  Valley  levee-raising project which  is  almost completed, but there is an area  in Wilkes-Barre  in particular called  Solomon Creek. It is a tributary to the  Susquehanna River.  This picture shows a  little bridge  that goes over Solomon Creek. This  bridge  is virtually dry most of the  time. You can see it is up 12, 14 feet  from the bottom. It is a horrible problem  in the city of Wilkes-Barre.  It  backs up into the river and causes all  sorts of damage in the city of Wilkes-  Barre and  south Wilkes-Barre  right  near a hospital which is hoping to expand—but will not expand if we can’t  fix this problem—to serve the residents  of the area.  What I have asked the chairman to  do—there is a provision that Congressgot  into  the House  WRDA bill which puts this flood control project underneath the Wyoming  Valley  levee-raising project which  is  authorized for over $400 million. Believe it or not, the levee-raising project  came  in at well under $400 million,  about $250 million. So there is room  under that cap to bring in this tributary which really does need to be fixed  to address this major flooding problem.  The Senator from Oklahoma, when I  explained this project to him, said he  would support us in conference in making sure this project is included in the  final bill. I will tell you, the people of  south Wilkes-Barre are very pleased to  hear tonight that as a result of this bill  passing, and we get  it through conference,  the  chairman  of  the  committee will support the Solomon Creek  project in conference, which will mean  that  literally within  the  next  12  months, we can begin to work on making  sure  that  south Wilkes-Barre  doesn’t experience this kind of tragic  flooding in the future.  With that, I thank the chairman for  his assurance and his support. It  is  deeply appreciated by me and I know  by Senator SPECTERand by the people  of Wilkes-Barre.

This is a very important bill which is  before the Senate. It is very important  to Michigan. I very much appreciate  all the hard work they have put into  bringing this bill to the floor.

Let me start out by saying thank you  to my chairman, Senator INHOFE, and  to our ranking member, Senator JEFFORDS, and, of course, Senators BOND  and BAUCUS, and the array of Senators  who have worked so hard on this very  bipartisan bill. We have all worked together, and I believe it is an excellent  bill. I thank the staffs for their commitment to this product, particularly  Let Mon Lee with Senator BOND, Angie  Giancarlo  and Stephen Aaron with  Senator INHOFE, and Catharine Ransom  and Jo-Ellen Darcy with Senator JEFFORDS. They put in very long hours,  many of them, to help all of us, and for  that I thank them.  All together, this bill represents the  collective work of nearly 6 long years.  That is how long it has taken to get  this water resources bill to the Senate.  I think we all agree that 6 years is far  too long to wait for a bill that authorizes essential flood control, navigation,  and  ecosystem  restoration  projects,  projects that help protect thousands of  homes and the lives of millions from  catastrophic  flooding;  projects  that  help restore the great wetlands and the  rivers of our Nation. What we learned  during Katrina is what happens when  we lose the wetlands in our country,  and we have been losing them. As a result of that, we lose the natural flood  protection that we so desperately need.  So  restoring  the great wetlands we  have lost in California—I think it is  about 90 percent of our wetlands, and  nationwide I think it is even more than  that. So we really have lost a great  deal of our wetlands, and this bill helps  to correct that. It protects the rivers of  our Nation, also very important and is  addressed here.  We have projects that help increase  our port capacity and projects that  make shipping easier and safer. Specifically, for my State of California,  there are many great and valuable provisions in this bill, essential flood control provisions that more than double  the amount of current funds authorized  to improve and upgrade levees in the  San Joaquin River Delta, levees that  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:52 Feb 05, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S18JY6.REC S18JY6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006

1514,185,2006-07-18,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, this effort to retain the McFarland  is not  being undertaken  for historical reasons. To talk about placing the McFarland in a museum is making light of an  issue which is very, very serious for my  State.  It  is  potentially  serious  for  about two-thirds of the other States in  the United States which are affected by  hurricanes and which have very important national security areas.  This amendment is being pursued at  the request of the Governor of Pennsylvania  and  the Maritime Exchange.  They are deadly serious about the adverse impact of retiring the McFarland.  On  the Delaware River alone  the  McFarland helps maintain a shipping  channel that supports 38 million metric  tons of cargo per year, a total value of  $14 million. That  ranks  second and  eighth in the Nation.  We are not talking about a museum  piece. We are talking about a dredge  which is vital for jobs and the economy  of the region. We are talking about the  McFarland’s availability to respond to  emergency blockades at the Department of Defense designated strategic  military seaports. You are not talking  about an antique. You are  talking  about an era where terrorism is an ongoing threat; where, within the past 2  weeks, we had a threat by terrorists to  blow up the Holland Tunnel; where the  President has a terrorist surveillance  program which has superseded the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and  is viewed under the President’s article  II powers as a wartime precedent because of the threat of terrorism.  We are talking about Department of  Defense interests in New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,  Georgia,  Florida,  Mississippi,  and  Texas. We are talking about a dredge  which played a key role in responding  to severe weather events and natural  OFFICER. Who  disasters and was dispatched to the  gulf  coast  to  assist  in Hurricane  Katrina.  We have a report by the Corps of Engineers which  relies  upon  industry  data. The Corps report concedes that  ‘‘to verify the industry data would require extensive auditing and is beyond  the scope or need of this report.’’  Beyond the scope of the report; we  ought to rely on a Corps of Engineers  report that relies upon industry data  where the industry has a vested interest in having the McFarland retired so  they can make more money, and you  have a national defense interest?  There has been no case made by the  committee to replace the McFarland.  How much time remains on my side?  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  DEMINT). The Senator has 21⁄2minutes  remaining.  ",2006

1516,185,2006-07-18,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, I have  listened to these arguments. We keep  going back and refuting the arguments.  We have it documented. There is no  question about that.  As far as the national security ramifications are concerned, I tell my good  friend from Pennsylvania I have served  for 20 years either on the House or the  Senate Committee on Armed Services  and I have watched these things very  carefully.  The  Senator  has mentioned  San  Diego and San Francisco, all  these  areas for national security purposes.  I suggest to my good  friend  from  Pennsylvania that these do not use the  Corps dredges. They use private-sector  dredges in these areas, in all of them  you mentioned.  Again, going back to the arguments,  as I quoted from institutions such as  the Transportation Institute and the  Seafarers International Union of North  America, AFL–CIO, they all say the  same thing, which I could repeat as  many times as we need to tonight—and  I have quite a bit of time left, so I  guess I could do it several times—that  it would take $20 million or so to refurbish this thing, to get it so it can operate.  The report that was quoted by the  Senator  from Pennsylvania  of  the  American Bureau of Shipping,  that  was, as I understand it, only referring  to the hull, that the hull has some  problems and  that  the hull  is not  cracked. So again, I just repeat these  arguments, as I have done before.  ",2006

1518,185,2006-07-18,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I did  not refer to San Francisco and I did  not refer to San Diego. The long list of  States affected were on the east coast  and on the gulf. There are two other  Federal dredgers on the west coast.  I have great respect for the distinguished Senator  from Oklahoma and  his 20 years of service on the Armed  Services Committee. But I have been,  for 26 years, on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and have some familiarity with these issues. I was on  the Intelligence Committee for 8 years  and chaired it in the 104th Congress  and have  some appreciation of  the  problems  of  terrorism. And  I have  served on the Judiciary Committee for  26 years, now chair it, and have been  very deeply involved in the President’s  electronics surveillance program which  has superseded the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act because of the threat  of terrorism.  We are talking here about having the  McFarland available  in many, many  ports and in many, many States—not  the State of California and San Francisco or San Diego, but  in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Virginia,  North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas, and others; and the  gulf coast States affected by the hurricane, again, Texas and Louisiana and  Mississippi and Alabama and Florida.  We are dealing here with a very flimsy Corps of Engineers report which is  based on industry data which is not  verified—a concession they make  in  this report. And it is provided by industry sources which have a vested interest  and  a  bias  in  eliminating  the  McFarland as a competitor.  Mr. President, I think it is fair to say  that if the committee’s point on decommissioning  the McFarland  is  to  stand, they have a burden of proof. And  they have not established it. There has  not been a hearing on this subject.  There has not been reliable evidence.  And I would say that in the face of the  threat of terrorism, and the work that  the McFarland does in that area, and  the work that the McFarland did in  Hurricane Katrina, that their burden of  proof is more than a preponderance of  the evidence; it ought to be clear and  convincing. And it has not been either  clear or convincing.  ",2006

Now, the Senator has a couple of arguments I had not responded to. One  was he states that it went down and  performed some type of a function in  Katrina.

1523,192,2006-07-18,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. President, yesterday, July 17, 2006, marked  the successful conclusion of the STS–  121  space  shuttle Discovery mission  with its safe landing at the Kennedy  Space Center in Florida. This 13-day  mission was the 115th shuttle mission  and the 18th to visit the International  Space Station. STS–121  satisfied  its  ‘‘return to flight’’ objectives by flight  testing  improvements to the shuttle  and testing on-orbit shuttle repair procedures. This flight provided more than  28,000 pounds of equipment and supplies  to the space station and enabled its  number of occupants to grow to three.  STS–121  included  three  important  spacewalks and  laid the groundwork  for the continued assembly, and ultimately doubling in size, of the space  station.  I applaud the bravery, expertise, and  accomplishments of the STS–121 crew—  Commander  Steven  Lindsey,  Pilot  Mark Kelly, and Mission Specialists  Michael Fossum, Lisa Nowak, Thomas  Reiter, Piers Sellers, and Stephanie  Wilson. This successful mission  is a  testament to the thousands of people  who work on the space shuttle and  space station programs.  Mr. President, we must  continue  with our plans to fly the space shuttle  in order to complete the construction  of  the  International Space Station.  Equally important, we must work together to preserve the workforce that  will soon become the backbone of the  new crew exploration vehicle and the  next human space project.  f  VOTING RIGHTS ACT  REAUTHORIZATION  ",2006
1524,192,2006-07-18,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, more  than 2 months ago I joined the Chairmen of both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee,  the Democratic and Republican leaders  of both the Senate and the House of  Representatives, and Members of Congress from both parties to introduce a  bill to reauthorize and reinvigorate the  temporary provisions of  the Voting  Rights Act of 1965. The bicameral, bipartisan introduction of this bill reflects not only its historic importance  as a guarantor of the right to vote for  all Americans, but also the broad consensus  that  the  expiring  provisions  must be extended this year without  delay. Unfortunately, we in the Senate  have been delayed in getting this bill  to the Senate floor by repeated cancellations and postponements of committee hearings and markups. The bill  was also delayed in the House of Representatives for a month by a small  group of opponents. Fortunately, the  House was able to pass this legislation  last week with 390 Members voting in  favor. Now it is time for the Senate to  do its part and pass this bill.  At my request, the chairman of the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  has  agreed to hold a special executive business session of the committee so that  after a month of delay we can report  out the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks  and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights  Act Reauthorization and Amendments  Act of 2006. I hope that this vital civil  rights legislation will be ready for full  Senate consideration without further  delay and that we can proceed with deliberate speed to pass the House-passed  bill so that it may become law before  Congress takes its summer vacation.  The U.S. Constitution  specifically  provides that Congress has the power  to remedy discrimination under both  the  fourteenth  and  the  fifteenth  amendments. Over the course of nine  Judiciary Committee hearings we received testimony from a range of constitutional scholars, voting rights advocates, and Supreme Court practitioners. There was agreement among  these witnesses that Congress is at the  height of its powers when giving enforceable meaning  to  these  amendments by enacting laws that address  racial  discrimination  in  connection  with voting. The  fourteenth and  fifteenth amendments have not changed.  As long as these amendments are in  our Constitution, Congress has the authority to enforce them, especially on  matters  of  racial  discrimination  in  connection with  the  right  to vote.  These are matters of fundamental importance.  The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  held several hearings this year on the  continuing need  for the provision of  the Voting Rights Act that requires  covered jurisdictions to ‘‘pre-clear’’ all  voting changes before they go into effect. This provision has been a tremendous source of protection for the voting  rights  of  those  long  discriminated  against and also a great deterrent  against discriminatory efforts cropping  up anew. Some academic witnesses suggested in their committee testimony  that section 5 should be a victim of its  success. In my view, abandoning a successful deterrent just because it works  defies logic and common sense. Why  risk losing the gains we have made?  When this Congress finds an effective  and constitutional way to prevent violations of the  fundamental right to  vote, we should preserve it. Now is no  time for backsliding.  Since section 5 of the Voting Rights  Act was first enacted in 1965 and last  reauthorized in 1982, the country has  made  tremendous  progress  in  combating racial discrimination. Certain  jurisdictions disregarded the fifteenth  amendment for almost 100 years and  had a history of pervasive discriminatory practices that resisted attempts  at redress from the passage of the fifteenth amendment in 1870 to the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.  Section 5 is intended to be a remedy for  violations of the  fourteenth and  fifteenth amendments,  in place  for as  long as necessary  to  enforce  those  amendments and eliminate practices  denying or abridging the rights of minorities to participate in the political  process. In fact, due in large measure  to the remedies provided in the VRA,  many voters  in  jurisdictions covered  for  the purposes of  section  5 have  gained the effective exercise of their  right to vote.  However, based on the record established  in hearings before the Senate  Judiciary Committee  and  the Subcommittee  on  Constitution,  Civil  Rights, and Property Rights, which  builds on the extensive record established in the House of Representatives,  there remains a compelling need for  section 5. The Judiciary Committee received three categories of evidence supporting the continuation of this remedy. First, there is evidence that even  with section 5 in place, covered jurisdictions have continued to engage in  discriminatory tactics. Often, this recurring discrimination takes on more  subtle forms than in 1965 or 1982, such  as vote dilution, which relies on racially polarized voting to deny the effectiveness of the votes cast by members of a particular race. Second, there  is evidence of the effectiveness of section 5 as a deterrent against bad practices in covered jurisdictions. Finally,  there is evidence of the prophylactic  effect of section 5, preserving the gains  that have been achieved against the  risk of backsliding.  Today, I would like to provide some  of the evidence received in the Judiciary Committee about the persistence of  discriminatory practices in covered jurisdictions that supports reauthorization of this crucial provision.  The robust record compiled  in the  Senate Judiciary Committee includes  voluminous evidence of recurring discrimination in section 5 covered jurisdictions. Often, this recurring discrimination  takes on more  subtle  forms  than in 1965 or 1982, such as vote dilution and redistricting to deny the effectiveness of the votes cast by members  of a particular race. Notably, many jurisdictions are repeat offenders, continuing a pattern of persistent resistance dating back to the enactment of  the VRA. Debo P.

1525,213,2006-07-18,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join the Senator from Virginia as an original cosponsor of legislation to study and promote the use of  energy efficient computer servers  in  the United States. The growth of the  Internet and online applications and  the strong demand for electronic transactions are creating a growing need for  data centers. Most data center equipment is composed of servers, which are  computers that share resources with  other computers on a network.  The average annual power and cooling bill for 100 servers is about $40,000—  from Computer World, February 6, 2006.  The U.S. server market is expected to  grow from 2.8 billion servers in 2005 to  4.9 billion in 2009. Without improved efficiency, data center power costs could  easily overtake hardware costs in the  next few years—A. Fanara, EPA, technical  workshop  on  server  benchmarking, March 27, 2006.  Our bill would require the Administrator of EPA to study and analyze the  growth  and  energy  consumption  of  computer data centers. A critical goal  of the study is to develop a standard  way to measure server efficiency. Energy efficient servers and data center  designs are currently available. This  analysis would help promote the use of  efficient server technology through the  Energy Star Program or the Department of Energy’s buildings standards  program and allow consumers to compare products on the basis of efficiency.  This  legislation has broad support  from the information technology sector and energy efficiency advocates, including the Alliance to Save Energy,  the American Electronics Association,  the American Council for an Energy  Efficient Economy, the Electronic Industries  Alliance,  the  Information  Technology  Industry  Council,  the  Semiconductor Association, and leading companies  such as  Intel, AMD,  Sun, and HP.  Mr. President, under the bipartisan  leadership  of Representative ESHOO,  and Representative ROGERS, the House  approved  identical  legislation  last  week. I hope that the Senate will also  pass this needed legislation as soon as  possible.  f  SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS  SENATE  RESOLUTION  534—CONDEMNING  HEZBOLLAH  AND  HAMAS AND THEIR STATE SPONSORS  AND  SUPPORTING  ISRAEL’S  EXERCISE  OF  ITS  RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE  Mr. FRIST  (for himself, Mr. REID,  Mr. BIDEN, Mr. SANTORUM, Mr. NELSON  of Florida, Mr. KYL, Mr. BOND, Mrs.  HUTCHISON, Mr. LEVIN, Mrs. DOLE, Mr.  GRASSLEY, Mr. BUNNING, Mr. SMITH,  Mr. TALENT, Mr. ROBERTS, Mr. VITTER,  Mr. CORNYN, Mr. VOINOVICH, Mr. ALLEN,  Mr. COLEMAN, Mr. MCCONNELL, Mr.  BROWNBACK, Mr. AKAKA, Mr. BAUCUS,  Mr. BAYH, Mr. BINGAMAN, Mrs. BOXER,  Ms. CANTWELL, Mr. CARPER, Mrs. CLINTON, Mr. CONRAD, Mr. DAYTON, Mr.  DODD, Mr. DORGAN, Mr. DURBIN, Mr.  FEINGOLD, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. HARKIN,  Mr.  INOUYE, Mr. JOHNSON, Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. KERRY, Mr. KOHL, Ms. LANDRIEU, Mr. LAUTENBERG, Mr. LEAHY,  Mr. LIEBERMAN, Mrs. LINCOLN, Mr.  MENENDEZ, Ms. MIKULSKI, Mrs. MURof Nebraska, Mr.  OBAMA, Mr. PRYOR, Mr. REED, Mr.  RAY, Mr. NELSON ROCKEFELLER, Mr. SALAZAR, Mr. SARBANES, Mr. SCHUMER, Ms. STABENOW,  Mr. WYDEN, and Mr. MCCAIN) submitted  the  following  resolution; which was  considered and agreed to:  S.

LOIS CAPPS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 18, 2006  ",2006
1527,255,2006-07-18,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, as a Member of  Congress who is a registered nurse and cares  deeply  about  fostering  dialogue  between  Arabs and Israelis, I wanted to share an inspiring story that appeared in the July 2006  issue of  the American Journal of Nursing.  Khalil Khoury, MScPharm, BSN, RN is head  nurse of an internal medicine unit at Hadassah  University Medical Center in Jerusalem where  Prime Minister ArieI Sharon was treated in December 2005. At a time of such hopelessness  and extraordinary tensions between Palestinians and  Israelis, Khalil’s story provided me  with a little bit of hope and optimism that all  is not lost in the Middle East. I urge my colleagues to take note of this story and hope it  instills that same bit of hope in you.  [From the American Journal of Nursing,  July 2006]  THE HOSPITAL AS SANCTUARY: AN ARAB  NURSEWHOCAREDFOR ISRAEL’SSTRICKEN  PRIMEMINISTER  (By Khalil Khoury)  I am head nurse on a unit known as Internal Medicine A at Hadassah University Medical Center  in Jerusalem. This  is where  former prime minister Ariel Sharon was admitted for several days after a minor stroke  on December 18, 2005. (He subsequently suffered a major cerebral accident on January 5,  2006, from which he has not recovered.) During his first hospitalization, my staff of Arab  and Jewish nurses cared for him in an atmosphere of mutual respect—a sharp contrast to  life outside of the hospital walls.  Internal Medicine A  is a microcosm of  Israel. Of 40 nurses under my supervision—  all Israelis—one-third of us are Christian or  Muslim Arabs and the rest are Jews. Yet we  work together as a harmonious unit, an approach that is the basis for the humane way  we treat our patients. I think of my workplace as an island of sanity within the insanity that surrounds us. As an Israeli citizen, I  have the same rights as Jewish Israelis, but  when security guards at a shopping center or  coffee shop see me or hear me speaking Arabic to a companion, they demand to see my  identification and search my bag more thoroughly than those of others. My professional  accomplishments,  my  integration  into  Israeli society, my triumphs over the odds  against Arabs in my country—none of this  matters.  I was born in Haifa in 1971, and my parents—a construction worker and a housewife—raised me to respect humankind, to accept others and to help them. This led me to  nursing, but my career choice was also a  practical decision. Because  they are perceived as security risks, Israeli Arabs can  get jobs in nursing more easily than they  can in other fields, such as high tech or the  military. I enrolled at the Hadassah-Hebrew  University School of Nursing in Jerusalem in  1992; when I graduated in 1996, I immediately  went to work as an RN on Internal Medicine  A. I was named head nurse in 2001.  When the prime minister was assigned to  our  department,  there was  considerable  media excitement.  ‘‘The team that treats  prime minister Sharon  includes Arabs,’’  commentators proclaimed. Given the political situation in Israel, the presence of Arabs  on the treatment team was considered exceptional. Yet inside the hospital, we performed  our duties exactly as we would for any patient. The only substantive difference was  the necessity of accommodating the prime  minister’s security staff in an adjoining patient room with a connecting door and the  political staff  in one of our two doctors’  lounges. We cared for the prime minister and  prepared and administered his medications,  including injections, all without interference  from the bodyguards who were at the bedside  around the clock.  I learned about my own prejudices from  the experience of being one of Sharon’s  nurses. Before meeting him during his first  hospitalization  in  2005,  I would have described him as tough, formal, distant, and  not very nice, based on his public image. But  he turned out to be pleasant and polite in  conversation; without his bodyguards and  political retinue, he would have been considered simply a nice old man.  I don’t see Sharon as my enemy, although  Israel does not always see Arabs as friends.  Fighting stereotypes  is what I do almost  every day, whether it is prejudice aimed at  me as a man in a traditionally woman’s profession or as an Arab living and working in  Israel. I am helped in this by the principles  of nursing, which emphasize patience and  tolerance toward others, without regard to  race, religion, sex, or nationality. This is  how I was raised, and working at Hadassah  has strengthened my commitment to these  values.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. ROBERT E.

1529,255,2006-07-18,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Speaker, recognizing  the  importance  of America’s  longstanding  free  trade policies and the many benefits of direct  foreign investment in our country, I commend  to the attention of my colleagues this excellent  Wall Street Journal piece by Douglas Holtz-  Eakin.  Mr. Holtz-Eakin rightly notes that congressional overreaction in the area of CFIUS reform would do great harm to our economy and  result in protectionist retaliation by our trading  partners.  [From the Wall Street Journal, Jul. 13, 2006]  YOUCAN’TBECFIUS  (By Douglas Holtz-Eakin)  The ongoing legislative effort to reform  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the  United States (CFIUS) has suddenly been put  on  the  fast  track.  In particular, Senate  Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby is asking for unanimous consent by the  full Senate to vote on his bill with no debate  over whether key provisions are in the national interest. Unfortunately, there is a big  downside risk in precipitous action.  Earlier this year, international investors  looked askance when an acquisition—the  purchase by Dubai Ports World (DPW) of Peninsular  and Oriental Steam Navigation  Company  (P&O)—dissolved  into  political  controversy because the deal included terminal operations at a number of U.S. ports.  Yet even though this impasse came on the  heels of heavy-handed congressional interference in Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation’s proposed purchase of American oil  company Unocal, hope remained that this  was all a brief departure from the U.S. tradition of open international investment.  Hope took a hit in the solar plexus last  month during the Senate debate over the  U.S.-Oman free trade agreement. Sen. Byron  Dorgan objected to an obscure provision covering ‘‘land-side aspects of port activities,’’  arguing that it would obligate the U.S. to  turn over to Omani interests the same kind  of port operations that were disputed in the  DPW affair. The Oman agreement ultimately  was approved by the Senate. But the eagerness of politicians to play the DPW card  bodes ill for the future.  Congress may not appreciate what is at  stake. Far from being in continuous conflict,  open capital markets and national security  support one another.

Res. 905, I submit an address by  Senator RICHARD LUGAR, Chairman of  the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  presented on December 16, 2003 at a symposium entitled Kazakhstan: Reducing Nuclear  Dangers, Increasing Global Security.  SYMPOSIUMKEYNOTEADDRESS BY SENATOR  RICHARDLUGAR (R–IN), CHAIRMAN, SENATE  FOREIGNRELATIONSCOMMITTEE  It is a pleasure to be here today to celebrate the decision made by Kazakhstan to  join  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  (NPT) as a non-nuclear state. A little more  than a decade ago, when the Soviet Union  collapsed, Kazakhstan became  the  fourth  largest nuclear power in the world. But instead  of  enlarging  the  nuclear  club,  Kazakhstan joined Ukraine and Belarus in  turning away from weapons of mass destruction. Courageous  leaders chose  instead to  embrace the NPT and the arms control process in eliminating offensive nuclear, chemical and biological arms from Kazakhstan.  The world cheered when Kazakhstan became a non-nuclear state in November 1996.  I am proud of the role the United States  played in Kazakhstan’s decision and of our  role in facilitating the removal of thousands  of nuclear warheads and the elimination of  hundreds of SS–18 intercontinental ballistic  missiles, silos, and command centers. The  addition of  three more nuclear weapons  states would have been a devastating setback to the reduction of offensive nuclear  arms around the world.  HISTORICSIGNIFICANCE  Kazakhstan’s wise and brave choice stands  in stark contrast to events in India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran. In 1998, the  world was shocked by the testing of nuclear  weapons in India and Pakistan. In January  of this year, the international arms control  process was again shaken by the departure of  North Korea from the NPT. Last month, the  world watched closely as the IAEA deliberated over Iran’s numerous NPT violations  amid Tehran’s threats of withdrawal should  the body seek to enforce the treaty’s provisions.  With  these  events  in mind,  the world  should  be  especially  appreciative  of  the  course selected by Kazakhstan. Leaders in  Almaty faced the same choices as their counterparts  in  New  Delhi,  Islamabad,  Pyongyang, and Tehran. But instead of violating international norms and pursuing nuclear weapons, Kazakh  leaders made  the  right choice. When searching for success stories,  the  international community  should  turn to Kazakhstan.  The presence of dangerous weaponry in the  states of the former Soviet Union was not a  problem that the U.S. Government was prepared to deal with in 1991. Most decision-  makers in Washington were highly skeptical  of assisting the newly independent states in  eliminating their inherited arsenals. In fact,  many were opposed to committing funds to  any program that seemed to benefit the  former Soviet Union. The atmosphere was  decidedly hostile to initiatives that focused  on foreign problems. Americans were weary  of the Cold War and the Gulf War. Both Congress and aspirants in the 1992 Presidential  election had decided that attention to foreign concerns was politically a lowered priority.  In this atmosphere, Senator Nunn and I  proposed legislation to commit a portion of  Defense Department resources each year to  the cooperative dismantlement of the old Soviet arsenal. The House of Representatives  had previously rejected a plan to commit one  billion dollars to addressing the problems of  the former Soviet Union. That outcome did  not give Senator Nunn and me much of a  springboard  for  our  initiative. Yet we  brought  together a bipartisan nucleus of  Senators who saw the problem as we did. Remarkably,  the Nunn-Lugar Program was  passed in the Senate by a vote of 86 to 8. It  went on to gain approval in the House and  was signed  into  law by President George  H.W. Bush.  Many believed that the Nunn-Lugar Program would be a relatively simple affair  wherein weapons would be quickly  safeguarded and destroyed. But  these efforts  were far more complex than most expected.  It wasn’t until Sam Nunn and I took high-  ranking Bush Administration officials with  us on a trip to the former Soviet Union that  executive branch implementation was accelerated and a strong commitment was established.  At a cost of less than two-tenths of one  percent of the annual U.S. defense budget,  the Nunn-Lugar Program has facilitated the  destruction of 520 ballistic missiles, 451 ballistic missile  launchers,  7 mobile missile  launchers, 122 bombers, 624 long-range nuclear air-launched cruise missiles, 408 submarine missile  launchers,  445  submarine  launched ballistic missiles, and 27 strategic  missile submarines. It also has sealed 194 nuclear test tunnels. Most notably, 6,212 warheads that were on strategic systems aimed  at the United States have been deactivated.  To put this into perspective, Nunn-Lugar has  dismantled more nuclear weaponry than the  countries  of Great Britain, France,  and  China currently possess in their stockpiles  and arsenals combined.  Nunn-Lugar  also  has  undertaken  previously-classified emergency missions in cooperation  with  the  government  of  Kazakhstan to thwart proliferation. Project  Sapphire is the best known. In the pre-dawn  hours of November 20, 1994, as winter descended upon northeastern Kazakhstan, experts from the Departments of Defense and  Energy took possession of enough highly enriched uranium to make between 20 and 30  nuclear weapons. Two U.S. C–5 cargo planes  then  flew  20  hours  with  five mid-air  refuelings, to deliver the material safely to  the United States and prevent it from falling  into the hands of rogue states or terrorist  cells.  Nunn-Lugar also assisted Kazakhstan  in  eliminating the former Soviet nuclear weapons testing complex. The Degelen Mountain  Test Tunnel Complex and Balapan were the  sites of hundreds of nuclear weapons tests  throughout the Cold War. In close cooperation with Kazakh partners, the Nunn-Lugar  Program  systematically  dismantled  the  complex and sealed nearly 200 nuclear test  tunnels  and  shafts. These  facilities will  never again contribute to the weapons systems that threatened the world during the  Cold War.

If virtue were to find strength even  in the war-torn parts of the world, violence would be rejected as the way to  peace. Neither trees nor life survive on  a battlefield.  So quickly, violent words can be  tossed around a household, casting a  cloud over a family, and expressions of  violence can even find their way into  the  language of  lawmakers and the  courts of a land.  Drown all forms of violent behavior  with virtue, Lord. The hand may reach  for a weapon, a mind can plot vengeance, but violence springs  from the  heart. That is why the hearts of Americans, Lord, need so much virtue that  there is no room for violence, on our  streets, in our speech or our daily reactions  to  today,  tomorrow,  forever.  Amen.  f  THE JOURNAL  ",2006

1535,1,2006-07-25,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker, more news  from the second front. The battle for  the border  is continuing. When our  government does not monitor  illegal  entry into our homeland, all types of  bandits come through.  One was Ramon Ramos. He and his  accomplice, Francisco Salcedo, were  stopped by Texas State Trooper Steven  Stone for speeding in Tyler, Texas, 400  miles from the border. They were wearing body armor and armed with knives,  handguns and assault rifles, and they  were looking for trouble.  Ramos  showed  Trooper  Stone  a  forged driver’s  license, and then, at  point blank range, started shooting.  Trooper Stone was shot six times and  left for dead. Ramos and Salcedo then  led other law enforcement officers on a  high speed chase.  Ramos was recently convicted and  sentenced to 14 life sentences. Why 14?  Well, he tried to kill 13 other people,  including peace officers in his blazing  gun battle with the law.  Salcedo will get his day  later this week.  Trooper Steven Stone miraculously  survived.  Mr. Speaker, these crimes against  peace officers could have been avoided  had the Federal Government done its  sworn duty to protect the borders from  illegal entry.  And that’s just the way it is.  in court  f  VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST  (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

1540,8,2006-07-25,Mr. HERGER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of S.  3525, as amended. As  amended, this legislation reflects provisions as reported by the Committee  on Ways and Means on June 29 and included in H.R. 5640, the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006.  I am pleased to be here with the gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr.  MCDERMOTT) who is a cosponsor of this  bipartisan legislation. I thank him for  his work and leadership on this legislation. I would also like to thank the  many Members from both sides of the  aisle for their support.  Mr. Speaker, this  legislation reauthorizes and improves numerous child  protection  programs  that  combined,  would provide about $4 billion during  the next 5 years to keep children safe  and ensure they are raised in safe and  loving families.  These programs are the Promoting  Safe and Stable Families Program, the  Child Welfare Services Program, the  Court Improvement Program and the  Mentoring Children of Prisoners Program.  This  legislation supports State efforts to prevent child abuse and neglect  by keeping families together and preventing, whenever possible, the unnecessary  separation  of  children  from  their families.  For example, the Promoting Safe and  Stable Families Program provides resources  for  family  support  services,  family preservation services, time-limited reunification services and post-  adoption services. We know that one of  the best ways to give a child a chance  of a bright future is to ensure that that  child is raised in a safe, loving family.  The services supported by this legislation are targeted where they are needed most, to help parents at risk of  abusing or neglecting their children or  to prevent repeated abuse and neglect.  On May  23,  the Ways and Means  Human  Resources  Subcommittee,  which I chair, held a hearing on this  legislation. We heard  from a broad  array of voices in support of the extension of these programs and in support  of changes requiring States to focus resources more on services for children  and at-risk families.  Earlier  this  year,  the  President  signed the Deficit Reduction Act of  2005, which provided $200 million in new  funds  for  services  to better protect  children over the next 5 years. I am  very pleased that this legislation targets these increased resources so more  foster children are visited on a monthly basis.  The  Department  of  Health  and  Human Services Office of  Inspector  General recently reported that these  visits were not  occurring. Only  20  States could  tell whether  the caseworkers actually visited children  in  foster care on a monthly basis.  In  seven of these 20 States, the reports  found that fewer than half of the children in foster care were visited on a  monthly basis. Research shows that  children who are visited on a more frequent basis are more quickly placed in  permanent homes and experience other  positive outcomes, compared to children not visited.  Newspapers are frequently reporting  the horrors of children neglected by  the very system charged to protect  them. The increased monitoring promoting by this bill makes sense and  would go a long way towards better  protecting these vulnerable children.  Mr. Speaker, we still have more work  to do to improve our Nation’s foster  care system. Time and time again, we  hear of children  lingering  in  foster  care, bounced from home to home. In  some cases, foster children have lived  in more than 50 homes. This is unacceptable, and we will continue to work  to improve this program so that all  children can live with a family that  loves them.  This legislation brings us one step  closer to that important goal. It has  widespread bipartisan support, and I  urge all my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
1541,8,2006-07-25,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, we have before us today  the Senate  companion  bill  to  the  Herger-McDermott Child Family Services and Improvement Act. We have  put the Senate version on the House  calendar to facilitate action. The Senate version is slightly different than  our bill, but we want to move ahead as  quickly as possible, so we are going to  strike the Senate language and insert  the Herger-McDermott language in its  entirety. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  It is a pleasure to work with Mr.  HERGERon this issue. In doing so, we  will make America a little safer for  vulnerable  kids.  Countless  children  across America need us  to protect  them from harm. In effect, the House  today is fulfilling its obligation as first  responders. For too many children, we  are the first and the last line of defense.  Mr. HERGERand I have produced bipartisan legislation that takes a modest step forward in safeguarding vulnerable children. This bill  is an attempt to find common ground so that  together we can pursue the common  good. I believe this can be a model for  the future. Certainly more needs to be  done, but every journey starts with the  first step.  This legislation renews the program  called Promoting Safe and Stable Families. This is a small but vital program  that supports the States in their efforts to prevent child abuse from occurring or from reoccurring. We maintain the flexibility of the current program by allowing the States to use  Federal money to provide a wide variety of family support, preservation, reunification and other services, and we  provide  greater  support  to Native  American tribes for these purposes.  We also recognize and support the  courageous caregivers serving on the  front  lines. For the  first time  in 7  years, the bill provides new Federal  funding to the States, $40 million, to  help them meet the challenges on two  fronts. The first is having the resources  to enable monthly caseworker visits  for children in foster care. The second  is investing more in the child welfare  workforce.  We know that more frequent interaction between caseworkers and foster  kids leads to better outcomes. We also  know that difficulties in recruiting and  retaining qualified caseworkers negatively affects the safety and permanency for at-risk kids. In fact, the Government Accounting Office warned us  in 2003 report about the risks incurred  by children when the average tenure of  child care worker is less than 2 years.  A lot of caring, dedicated caseworkers  leave their job, not because they want  to, but because they are forced to leave  due  to  financial  circumstances. We  begin to address this issue in a bill  with a $40 million downpayment. This  shows, I think, that we mean business.  The legislation also makes changes  in other child care support programs  that have proven to be effective, and  we want to keep them working to benefit  kids  and  families.  Despite  naysayers, government can be an instrument for good. Today in this bill  we can prove it.

1543,15,2006-07-25,Mr. REICHERT.," Mr. Speaker, I am  proud to rise in support as a sponsor of  H.R. 5852, the 21st Century Emergency  Communications Act of 2006. Although  I appreciate the comments from the  gentleman from Michigan, I would like  to first address before I get into my  formal  statement  some of his comments.  There have been  several hearings,  four hearings and a joint hearing, held  on the  issue of  interoperability and  operability under the umbrella of the  Homeland Security Committee  and,  more specifically, through the Emergency  Preparedness  Subcommittee  that I chair.  I have only been  in Congress  18  months. I was a police officer for 33  years. The last 8 years of that I was the  sheriff. So I know a little bit about  interoperability.  I know a  little bit  about the inability for police officers  to communicate. I know a little bit  about life and death, and the ability to  be in touch with your communications  center or not to be in touch with your  communications center, or not to have  a partner present, or wait for a partner  when you are facing someone with a  gun. And I understand, too, the gentleman from Michigan has some experience in law enforcement and hopefully  understands  the  importance of  this  bill.  I would also like to point out that between 2003 and 2005, $2 billion have  been spent by the Federal Government  across this Nation for interoperability  without any national plan, without any  national standards. And that is what  this bill addresses today, and that is  why  it  is so  important  for  first responders across this country.  So there have been hearings. And not  only have  there been hearings, but  these hearings have been held with people in attendance like firefighters, police officers, emergency management,  people on the ground, people doing the  job. We are not just hearing from politicians and mayors and CEOs of police  departments and sheriff’s offices, we  are hearing from cops and firefighters,  and they are supporting this bill 110  percent.  So,  I would  like  to  thank Mr.  PASCRELL, my ranking member on my  subcommittee, and  I would  like  to  thank Mr. THOMPSON,  the  ranking  member of the full committee, and all  those who serve on both committees,  the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Science and Technology and  the  full  Homeland  Security  Committee, who supported this bill.  When people look at Congress, they  say what are we doing? Why are we not  working together? On this particular  issue, we did work together. This was a  combined effort, this was a team effort,  and it was congenial and it was an effort that was well respected by every  member and every staff member on  both the subcommittee and the committee.  Protecting our Nation should never  be an issue where Democrats and Republicans cannot come together and  recognize the need for our cooperation,  especially on behalf of our  first responders to ensure that our communities stay safe.

1546,43,2006-07-25,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of H.R. 4472, the Adam  Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation is a victory in the fight to keep  our children safe. There are many critical and important provisions included  in this bill. In particular, Mr. Speaker,  I want to thank the House and Senate  conferees for including in this legislation a provision that I introduced in  the House earlier this year, a provision  that is entitled Masha’s Law.  Last year I learned of a shocking inequity that exists in our current law.  Currently,  a  person  who  illegally  downloads music  faces  penalties  in  civil court that are three times as  harsh as a person who downloads child  pornography. This horrible  inequity  was the inspiration behind the introduction of Masha’s Law, and this provision dramatically increases civil statutory damages  for child exploitation,  creating a civil avenue victims of child  sexual exploitation can pursue to recover monetary damages  from these  predators. This  includes  those who  produce, distribute, and consume child  pornography.  Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues to  know that Masha’s Law is named after  a brave 13-year-old girl from my district, Masha Allen. Masha was born in  Russia and placed in a state orphanage  because her mother was an alcoholic  and a drug addict. When she was 5  years old, a man  from  the United  States was  allowed  to  adopt  her  through  an  international  adoption  agency. This man  started  sexually  abusing her the very first night she arrived in America.  Fortunately, this perpetrator is now  behind bars. However, over the years of  his abuse of Masha, he photographed  her, posted her pictures, and traded her  pornographic images over the Internet.  The sad reality is that, although these  monsters can be put behind bars, the  victims of Internet child pornography  will continue to be exploited, and this  is why I introduced Masha’s Law.  Mr. Speaker, a compassionate society  looks after the most vulnerable among  us, our children. I urge my colleagues  to support the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act so we can protect our most precious commodity, innocent children like Masha, and give  back hope to those who need it most.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  4472, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and  Safety Act. This bipartisan legislation is a victory  in  the  fight  to keep our children safe.  There are many critical and important provisions included in this bill, provisions that allow  States to better track convicted sex offenders,  ones that tighten up loop holes in current sex  offender registration and notification laws, and  ones that empower law enforcement through  increased coordination.  In particular, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank  the House and Senate conferees for including  in  this  legislation a provision  I  introduced  in  the House earlier this year, a provision entitled  ‘‘Masha’s Law.’’  Last year I learned of a shocking inequity  that exists in our current law.

It allows  these  individuals a pathway  to recover  damages  they  have  suffered  from  these  crimes and allows them to pursue this avenue  even after they are no longer a minor. Therefore as  their pictures are downloaded and  traded, year and year, these victims can continue  to seek  justice  from  these horrendous  crimes.  Mr. Speaker, a compassionate society looks  after the most vulnerable among us, our children.  I urge my colleagues  to support  the  Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act,  so we can protect our most preciously commodity,  innocent, children  like Masha, and  give back hope to those who need it the most.

1547,43,2006-07-25,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from  Florida  (Ms.  GINNY  BROWN-WAITE).  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 4472, the Adam Walsh  Child Protection and Safety Act of  2006.  Finally, we have a bill passed by both  this body and the Senate for the President to sign. Finally, Mark Lunsford  has a legacy for his daughter Jessica of  a guardian angel keeping children safe  by closing dangerous loopholes in our  law. Finally, the family and friends of  Adam Walsh, Carlie Brucia, Sarah  Lunde, and so many others can sleep a  little better at night knowing we are  helping to protect America’s precious  children.  My heart is still broken for the loss  of Jessica Lunsford and all the joys in  life that she will miss. At least she will  be in a better place where no one can  ever harm her again.  Mr.  Speaker,  certainly  Chairman  SENSENBRENNER, who worked tirelessly  on this bill, deserves a great deal of  credit.  Back  when  I  first  heard  about  Jessica’s disappearance, I knew that we  could not sit back and do nothing. For  instance,  the  probation  officer  for  Jessica’s alleged killer, John Couey,  never knew that he was a convicted sex  offender. I introduced a bill, and Chairman SENSENBRENNERwas kind enough  to include it in this comprehensive bill,  that fixes that.  The alleged perpetrator also did not  have a current address on file with law  enforcement, as he should have. This  bill demands more  frequent updates  and checks. It also provides some grant  mechanisms to be sure that the localities can pay for this additional registration. The bill empowers States to  do just as Florida has done and use  GPS monitoring devices to track offenders.

There  are  legitimate  differences between Democrats and Republicans and  liberals and  conservatives.  But without  subsuming  those  or  without anybody sort of abandoning  his or her principles, we have been able  to find that area where there is common ground like this.

1554,50,2006-07-25,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker, I am in  strong support of H.R. 4804, the FHA  Manufactured  Housing  Loan Modernization Act of 2006.  Manufactured homes play an important role in serving housing needs for  many Americans, especially in the district I represent in East Tennessee.  I am very proud to have a leader in  the manufactured housing  industry,  Clayton Homes, headquartered in my  district. They are a company of integrity and are now operating in over 40  states across the country .  More and more people each year are  moving into my district, which is one  of the  fastest growing areas  in the  country. I can understand why so many  want to move there. It is a great place  to live, raise a family or start a business.  All of this growth is contributing to  a crisis in affordable housing. Manured  home prices have increased over 50 percent since 1992. In 1992 FHA Title I insured over 30,000 Title I loans. In 2004,  that number was below 2,000.  Options for financing manufactured  homes are very limited. Today, there  are only two private lenders that participate in the FHA program. This bill  will encourage more private sector participation, creating more competition  with lower interest rates and costs.  The bill increases the amount that  can be insured on a loan. It removes a  cent portfolio cap that only allows 10  percent of the dollar value of the lender’s portfolio to be insured.  Under the proposed system in H.R.  4804, a practical program will encourage more private sector participation  and increase accessibility to manufactured home loans. Making these loans  more accessible will help many get out  of a renting situation.  This bill will allow many a chance to  own a home, a very important part of  the American dream. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4804.  ",2006

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that—  (1) one of the primary missions of the Federal Housing Administration  (FHA) single  family mortgage  insurance program  is to  reach borrowers who are underserved, or not  served, by the existing conventional mortgage marketplace;  (2) the FHA program has a long history of  innovation, which includes pioneering the 30-  year self-amortizing mortgage and a safe-to-  seniors reverse mortgage product, both of  which were once thought too risky to private  lenders;  (3) the FHA single family mortgage insurance program traditionally has been a major  provider of mortgage  insurance  for home  purchases;  (4) the FHA mortgage insurance premium  structure, as well as FHA’s product offerings, should be revised to reflect FHA’s enhanced ability to determine risk at the loan  level and to allow FHA to better respond to  changes in the mortgage market;  (5) during past recessions, including the  oil-patch downturns in the mid-1980s, FHA  remained a viable credit enhancer and was  therefore instrumental in preventing a more  catastrophic collapse  in housing markets  and a greater loss of homeowner equity; and  (6) as housing price appreciation slows and  interest rates rise, many homeowners and  prospective homebuyers will need the less-  expensive, safer financing alternative that  FHA mortgage insurance provides.  (b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act  are—  (1) to provide flexibility to FHA to allow  for the insurance of housing loans for low-  and moderate-income homebuyers during all  economic cycles in the mortgage market;  (2) to modernize the FHA single  family  mortgage insurance program by making it  more reflective of enhancements to  loan-  level risk assessments and changes to the  mortgage market; and  (3) to adjust the loan limits for the single  family mortgage insurance program to reflect rising house prices and the increased  costs associated with new construction.  SEC. 3. MAXIMUM PRINCIPAL LOAN OBLIGATION.  Paragraph (2) of section 203(b) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)(2)) is  amended—  (1) by striking subparagraphs (A) and (B)  and  inserting the  following new subparagraphs:  ‘‘(A) not to exceed the lesser of—  ‘‘(i) in the case of a 1-family residence, the  median 1-family house price in the area, as  determined by the Secretary; and in the case  of a 2-, 3-, or 4-family residence, the percentage of such median price that bears the same  ratio to such median price as the dollar  amount limitation in effect under section  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:08 Jul 26, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K25JY7.043 H25JYPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

1564,57,2006-07-25,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in  strong  support of  the Expanded  Homeownership Act. It modernizes and  moves the FHA into the realities of the  housing market of the 21st century.  I want to build on the comments of  my colleague MAXINEWATERSwho has  worked  selflessly  and  devotedly  on  moving this legislation to the floor in  a bipartisan effort.  There are three points that are particularly important to New York and  the district that I represent. The bill  raises the mortgage limits to 100 percent of area median income, thereby  making more Americans eligible to receive loans under FHA.  Secondly,  it expands coverage, not  only to higher risk  individuals, but  also to cover condos and co-ops. I represent many people who live in high-  rises. They live vertically as opposed to  horizontally. This  is  an  important  change. Many more will be eligible for  FHA support.  Thirdly, and very importantly to the  elderly in New York City and around  the country,  it  lifts the cap on the  number of reverse mortgages HUD can  insure, allowing many more elderly in  our country to be able to stay in their  homes.  I congratulate the leadership on both  sides of the aisle. This is an example of  the bipartisan effort in the Financial  Services Committee that has moved  forward meaningful legislation, and I  particularly thank my colleague and  ranking member of  the  committee,  MAXINEWATERS.

1567,57,2006-07-25,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to address a very important part  of this bill that increases Americans’  access to reverse mortgages.  Reverse mortgages are a tremendous  vehicle by which Americans can get access to the equity in their home to  make it available for health care, for  assistance,  for travel,  for education;  and now this bill will take three big  steps forward to make reverse mortgages more available.  First, it will do so by having a uniform national cap so that it will remove this cap in a lot of areas in the  country that have prevented Americans from having reverse mortgages.  Secondly, it will make it available  for, essentially, homeownership, which  might be in the best interests of senior  citizens.  Third, it will remove the cap on the  number of reverse mortgages that essentially  can  go  through  the FHA  home  equity  conversion  program,  which now issues 90 percent of the reverse mortgages in the country.  So this is a fantastic opportunity,  particularly for our seniors to be able  to have access to the equity in their  WATERS,  homes. It  is a big stride  forward. I  know a lot of seniors are going to take  advantage of it to make sure they can  stay in their homes, to use their equity  to finance having health care and assistance in their homes to give them  their liberty.  I want to thank the bipartisan effort  to put this together. I also want to  thank noted author Tom Kelly who has  been a great advocate for getting these  reverse mortgages used by more Americans.  ",2006
1568,57,2006-07-25,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes  to  the  gentlewoman  from  Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE).  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to revise and  extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, let me thank the chairman,  Mr. NEY, and his ranking member, Ms.  for their constant enhancement of opportunities for homeowners,  and allow me to congratulate the Congress who I hope will vote to add to the  American Dream.  I come  from a community where  under 50 percent own homes. So we are  still striving in Houston, Texas, to provide  those opportunities. There are  three elements that I think are very  crucial in this legislation that would  help expand that opportunity.  One, the risk-based pricing is a great  step up.  I have always argued that  there needs  to be  some  flexibility.  Credit scoring has denied many of our  hardworking taxpayers getting homes.  This at least allows a risk assessment  to be made on the homeowner’s credit  standing, and then if they emerge and  do better, they can get out from under  this assessment, and the ability  for  downpayment can range from high risk  to low risk. That is good.  In addition, including the 100 percent  financing for FHA is outstanding because in all of our jurisdictions, the  costs of housing is going up. One hundred percent is far better than 87 percent. Even Houston  is a high-dollar  market as more competition comes in  for housing.  I would also say that reverse mortgages is something that is an innovative tool. However, I hope in the legislation there is information to seniors  so that they understand, and others  who would partake of a reverse mortgage, what the pros and cons are so  that, in essence, it is a positive and not  a negative. You keep your house; you  do not lose it. You are, in fact, given  expanding opportunities.  So I congratulate my colleagues for  answering the question, Is the American Dream of homeownership for everyone? Yes, it is. It is for Houstonians  who have less of a 50 percent ownership. Yes,  it  is, and the Expanding  American Homeownership Act of the  Financial Services Committee  is  a  good start.  I congratulate and ask my colleagues  to support this particular legislation.

1570,71,2006-07-25,Mr. ISRAEL.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Promoting Transparency in  Financial Reporting Act, and I want to  thank my very good friend from Kentucky (Mr. DAVIS) for introducing this  important measure. I was pleased to  cosponsor it and I am very pleased to  work with him on the bill.  I also want to thank the chairman  and ranking member of the Financial  Services Committee, Mr. OXLEY and  Mr. FRANK, for bringing this bipartisan  legislation to the floor today.  H.R.  5024  requires  that  the chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange  Commission, the Financial Accounting  Standards Board, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board provide oral testimony to the Committee  on Financial Services on their efforts  to reduce the complexity in financial  reporting to provide more accurate and  clear  financial  information to  investors. These  appearances  before  the  committee would begin in 2007 and continue annually for 5 years.  Madam Speaker, the ability of America’s investors to make informed decisions is severely compromised when financial reporting is inaccurate, when  it is incomplete, when it is unclear. We  saw the consequences of bad financial  reporting years ago during the corporate  accountability  scandals  at  Enron and WorldCom, among others.  Those bankruptcies not only revealed  weaknesses in many aspects of our financial reporting system, but showed  the devastating financial impact when  their financial statements are not held  to the highest standards.  In many cases, the complexity of financial  reporting  requirements  has  made it very difficult to detect purposeful violations of those standards.  Congress, regulators, and the industry  assessed these financial reporting failures and reacted with efforts aimed at  strengthening the financial reporting  system. Sarbanes-Oxley made very important initial strides to this end; however, more needs to be done.  This measure is an important next  step. By calling on the SEC, PCAOB,  and FASB to testify each year on the  steps they are taking to improve financial disclosures, Congress is ensuring  that it can and will effectively carry  out  its oversight  function. We  can  gather the necessary  information to  ensure that, should we need to act legislatively, we are doing it in a sober,  thoughtful manner based on data rather than in haste as we respond to the  latest news cycle.  Madam Speaker, this legislation will  help us as we work with the FEC,  FASB and the PCAOB to improve our  financial reporting system. It is important that we maintain a consistent  focus on this issue. And, to that end, I  urge all of my colleagues to support  the measure. Again, I was pleased to  work closely with the gentleman from  Kentucky.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2006
1571,71,2006-07-25,Mr. DAVIS  of Kentucky.," Madam  Speaker, again, I want to reiterate my  thanks to the gentleman  from New  York. It has been a great process to see  this come to pass. Let’s pass this bill  as a first step toward creating a process for continuous improvement that  will simplify and improve our financial  reporting regulatory framework.  Madam Speaker, I have no other requests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  ",2006

Madam  Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5013) to amend  the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief  and Emergency Assistance Act to prohibit the confiscation of firearms during certain national emergencies, as  amended.  The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 5013  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006’’.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  Congress finds the following:  (1) The Second Amendment to the Constitution states that a ‘‘well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free  State, the right of the people to keep and  bear arms, shall not be infringed’’, and Congress has  repeatedly  recognized  this  language as protecting an individual right.  (2) In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, State  and local law enforcement and public safety  service organizations were overwhelmed and  could not fulfill the safety needs of the citizens of the State of Louisiana.  (3) In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the  safety of these citizens, and of their homes  and property, was threatened by instances of  criminal activity.  (4) Many of these citizens lawfully kept  firearms for the safety of themselves, their  loved ones, their businesses, and their property, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment, and used their firearms, individually  or in concert with their neighbors, for protection against crime.  (5) In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, certain agencies confiscated the  firearms of  these citizens in contravention of the Second  Amendment, depriving these citizens of the  right to keep and bear arms and rendering  them helpless against criminal activity.  (6) These confiscations were carried out at  gunpoint by nonconsensual entries into private homes, by traffic checkpoints, by stoppage of boats, and otherwise by force.  (7) The citizens from whom firearms were  confiscated were either in their own homes  or attempting to flee the flooding and devastation by means of motor vehicle or boat,  and were accosted, stopped, and arbitrarily  deprived of their private property and means  of protection.  (8) The means by which the confiscations  were carried out, which included intrusion  into the home, temporary detention of persons, and seizures of property, constituted  unreasonable searches and seizures and deprived these citizens of liberty and property  without due process of law in violation of  fundamental rights under the Constitution.  (9) Many citizens who took temporary refuge in emergency housing were prohibited  from storing firearms on the premises, and  were thus treated as second-class citizens  who had forfeited their constitutional right  to keep and bear arms.  (10) At least one highly-qualified search  and rescue team was prevented from joining  in relief efforts because the team included  individuals with firearms, although these individuals had been deputized as Federal law  enforcement officers.  (11) These confiscations and prohibitions,  and the means by which they were carried  out, deprived the citizens of Louisiana not  only of their right to keep and bear arms,  but also of their rights to personal security,  personal liberty, and private property, all in  violation of the Constitution and laws of the  United States.

Res. 145) expressing the sense of Congress in support of a national bike month and in  appreciation of cyclists and others for  promoting bicycle safety and the benefits of cycling.  The Clerk read as follows:  H. CON. RES. 145  Whereas there are over 57 million adult cyclists in the United States;  Whereas it is estimated that 100 million  United States citizens of all ages cycle each  year;  Whereas 5 million United States citizens  commute by bicycle to work;  Whereas  the bicycle  industry generates  more than $5 billion dollars a year and is an  important part of the economy of the United  States;  Whereas recreational cycling is a safe, low-  impact, aerobic activity for all ages;  Whereas when an individual cycles as a  form of regular exercise, the health of the individual may be increased;  Whereas a national bike month would provide an opportunity to educate United States  citizens about  the  importance of bicycle  safety and the health benefits of cycling;  Whereas most communities in the United  States officially recognize May 20th as Bike  to Work Day; and  Whereas the month of May has officially  been celebrated as National Bike Month by  the League of American Bicyclists and the  majority of the international cycling community since 1956: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved by the House of Representatives (the  Senate concurring), That it is the sense of  Congress that—  (1) United States citizens should observe a  national bike month to educate citizens of  the United States about the importance of  bicycle  safety and  the health,  transportation, recreational, and environmental benefits derived from cycling;  (2) health and transportation professionals  and organizations should promote bicycle  safety and the benefits of cycling; and  (3) United States citizens should salute the  more than 57 million cyclists in the United  States and the national and community organizations, individuals, volunteers, and professionals associated with cycling for promoting bicycle safety and the benefits of cycling.

1579,78,2006-07-25,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Since 1956, the international cycling  community and the League of American Bicyclists have celebrated May as  National Bike Month. This resolution  expresses the sense of Congress that  U.S. citizens should observe a National  Bike Month.  Over 100 million American citizens of  all ages cycle each year. In addition, 5  million people commute by bike to  work.  But these people are the exception,  not the rule. Over 57 million people in  the United States are overweight. 78  percent of Americans do not meet the  recommended basic levels of activity.  During this time when childhood obesity and type II diabetes are rising at  alarming rates, it is important that we  encourage people to a more active lifestyle.  Cycling is a safe, low impact, aerobic  activity for all ages. As more people  participate  in activities such as cycling, the recent trends in obesity and  type II diabetes can be reversed.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Bike  Caucus and cosponsor of this bill, I support efforts to publicize the benefits of  cycling and of bicycle safety. My home  State of Wisconsin is a leader among  the States in the number of trails our  residents can enjoy and more than half  a million people in Wisconsin ride a  bike at least once a month.  On  the business  side, we are  the  proud home of manufacturers of bikes  and bike products. Even the President  of  the United States  rides a Trek,  headquartered  in Wisconsin, as does  seven-time  Tour-de-France  winner  Lance Armstrong.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 145. By  establishing a National Bike Month we  are providing the opportunity to educate people about the importance of bicycle safety and the health benefits of  cycling.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
1580,78,2006-07-25,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this is the 50th year we  have observed Bike Month, and it has  been somewhat delayed coming to the  floor this year, but I think it is all the  more significant.  We  just witnessed this  last week,  American Floyd Landis in his heroic  victory in the Tour-de-France, just in  time for him to proceed with surgery  to replace his hip.  We have watched this summer as gasoline prices have exceeded $3 a gallon  across the country, and record high oil  prices. To say nothing of the continued  congestion,  pollution  and  parking  nightmares suffered by so many Americans. It is appropriate for us to reflect  on  the contributions of  the bicycle  today and its potential for the future.  b1530  The bicycle is the most efficient form  of urban transportation yet designed  by man. It is fun, healthy, inexpensive.  It  is often  identified with kids; and  that  is appropriate. We are working  hard to make it safe and attractive for  children. The recent reauthorization of  the Surface Transportation Act authorized almost two-thirds of $1 billion  for our historic Safe Routes to School  program. We are watching safety education for young cyclists around the  country.

1581,85,2006-07-25,Mr.  LATOURETTE.," Mr.  Speaker,  when we called up Bob Feller and said  we were going to be doing this and invited him to Washington tomorrow, he  said there are two people I need to see,  my good friend Senator JIMBUNNING,  who he knows, of course,  from the  Baseball Hall of Fame, and I have to  see my great friend, SHERRYBOEHLERT,  who  represents  Cooperstown,  New  York.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. BOEHLERT).  (Mr. BOEHLERT asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1582,85,2006-07-25,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, I have  to start with a confession. And here is  the confession: Bob Feller is one of my  heroes.  I say that unabashedly. It is not because to me as the ultimate baseball  junkie I appreciate the great game and  the great players; it is not just because  baseball’s mecca, the Baseball Hall of  Fame, is the epicenter of my district.  No, I appreciate and applaud Bob Feller  for all the things he has done on the diamond, but he is one of my heroes because of the person that he is, the guy  inside.  I have been privileged to get to know  Bob Feller quite well over the last several years. As a matter of fact, Memorial Day 2002, when the Baseball Hall of  Fame announced the policy that forevermore all veterans would be admitted free into that shrine, the mecca of  baseball, they had a special ceremony  to recognize the greats of the game  who served in the military when the  Nation needed them most. And it was  my high honor to present Bob Feller’s  submission.  b1615  There is there in the Hall of Fame  this plaque, a great big plaque with  some of the greats of the game, Ralph  Kiner, Warren Spahn, Phil Rizzuto, all  people who served in time of the Nation’s need. But the one that got the  most attention was Bob Feller. And I  will tell you this, think about the dynamics. In 1941, 23-year-old ace of the  Cleveland Indian staff, he won 23 games  that year. His record was 23–15. What  would that command in today’s market? He would have 14 agents and he  would have a gillion dollars’ worth of  offers  from every club  in the major  leagues because pitching is such a premium. So this ace, this admittedly acknowledged one of the best in the business anywhere, 2 days after Pearl Harbor, became the first member of Major  League Baseball to pack his belongings  and sign up  for his Nation. And he  served with great distinction all during  the war, World War  II,  in the U.S.  Navy. And when he came back, he resumed his career. You know the rest of  the story, so many of my colleagues  have said it so well. He was just absolutely a breathtaking talent on the  mound.  Mr. GINGREY reported on his father-  in-law mesmerized by what he saw. He  was just wonderful. But that typifies  the inner man. He is wonderful every  single day of his life, in his personal  life, and I am privileged to salute Bob  Feller and his very fine partner, his  wife Ann. They are truly great Americans.  ",2006
1583,85,2006-07-25,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  continue to reserve my time.  ",2006
1584,85,2006-07-25,Mr.  LATOURETTE.," Mr.  Speaker,  when we introduced this resolution, I  was riding over for a vote yesterday  and saw Mr. LEACH of Iowa, and his  eyes lit up when I said we were going  to do this, because he too has some remembrances that he wants to share  about Bob Feller. It is now my pleasure  to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. LEACH).  ",2006
1585,85,2006-07-25,Mr. LEACH.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding, and I thank the  gentleman particularly for bringing a  resolution about this son of Iowa.  I might  just mention, Bob Feller  comes from a small county west of Des  Moines called Dallas County. My family was originally  from this county.  This county produced a series of very  fine athletes in a given era. One was  our State’s great hero, a Heisman trophy winner  by  the  name  of Nile  Kinnick who lost his life in World War  II. Another was a first cousin of Bob  Feller’s named Hal Manders. Hal also  pitched major league baseball.  A number of years ago, Bob and Hal  visited me here in Washington, and Hal  gave me a small gift that I will treasure for the rest of my life. It was a picture of Bob Feller and Hal as ballplayers at about the age of 12, and they  were oversized kids on a small team,  and across the uniform was marked, I  believe, the Braves. And I asked Bob  Feller, what was the background of  this little league team? And Bob said,  you know, we lived kind of in the country, we didn’t have a team, so our two  fathers who were brothers-in-law started this team. And I said to Bob, well,  what would have happened if your father and your uncle didn’t start this  team? And he said, well, I never would  have pitched ball again.  And it is kind of a beautiful story for  all of us, because what he was saying  was that Bob Feller would not be Bob  Feller if he didn’t have a father who  dedicated some time to starting a little  league baseball team. And that is really the American system, the American  dream, the American family. I think  we give honor to Bob because we give  honor not just to a great athlete, but  to the idea of sport and to the idea and  the  ideals of American competition,  which he has always reflected the best  of. I thank you, Steve, for this moment.  ",2006
1586,85,2006-07-25,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  simply to close, I would just simply reiterate that America has never known  a greater athlete nor a greater spirit in  terms of one who would interrupt his  career as a professional athlete, join  the military, and go and fight for a  cause greater than the World Series.  Bob Feller was a hero to thousands and  thousands and thousands and will continue to be.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2006
1587,85,2006-07-25,Mr. LATOURETTE.," Mr. Speaker, in  closing, I just want to thank everyone  who spoke, Mr. BOEHLERT, Mr. LATHAM,  Mr. KUCINICH, Mr. DAVIS, again, and  thank Mr. DAVIS of Virginia and Mr.  LEACH for talking about Bob Feller. I  again would tell folks that at 87 years  old, he will be here tomorrow, and, if  schedules permit, I hope you take time  to say hello to him. I urge passage of  the resolution.

1593,127,2006-07-25,Mr. MCKEON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition  to  this  politically motivated motion to instruct. I believe we  are nearing the end of the pension reform conference, and this motion  is  nothing more than a last minute, desperate attempt to slow the most substantial retirement security reforms in  a generation.  Like the famous Yogi Berra saying,  this is deja vu all over again. Throughout this pension conference, opponents  of pension reform have attempted to  distract from the process through these  obstructionist tactics, and here we are  again ready to deal with yet another.  The latest motion to instruct, or motion to obstruct as is truly the case, is  little more than a random jumble of  unrelated issues being discussed in the  ongoing  pension  conference.  From  purely a policy perspective, it is irresponsible  to mix and confuse  these  complicated  issues  in  this  fashion.  Members with opinions on one or more  of these  issues should not be  forced  into contradicting positions on other  issues. But let’s be very clear up front.  This has nothing do with policy. It is  all about politics.  This  pension  legislation  we  are  crafting is complicated, and those who  support passing legislation to fix our  pension system are working hard to  bring a final bill before the full House  and Senate for consideration. What the  opponents of reform are doing today is  putting their good names on a bull-in-  a-china-shop exercise. They have cherry-picked a handful of Senate positions  that have evolved over time. It is reckless and, in the end, it will do nothing  to advance the process. Here are just a  handful of its flaws.  Number 1, this motion to  instruct  would tie the hands of those who voluntarily offer hybrid plans, which are  the sole bright spot in the defined benefit system. To place restrictions on a  system  that actually provides more  generous benefits for the majority of  workers than do traditional plans sets  a very bad precedent.  Number 2, this motion to  instruct  also would increase the deficit of the  PBGC, which is exactly the opposite of  what we are trying to do. If this provision were  applied,  taxpayers  could  count on an additional cost of $2.5 billion to the PBGC over the next 10  years.  Number 3, this motion to  instruct  would assign the PBGC which, in some  respects, is like an insurance company,  with developing  industrial policy  for  the troubled plans via a ‘‘workout program.’’  This  would  pit  companies  against one another. And this process  would be steered by a quasi-governmental agency, often dependent upon  the whims of the administration  in  power.  And finally, this motion to instruct  attempts to score partisan points on  the  issue of executive compensation.  But this is an issue the House bill already responsibly addresses, and any  final conference will do the same. The  House-passed pension reform restricts  golden parachute agreements when the  rank and file plan is considered at-risk.  Mr. Speaker, this last ditch attempt  to distract from our reform efforts is as  transparent as it is desperate. Fortunately, the end of this conference is in  sight, and the reforms needed to ensure  the defined benefits system remains  viable  for generations  to  come are  nearly in place.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on  the motion to instruct, and reject this  attempt to obscure our progress.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
1594,127,2006-07-25,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. ANDREWS).  (Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1595,127,2006-07-25,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my friend for yielding. I rise in support  of his motion.  I want to try to explain, Mr. Speaker,  to our  colleagues what one of  the  issues in Mr. MILLER’s motion has to  do with.  Let’s assume that we have a pension  plan that is only 75 percent funded;  that is to say, it has $75 for every $100  that it needs to meet its pension obligations. Under the bill that passed the  House, the people that run that plan  could say the following: The CEO of the  company could continue to get 100 percent of the benefits that he was entitled to under the plan, the wealthiest  person in the company. But the person  who cleans his office at night could  have her pension cut.  Let me say this again. If the plan had  $75 for every $100 that it needs, under  the provision the House passed, the  CEO of the company gets every nickel  that he is entitled to. No cut at all.  But the custodian who cleans his office  at night, or the clerk who types his letters, or the person who delivers his  documents, could have their pension  cut considerably.  Now, this is not right. This is not  right. If some employees are going to  take a cut in their pension, then it  seems fair that everyone should share  equally in that punishment.  One of the great principles of the  American economy is that a rising tide  lifts all boats. When a company prospers, so does everyone in the rank and  file, so does every shareholder, so does  every investor, one would hope. And  lots of decisions are predicated upon  that principle.  We want the executives to flourish  and prosper, because if they do, they  will make better decisions for the people who clean the offices and type the  letters and deliver the documents.  But the corollary to that principle is,  if the boat is sinking, then some people  can’t jump off the boat into a life boat  while everybody else stands there as  the ship goes down. That seems rather  fair.  One might call this the Titanic principle, you know, where the people who  were in the luxury compartments got  to the life boats first, but the people  locked in steerage sank to the bottom  of the Atlantic Ocean.  The Senate has a very different provision. Ninety-seven senators voted in  favor of this provision; and it said, very  simply, the same rule that applies to  the lady who cleans the office at night  should apply to the CEO who sits in the  office all day long. Ninety-Seven senators voted in favor of that provision.  Two voted against it.  Mr. MILLER’s motion wisely says that  this House should go on record as saying that is the provision we ought to  adopt. Vote ‘‘yes.’’  ",2006

1599,134,2006-07-25,Mr. EMANUEL.," Mr. Speaker, while  the Republican Members of Congress  have been blocking the first minimum-  wage increase in 9 years, there is new  evidence that income stagnation is not  just hurting lower middle-class families but middle-class  families across  the board.  Just the other day, the Los Angeles  Times reported that income stagnation  is now hitting people with a 4-year college  education.  In  fact,  the White  House’s own economists  report  that  earnings and  income  for  employees  with 4-year college degrees fell by 5.2  percent between 2000 and 2004, during  the President’s  first  term. That  is  when adjusted for inflation. So, basically, if you have a college degree education, you had a decline in income.  Now, for 30 years, 40 years we have  told people that you earn what you  learn. A college degree today  is no  longer as valuable a ticket to success  as it was before. You have to literally  go back 30 years, to the 1970s stagflation, when people with a college education saw their income decline.  Now, what is happening in addition  to  income decline  in America? This  isn’t just for working stiffs. This is for  people with a 4-year college education  and also for people with a master’s education.  Energy prices? Well,  they are up,  more than doubled. In fact, when the  President took office, gas was $1.33 a  gallon. Today, it has gone up to close  to $3 a gallon.  Health care costs. Health care costs  for a family of four has risen 78 percent, to $11,000 a year for a family of  four.  College costs for their kids, up 38 percent for a 4-year college education.  Savings,  for  the  first  time  since  World War II, are in negative territory,  which is why people say bankruptcy  and debt is one of their biggest economic concerns besides filling up their  car with gas.  So take that whole picture: incomes  declining, energy prices up, close to  doubling; health care costs $11,000 a  year  for a  family of  four, and continuing at 25 percent increases; college  costs up 38 percent; savings in negative  territory. We have a Swiss cheese economy, and it is hurting and killing the  middle class, who have done everything  right. They got told to get a college  education  and  you  earn what  you  learn. Today  that college education  ain’t  enough. They went  out  and  earned a master’s degree in education.  That ain’t enough.  And on top of that, besides incomes  going down, all the costs to maintain a  middle-class life, health care, energy  costs, education, and retirement security, are all under attack. And what do  my colleagues do when it comes to retirement  security, when corporation  after corporation is eliminating pensions? They want Social Security to  lead the way.  The  plan  for  retirement  security  isn’t, when companies are eliminating  pensions,  to  have  Social  Security  eliminated or privatized. It is to give  them that security that people know,  that people like, and that is the security that comes with Social Security.  On energy. What is their answer to  rising costs? As my colleague from Oregon said before, they handed over $14.5  billion in taxpayer subsidies to big oil  companies so they could make additional profit. My view is if gas is 75  bucks a barrel, or 74 bucks a barrel, let  the free market work. Use your profits  to drill. Don’t take taxpayers to subsidize it. People out there are paying  twice, once at the pump at 3 bucks a  gallon and once on April 15 when we  hand over $15 billion a year.  And  for health  care  costs? They  handed off to the pharmaceutical companies an additional  $130 billion  in  profits.  Middle-class families are struggling  with  ever-increasing  taxes,  ever-increasing costs and stagnant incomes. It  is time to have an economic strategy  that, again, lifts all boats.  Now, I don’t want to take a stroll  down memory lane; but in the 1990s,  when we were running balanced budgets and we were running a surplus, incomes for all people, not just the top  end, but for all workers were up. College costs were contained, health care  inflation was running alongside regular  inflation, and energy prices were actually $1.33 a gallon, not 3 bucks a gallon.  That was a time in which we actually  made an improvement. We invested by  giving all kids health care whose parents didn’t have health care. We created 22 million jobs. We ended welfare  as we know it. We put people to work  rather than dependency. We had record  homeownership,  low  inflation, a balanced budget,  record  surpluses, and  began to pay down the debt.  Put your fiscal house in order. Invest  in education, health care, and energy  independence in America. It is time for  a change. It is time for new priorities.  f  VENEZUELA AND TERRORISM  (Mr. ROYCE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1600,134,2006-07-25,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker, last week,  the Subcommittee  on  International  Terrorism that I chair held a hearing  on Venezuela’s link to terrorism. On  May  15,  the State Department designated Venezuela as not cooperating  fully with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts.  Mr. Speaker, from what we heard from  the Department officials, it is not that  Venezuela is not cooperating fully; it is  that Venezuela is not cooperating at  all.  Disconcerting was the testimony we  heard from the State Department that  Venezuelan passports  can be  forged  with child-like ease, and that the U.S.  is detaining at our borders an increasing number of third-country aliens carrying false Venezuelan documents. According to a 2003 U.S. News report,  thousands of Venezuelan identity documents are being distributed  to  foreigners from Middle Eastern nations,  including Syria, Pakistan, Egypt and  Lebanon.  We know that travel documents are  as important as weapons for terrorists.

We are a group of 37 Democrats that  are fiscally conservative, that want to  restore some common sense and fiscal  discipline to our Nation’s government.  We are a group of 37 that are sick and  tired of all of the partisan bickering  that goes on in this Chamber and in  our Nation’s capital.  Mr. Speaker, it should not be about  whether it is a Democratic idea or a  Republican idea. It ought to be about is  it a common sense idea, and does it  make sense for the people who send us  here to be their voice at our Nation’s  capital.  Mr. Speaker, I contend that this Republican  leadership,  this Republican  administration, is not leading us down  the correct path. Our country is not on  the right track when it comes to our  Nation’s  finances, when  it comes to  being good stewards of the American  people’s tax money.  As you can see here on the Blue Dog  Coalition  poster,  today  the United  States’s  national  debt  is  $8,419,336,525,769.  For every man, woman and child, including the children born today, every  United States citizen’s share of the national debt is a staggering $28,129. And  the sad reality is that during this hour,  during this Blue Dog Special Order,  during the next 60 minutes, this number, the U.S. national debt, will go up  by approximately $41,666,000.  As fiscally conservative Democrats,  we believe the time is now to restore  common sense and fiscal discipline to  our Nation’s government. This $28,129  number, each citizen’s share of the national debt which is what we in the  Blue Dog Coalition refer to as the debt  tax, D-e-b-t, that is one tax that cannot be cut.

I found what you just went  over with your numbers very  interesting, because in coming here tonight  to talk about the economy and the  very good news of what America is facing with the growth in our economy because of the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, I  wanted to share with you that there  was an excellent article in The Wall  Street Journal today, and it went right  along the same path of what you just  said.  That article started out by saying  that John F. Kennedy believed that an  economy hampered by restrictive tax  rates will never produce enough revenue to balance our budget, just as it  will never  produce  enough  jobs  or  enough profits.  In those days, when the Kennedy tax  cuts were passed, 80 percent of Democratic Senators and Representatives  voted for those Kennedy tax cuts. But  the article goes on to point out that in  2003, when these most recent tax cuts  were passed, only 7 of 205 Democrat  Representatives voted  for  those  tax  cuts. And, more than that, the editorials across the Nation went on to  call the tax cuts economically unsound  and claimed they would increase the  deficits by hundreds of billions of dollars and said they were unlikely to  stimulate the wallowing economy.  What we have seen is absolutely the  opposite of that.

So, Mr. RYAN, when folks come to the  floor and start talking about, and Mr.  DELAHUNT, what the American people  can do, tell you what, why don’t we  play fair? We have control of the minimum wage, Mr. DELAHUNT, we can  raise the minimum wage.  On this side of the aisle we said,  number one, we will be raising the minimum wage. Okay, not raising the salaries for Members of Congress.  ",2006
1608,155,2006-07-25,Mr. RYAN of Ohio., Within the first  100 hours.  ,2006
1609,155,2006-07-25,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Within the  first 100 hours we are willing to move  forward, and we have said it, in our  new direction  for America. We have  said we are going to cut student loan  costs  in half, Madam Speaker, more  than the Republican majority that is  in control now.  We have said that we are going to  move in the direction of true energy innovation,  investing  in  the Midwest  versus the Middle East, here in America with E–85 ethanol. Republican majority has the House now. They are not  doing it.  We have said that we are going to  pay as we go and have real fiscal responsibility, because we are the only  party in this Chamber, Mr. DELAHUNT,  that can say we have actually balanced  the budget. We have balanced the budget, with surpluses as far as the eye can  see. The Republican majority  takes  over and we are borrowing from countries that we have  issues with,  like  China, Japan, and the U.K. Well, not  the U.K., but other countries that are  questionable. OPEC  nations. And  I  don’t even want to go through that  list.  So when we start talking about these  things, gentlemen, and when they come  to the floor, and this is a free country  and what a democracy, but meanwhile,  Mr. DELAHUNT, we have veterans that  have  fought, some are at Arlington  Cemetery for paying the ultimate price  for us to salute one flag. We look at the  services and the things that we have  promised veterans, and this is not a  Democrat  or  Republican  or  Independent or nonvoter issue, this is an  American issue. To see veterans having  to wait 2 and 3 months to see a specialist at a VA hospital, whether it be  a foot doctor, an eye doctor, or just  getting a simple exam, is unacceptable,  especially when the Republican majority is giving tax breaks in a record  breaking way to individuals that are  not even asking for them, and when  billionaires have $398 million retirement packages, I think it is important  for us to come to the floor and share  this with the American people.  It is not only important, it is our obligation. So that the reason why, Mr.  I  sir,  DELAHUNT, as I land, that it is important, no matter how late, if it is 11:40  at night or it is a few minutes before 10  p.m.  ",2006

1613,155,2006-07-25,Mr. MEEK  of Florida.," We  have  worked all day, and some Members of  Congress, Madam Speaker, are home  enjoying  themselves,  relaxing, what  have you, some are working in their offices right now answering their e-mails  or regular mail, that we come to the  floor, take away from what some may  say is our personal time after we finish  our regular business, that we come to  the floor to show how we have the will  and the desire to put America in a new  direction and not only fight for working class folks, but making sure that  those that pay their price to this country, which are a number of Americans  but especially our veterans, will be  treated with dignity and respect.  ",2006

1615,155,2006-07-25,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Yes,  would yield, ",2006
1616,155,2006-07-25,Mr. RYAN.,  ,2006
1617,155,2006-07-25,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Because I think it  is so important that the American people and the Members who are watching  this  here  tonight  understand  that  things will  be  completely  different  when the Democrats take over in January; that we will, within the first, not  100  days,  Madam  Speaker,  Mr.  DELAHUNT, but within  the  first  100  hours out of this House we will pass a  minimum wage increase that will get  us in a few years to $7.50 an hour; that  we will, in the first 100 hours, cut student loan interest rates in half for parents and for students, which will save  families $5,000 over the course of the  loan.  We are not rocket scientists. We are  not saying we have some extravagant  plan that is very elaborate and very  complex. These are basic fundamental  things. We are going to strip the oil  companies of the $16 billion that they  get in subsidies, and we are going to  put that towards education and innovation and alternative energy sources.  And all these things we need to do, Mr.  DELAHUNT, in order for us to be competitive as a country.  ",2006

1619,155,2006-07-25,Mr. RYAN.," I just want to make sure we  are accurate. It is $7.25, not $7.50, sir,  that we want to move the minimum  wage. I want to make sure that we are  accurate. I know you mistakenly said  $7.50. I would like to do $7.50, but our  plan is $7.25, just for the record. Because we believe in making sure that  even when we make a mistake to level  with the American people.  ",2006
1620,155,2006-07-25,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Reclaiming my  time, I yield to my friend from Massachusetts.  ",2006
1621,155,2006-07-25,Mr. DELAHUNT.,"  I appreciate  the  gentleman yielding his  time, and  I  want to compliment my friend from  Florida, Mr. MEEK, because he just did  something that is rare in Washington.  He acknowledged that there was an  error; that there was a mistake. Because you will never hear that on the  floor of this House.  But the American people, I would  submit, want their elected officials to  acknowledge when a policy has failed  and come up with another idea and be  forthright about  it. I mean, when I  hear about all of the problems that  haven’t been solved because of a minority party, I begin to wonder, is there an  alternative reality there?  As I said earlier, Madam Speaker, the  Republican majority has owned this  Chamber for 12 years. Where have you  been? Now you are talking about fiscal  responsibility. And the reason you are  talking about it is because there is 100  days to an election. That is why you  are talking about  it. And you talk  about the direction of the country. You  know, we talk about a new direction  and a  change  in direction, Madam  Speaker, because  there  is no alternative.  If we continue to go and continue to  chart the same course that the administration and the Republican House and  the Republican Senate have charted for  the United States, we will be in serious  trouble. And let me just give you four  statistics:  Since  the Republicans  have  controlled both branches of Congress in  the last 5 years, and President Bush  was inaugurated in 2001, college tuition  has increased by 40 percent, health care  costs to the American people have increased by 55 percent, and gas prices  have increased by 79 percent.  But Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, you  know what has gone down in this country? Madam Speaker, you know what  has declined in this country? Median  household income. A family of four in  this country,  since  the Republicans  have governed here in this institution  for 5 years, the average American family has experienced a decline of 4 percent in their income. On top of all the  escalating costs that are eating away  at their security, everyone in America  knows  that  retirement  security no  longer exists. They know that their  health care plan can be canceled at any  time. They know that they won’t be  able to afford to send their children to  college because they can’t afford the  loans. I mean, the list goes on and on.  We have got to change the direction of  this country.  With  that,  I yield  woman from Florida.  ",2006
1622,155,2006-07-25,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Thank  you so much to my good friend, Mr.  DELAHUNT, and I am glad to be here  with my three good friends from the 30-  something Working Group.  You know, the answer to the question  that  is  on  everybody’s mind,  which is why do they keep moving us  in this direction? Well, if you actually  shine a light or a magnifying glass on  what is really going on here, then it  would be clear that their priorities are  all wrong. So instead, what they do is  they engage in the politics of distraction, like they did all during last week.  the gentleto  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:51 Jul 26, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00155 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K25JY7.166 H25JYPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

1632,176,2006-07-25,Mr. LEAHY.," I thank the Chair. Mr.  President, today, the Senate considers  the nomination of Jerome A. Holmes  for a lifetime appointment to the Court  of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Just  last week we confirmed another nominee to the Tenth Circuit, the fifth to be  appointed  by  this  President.  This  progress comes in stark contrast to the  seven years in which a Republican-led  Senate failed to confirm a single new  judge for that court. Indeed, when I  moved forward with the nominations of  Harris Hartz of New Mexico, Terrence  O’Brien  of Wyoming,  and Michael  McConnell of Utah, it broke a longstanding partisan barricade that had  been  maintained  by  Republicans.  Among the victims of the Republican  obstruction were outstanding lawyers  President Clinton nominated such as  James Lyons and Christine Arguello,  who were never even granted hearings  by  the Republican majority. Judge  Lyons was among the many Clinton  nominees  voted  unanimously  ‘‘Well  Qualified’’ by the American Bar Association who were never granted hearings, and Ms. Arguello is a talented  Hispanic attorney whose nomination  had significant, widespread and bipartisan support from her community and  State. They were among the more than  60 qualified, moderate judicial nominees of President Clinton that Republicans  ‘‘pocket  filibustered’’ and defeated without hearings or votes of any  kind.  Just last Thursday, Democratic Senators  joined  in  the confirmation of  Judge Gorsuch, an extremely conservative nominee, and three others. Working together we confirmed two circuit  court nominees and two Federal trial  court nominees in a matter of minutes.  We brought the total number of judicial nominees confirmed during this  President’s term to 255, which exceeds  the total for the last 51⁄2years of the  Clinton administration. It brought the  total number of judges confirmed over  the last 18 months to 50. Of course, during the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee the Senate confirmed  100 lifetime judges, twice as many in  less time. Last week’s success demonstrates  again how we  can make  progress in filling vacancies by working together. Senator SALAZAR’s support for Judge Gorsuch was a critical  factor  in our ability to act swiftly.  Senator LINCOLN’s and Senator PRYOR’s  support for confirming Judge Shepherd  to the Eighth Circuit likewise made a  real difference.  Regrettably, this nomination we consider today is not without controversy  and concern. Mr. Holmes initially was  nominated to fill a district court seat  in Oklahoma. The White House withdrew that nomination and renominated  him to the circuit court after Judge  James H. Payne asked the President to  withdraw his nomination. That withdrawal came after public reports that  Judge Payne had ruled on a number of  cases in which he had a conflict of interest. While the committee never had  a chance to hear directly from Judge  Payne about  the  reported conflicts,  these types of conflicts are a violation  of Federal law as well as canons of judicial ethics and have no place on the  Federal bench. Certainly, they should  not be rewarded with a promotion.  Before Mr. Holmes’ hearing, I raised  concerns about the many controversial  letters and columns he has written on  such topics as juror racial bias, affirmative  action,  discrimination,  and  school vouchers. In these writings, Mr.  Holmes derided opposing points of view  and those who held them. I asked Mr.  Holmes to address my concerns about  how he might rule on civil rights issues  and how he would treat litigants as a  judge. Regrettably, Mr. Holmes’ stock  answers to my questions that he would  follow Supreme Court precedent have  not reassured me that he would be the  kind of judge who understands the critical role of the courts as a protection  of individual rights and civil rights.  In one column, Mr. Holmes described  certain allegations of racial prejudice  at criminal trials as ‘‘harmful’’ because  it ‘‘bolster[s] the cynical view that jurors vote along racial  lines,’’ which  ‘‘undermines public confidence in the  fairness of the criminal  justice system.’’ In fact, Mr. Holmes suggested  that it is the focus on the problem of  racial bias  in  jury selection—as opposed to the racial bias itself that—  harms the criminal justice system. He  wrote  that  focusing  on  racial  bias  ‘‘may actually give the green light to  jurors to exercise arbitrary power in  the jury box when their racial number  allow it.’’  The Supreme Court has long recognized that racial bias in jury selection  undermines constitutional guarantees  to a fair trial, establishing in the landmark 1986 decision Batson v. Kentucky  that striking jurors on the basis of race  is unconstitutional. In contrast to Mr.  Holmes’ statement that accusations of  racial  bias  are merely  ‘‘cynical,’’  Batson was based on evidence showing  patterns of race discrimination in jury  selection. It has been reaffirmed repeatedly during the last 20 years in  sharp contrast  to  the views of Mr.  Holmes. I gave Mr. Holmes every opportunity to admit error and indicate  not only that he had learned of the Supreme Court’s precedent but that he  had adopted that view of the law and  accepted the prohibitions against racial discrimination as  just, but  received no such reassurance.  Instead,  the  nominee  begrudgingly  acknowledged that he would have to follow Supreme Court precedent when expressly  bound by it.  In another column Mr. Holmes wrote  after the Supreme Court’s landmark affirmative action decision, Grutter v.  Bollinger, he criticized the High Court  for missing an ‘‘important opportunity  to drive the final nail in the coffin of  affirmative action’’ and said that the  ‘‘court did not go far enough: Affirmative action is still alive.’’ In addition,  he described affirmative action scholarship programs as  involving classifications that are ‘‘constitutionally dubious and morally offensive.’’  This was a landmark case and in it  Justice Sandra Day O’Connor spoke for  the Supreme Court and the Nation.  Justice O’Connor, a conservative appointed by President Reagan, considered the facts and the law carefully.  She took into account the brief from 65  leading U.S. corporations that noted  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:17 Jul 26, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G25JY6.011 S25JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o y r r e h c y         ",2006
1633,183,2006-07-25,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Oklahoma.  ,2006
1634,183,2006-07-25,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, first, let  me  thank  the  junior Senator  from  Oklahoma for the time he spent on the  floor and the time he spent defending  this man, not that he should ever need  any type of defense against some of the  accusations. I didn’t realize that there  is an article referred to where he stated: There are other ways to get minority students on college campuses besides handing out benefits based solely  on skin color.  I am proud of it. I am also proud of  the  fact that I have known Jerome  Holmes  for  some  5 years. Frankly,  prior to this nomination, I made recommendations to the President that he  consider this man because he is so incredibly qualified. We all agree he is a  man of great character and undeniably  fit for the bench. He has connections  with both Oklahoma City and throughout Oklahoma, as well as the District  of Columbia, a family history that goes  back.  He was one of the prominent figures  in the Oklahoma City bombing that  took place 11 years ago. He was on the  Oklahoma  City  bomb  prosecution  team, and I believe it was his distinguished service as assistant U.S. attorney that really began to set him apart  in the legal field.  When asked about Mr. Holmes, most  lawyers in Oklahoma begin their compliments with his work as U.S. assistant attorney in some public corruption  cases in our State. He is someone who  is willing to get in there and criticize  and open up things other people aren’t,  a great characteristic and I think very  important. But if I were to single out  another one, I would say his chairmanship of City Rescue Mission in Oklahoma. This is their mission statement:  Serving the homeless both with help, hope,  and healing in the spirit of excellence, under  the call of Christ.  I have certainly made my position  known for quite some time concerning  him and how he limits his opinions to  the facts, the litigants, and law before  him in any case. At a time when our  Nation is faced with the onslaught of  judicial activism, he  is a breath of  fresh air and I believe he is a man of  character and principle; that he will  rule justly within the parameters of  the law.  We have a resolution from the Oklahoma Bar Association.  I  have  the  former president of the American Bar  Association, the president-elect of the  local Federal bar association, I have  the deans of all three of the Oklahoma  law schools praising him in the highest  of terms.  Judge Holloway, currently sitting on  the Tenth Circuit, noted Mr. Holmes’s  compassion for people whose cases were  before the court. John Richter, the  U.S. attorney for the Western District  of Oklahoma, who worked with Mr.  Holmes, can speak from the prosecutor’s perspective and has said that Mr.  Holmes is a man of integrity and character and possesses a rock-solid work  ethic.  Mike Turpen is someone with whom  Senator COBURN is very  familiar.  I  don’t believe in the years I have known  Mike—and we have one of these very  honest relationships. He is a very partisan Democrat. I don’t think he has  ever said anything nice about a Republican in his life except Jerome Holmes.  Dan Webber—we have all these Democrats who are lined up without anyone  dissenting from the idea that this guy  is the perfect nominee to be confirmed  to the Tenth Circuit.  Judge Ralph Thompson—I was elected to the State legislature with Judge  Thompson. I considered him not just  one of my closest personal friends, but  he is certainly a judge of distinction in  Oklahoma and has been  for over 30  years. He ought to know a thing or two  about judges. He said:  Mr. Holmes is dedicated completely to the  rule of law, the proper role of the judiciary  and to applying and  interpreting the  law  without regard to personal views on given  issues.  I don’t think there is any judge, any  Federal judge in the history of Oklahoma, who  is more highly regarded  than Judge Thompson. He also went on  to affirm Mr. Holmes’s honesty and  compassion.  I have a letter from Pastor George  Young, a member of the NAACP and  the Urban League, who showed great  character in voicing his support for Mr.  Holmes. He said: I trust Mr. Holmes,  and so in light of our differences I support his nomination. Now, he is one  who doesn’t agree with  everything,  every statement that Jerome Holmes  has made, and yet he supports his nomination. He is for him.

1637,197,2006-07-25,Mr. ENSIGN.," Mr. President, the Senator from California said twice today  that this bill protects a  father who  commits incest with his daughter. In  other words, he can commit a crime  and still take her across State lines to  get an abortion.  That  argument  is  illogical. Obviously, a father is a parent. In a State  with a parental consent law, he is a  parent with rights under State law. If  he wants his daughter to have an abortion, to cover up his own crime, he can  freely give his consent to allow his  daughter to have the abortion in their  State of residence. That father doesn’t  have to take his daughter across State  lines. As a result, this bill does not affect such an outcome one way or the  other. His abuse of his daughter in that  situation is not only morally wrong, it  is illegal. This bill doesn’t affect that  situation one way or another. So to say  we are protecting a father’s right to go  across State lines—it is an argument,  frankly, that just doesn’t hold water. It  just doesn’t.

1640,204,2006-07-25,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, I thank  the Senator from Nevada, Mr. ENSIGN,  for his leadership on this issue and for  yielding time and for bringing this important matter before the Senate.  My colleague from California mentioned that this  is an election year  ploy. But I think the last time this was  voted on in the Senate was in 1998.  That was a cloture vote. I don’t know  that there has ever been an up-or-down  vote in the Senate. It has been voted  on in the House.  I think most people see this particular provision as something that is a  commonsense approach to this issue.  Obviously, there are a lot of labels that  are thrown around in this very contentious debate in our country. But when  it comes to this particular issue, the  courts have laid out some parameters  under which States can operate when it  comes to statutes that they adopted  that impose conditions and restrictions  on abortion. The undue burden requirement that came out of the Planned  Parenthood v. Casey decision many  years ago created this scenario where if  there is not an undue burden, that statutes enacted by States can impose restrictions. And many States have done  that.  One that many States have adopted  is the issue of parental consent or parental notification. In fact, there are  about  37 States  to date  that have  adopted  in  some  fashion  that  particular legislation. Thirty-seven States  have enacted statutes imposing legal  obligations on pregnant minors to notify or gain the consent of their parents before getting an abortion. S. 403,  which we are debating today, does not  supercede or otherwise alter any of  those laws, nor does it impose any parental notice or consent requirement  on any State. These are States that  adopted these laws. The bill would only  give effect to a State’s parental  involvement law if that law is constitutional. Therefore, any State parental  consent law given effect under this bill  must contain a judicial bypass provision which allows the minor girl to petition a judge to waive the parental notification requirement.

1641,211,2006-07-25,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Senate is bypassing  normal procedure  to debate a  controversial bill on which the Senate refused to proceed 8 years ago. That was  the last action taken on this kind of  bill. Since then 8 years have passed.  Our Constitution has not changed. I am  thankful for that. The complex issues  and federalism concerns that so many  Senators voiced 8 years ago still remain. So if anything has changed, it is  difficult to know. Instead of regular  order and allowing the committee of  jurisdiction to gather the facts, to consider the legislation, to amend it or reject it, we find ourselves proceeding almost helter-skelter on what is a very  serious matter with  important personal, privacy and legal implications.  It is a striking contrast that we turn  to this bill after last week’s bipartisan  unifying effort in which we took four  months to hold nine hearings and work  with our counterparts in the House to  reauthorize key provisions of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965. If that  process exemplified the Senate at its  best, this proceeding stands in sharp  contrast. The press is reporting that  the Senate is being required to turn to  this bill at this time as part of the Republican-designed run up to the elections. Having spent time on a constitutional amendment that would have cut  back on the Bill or Rights, having  wasted precious time seeking to write  discrimination into the Constitution,  this is next on their campaign checklist of items needed to rev up their voting base. In fact, having just seen the  President reject our efforts to authorize Federal funds for vital stem cell research with his first official veto, they  now rush to reopen the abortion debate. I am a little surprised they are  not seeking another vote on some further  intervention  into  the  circumstances of Terri Schiavo and her  family.  In fact, the bill before us, like the  legislation rushed to the floor to intervene in Florida’s legal system in the  case of Terri Schiavo, is another case  of congressional overreaching and of  trying to federalize decisions that previously have been left to the States. I  unequivocally support the goal of fostering closer familial relationships and  the value of encouraging parental involvement in a child’s decision about  how to respond to an unplanned pregnancy. We all do. That is not the issue.  I thank Senators BOXER, MENENDEZ,  LAUTENBERG, and FEINSTEIN for bringing amendments seeking to make this  legislative  consideration worthwhile  and beneficial to those in need of government help, rather than an imposition of the heavy hand of government  intervention. I support their amendments.  The underlying bill, however, raises  challenging issues of federalism that  caused many of us to reject it before  and will lead me to oppose it, again. I  find it ironic that many of the same  people who insist that fully considered  State  laws on civil union and civil  partnership and marriage not be respected, are those who in the context  of this  legislation  insist that State  laws be held to bind people even when  they travel outside their States, and  that Federal criminal law become the  enforcement mechanism to ensure that  they are binding.  The underlying bill does  little  to  strengthen communication and trust in  families. While I know as a father that  most parents hope their children would  turn to them in times of crisis, no law  will make that happen. No  law will  force a young pregnant woman to talk  to her parents when she is too frightened to do so. This bill does not increase the perception of choices  for  such young women. Rather, it is likely  to drive young women who are afraid  to seek help from their families away  from  their  families and greatly  increase the dangers they face from an  unwanted pregnancy.  The nature of our Federal system revolves around States maintaining their  historically dominant  role  in developing and implementing policies that  affect  family matters, such as marriage, divorce, end-of-life choices, child  custody and policies on parental  involvement  in minors’ abortion decisions. I respect that. I respect each  State to define those family relationships and have resisted Federal intrusion  into  those matters.  Congress  should not dictate the nature of family  relationships. I had hoped we learned  our lesson on this when the American  people  reacted with outrage  to  the  President and Congress intervening in  the Terri Schiavo matter.  Twenty-six States have adopted parental  consent  or notification  laws  that are currently enforced and meet  the bill’s definition of a ‘‘law requiring  parental  involvement  in  a minor’s  abortion decision.’’ That means that  the remaining States—the 24 States  that  include  Vermont—either  have  opted for no such law, or have decided  on a State law that allows for the involvement of adults other than a parent or guardian in the minor’s reproductive decision. While I respect the 26  notification law States, I also respect  the 24 other States and the privacy  rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

1642,218,2006-07-25,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President.  I  rise  today  in support of  legislation protecting the most important relationship of all: that of parents and their  children. The  family  is  the  fundamental,  crucial  and  indispensable  building block of our civilization, and  parents are at its center. Yet, when it  comes to one of the most important decisions in life, children are being kept  from the guidance of their parents. I  am talking, of course, about the decision whether or not to have an abortion.  The American people believe  that  parents should be involved in deciding  whether their daughter should undergo  an  abortion. Statistics  consistently  show this, and the Supreme Court has  upheld this. As the Court noted in the  decision of H.L. v. Matheson: ‘‘the medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious  and can be lasting; this is particularly  so when the patient is immature.’’ In  the case of Parham V. J.R. the Court  said ‘‘[t]he law’s concept of the family  rests on a presumption that parents  possess what a child lacks in maturity,  experience, and capacity for judgment  required for making life’s difficult decisions.’’  Convinced of the soundness of this  reasoning, at least 48 States have enacted laws requiring consent of or notification to at least one parent, or authorization by a judge, before a minor  can obtain an abortion. Unfortunately,  this wise policy is being undermined.  Thousands of children every year are  taken across State  lines by people  other than their parents to secure secret abortions. As we speak, abortion  providers across the Nation, operating  in States with no parental consent or  notification laws, are taking out advertisements in phonebooks outside of the  State where they operate in order to  attract underage patients  in neighboring States with different laws. They  are doing this in my home State of  Idaho. They are doing this in Pennsylvania, blatantly trumpeting the  fact  that their clinics, outside of Pennsylvania, do not require parental notification as Pennsylvania does. In essence,  these abortion providers are encouraging people to circumvent one State’s  parental notification law by crossing  the border into another for a secret  abortion.  The tragedy is that thousands of non-  related  adults  take  this  suggestion  every year in successful attempts to  circumvent the law. In one highly publicized case, a 12-year-old girl living in  a State with a constitutionally upheld  parental notification law became pregnant by an 18-year-old man. The man’s  mother took her for an abortion in a  neighboring State with no parental notification requirement. The mother’s  actions were discovered, and she was  convicted of interfering with the custody  of  a  child.  A  prominent  proabortion legal defense organization  appealed the conviction on the grounds  that she merely ‘‘assisted a woman to  exercise her constitutional rights’’ and  as  such was herself protected  from  prosecution by the Constitution. This  reasoning cannot stand.  To say that, because the Court in Roe  v. Wade declared most abortions constitutionally protected during the first  trimester, that therefore minors have  an absolute right to abortion without  so much as notifying their parents, and  that third parties—whatever their motives—have the right to transport them  across State lines for a secret abortion,  is to stand constitutional protections  on their head. It is to strip children of  the natural protection of their parents.  There is hardly another circumstance  warranting the need for parental guidance and judgment more than when a  young daughter becomes pregnant and  is considering an abortion. For  the  sake of our children and our families,  this must stop. As a Nation, we loosen  our precious family ties at our peril.  I must also note that Idaho is unable  to enforce parental notification and  consent  laws  that have passed  the  State legislature and have been signed  into law by the Governor. Nearly 20  other States are in the same situation.  These laws are all enjoined due to lawsuits brought by organizations intent  on  imposing  their  flawed  understanding of the United States Constitutional protections on  the American  people, and judges willing to support it.  It is my hope that this litigation will  be resolved and that the right of elected officials to make and enforce laws  under their jurisdiction will be upheld.  I strongly support and am cosponsoring the Child Custody Protection  Act. Children must  receive parental  consent for even minor surgical procedures. Children must receive parental  consent to take an asprin from their  school nurse. I want to make it a Federal offense to transport a minor across  State lines with intent to avoid the application of a State law requiring parental involvement in a minor’s abortion, or judicial waiver of such a requirement. The profound, lasting physical and psychological effects of abortion demand that we help states guarantee  parental  involvement  in  the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:17 Jul 26, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A25JY6.033 S25JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o y r r e h c y         ",2006
1643,225,2006-07-25,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to express my support for the  Voting Rights Act, VRA. Unfortunately a longstanding medical appointment kept me from casting my vote in  favor of this legislation last week and  I want there to be no question as to my  support for the VRA. For over 50 years,  the VRA has protected the cornerstone  of democracy: the right to vote. Congress enacted the VRA in response to  evidence that some States and counties  had denied many citizens access to the  ballot because of their race, ethnicity,  and language-minority status. The creators of this law were convinced, as am  I, that a strong America is one that reflects the feelings and opinions of all  Americans. That means that everyone  has the right to vote.  Provisions of the VRA prohibit election laws that would deny or abridge  voting rights based on race, color, or  membership  in a  language minority.  The act allows citizens to challenge  discriminatory  voting  practices  and  procedures and prohibits the use of any  test or device as a condition of voter  registration. Such provisions seem like  common sense today, but they were  not always so widely supported. We  must recommit today not to return to  the mistakes of yesterday. I am pleased  that the Senate approved the reauthorization of this critical act. It correctly  ensures that every citizen has a stake  and a voice in our country’s future.  f  INSTABILITY IN SOMALIA  ",2006
1644,225,2006-07-25,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I am  deeply troubled by reports in the press  that the Islamic courts in Somalia are  advancing on the internationally recognized Transitional Federal Government, TFG, and are apparently ignoring recently signed cease-fire agreements. It  is  imperative that the Islamic courts recognize the TFG as the  official governing body of Somalia and  that it abide by the cease fire agreed to  on June 22, 2006, in Khartoum. The Islamic courts must work in good faith  to strengthen the TFG and actively  commit to the development of a more  inclusive and  representative government of Somalia.  For this to happen, the international  community,  including  the  United  States, needs to be fully engaged. The  United States, in particular, must develop a comprehensive strategy for Somalia that utilizes all  facets of  its  power and capabilities and must ramp  up  its diplomatic efforts throughout  the region and the international community to bring this crisis to an end.  Unfortunately, it can’t do that if it  doesn’t have the resources or the people in place to deal effectively with the  complexity of this problem. The U.S.  Government needs to appoint a senior  envoy for Somalia to pull together a  strategy and to engage full time with  international and regional partners in  addressing  this crisis.  It also needs  more staff and more resources to work  with to help execute this strategy and  to contribute to international efforts  to bring about lasting peace throughout  the  region. The  administration  should work closely with Congress to  identify what additional resources are  needed for Somalia, given the recent  escalation of tension there.  That said, it is important to realize  that efforts to both establish long-term  peace and to eradicate terrorist networks and safe havens in Somalia are  complimentary. The U.S. Government  must  recognize  that  long-term  stability in Somalia is our best weapon  against terrorist networks, extremist  organizations, and the conditions that  allow them to seek safe haven there.  We must look at poverty reduction programs, economic development efforts,  support  for  democratic  institutions,  anticorruption efforts, and education  as the core elements of a new Somalia  strategy.  As we  learned  in Afghanistan, we  cannot  ignore  the  conditions  that  breed extremist and terrorist organizations. Accordingly, it is essential to  recognize that any attempt to address  instability in Somalia must address a  range of root causes or facilitating conditions: a weak and dysfunctional central government, extreme poverty, corruption, conflict, disease, and drought.  It is imperative that the U.S. Government begin playing a  leadership  role in helping stabilize Somalia and  the region and that  it do so  immediately. We need a comprehensive approach to engaging with regional actors, the international community, and  the U.N. to find a permanent solution  to this crisis. Such an approach will  contribute to stability throughout the  Horn of Africa and to our national  security.  NATIONAL KOREAN WAR  VETERANS ARMISTICE DAY  ",2006
1645,225,2006-07-25,Mrs. CLINTON.," Mr. President, on  Thursday, July 20, 2006, I introduced S.  3700, which would honor the valiant efforts of our Korean war veterans, who  risked their lives fighting against communism on the Korean peninsula. As  we honor the 53rd anniversary of the  Korean War Armistice, I am proud to  reintroduce this legislation recognizing  Korean War Armistice Day. The Korean War Veterans Recognition Act of  2006 would  include National Korean  War Veterans Armistice Day among  the  days when  the American  flag  should especially be displayed. Earlier  this year, Representative SUEKELLY  reintroduced  similar  legislation  into  the House.  National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day is July 27, which recognizes  that negotiators signed an armistice  agreement at Panmunjom on July 27,  1953. This led to North Korea’s withdrawal across the 38th parallel and allowed the Republic of South Korea to  be free from attempts to force communism upon its people.  This year, as we commemorate the  53rd anniversary of the signing of the  Korean War Armistice, it is important  that we take a moment to reflect upon  the sacrifices our men and women of  the U.S. Armed Forces have made in  brave service to our Nation since its inception. I am pleased to introduce this  legislation to respectfully honor and  pay tribute to the tremendous courage  and sacrifice demonstrated by the men  and women who served in the Korean  war. As U.S. soldiers continue to fight  for freedom around the world, we must  remember the sacrifice and valor of  their brethren who helped protect and  promote American values on the Korean peninsula over a half century ago.  f  CELEBRATE AMERICA CREATIVE  WRITING CONTEST  ",2006

1647,232,2006-07-25,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  to introduce S. 3721, the Post-Katrina  Emergency Management Reform Act of  2006. It contains a vital set of reforms  and  innovations  for our emergency-  management systems that are designed  to save lives and ease suffering when  disaster strikes. The crafting of this  bill has benefited from the insights of  my  principal  cosponsor,  Senator  from the support of  our other cosponsor, Senator SALAZAR.  The Senate has already acted on one  critical measure to apply the bitter  lessons of Hurricane Katrina. The 87 to  11 vote on July 11, adding creation of  the U.S. Emergency Management Authority to the Homeland Security appropriations bill, adopted a major element of today’s bill. That was a great  step forward.  The Senate Homeland Security Committee conducted an  8-month  investigation with 23 hearings, more than  325 formal interviews, and a review of  LIEBERMAN, and  more than 838,000 pages of documents  to ascertain why the response to Hurricane Katrina was so inadequate at all  levels of government. The  investigation revealed serious failures of leadership. It also revealed an urgent need  for broad reforms ranging from communication-technology  standards  to  the structure and missions of entire  Federal agencies.  Some of the 88 recommendations that  flowed from our investigation can be  adopted by administrative action. The  Post-Katrina Emergency Management  Reform Act comprises important steps  that only Congress can take. I will outline the five key components of our  bill.  First, we strengthen FEMA and rename it as the United State Emergency  Management Authority, or US–EMA,  to signify a fresh start. We elevate US–  EMA within DHS, restore its preparedness authority, and protect it from departmental reorganizations that could  erode  its budget and assets. These  measures give the agency mission and  asset protections like those of its DHS  siblings, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service.  These statutory protections are important.  Securing  the  integrity  of  FEMA preserves the cooperative benefits of its operating within easy reach  of other DHS agencies. It also avoids  the duplication, cost, and confusion for  State and  local officials that would  come  from carving FEMA out as a  weak, stand-alone agency for natural  disasters. Keeping FEMA where it was  placed by the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 avoids the need  for DHS to  recreate a similar terror-response capability.  Improving contact and coordination  among Federal, State, and local agencies is essential. For that reason, our  bill  provides  for  regionally  based,  multi-agency  Federal  strike  teams  that will be ready to act and deploy in  a region they will already know and  understand before a disaster occurs.  The bill also provides continued funding for the interstate Emergency Management  Assistance  Compact  that  proved so valuable in marshaling aid  for the gulf coast last year. It commits  the US–EMA to work with States and  localities  to develop a  standardized  credentialing system that will help responders and  selected private-sector  personnel move quickly into disaster  areas anywhere in the country, and it  requires the US–EMA to offer technical  assistance to State and local governments.  To help remedy the communications  gaps revealed by Hurricane Katrina, we  also  improve  the agency’s organizational and technical communications  systems. Our bill designates the Administrator of  the US–EMA as  the  principal advisor to the President on  emergency-management issues. Meanwhile, national and regional advisory  councils will ensure that the US–EMA  has open channels of communication  with State and local officials, emergency  responders, key private-sector  and  nongovernmental  entities,  and  with representatives of people with disabilities.  On the equally important technical  side, our bill consolidates several communications programs within a new Office  of Emergency  Communications  within US–EMA. This office will devise  a national emergency-communications  strategy, administer grants for interoperable  communications, and  regularly assess the operability and interoperability of the communication systems that are essential for disaster response and that failed so widely during  the Katrina catastrophe.  This US–EMA portion of the bill has  received a great deal of attention. But  it is only one part of this package of  essential reforms.  The second part of our bill permits  an enhanced Federal role in emergency  management when major disasters require it. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance  Act, better known as the Stafford Act,  authorizes a variety of Federal assistance measures to State and local governments when the President has declared a disaster.  Congress has amended the Stafford  Act over time to make it more effective. Our bill continues that process of  improvement  by  applying  lessons  learned from Katrina.  At the highest level, it directs the  Federal Government  to develop and  maintain a national disaster-recovery  strategy in coordination with the State  and local governments which will lead  each recovery. This fills a remarkable  planning void in our current system,  which focuses on response. When disaster overwhelms state and local governments and devastates large areas,  recovery can be a long process requiring extended Federal assistance.  We increase the potential for more  effective Federal aid in several ways.  For example, the legislation enhances  Federal agencies’ ability  to  respond  when the President uses his authority  to direct their assistance in major-disaster response and recovery.  The bill requires a national-disaster  housing strategy and authorizes making  semipermanent housing units a  part of Stafford Act assistance.  In  many cases, the modular ‘‘Katrina cottages,’’ for example, would be less costly,  safer, more  livable, more easily  sited, and more durable than the notorious trailers FEMA purchased.  A new title VII for the Stafford Act  gives the President discretion to offer  increased Federal assistance when disaster overwhelms state and local governments. This discretionary—but limited—authority  for  catastrophes  includes raising the cap on individual assistance, assisting victims with rent or  mortgage costs, extending disaster-unemployment benefits, increasing community  loans, and raising the reimbursement to communities for the cost  of  food, clothes, and other essential  goods they distribute to victims.

TAMMY BALDWIN  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 25, 2006  ",2006
1650,246,2006-07-25,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the University of Wisconsin, the  Political Science Department, and the student  participants on the creation and completion of  the first annual UW Summer Washington Program. This  invaluable opportunity was made  possible by the generous support of many UW  alumni.  The 15 undergraduate students were selected through a competitive application process and are  interning  in various offices on  Capitol Hill. They are gaining experience  in  legislative offices, lobbying firms, the Department of Justice, and several foreign policy offices, while also participating  in a Political  Science course. Guest speakers and hosts, all  of whom are UW alumni, have been in attendance at each class session offering priceless  and practical advice to the students.  This program would not have been possible  without  the support of  the Wisconsin alumni  who have helped in funding, organizing social  events, and speaking  to  the class. The UW  Foundation, in collaboration with the Department of Political Science, has worked with  alumni to get this program off the ground in  hopes that it will be available to future undergraduate students. The goal of this program is  to establish a permanent presence for the University of Wisconsin in Washington, DC.  I am proud to rise today to pay tribute to the  establishment of this exceptional opportunity.  It is truly an honor for me to represent the students, the alumni, and the University of Wisconsin on  this occasion, and wish  them  the  best of luck in the successful continuation of  this important program.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE GRAND CANYON  CHAPTER  OF  THE  AMERICAN  RED CROSS  HON. J.D. HAYWORTH  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 25, 2006  ",2006
1651,246,2006-07-25,Mr. HAYWORTH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in honor and recognition of the Grand Canyon  Chapter of the American Red Cross as they  celebrate 90 years of service in Arizona.  Since 1916, the American Red Cross Grand  Canyon Chapter, headquartered in Phoenix, is  where the people of Arizona come together to  help one another. The passionate volunteers  and staff who make up  the Grand Canyon  Chapter provide care, comfort and lifesaving  skills to millions of people in Arizona. Volunteers serve their neighbors throughout the 10  counties in the northern two-thirds of Arizona,  a population of 4.5 million.  Arizonans benefit  from programs  that provide meaningful assistance and lift the spirit of  individuals and  families  throughout our communities. The chapter  is a  leader  in water  safety  instruction.  I am particularly proud of  their ‘‘Water Whiz Kids’’ program, which teaches backyard pool safety to children and also  provides infant and child CPR training to their  parents.  Within my district, the Grand Canyon Chapter is there when a disaster strikes thousands,  and when it strikes only one. In May of this  year,  in  the wake of  the Tradewinds Apartment fire in Mesa, Red Cross volunteers assisted 34 families, served 400 meals, and distributed 125 comfort kits. Another local emergency response was the Cave Creek Complex  Fire last year where 36 Red Cross volunteers  opened a shelter and provided 23 residents  with meals and comfort kits.  The American Red Cross Grand Canyon  Chapter has also played an instrumental role  in assisting after national disasters outside Arizona, including Hurricane Katrina. Last year,  over 100 Red Cross volunteers from Arizona  deployed to the gulf voast to help with the disaster response. The Grand Canyon Chapter  also operated a national call center  for disaster victims throughout the country. Impressively, with only 30 hours advance notice, the  Chapter organized ‘‘Operation Good Neighbor  Shelter’’ at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, helping more  than 1,000 Hurricane  Katrina evacuees in our State last year. These  evacuees were displaced and relocated from  the gulf coast, suddenly  finding  themselves  hundreds of miles from their homes, yet upon  their arrival,  they were  the recipients of  the  warm ‘‘compassion in action’’ that exemplifies  the Red Cross volunteer and the spirit of Arizonans: good neighbors helping new neighbors during drastic times.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me  to honor and  recognize  the American Red  Cross Grand Canyon Chapter on  its 90th  birthday. With congratulations and gratitude for  the excellent work they do to enrich our lives,  I am pleased to recognize their service to our  communities throughout the great State of Arizona.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

I strongly support the state of Israel, and am  in  full support of  its actions  to defend  itself  against the attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah.  Both of these terrorist organizations are comprised of terrorist thugs and must be rooted  out in order for peace to be achieved in the  region, and their use of civilians as shields is  deplorable.  I am grateful that Israel has taken so many  steps  to wage a careful,  targeted effort,  focused on eliminating terrorist elements while  also minimizing other damage.  I applaud the President for moving forward  on the right track in demanding that Hezbollah  be eliminated  from Lebanon, and also hope  this will be the opportunity for the Arab world  to unite against  terrorism.  Iran and Syria  should take notice—supporting terrorist organizations is not a proper activity of governments.  Mr. Speaker,  I once again  reiterate my  strong support of H. Res. 921, and would  have voted in favor if my voting card had registered successfully.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. MICHAEL M.

1657,253,2006-07-25,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to Reverend Lewis Randolph who  will celebrate 30 years as pastor of the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church on October  14th in my hometown of Flint, Michigan.  Reverend Randolph was installed as pastor  of Antioch Baptist Church  in 1976 as  the  church’s fifteenth pastor. He quickly made an  imprint upon  the congregation by a  twofold  plan of renovating the physical structure of the  church grounds and by evangelizing  in  the  community.  Starting  in 1979 and continuing over  the  next 30 years, Pastor Randolph renovated the  sanctuary, improved the parking lots, added a  new kitchen, dining facility, and improved the  upper level of the church.  As a part of the church’s covenant ‘‘to strive  for the advancement of this church in knowledge, holiness, and comfort;  to promote  its  prosperity and  spirituality’’; Reverend Randolph has organized and supported numerous  auxiliaries and ministries. These  include  the  Voices of Antioch Choir, the Usher Board and  a Concerned Committee to help persons return to the church. He added a new Easter  Sunday worship service, supports a ministry in  Haiti, teaches a weekly Bible class, and distributes Bibles and baskets of food in the community.  Recognizing the need to encourage young  people, he has made sure that Antioch Missionary Baptist Church has been well  represented in the Young Peoples Department of  the National Baptist Convention, USA, Incorporated over the past several years. Under his  tutelage several pastors began their ministries  with his guidance and direction.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in honoring Reverend Lewis Randolph. The  Flint community is a better place because of  his leadership.  f  RECOGNIZING DREW KELLY FOR  ACHIEVING THE RANK OF EAGLE  SCOUT  HON.

1659,267,2006-07-25,Mr. REYES.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of H. Con. Res. 125, expressing Congressional support for ‘‘Hire-A-Veteran  Week,’’ and encouraging  the President  to  issue a proclamation calling upon employers  to increase employment of men and women  who have served honorably in the U.S. Armed  Forces.  As a U.S. Army veteran and a member of  the House Armed Services and Veterans’ Affairs Committees,  I know of  the challenges  awaiting  our  servicemembers  when  transitioning from military service to the civilian  workforce. While this resolution will not solve  the problems of unemployment within the veterans community, it is a strong message that  we as Members of Congress should send to  anyone in a position to hire qualified veterans.  Having military veterans in both my El Paso,  TX and Washington, DC offices, I know of the  exceptional  training  the Armed Forces provides  our  servicemembers,  and  wholeheartedly encourage any employer to consider  hiring  those veterans who have served our  country.  Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to  join me in supporting our nation’s veterans by  voting in favor of H. Con. Res. 125.  f  INTRODUCING THE AMERICARE  HEALTH INSURANCE ACT OF 2006  HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 25, 2006  ",2006
1660,267,2006-07-25,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, it gives me great  pleasure to introduce the AmeriCare Health Insurance Act of 2006. I am joined by the AFL-  CIO, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the  American Nurses Association, the Center for  Medicare Advocacy, Consumers’ Union, Families USA, SEIU, the Universal Health Care Action Network, and the National Association of  Community Health Centers in supporting this  common sense solution to achieve universal  health insurance coverage.  In my tenure in the House, I have been involved in many discussions about how to reform our health system. These debates tend  to occur every 10  to 15 years when health  costs rise to a level that attracts our attention.  Unfortunately, the minor tweaks and threats of  reform we have made in the past have not resulted in lasting change. As a result, we are  spending more—and getting  less—than any  industrialized nation.  If history is any guide, we are nearing yet  another health reform discussion in this country. This time, we need to get it right. To that  end I offer AmeriCare—a practical proposal to  ensure that everyone has affordable health insurance.  AmeriCare  is based on  the principles  that  the U.S. health system should cover everyone,  be affordable, and be meaningful.  Eighty percent of  the people who  file  for  bankruptcy because of medical bills have  health  insurance, but  their benefits do not  meet  their  needs.  Policies  that  are  unaffordable,  that  discourage  people  from  seeking care, or that do not cover necessary  benefits are empty solutions.  AmeriCare builds on what works—both employer coverage and Medicare—in an effort to  dramatically expand coverage with minimal  disruption to the current system. It addresses  the broader issues in our health system overall, and provides an important marker for a renewed discussion on health reform.  For the past four decades since it was enacted,  the stability and affordability of Medicare have helped millions of seniors and people with disabilities live longer, healthier lives.  Because of Medicare, families have been able  to save  for  their children’s education  rather  than having  to pay  for  their parents’ health  care.  Since  the program began, Medicare’s per  capita costs have grown at a slower rate than  private health  insurance or  the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.  Providers,  too, have benefited  from Medicare. Without Medicare as a consistent payer,  providers would not be able to offer the top  quality care  they deliver  today.  Indeed, uncompensated care  for people who are uninsured or underinsured is pushing some providers toward the breaking point. Meaningful  coverage for all makes good business sense  for providers.  AmeriCare also  recognizes  the  important  role that job-based benefits play in our current  health  system.  Under  AmeriCare,  people  would  continue  to  obtain  health  coverage  through  their employer—as most of us currently do—or they would be covered under the  new AmeriCare system. Expanding insurance  coverage to all will end the cost shifting that  results from the high number of uninsured we  have today. This could reduce premiums for  job-based insurance by as much as $1,000 for  family coverage, according to the Institute of  Medicine.  Expanding coverage to all will also strengthen the economy and improve our competitiveness. General Motors  recently admitted  it  spends more on health care  than on steel;  Starbucks spends more on health  insurance  than on coffee. The need to address health reform is more urgent than ever before.  AmeriCare is a sensible solution for our Nation’s employers—many of whom are already  meeting the challenge of providing coverage  for their employees. I plan to reach out to the  business community to begin a dialogue about  how we might move forward with AmeriCare.  AmeriCare creates a new Title XXII in the  Social Security Act. It uses Medicare’s existing  administrative  infrastructure,  but  improves  upon Medicare’s benefits to address some of  the current gaps in coverage, such as mental  health parity, coverage for children, and family  planning and pregnancy-related services  for  women. State Medicaid programs would  remain  responsible  for  long-term  care,  but  AmeriCare would now cover low-income children, women, and others who currently  receive non-long term care services under Medicaid.  AmeriCare  is  financed  through premiums,  paid 20 percent by  individuals and  families  and 80 percent by employers, general revenues, and state  funds. People with  incomes  under 200 percent of poverty would be fully  subsidized, and premiums and cost-sharing  would be phased in for those with incomes between 200–300 percent of poverty.  There  is also a  limitation on out-of-pocket  spending to ensure that no one spends a disproportionate share of their income on health  care. Employers could continue to offer their  own coverage, so long as it is equivalent to  AmeriCare. Payment of premiums would be  reconciled at the annual tax filing in April.  Everyone in the room should be aware that  there  is an effort underway  to  reform our  health system, but not in the way we would  like. Republicans have been pursuing stealth  reform for the past decade in their dogged determination  to dismantle  the employer-based  system and force everyone into high deductible health plans, regardless of whether they  open or benefit  from a Health Savings Account.  Their rhetoric makes it sound like you ‘‘own’’  your health care. But what they really mean is  that you are on your own. It’s not just that you  have  to  fend  for yourself when purchasing  health care, it’s that for most people—especially the currently uninsured—the Health Savings Account is purely theoretical. Employers  don’t have  to contribute  to  these accounts,  and most don’t.  The Republican agenda expands the class  of people who are underinsured, putting both  patients and providers at greater risk. More  and more doctors and hospitals are being  forced to act as bill collectors rather than care  providers, and patients are saddled with debt  and even bankruptcy because their insurance  benefits are  inadequate. For example, many  high deductible policies do not cover maternity  benefits. The situation will only get worse if we  continue to allow high-deductible health plans  to take hold.  Without  the security of a universal health  plan  that covers everyone, each of us  is at  risk. For years we have accepted that people  fall through the cracks in our health system.  No parent should ever have to deny their child  a lifesaving treatment because they cannot afford  the cost. No  family should ever  lose a  parent because their condition was treated too  late.  We need a strong alternative vision  for  health  reform. That  is why  I  am  putting  AmeriCare forward today. This proposal promotes shared risk and responsibility, not individual  risk  and  greater  fragmentation.  AmeriCare offers an alternative vision that is  simple and straightforward, fair and manageable.  Our Nation is at a crossroads. Our legacy  should be a future where our children are not  saddled with debt, where they do not fear financial  ruin due  to an  illness. Whether we  build a healthy future for our children or not  depends upon the decisions we make today.  True compassion means offering  real solutions, not empty promises.  Working together, applying common sense  approaches that build on what works, we can  ensure that no-one risks the loss of insurance  coverage. All we need is the will to do it.

1661,6,2006-09-05,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, when I  came to Congress years ago, I had no  idea that one of the major  issues I  would face and be involved in was the  tobacco industry. Now, I knew what tobacco had done to my family. I lost my  father when he was 53 years old. He  died of lung cancer. He smoked two  packs of cigarettes a day. I was just a  sophomore in high school when he died.  I stood there by his bed at his last  breath and thought to myself, I hope I  am smart enough to never be addicted  to tobacco, because I have seen his  young life destroyed by it.  I didn’t swear to go against the tobacco companies. That sure wasn’t the  reason I ran for office. But the time  came, as a Member of the House of  Representatives, when  issues  started  presenting  themselves  involving  tobacco. As they presented themselves, I  recalled my personal and family experience with death and disease from tobacco, and I decided to get involved.  About 15 or 16 years ago, I introduced  a bill to ban smoking on airplanes. I  was a Member of the House and didn’t  know any better, and I was told by the  experts: You are going to lose; nobody  beats the tobacco lobby; they are too  powerful in this town. All of the leadership on both sides of the aisle in the  House opposed my amendment. To my  great surprise,  it passed anyway.  It  turns out that Members of the House of  Representatives, and ultimately Members of the Senate, are frequent fliers.  They knew how ridiculous it was to  have smoking sections on airplanes and  nonsmoking sections. Eventually, we  reached a point where there was no  smoking on airplanes. My colleague  from New Jersey, Frank Lautenberg,  carried  this bill  successfully  in  the  Senate.  Together,  we  worked  and  banned smoking on airplanes.  A  lot of things have happened  in  America  since. Once we  established  that it was unsafe to be exposed to secondhand smoke on airplanes, people  started asking the obvious questions:  Is it safe in an office? Is it safe in a  hospital? Is it safe on an Amtrak train  or on a bus? America started moving  toward a new standard over the last 16  years, and I am happy to say there are  now fewer and fewer places in America  where you are exposed to secondhand  smoke. Most smokers who are still addicted at least ask permission before  lighting up. Most know it is better to  go outside. That is a changing standard  in America and one that I believe has  led to a healthier nation.  Make no mistake, while we have  made progress in dealing with tobacco,  the tobacco companies have still been  selling their deadly product. As they  sell that product, we learn more and  more about their corporate strategy.  Let me read to you the opening line in  an  editorial  last week written  in  Newsday, a publication in New York:  Lying is as natural to tobacco executives  as breathing once was to their customers.  They were reacting to  last week’s  stunning disclosure that the tobacco  industry is up to its same old tricks.  During the last 6 years, cigarette manufacturers have steadily increased the  level of nicotine smokers inhale every  time they smoke. Nicotine, of course,  is that addictive chemical in the cigarettes which  leads people  to  smoke  even more. During the same 6-year period of time, more and more cities and  States have been expanding protections  for people to play and work away from  secondhand smoke, while the industry  has been loading up their product with  more nicotine so that it is tougher to  quit.  The Surgeon General of the United  States found definitively that secondhand smoke is dangerous. Of the 45 million Americans who still smoke today,  70 percent say they want to quit. It is  tough to quit. It is made even more difficult because the cigarette manufacturers put more of the addictive nicotine chemical  in the cigarettes. We  know that now. The tobacco industry  was found guilty of racketeering, of intentionally manipulating nicotine levels to create more addiction to cigarettes. While they are running this advertising about how dangerous it is to  smoke, to talk to your kids—while you  see those ads on television and see  what is going on in newspapers and  magazines, all  this advertising notwithstanding, they are pumping more  and more of this addictive nicotine  into their product.  We passed in the Senate a provision  that would have given the FDA the authority to regulate cigarettes. It died  in conference. Once it went into a conference with the House of Representatives, they stopped it. So this deadly  product of tobacco and cigarettes continues to be the only product in America that is widely sold and is not regulated by our Government. It is not regulated in terms of its contents or its  marketing or advertising. You would  think that in a situation such as this,  the tobacco industry would have spent  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:36 Feb 05, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S05SE6.REC S05SE6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006
1662,13,2006-09-05,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, again,  just to complete that thought, there  are ways that both sides in this end-of-  life care debate can be brought together. I have mentioned several. What  I think is clear, after the Terri Schiavo  discussion, is that the American people  don’t want  the Federal Government  butting in, interfering, and preempting  the ability of  families and those  in  their  last days to make these  judgments. For the citizens of my State,  the Death With Dignity Act  has  brought about improvement in many  areas  and  encouraged  conversations  about a wide variety of end-of-life options. Those  conversations  probably  wouldn’t have even taken place if the  people of my State hadn’t voted for  this twice. In my State, the end-of-life  process has been decriminalized. Recognizing the deeply personal nature of  this, the Federal Government should  not decide again, as has been considered before, that this should be the  province of the Federal Government  and not left to individuals and families.  My State has chosen a unique path.  Rather than the bitter and divisive debate over physician aid  in dying—  which this country would have, once  again,  if S.  3788 moved  forward—I  would offer that  instead the Senate  work together on a bipartisan basis to  make the end of life a better period for  all Americans.  So consistent with the policy I have  held of publishing  in  the CONGRESSIONALRECORDa statement whenever I  put a hold on a piece of legislation, I  am announcing today my intent to object to any unanimous consent agreement concerning S. 3788. The Senate  should have learned during the debate  over the tragic case of Terri Schiavo  that the American people don’t want  the  Government  interfering  during  these very difficult days. S. 3788 would  allow  just this kind of  interference,  and that is why I will do everything I  can to defend Oregon’s law against this  congressional overreaching and respect  the message the American people sent  during the Terri Schiavo debate that  there ought to be a right to be left  alone.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",2006
1663,13,2006-09-05,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.  f  THE CRASH OF COMAIR FLIGHT  5191  Mr. MCCONNELL: Mr. President, it is  difficult to put into words what the  citizens of Kentucky are feeling. Nine  days ago, tragedy struck the heart of  our  Commonwealth  when  Comair  Flight 5191 crashed shortly after takeoff at Blue Grass Airport, in Lexington,  KY. Forty-nine people perished.  This single, devastating event is of  course not one story but many. This  crash has brought grief into scores of  families and countless lives, all over  Kentucky and beyond. Holes that cannot be  filled have been  created  in  places  like Lexington, Georgetown,  Somerset, London, Harrodsburg, and  Richmond.  Funeral services have been conducted  across Kentucky over recent days, and  I know I am joined by all Kentuckians  in extending heartfelt sympathy  for  the families and loved ones of the victims.  After a catastrophe as great as the  crash of Comair Flight 5191, sorrow can  be overwhelming. Many people in my  state are feeling that way now. And the  entire state is struggling for answers in  the face of such an unexpected tragedy  that is so unbearable.  Since the crash I have been learning,  as many Kentuckians have, about the  lives of the victims, who they were and  where they were going that day.  Four  Kentuckians  on  the  plane  worked  for Galls, a Lexington-based  company  that makes  public  safety  equipment and apparel. Three of them  were flying to New Orleans to help deliver new uniforms to New Orleans police officers after Hurricane Katrina.  Jonathan Hooker, 27, and Scarlett  Parsley Hooker, 24, spent only hours  together as husband and wife before  they both boarded Flight 5191 to fly to  California  for their honeymoon. The  Reverend Terry Gabbard married them  the night before the flight in a beautiful evening ceremony in Lexington.  One week  later, he would speak at  their funeral.  The deaths of these two newlyweds so  soon after starting their lives together  devastated many in their hometown of  London, Kentucky. Jon had a lot of  friends after attending London’s North  Laurel High School, where he was a  star athlete.  He went on to pitch for the University of Kentucky baseball team from  1997 to 2001, and then to work as a professional minor-league baseball player.  In the last few months of his life, he  helped  others  as  a  substance-abuse  counselor. He liked to play golf, and  worked with a youth baseball league in  London.  Scarlett, his wife, was a 2004 graduate of Centre College,  in Danville,  Kentucky, and was attending the University of Kentucky to pursue a master’s  degree  in  communication  disorders.

My friend Lee Todd, the president of  the University of Kentucky, put it well  when he said that this young couple  ‘‘held all the promise that youth and  love carry.’’ Because of the tragedy of  Flight 5191, we will never get to see  that promise fulfilled.  A promise was also snuffed out in  Lexington at the same time—the promise of a father to a young son to watch  him grow up.

1664,20,2006-09-05,Mr. KENNEDY., I was just asking the  Senator how this is different from the  Durbin amendment. I note the Senator  was in the Chamber earlier. How is this  amendment different? I was a cosponsor of his amendment.  ,2006
1665,20,2006-09-05,Mr. ALLEN.," I would have to look at  the details. That is why I mentioned  the Senator from Illinois, and I and  others, I think, share the same concern. The main point, the main concern—which is making sure the professional services were there, the adequacy of the devices, the adequacy of  the health care professionals—I think  was actually  fairly  identical. I have  not looked at the measure of the Senator from Illinois. It appears that we  are going down the same stream, in the  same direction.  ",2006

1668,20,2006-09-05,Mr. STEVENS.," I believe the main difference was the amendment of the Senator from Virginia said ‘‘may’’ and the  amendment of the Senator from Illinois said ‘‘shall’’ in terms of the $19  million. And you have used the word  ‘‘shall’’  from the amendment of the  Senator from Illinois, have you not?  ",2006
1669,20,2006-09-05,Mr. ALLEN.," Yes, as modified. Thank  you. However, the point is it is $19 million, and it shall be appropriated for  this function.  ",2006

1671,20,2006-09-05,Mr. ALLEN.," The point is, my amendment was going to be $19 million regardless. And my view was, we needed  added funding, and this will make it  absolutely clear.  ",2006
1672,20,2006-09-05,Mr. KENNEDY.," I thank the Senator  because I was a cosponsor. I did not  pay  close  attention  to  the  presentation, but I was a cosponsor of Senator DURBIN’s amendment, as I understand, as printed.

I have been told by  staff that he has modified his amendment so it is now identical to mine; is  that correct?  ",2006
1682,20,2006-09-05,Mr. ALLEN.," I believe so. Mr. President, my amendment was filed before  the Senator’s and his was filed after. I  have not read the Senator’s amendment, but as modified, the best I have  heard from talking to Senator STEVENS  and listening to the Senator from Massachusetts, they seem to be very close,  if not identical.  ",2006
1683,20,2006-09-05,Mr. DURBIN.," I think the changes in  language  the Senator made  to his  amendment have made them virtually  identical, so it appears we are setting  out to do the same thing.  So that there is clarity in the record,  I want to make sure I understand this.  My amendment said $19 million will be  available to this program for defense  and a veterans brain injuries center. Is  that  the Senator’s modified amendment?  ",2006
1684,20,2006-09-05,Mr. ALLEN.," Rather than ‘‘will,’’ it  would be ‘‘shall’’ in my amendment.  ",2006
1685,20,2006-09-05,Mr. DURBIN., Yes. So they are identical at this point.  ,2006
1686,20,2006-09-05,Mr. ALLEN., The Senator wasn’t  here. I mentioned that I would love for  us to work together on a bipartisan  basis to effectuate our shared goal.  ,2006
1687,20,2006-09-05,Mr. DURBIN., That is exactly what  we should do.  I ask unanimous consent that the cosponsors of my amendment—and there  are some eight cosponsors and myself.  Let us do this as a bipartisan amendment since we are doing exactly the  same thing. Is that acceptable to the  Senator?  ,2006
1688,20,2006-09-05,Mr. ALLEN., Agreed.  ,2006
1689,20,2006-09-05,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I would  like to make a statement in support of  the amendment at this point. I think  we all understand that the war we are  fighting in Iraq has resulted in injuries  that are much different than in previous wars. Many times our soldiers  would go to war and face other soldiers  and enemies with rifles aimed at them  trying to kill them. Now most of our  soldiers and marines are coming home  with injuries related to trauma from  these homemade bombs,  these  IEDs  which are being exploded. As a consequence, the signature wound of the  wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for American  soldiers has become  traumatic  brain injury.  Many of my colleagues who have visited  injured  servicemen at military  Veterans  Administration  facilities  across the Nation understand this is a  new challenge for us. We say to the  men and women in uniform: If you will  risk your life and stand up for America, we will stand by you. If you are injured, we will make sure we do everything humanly possible to get you back  on your feet and back at home and into  your normal life.  So now we know  that  traumatic  brain injury is a new challenge for us,  in greater numbers than we have ever  seen in previous conflicts. The leading  organization within the DOD to deal  with this is the Defense and Veterans  Brain Injury Center. They started it in  1992, and the clinical treatment and research conducted by that center has  really tried to define optimal care for  survivors of traumatic brain injury.  This  center  is  located  at Walter  Reed, one of our greatest hospitals in  America. It has other sites in Texas,  California, Virginia, Florida, North  Carolina, and Minnesota. The center’s  current budget is $14 million. That fiscal year ends in just a few weeks. The  leaders at the center requested $19 million  for the coming year. They say  there are more patients. That is obvious  from the soldiers coming home.  They say the cost of long-term care has  gone up. The current staffing requirements and need for research to improve  treatment and prevention all require  more funds, so that $14 million this  year would not be enough  for next  year. The appropriations bill we seek  to amend, unfortunately, cut the funds  for the center. In fact, it cut them in  half to $7 million. That is totally inadequate, even for this year, and would  not meet the need for next year.  The center estimates that 1 out of  every 10 servicemembers in Iraq and 2  in 10 troops in the front lines return  from combat tours with concussions. It  is the nature of combat in Iraq, where  insurgents use roadside bombs instead  of bullets. That produces more brain  injuries. As of today, more than 1,700  wounded servicemen have come back  from Iraq with brain injuries. Half of  them are  severe  enough  to permanently  impair  thinking,  memory,  mood, behavior, and their ability to  work. In Vietnam and previous 20th  century wars, brain injuries were just  12 percent of injuries. In Iraq and Afghanistan, it is almost double—22 percent.  According to a recent study by researchers at Harvard and Columbia, it  is estimated that the cost of medical  treatment  for these  individuals with  brain injuries from the Iraq war will be  at least $14 billion over the next 20  years. So when we speak of the real  cost of war at this point, we are talking about not only the current injuries  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:36 Feb 05, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S05SE6.REC S05SE6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006
1690,48,2006-09-05,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to a former colleague and dear friend, Robert Giaimo,  who passed away on May 24 of this  year. He  served  the people of Connecticut and the United States as a  Member of the House of Representatives for more than 20 years, and I want  to speak to my colleagues today about  the life and legacy of this dedicated  public servant.  Bob Giaimo was born in North Haven,  CT on October 19, 1919, son of the late  Rose and Rosario Giaimo. He attended  North Haven public schools, and graduated from Fordham University before  receiving his law degree from the University of Connecticut in 1943. During  World War II, Bob served as a commissioned officer  in  the United States  Army. When he returned, he served as  the chairman of  the State of Connecticut Personnel Appeals Board, as a  member of the North Haven Board of  Education, North Haven Board of Finance, and as third selectman of the  town of North Haven.  Bob Giaimo’s  public  service  culminated with his tenure in the House  of Representatives. Elected  in  1958,  Congressman Giaimo represented Connecticut’s third congressional district  until his retirement in 1980. During his  eleven terms in office, Representative  Giaimo  served as a member of  the  House Education and Labor Committee  between 1959 and 1963, and went on to  serve  on  the House Appropriations  Committee. When  the House Committee on the Budget was established  in  1974, Representative Giaimo was  elected to serve as a member, and was  elected chairman of that committee in  1979. He was the first Connecticut Democrat and the first Connecticut Member of Congress since 1931 to chair a  congressional committee.  One of Congressman Giaimo’s greatest  legislative achievements was undoubtedly his 1965 sponsorship of the  bill that created the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, separate  grant-making  agencies  that  support  our nation’s painters, sculptors, writers, poets, and historians, among others. His dedication to this legislation  has made an enormous contribution to  America’s cultural heritage.  When I was elected to Congress in  1975, Bob was already a senior member  of the House. But he very graciously  took an interest in showing this newcomer the ways of that  institution.  With me, as with all who knew him,  Bob was a public figure who led by example. Never one to seek the spotlight,  Bob remained dedicated to the working  families, the poor, the elderly, and others who cannot afford to buy a voice in  Washington and who instead rely on  their elected officials to look out for  them in the corridors of power. The  quality and caliber of this leadership  will be missed and continues to inspire  those of us who knew him and who  serve in public life.  My wife Jackie and I offer our deepest condolences to his wife Marion, his  daughter  Barbara,  and  his  granddaughter Tracey. They have lost a beloved member of their family. And the  people of Connecticut and our Nation  have  lost a dedicated public servant  and an exceptional man.  I was honored to attend Representative Giaimo’s memorial  service  on  June 1, and found the eulogy, delivered  by Reverend Hugh MacDonald, to be  particularly moving. I ask unanimous  consent that the text of the eulogy be  printed in the RECORD.  EULOGY: ROBERTGIAIMO  (Reverend Hugh MacDonald, June 1, 2006)  The great cathedrals of Europe are a glorious part of our Christian heritage—towering testimonials to an Age of Faith. But  anyone who now visits these sublime buildings soon realizes that they also have a history as cemeteries for the celebrated.  Whether interred in the basement crypts  or encased in magnificent tombs scattered  around the sanctuary and aisles, the famous  dead almost vie for attention with our living  worship.  My  personal  favorite  among  cathedral  tombs is in the Cathedral of Saint Richard in  the city of Chichester on the southern coast  of England. In the north aisle of that elegant  church  is a massive stone sepulcher containing the remains of the fourteenth-century Earl of Arundel and his countess. Side  by side, atop the monument, lie their carved  stone likenesses.  A famous warrior, he is clad in medieval  armor, and his feet rest up on a lion—the  symbol of bravery. On his right, his wife is  shown in nun-like robes, her feet resting on  a small dog—symbol of fidelity.  Purely as sculpture, the Arundel tomb is  not all that impressive, and six centuries  have blurred the once precise details of the  carved faces. But what finally rivets your attention is their hands! The universal custom  in  pious monument-sculpture  is  for  the  hands to be stiffly folded on the chest, pointing heavenward in a gesture of everlasting  prayer.  Not so with the Arundels! His left arm lies  at his side, and in that left hand he holds the  empty glove (or gauntlet) for his right hand.  So,  immediately your eyes seek out that  right hand. His right arm is also relaxed at  his side, and the hand is thus concealed by  the overlapping folds of the countess’s robe  as she lies beside him. But if you go to the  foot of the monument and stoop down a bit,  you  can  discover  their  touching  secret.  Under the carved armor and the pleated  dress, their hands are clasped in tender love!  I find that detail enormously moving. We  know almost nothing now about the once famous exploits of this heroic earl and nothing  whatsoever about his wife. And in the cathedral that houses their bones, the centuries  have witnessed violent religious wars and  the cruel ravages of time. But through it all  and despite it all, those clasped hands are a  reminder of what is noblest in our lives and  in our legacy. The poet Philip Larkin put it  beautifully in the final line of his meditation  on the Arundel tomb when he wrote: ‘‘What  will survive of us is love.’’  Those words sprang to my mind on Monday  after I had talked on the phone with Barbara  about the shining love her parents shared.  Robert and Marion were married here at  Saint Barnabas sixty-one years ago. Sadly,  poor health prevents Marion from being here  with us this morning for this Mass of Christian Burial.  But in fact every celebration of the Eucharist reminds us that nothing can truly separate us from our love of the Lord or our love  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:36 Feb 05, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€6SENATE\S05SE6.REC S05SE6 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2006
1691,55,2006-09-05,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. President, I want to  take a moment and wish best of luck to  an accomplished, young and promising  Mississippian who  is  leaving  federal  service to pursue private sector opportunities.  Nick Walters, originally of Wiggins,  MS, was  appointed  as Mississippi’s  USDA Rural Development Director by  President George Bush in 2001. Since  then, Nick has done a great job supporting  Mississippi’s  communities,  helping to secure resources needed for  public facilities, utilities, and for economic development.  This is a key Federal position for my  State. As Nick likes to say, this is the  ‘‘nonfarm,’’  or  ‘‘nonfood’’  part  of  USDA. It is about new water and waste  water  systems,  so people  can have  clean, dependable running water. It is  about new community centers, town  halls,  and  even  high-tech  or  educational assets like broadband service,  telemedicine and long-distance learning.  Since taking office, Nick has presented scores of oversized checks, in  countless, photos for local papers telling stories about a new water tower or  a new police car or fire truck.  Some  people might  think  these  things are small, and they often are in  terms of Federal dollars. But  these  modest  services will  reverberate  for  years to come. As Nick says: USDA  Rural Development is really about economic development, helping to encourage and sustain job creation—paving  the way for communities to grow.  Nick has helped  administer more  than $100 million to Mississippi’s cities  and towns through this agency.  He hasn’t sat on his laurels waiting  for mayors, supervisors, town alderman  or CEOs to approach him. Nick has  been proactive, innovative, and he has  actively sought cases and ways to meet  individual community needs through  USDA’s  various Rural Development  Programs.  We’ve all heard the old saying: Don’t  tel1 me what you can’t do, tell me  what you can do. That has been Nick  Walters’ approach to public service. His  first inclination is to act.  That is something we Mississippians  appreciate. After Hurricane Katrina,  we saw many Federal bureaucrats in  FEMA and elsewhere strapped by indecision, blinded by tunnel vision, stuck  on what they could not do, obsessed  with the word ‘‘no,’’ when they should  have been saying ‘‘yes.’’  Nick isn’t that type. He has provided  a great example of what someone in  this office can do using its authority to  the utmost, and we are working hard to  find a successor who will continue this  strong leadership.  Nick Walters will be missed, but my  guess is that he will be back in public  service one day. In what capacity? I  don’t know. That’s a decision for him,  his wife Lisa and his young children,  Porter and John Garrett.  But now with this success behind him  and given his previous experience in  the  private  sector,  his work with  former  Mississippi  Governor  Kirk  Fordice, his stint as chief of staff for  the Mississippi Public Service Commission—Nick Walters will be successful  in wherever his endeavors may lead.  I hope my colleagues will join me in  thanking Nick Walters for his exemplary service to the Federal Government and, more importantly, to America as Mississippi’s USDA rural development director.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO BRAD EXTON  ∑",2006
1692,55,2006-09-05,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, today  I wish to honor Brad Exton, an individual with a  long and outstanding  record as member of the U.S. Forest  Service. Over the course of his 29 years  in the Forest Service, Mr. Exton has  held many demanding posts, including  deputy forest supervisor and acting forest supervisor of the Black Hills National Forest, BHNF, in South Dakota.  He has also been instrumental in helping the Forest Service improve relations with Native American tribes, and  helped to create a closer relationship  between the Forest Service, National  Park Service, and the State park system.  Before his tenure in South Dakota,  Mr. Exton served in several States and  numerous positions within the Forest  Service. He was a graduate forester in  Oregon; a river ranger in the Frank  Church River of No Return Wilderness  in Idaho; a district ranger in Caribou-  Targhee  National  Forest,  encompassing 3 million acres in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah; and a recreation staff officer in the Ashley National Forest in Utah. He brought this  wealth of experience with him to BHNF  in April of 2003.  As deputy forest supervisor and acting  forest  supervisor at BHNF, Mr.  Exton took a leadership role in confronting  some of  the most difficult  challenges facing the organization. For  example, Mr. Exton was  a BHNF  spokesman and negotiator on issues of  concern to Indian tribes. The Black  Hills area is sacred land to 22 tribes, including the Lakota people, and there  has often been tension with the Forest  Service over the role of the tribes in  land management and usage. Through  meetings and the formation of an advisory group, Mr. Exton has partnered  with tribal members to seek a more active role for the tribes in maintaining  healthy forests and creating an atmosphere of respect for indigenous cultures  and knowledge. His commitment was  reflected in 2005, when he was awarded  a Regional Forester Honor Award for  his work with the Rosebud Sioux Tribe  in developing a program of fuel reduction.  While it is unfortunate for BHNF to  lose a valuable public servant such as  Mr. Exton,  I am confident he will  thrive in his new position as manager  of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. I wish to  congratulate Mr. Exton on this exciting new opportunity, and wish him all  the best. The cooperation and respect  Mr. Exton has fostered in South Dakota will remain as a worthy legacy.∑  f  HONORING RUDY GARCIA  ∑",2006
1693,55,2006-09-05,Mr.  COLEMAN.," Mr. President,  I  would like to take this opportunity to  honor the memory of Rudolph ‘‘Rudy’’  Garcia, a quintessential entrepreneur  and fixture in the St. Paul community,  who passed away on August 27, 2006, at  the age of 61. As Rudy’s close friends  have noted: ‘‘He truly personified the  American Dream.’’ Having grown up in  an orphanage without any formation  education, Rudy decided at an early  age to chase his dream of owning and  operating his own restaurant a dream  that went hand in hand with his great  love of cooking.  At the age of 21, he opened his first  establishment, Garcia’s Casita on the  West Side of the city, becoming St.  Paul’s  first  Latino  businessowner.  Through a combination of Rudy’s personality  and  commonsense  business  practices, he was able to grow Garcia’s  Casita into a string of six different St.  Paul eating establishments during the  1990s. From steakhouses to nightclubs,  Rudy’s  perseverance  continually  led  him to success even in the face of several failures and a St. Paul that was  still on the edge of revitalization.  Rick Aguilar, a St. Paul businessman  and longtime friend, described Rudy as  ‘‘a man with a million ideas’’ whose energy helped him roll with the punches  and make his dreams a reality. Rudy  continued to stay the course as both he  and St. Paul grew alongside each other  through the years. In 1994, while serving as the mayor of St. Paul, I had the  distinct privilege of proclaiming a day  in his honor. While the St. Paul community mourns Rudy’s  passing, we  can’t help but celebrate his life that  should serve as a model for not only  Latinos, but all Americans who are  looking to make their dreams a reality.  The St. Paul area and I will sincerely  miss Garcia’s great commitment to our  community. Whether it was his work  in the restaurant business or his participation in the early 1960s band the  Jaymars a popular area band  that  played a mix of jazz, rock ‘n’ roll and  blues—Garcia’s impact on St. Paul is  immeasurable.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO LYN MCCLELLAND  ∑",2006

1698,5,2006-09-15,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I think my  friend,  the  distinguished majority  whip, is talking about things that really do not exist. We have now in the  Senate a bipartisan agreement on how  to approach the Hamdan decision, the  detainee problem. We had all Democrats and four Republicans—far more  than a majority  in the committee—  who voted yesterday to bring the matter to the floor that would solve this  problem.  It is not a problem at this point that  has  been  solved  by  the European  courts. It has been solved by the U.S.  Senate. We certainly know that the  document  that has  come  from  the  Armed Services Committee is imperfect, and we can always try to work to  improve that. I think we should move  forward on this issue. I think there is  certainly nothing in the mind of the  American people or the American public that what the President has suggested is final.  Certainly, he is not infallible, as indicated by Colin Powell—four-star general, general in the Army, Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of  State for a number of years. He says  the President’s approach is wrong. He  is not  talking about  the European  courts determining what we should do.  He is saying that the approach of Senator MCCAINand others is the proper  way to go.  I would also say—without a long discussion—we have the same situation at  this stage in the Senate dealing with  domestic spying. We have a bipartisan  solution to this issue. Members of the  Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan  basis, voted to bring a bill to the Senate. Again, I am sure that bill is not  perfect, but it certainly is a bipartisan  solution to a problem that exists, one  that is in compliance with the Constitution of the United States.  Mr. President, the Iraq war has been  a diversion on the war on terror, and  that seems pretty clear.  f  TAX EXTENDERS  ",2006
1699,5,2006-09-15,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, changing  subjects just for a minute, prior to the  August recess, Republicans attempted  to win support for their attempt to repeal the estate tax by attaching that  to a  flawed minimum wage  increase  that was only meant for show and not  to actually accomplish anything. And  they also tied to it popular tax provisions, referred to as extenders.  Now, keep  in mind  the extenders  were all agreed to by Democrats and  Republicans. They had agreed to this,  and the only thing that was not there  was the signature, and that was to take  place at 8 o’clock at night in the Capitol. When people came back to sign  the conference report, word had come  from the White House: Do away with  this agreement. So that is why they  came up with the so-called Trifecta: estate tax repeal, extenders, minimum  wage.  Republicans were very clear regarding  their  strategy.  Representative  ZACHWAMPof Tennessee claimed that  GREGG Democrats had been ‘‘outfoxed.’’ Well,  of course, this bill did not pass because  it was flawed. It was so unfair to the  American people that you would do  away with all these important tax provisions for the middle class in an effort  to get a repeal of the estate tax that  would affect the richest of the rich:  8,100 Americans.  The strategy of holding the extenders  hostage to their estate tax giveaway  put these important provisions in jeopardy of not getting enacted ever. As if  to emphasize this point, Senator JUDD  said—and  I  quote—‘‘[i]f you  don’t  kill  the  hostage,  there’s  no  threat.’’ How about that.  Now, Senator BAUCUSyesterday—on  more  than  one  occasion—requested  unanimous consent to delink the extenders, which have broad bipartisan  support, from the Republicans’ ill-fated  attempt to repeal the estate tax for a  small number of the wealthiest families in America.  American families and businesses are  paying the price for this Republican  do-nothing Congress’s failure to extend  these tax breaks. Millions of families  and individuals are facing higher taxes  today as a result of this failure.  Mr. President, this is just not HARRY  REID, a Democrat, speaking. Look what  was said yesterday by the chairman of  the Finance Committee, a Republican,  CHARLESGRASSLEYof Iowa:  A delay of legislative beyond the anticipated recess date of September 29, 2006, will  cause hardship, tax compliance problems and  confusion for the millions of taxpayers who  claim these widely applicable tax benefits.  GRASSLEY’s  According to a memo from Senator  office,  after  consulting  with IRS officials, the IRS contracts  with several printers to produce 1040  and 1040A income tax return forms are  in jeopardy. It also said that IRS must  finalize the information it is to submit  to these printers by October 15 in order  to ensure forms will be printed in time  and be distributed to taxpayers at the  beginning of 2007; that if Congress has  not  passed  extenders  legislation  by  that time, the forms will omit lines instructing taxpayers to compute State  and local sales tax, college tuition, or  out-of-pocket classroom expenses into  their tax liability.  American families and businesses are  paying the price because of this do-  nothing Congress. They refuse to extend  important tax breaks. Families  who  recently  took  their  sons  and  daughters  to  college  now  wonder  whether the tuition deduction Republicans allowed to expire last year will  get reinstated.  What are these tax extenders? The  State and local sales tax deduction. In  States all over the country which have  an income tax, they are allowed to deduct that from their Federal income  tax. Now that the Republicans failed to  act  in States where  individuals pay  sales tax, they are not able to do this.  The tuition deduction is another one  which allows parents and students to  deduct all tuition and related expenses  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:52 Sep 16, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15SE6.005 S15SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 2 6 C P D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2006

1705,12,2006-09-15,Mr. OBAMA.," Mr. President, today  marks a victory for government transparency and a victory for democratic  accountability. By passing the Federal  Funding Accountability  and Transparency Act of 2006, the House of Representatives  and  the  Senate  have  brought a little much-needed sunlight  to the world of government spending.  This bill requires the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that a  free, searchable Web site is available to  Americans to access information about  Federal grants, contracts, loans, and  other  financial assistance. The Web  site will make public important oversight information including the name  and location of an entity receiving an  award, a description of the purpose of  the funding, the amount of funding, the  type of transaction, the primary location of performance under the award,  the funding agency, and any other relevant information specified by the Office of Management and Budget. Existing Federal databases, such as the Federal Procurement Data System, FPDS,  the Federal Assistance Award Data  System, FAADS, and Grants.gov, contain other public information that may  also be made available through the new  Web site.  Current law requires that certain information related to the use of competitive or noncompetitive procedures  in procurements be included in FPDS.  Executive agencies must provide competition information for each procurement transaction, including the extent  to which the procurement was subject  to competitive procedures, the type of  solicitation procedure used, whether  the procurement was awarded using a  socioeconomic program set-aside, and,  when applicable, the reason for a non-  competitive procurement. This  information  is  available  to  the  public  through FPDS.  It is my expectation that the Office  of Management and Budget will ensure  that all relevant information on the  use of competitive or noncompetitive  procedures will be included in the information made available through the  Web site. Since the collection of this  information is already mandated and  the information is made publicly available, its inclusion on the searchable,  user-friendly Web site should not cause  any additional burden or complexity.  Mr. President, I would like to ask my  friend from Oklahoma and the author  of this legislation, who has tirelessly  fought  to  improve  government  accountability, if he shares my expectation that the new Web site will include  information on the use of competitive  procedures.  ",2006
1706,12,2006-09-15,Mr. COBURN., I thank the Senator  from Illinois. I share his understanding  of this legislation and also his expectation that the Web site will include information about the use of competitive  procedures.  ,2006
1707,12,2006-09-15,Mr. OBAMA.,"  I thank the Senator  from Oklahoma for his leadership on  this issue. I am grateful for our partnership to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of government services. I  am confident that our efforts to reduce  the use of noncompetitive procedures  will save taxpayer money and improve  the quality of contracted goods and  services.  I would also like to inquire of the distinguished chair and ranking member  of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee who were instrumental in bringing this legislation  its  through committee and ensuring  passage by the Senate.  I would ask Madam Chairman, if it is  her expectation that  information on  the use of competitive or noncompetitive procedures for the financial transactions reported on the Web site created through the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of  2006 will be available on the Web site,  so  that citizens will have  straightforward access to comprehensive information on federal awards?  ",2006
1708,12,2006-09-15,Ms. COLLINS.,  I would assure the  Senator from Illinois that that is indeed my expectation.  ,2006
1709,12,2006-09-15,Mr. OBAMA.,"  I  thank  the  distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The American people are well  served by her leadership and the diligence of her excellent staff. Let me further note that all of us are well served  by the productive working relationship  that  the  chairman  shares with  the  ranking member. The bipartisan nature of this bill is a testament not only  to the broad support for the idea itself  but also to the cooperative manner in  which the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee conducts  its business.  So let me ask the committee’s ranking member and my good friend from  the State of Connecticut, who has long  been a champion of good government  and transparency, whether he shares  our understanding that this new Web  site will  include  information on the  competitive or noncompetitive procedures used in government contracting  for goods and services.  ",2006
1710,12,2006-09-15,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, I  agree with the Senator from Illinois  and do expect that publicly available  information  about  the  procurement  procedures used  in government contracting  will  be  made  available  through the Web site.  ",2006
1711,12,2006-09-15,Mr. OBAMA.,"  I thank the Senator  from Connecticut. It has been my privilege to work with him on this issue.  Transparency is the first step to holding government accountable. We can’t  reduce waste, fraud, and abuse or improve fairness and efficiency without  knowing how, where, and why Federal  money is being spent. And we cannot  ensure that Americans are getting the  best quality and the best prices on government contracts without being able  to evaluate the types of procedures  used to procure goods and services.  Whether you believe the government  ought to spend more money or spend  less, we can all agree that the government ought to spend every penny efficiently and transparently. If the procedures by which the government spends  money, or those expenditures themselves, can’t withstand public scrutiny,  then the taxpayers’ money shouldn’t be  spent. The American people deserve no  less.

1712,19,2006-09-15,Mr. WEXLER.," Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to  recognize today Rabbi Amy Rader, who eloquently delivered yesterday’s opening prayer.  Rabbi Rader’s historic prayer,  the  second  opening prayer led by a female Rabbi in the  history of  the House of Representative represents a significant moment for the American  Jewish community. Rabbi Rader, an Associate  Rabbi at Temple B’nai Torah in Boca Raton is  a prominent and proud member of the South  Florida Jewish community. Whether directing  the B’nai Mitzvah Program, or coordinating the  Judaic curriculum of the Early Childhood Center, Rabbi Rader’s dedication to her congregation and community makes her an extremely  worthy choice to lead this morning’s prayer.  Rabbi Rader enjoys increased prominence  in the Conservative movement and was a recipient of the prestigious Rabbi Simon Greenberg Rabbinic Leadership Award by the Jewish Theological Seminary. She was admitted  to the innovative rabbinic leadership development program, Professional Education and Excellence for Rabbis, which is sponsored by the  Synagogue Transformation and Renewal.  Rabbi Rader studied at the Schechter Institute of Judaic Studies in Jerusalem and the  University of Judaism in Los Angeles, and was  ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary  of America in New York City in 1999. Rabbi  Rader also serve as the rabbi for the Lakeland  Hills Jewish Center in Ringwood, New Jersey,  was a fellow at the National Jewish Healing  Center  in New York City, and was  the  first  Jewish chaplain at Methodist Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota, her hometown.  I am pleased  to recognize Rabbi Rader’s  husband, Kevin, and their four children: Caleb,  Ruby, Yael and Ezra. In her six years in the  Boca Raton and South Florida communities,  Rabbi Rader has wonderfully balanced her  service to the community with her devotion to  her  family and she  is a model  for us all  to  emulate.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

MIKE THOMPSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 15, 2006  ",2006
1714,19,2006-09-15,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of the Humboldt Bay  Municipal Water District. Since 1955, residents  and businesses of the Humboldt Bay and beyond have benefited from this well-organized  and superbly run service that has grown and  developed  to meet  the needs of Humboldt  County.  The Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District  has emphasized close and positive relationships with  the municipal customers who deliver water to residents of the Humboldt Bay,  and with industrial customers in the area. By  concentrating  on  these  relationships,  they  have  consistently delivered a highly-valued  standard of service to my constituents.  Mr. Speaker,  the Humboldt Bay Municipal  Water District was founded on the basis of an  elective  referendum on March 13, 1956.  It  began operations in 1961 with services to the  Cities of Eureka and Arcata, and to the Georgia Pacific Lumber Mill, still  in operation as  Evergreen Pulp, Inc. Over the following decade, 5 other municipal services districts joined  the HBMWD. The presence of a steady supply  of water  facilitated  the development of  the  pulp  industry  in Humboldt County and has  made possible  the productive use of wood  waste generated by the lumber industry.  Mr. Speaker, many people have been important to the long-term success of the Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District, but none  have matched  the vital contributions of Mr.  John Winzler. Mr. Winzler has worked on the  project since 1961, and as District Engineer  has guided the development and maintenance  of this important infrastructure.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is appropriate at  this  time  that we commend the Humboldt Bay Municipal  Water District on  its 50th year  in operation,  and recognize  the  importance of  the District  for the quality of life and economic vitality of  the Humboldt Bay region.  f  TRIBUTE TO ROBERTA  HOLLOWELL  HON. LYNN C. WOOLSEY  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 15, 2006  ",2006
1715,19,2006-09-15,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, we rise today  to honor Roberta Hollowell of Santa Rosa,  California, who passed away on August 10,  2006, after a two-year battle with cancer. We  know  that,  though she has  left  this earthly  plane, she will be continuing her work as a  feminist activist elsewhere. Hers is the kind of  voice that will never be silenced, and her spirit  lives on in the many she inspired.  Born 77 years ago in Brooklyn, NY, Roberta  moved to California as a teenager when her  father  took an engineering  job  in  the Bay  Area.  She  graduated  from UC  Berkeley  (where she met her husband Ellis Hollowell)  and later earned a master’s degree from Mills  College. The couple had three children before  divorcing in 1962.  In 1962 Roberta and the children moved to  Sebastopol and later to Santa Rosa. At that  time, Roberta  began  teaching English  at  Healdsburg High School, a position she held  for 23 years.  As an activist, Roberta was a  leader and  member in many organizations, and as a retired teacher, education was one of her passions. She was active in the California Teachers Association (CTA), National Education Association  (NEA),  the Sonoma County Educators Council,  and  the Healdsburg Area  Teachers Association. Other  affiliations  included National Organization for Women, Sierra Club, NAACP, Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women, and California  State Democratic Central Committee.  Her union work and liberal politics probably  started as a family trait, but Roberta blazed  her own path and was a mainstay of  the  Sonoma County Democratic Party. She was  active till the end in a host of issues that benefited from her skills and contacts.  But it is Roberta’s personal contacts and example  that we  remember  the most. Stories  told at her funeral attest to her unique ability  in bringing others into the fold. She insisted  that since we all have voices we should use  them. Her humor and warmth as well as her  determination, leadership, and sense of organization were all key to her success. And fond  nicknames,  like The General and La Jefa,  were also marks of respect.  Roberta was very proud of her wonderful  family. She is survived by her daughter Mardi,  her  son  Tom,  grandchildren  Ryan  and  Danielle,  and  great-granddaughter Melody  Ann. Her son David preceded her in death in  1995.  Mr. Speaker, we are honored to have been  counted  among Roberta Hollowell’s many  friends. We will miss her support and inspiration and will carry her legacy with us.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

1717,3,2006-09-27,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker, Members of  Congress are looking for border security answers, and the American people  are demanding them. But it seems we  are being stonewalled by our own Border Patrol hierarchy.  Get this, apparently our Border Patrol agents cannot talk or answer questions from Members of Congress without filing a lengthy detailed report, the  same type of report they file when they  arrest  illegals, drug runners, or are  even shot at by the Mexican military.  This appears to intimidate our Border  Patrol agents to not say a word about  what is really going on.  When I have been on the border, the  Border Patrol agents were very reluctant to say anything except scripted  answers. Now I know why. What does  the Border Patrol hierarchy have to  hide? Apparently  the  truth because  that is all we are after.  Why  wouldn’t  homeland  security  want their agents talking to Members  of Congress? Members of Congress are  being forced to tear down the war of silence just to control our own border.  The enemy  is not Congress or  the  American people, it is the insurgents  who infiltrate our border every day.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  NO RECESS UNTIL ACTION ON  ENERGY PRICES  (Mr. STUPAK asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1718,3,2006-09-27,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker, the Bush  administration and Republicans in this  House enjoy a cozy relationship with  big oil companies, one that is paying  off for oil but is hurting American consumers.  For 5 years now, the President has  stacked his administration with former  energy executives, friends and former  colleagues of his and the Vice President’s. It is no wonder then that now  the Nation’s three largest oil companies have been posting record profits.  They are benefiting from the Republican policies that allow them to price  gouge and receive huge tax subsidies.  But when it comes to offering assistance or solutions to the American consumer, the Republicans in the Bush administration come up short. No money  for home heating assistance, no money  for consumer price relief, no money to  invest in finding alternative fuels. Of  course not, it is all going to the oil  companies. There is just not enough  left to help the average American.  Democrats demand action on  issue  before Republicans  take  House into yet another recess.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent  to bring up H.R. 4479, which repeals the  oil company tax subsidies and allows  us to find real solutions to the energy  crisis.

Under  the  Speaker’s  announced guidelines, the Chair is constrained not to entertain such a request in the absence of express clearances by bipartisan  committee and  floor leadership.  this  this  f  NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE  ESTIMATE AND WAR ON TERROR  (Mr. GINGREY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1719,3,2006-09-27,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to thank President Bush for declassifying key judgments from the National  Intelligence Estimate  so  the  American people can understand the  absolute critical importance of our war  on terror, and why the bills we are debating this week, from defense appropriations to military commissions, are  essential to keeping America safe and  our homeland secure.  Mr. Speaker, despite what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  might claim, American is not responsible for the rise of terrorism. We did  not bring this war on the terrorists.  They brought  this upon  themselves  when they attacked freedom and our  way of life in Kenya, Tanzania, aboard  the USS Cole, New York City, Pennsylvania, and right here in Washington,  D.C. on September 11.  America has a winning strategy of  relentlessly hunting down those who  wish us harm, and working to defeat  terrorism by encouraging democracy in  the Middle East. If the terrorists are  emboldened by the spread of this newfound freedom, it is because they know  that free people will terminate the terrorist way of life.  Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely incumbent upon us and this body to give  President Bush, our CIA, and our military the tools they need to prevent future attacks on our Nation.  I hope my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle will join me this week  in voting to protect the American people.  f  RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE  (Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1720,3,2006-09-27,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, for  10 years the Republicans have kept  hardworking Americans away from an  increase in the minimum wage. Over 7  million people who get up in the morning every day and go to work, all day  long, all week long, all month long and  all year long, and at the end of that  year they end up in poverty. At the end  of that year they end up with the inability to provide for their families.  For 10 years, the Republicans have  fought an  increase  in the minimum  wage. For 10 years the Republicans  have made  it official policy of this  country that people who get up and go  to work every day will end up in poverty. It is a poverty wage. And the Republicans are proud of it. The majority  leader boasts that he has fought this  his entire public life, and yet these people are stuck at 1950 wages.  But what is not stuck at 1950 is the  price of groceries, the price of gasoline  to go to work, the price of housing, and  the price of health care. There is no relief for these hardworking Americans.  There is no relief for their families because the Republicans refuse to entertain a clean vote on the minimum  wage. A clean vote, so 7 million Americans could start to have an increase in  their yearly take-home pay. That is  what the Republicans refuse.  There is 72 hours left in this session.  The Republicans can decide to do the  decent thing, to provide a minimum  wage increase for hardworking Americans. But the Republicans won’t do  that because they are not a party of decency. They have chosen to put these  people into poverty and to keep them  in poverty year after year after year.  Yet they have chosen to have eight pay  raises for Members of Congress at the  same time they have chosen to keep  hardworking Americans in poverty.  That’s what the Republicans promise  hardworking Americans, you end up in  poverty.  ",2006

1727,10,2006-09-27,Mr. DEFAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, Medicare  part D, confusing, complicated, very  costly. In fact, the Bush administration lied about the cost. They had estimates that said it would cost $750 billion to $1 trillion, but they suppressed  that to get votes from conservatives on  their side. They said not a penny more  than 400 million, and it is very costly  to seniors.  We now have 3 million seniors who  have fallen into something called the  donut hole. They get to spend $2,600 out  of pocket before they get any more  Medicare prescription drug benefit, and  they have to pay a higher price for the  drugs during that time period than  they could get at the local drugstore,  let alone getting it from Canada or if it  was centrally purchased by the government.  We have it in our power to fix it  today, save the taxpayer $750 billion,  get the seniors out of the donut hole,  but they are going to say it is the custom and practice of the House not to  consider such things.  The custom and the practice of the  House is to fix problems confronting  the people of  the United States of  America. It is cleared on my side of the  aisle.

It will endanger American  personnel overseas, undermine the Geneva conventions, and give a get-out-  of-jail-free card  to people who may  have committed war crimes.  If an American is captured in North  Korea, Iran, Syria, or Somalia and held  and interrogated under the same kangaroo court process this bill will create, every single Member of this House  would be outraged at that miscarriage  of justice.  The public is tired of a Republican  majority  that  retreats  to  fear-  mongering  instead of trying to  find  constructive solutions to the serious  security problems  facing Americans.  The Republicans refuse to screen for  nuclear bomb material coming in in  ships, they refuse to screen cargo going  onto American passenger planes, and  they refuse to require that chemical  plants in our country have mandatory  security built around them.  By passing this bill today, we are  lowering our standards and we are encouraging  other  countries  to  lower  their standards as well.

At a time when gas prices,  tuition bills, and housing costs are  skyrocketing, real wages for full-time  workers are declining.  Low-income  families  are  suffering  even more, with the lowest inflation  adjustment minimum wage in 50 years.  The Bush economy has made  it difficult for the income of all working  Americans to keep up with the rising  costs. Democrats have a plan to reserve  these misguided tax cuts and redirect  them to the middle class and working  people who need them most.  Mr. Speaker, since the Republicans  in this body have refused to raise the  minimum wage for the past 9 years,  and since they seem intent on adjourning  this  body  before  taking  up  a  straight up-or-down vote on raising it,  I now ask unanimous consent to bring  up H.R. 2429, Congressman GEORGEMILLER’s Fair Minimum Wage Act.  ",2006

1734,10,2006-09-27,Mr. WESTMORELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  over the last year, House Republicans  have focused on common sense energy  solutions to help lower gas prices, create jobs for American workers, and reduce America’s reliance on foreign energy sources. And what have the Democrats done? Democrats voted against  the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act,  which would create thousands of family wage American jobs and allow more  of our energy resources to be produced  in  the deep  seas while empowering  States to protect their coastlines.  Democrats voted against the Refinery  Permit  Process  Schedule Act,  which would encourage new refinery  capacity in order to increase gasoline  supplies and drive down high prices.  Democrats voted against the American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act,  authorizing environmentally safe energy production in ANWR, creating 1  million family wage jobs and increasing the supply of American-made energy to lower gasoline prices.  Mr. Speaker, I keep hearing from the  other side of the aisle this refrain of  the ‘‘do-nothing Congress.’’ I would say  it is more the ‘‘do-nothing Democrats.’’  Republicans have a strong record  in  passing commonsense energy solutions,  something Democrats can’t claim.  It is time for the other side to quit  whining and start working.  f  CONGRESS  SHOULD MAKE  COLLEGE  MORE  AFFORDABLE  TODAY BY PASSING LABOR-HHS  BILL  (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2006
1735,10,2006-09-27,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker,  for 6  years  now, Washington Republicans  have done absolutely nothing to help  college students better afford college.  President Bush promised to  increase  Pell Grants  during his  first  presidential election in 2000, but has refused  to live up to that promise. The maximum Pell Grant has been frozen for 4  straight years, and now only covers 32  percent of tuition costs.  Inaction was not the problem earlier  this year when the Republican Congress raided student aid programs. Our  Republican colleagues raided $12 billion from college education programs,  forcing the Education Department to  raise interest rates on college loans to  over 8 percent.  Democrats  reject  these Republican  actions. At a time when college students  are  confronting  skyrocketing  tuition costs, we think this Congress  should be coming up with creative solutions to help college students better  afford their education.  Today, we should pass an improved  Labor-HHS appropriation bill that restores the massive cuts in college tuition assistance imposed on this Congress and expand the size and availability of Pell Grants.  f  PROVIDING  FOR  CONSIDERATION  OF H.R. 6166, MILITARY COMMISSIONS ACT OF 2006  ",2006

1737,17,2006-09-27,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in full support of the rule for  H.R. 6166.  I hear  from a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  and particularly heard in our hearing  yesterday in the Rules Committee, a  complaint about process.  I understand that, Mr. Speaker. That  is what the minority party does. That  is what we would do if we were in that  situation. That is what we have done in  the  past.  I understand  those  complaints about process.  But this  is now where the rubber  meets the road. This is about policy.  This is a bill that we need their full  support on. The men and women that  work in our intelligence community,  the CIA agents, the interrogators, the  military personnel, they need our support. We  shouldn’t  be  giving more  rights to the terrorists than we do to  our own people who are fighting every  day to protect us.  Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my  colleagues that these detainees, whether they are in prison in eastern Europe  or at Guantanamo Bay, they are not  there because they were caught chewing bubble gum in class, or throwing  spitballs. These are very, very bad guys  that were caught on the battlefield in  Afghanistan with weapons in hand. Or  in  some  instances, preparing  improvised explosive devices  to blow our  young men and women to smithereens.  So I don’t think they deserve any special rights. They deserve the right to  counsel and a fair trial, and that is  what we are giving them. These people  are out of uniform. They are not fighting  for  any  particular  government.  They are targeting civilians. They are  beheading  the  prisoners,  including  Daniel Pearl, Nick Berg, and from my  own district, Mr. Speaker, a government contract worker, a husband and a  father, Jack Helmsley.  They don’t qualify for rights under  the Geneva Convention, even though  the President has tried to extend them  those rights. The Supreme Court, of  course, in their recent ruling, says we  have to do that, so that is what we are  doing. We are giving them rights. We  are being a whole lot kinder to them  than they ever would be to us because  of our moral standards. I think that is  important.  I think this is a bill that gets it right  and it deserves the support of Members  on both sides of the aisle. I hope my  colleagues, when the rubber meets the  road, when we get to the vote, they  will think about policy and not process.  ",2006
1738,17,2006-09-27,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI),  the minority leader.  ",2006
1739,17,2006-09-27,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, as I always remind my colleagues, I am a  mother of five children and I have five  grandchildren going on six in October.  Their personal safety is of paramount  importance to me, as it is to every parent of their children and grandchildren  in our country.  As elected officials, our primary responsibility is to protect and defend  our country, to provide for the common defense. It is in the Constitution  of the United States.  So to come to this floor on this very  important debate and to hear the Representative  from Georgia,  to  imply  that this issue of punishing those who  do harm or could do harm to our country is not a priority for every Member  of this body is a disservice to this debate and dishonors our Constitution.  How dare you come to this floor and  imply that we think that these people  are being tried for chewing gum. They  have committed the most heinous acts  that we have witnessed in our lives.  Every American wants  them  prosecuted and punished. Every American  wants them prosecuted and punished.  I will not yield. You had your time.  You demeaned this debate by implying  that we think they were being tried for  chewing gum. That is what you said.  The RECORDwill show it.  But it isn’t just you. It isn’t just you.  It  is the condescension and the disrespect for something that we should  expect every Member of this body on  both sides of the aisle to take very,  very seriously: To provide for the common defense.  b1215  We have that officially as our responsibility. It is our first responsibility because, unless our people are safe, nothing else really matters. And as a mother, as a parent, as a mother of five and  a grandmother of five going on six, as  I constantly remind you all, I identify  with the concerns of all of America’s  families for safety in their neighborhoods while these Republicans are cutting the Community Policing program,  Cops on the Beat program. So it just is  very pervasive.  But, again, we all want a safe home,  a safe community, a safe neighborhood,  homeland security, and to be able to  protect our country wherever our interests are threatened  in the world.  And  the ability  to anticipate what  those dangers may be is a very important one as well.  It is 5 years since 9/11. Not one person  who has been directly responsible for 9/  11 has been prosecuted and punished.  There  is something wrong with this  picture. And  this bill  that  is here  today, because it does violence to the  Constitution of the United States, also,  as Mr. SKELTONsaid, will produce convictions that may well be overturned  because the bill does not heed the instructions from the Supreme Court, a  Supreme Court friendly to this administration, which has directed it to go  back to the drawing board.  Democrats bring to this debate an  unshakeable commitment, as do Republicans, to the proposition that terrorists who attack Americans must be  caught, convicted, and punished in a  judicial process that will withstand the  scrutiny of  the Supreme Court. We  want them in jail. We want them punished, whatever that punishment is. We  don’t want it overturned. And that is  what this debate is about today.  The American people want those who  perpetrated and are responsible for 9/11  to be prosecuted without further delay.  It is 5 years later, and they want convictions to stick so that justice will  not be further postponed. It is inexplicable. How do you explain to people  that 5 years later this has not happened, and not one single planner has  even been brought to trial?  The bill does not help us achieve the  goal of bringing anyone to trial. It is  badly flawed. It threatens the safety of  our troops, our ability to prosecute terrorists effectively, our ability to protect the American people, and to honor  our oath of office to protect and defend  the Constitution. Rather  than welcoming suggestions for improvements,  Republicans refuse to hear them at all.  The only one recourse that we have  is to defeat this rule so that we can  offer amendments to address some of  the bill’s most glaring deficiencies in  the areas of, one, habeas corpus; two,  Geneva Conventions standards; and the  appeals process. If we do not, I believe,  as I have said, that we will be headed  for a repeat of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, a  Supreme Court defeat for the President  and a decision that sends us back to  square one in terms of bringing those  responsible for 9/11 to trial.  By seeking to strip Federal courts of  habeas corpus review, this bill is practically begging to be overturned by the  courts. Habeas corpus  is one of the  hallmarks of our legal system and our  democracy. It is the last line of defense  against arbitrary executive power. And  on that subject, we had a rule that was  proposed by ",2006
1740,17,2006-09-27,Mr. MEEHAN.," It was rejected by the Rules Committee. Hopefully, we can reject the previous question so that we can bring that up.  Then, permitting  indefinite detention under conditions that cannot be  challenged in court is so contrary to  our history and our values  that  it  should raise all sorts of red flags. Yet  this bill  rushes us headlong  into a  court-stripping misadventure that will  have disastrous consequences for our  efforts to combat terrorism. Let us not  go there. That is habeas corpus.  In addition, the bill establishes an  appeals process, and it is interesting,  Mr. Speaker. The appeals process  in  this bill ignores the existing highly respected appellate military system that  provides a direct route to the Supreme  Court, expedited. Rather than deferring  to the military justice system that is  very respected by the military and that  is now in place, the bill creates a new  appeals court with no track record and  a longer, longer path to the Supreme  Court review, which will delay justice.  Perhaps most distressing, this bill  could very well boomerang on us, putting American troops in danger.  Redefining the Geneva Conventions  in ways  that  lower  the  treatment  standards the Conventions create poses  a real risk to American forces.

1744,38,2006-09-27,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, we need to be tough on  the terrorists, but we also need to be  tough with certainty. I oppose this legislation because it lacks the certainty  that we require.  As a  former prosecuting attorney  from yesteryear, Mr. Speaker,  I remember the specter that hangs over  every prosecutor’s head after successfully prosecuting a criminal, and that  specter is that the Supreme Court will  reverse that hard-won conviction.  I am terribly concerned that this is  not tough enough because it does not  bring about the certainty of a conviction being upheld and  standing  the  scrutiny of our Supreme Court.  This is a constitutional issue. The debate today will undoubtedly go down in  the annals of our country as being one  that stands out as a study in constitutional law and duty thereunder. Our  duty as Members of Congress is to uphold the Constitution. That is what I  intend to do in my speech and in my  vote.  But also it is our duty to pass legislation that is constitutional. I have serious questions as to whether this is constitutional or not.  I received a  letter  from the Chief  Counsel of the tribunals that exist,  Colonel Dwight Sullivan, who said, ‘‘If  the new military commission system is  constitutionally permissible, allow  it  to proceed with the judiciary’s imprimatur. If, as I believe, it is constitutionally deficient, then allow the judiciary to quickly identify its faults so  they can be corrected.’’  I offered an amendment to the Rules  Committee that would provide for expedited review by the court system,  and it was turned down.  What is so bad is that a case goes  cold, witnesses  disappear, witnesses  die. It would be an absolute injustice  for a despicable terrorist, once convicted, to have that conviction overturned, and you can’t try  it again.  Some of these people are absolutely  the worst of the worst. That is why we  need certainty in the law, and that is  what we do not have here.  There are numerous constitutional  challenges regarding this legislation. I  will mention them:  The provisions that strip the Federal  courts of jurisdiction over habeas corpus.  Second, article I of the Constitution  prohibits ex post facto laws. That is  what this creates.  Third, it is questionable as to whether under article III of the Constitution  the Supreme Court would uphold a system that purports to make the President the final arbiter of the Geneva  Convention.  Fourth, the provisions regarding coerced  testimony may be  challenged  under three amendments to our Constitution.  Fifth, the right to confront witnesses  and evidence.  It also, among other  things, has legislation containing the  broadest of hearsay rules.  Sixth, the violation of the exceptions  clause under article III.  Seventh, the challenges on equal protection  and  other  constitutional  grounds.  We want certainty, Mr. Speaker. We  want these people, once tried, to be  convicted and that conviction upheld.  If we pass a law full well knowing that  there are provisions in here that would  allow them a get-out-of-jail-free card  or to have a death sentence reversed,  we are doing wrong. We are doing  wrong according to our duty, and we  are doing wrong  in representing the  people of our country.  We need certainty as well as toughness. Without certainty, we will not be  tough on these terrorists.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006

1746,38,2006-09-27,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 6166.  Ladies and gentleman, this is not an  ordinary bill. This is an urgently needed measure to fill a gaping hole in our  legal system, both  in our ability to  bring criminals of 9/11 to justice, the  bombings of  the USS Cole and  the  American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to  justice, and to protect our  American troops and agents from frivolous prosecutions and lawsuits. It is no  exaggeration to say that this is the  most important measure to come before this body in this Congress.  Without this bill, the mastermind of  9/11, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who deliberated  and  cold-bloodedly  plotted  the death of thousands of Americans,  would go unpunished  for his crimes  upon humanity.  Yes, we are a nation of laws. The Supreme Court has called upon the Congress to act, and that is what we will  do.  We have produced an extraordinarily  fair criminal process here to adjudicate  the fate of these terrorists. Those who  would find the court procedures laid  out in this bill wanting will never be  satisfied until we are reading Miranda  rights on the battlefield. We have carefully narrowed and crafted the provisions of this bill to enable the United  States to prosecute the perpetrators of  the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the 2000  attack on the USS Cole, and other  crimes that have been committed.  Yes, these were suicide attacks and  the men who delivered the explosives  were killed, along with innocent victims, but the planner, logisticians, and  financiers of those operations remain  at large.  Importantly, this bill allows, as all  Americans believe it should, the criminal prosecutions of those who purposefully and materially supported these  criminal activities. And, of course, the  measure covers those responsible for 9/  11 as well.  Mr. Speaker, I can think of no reason  that  this measure  should not  pass  unanimously. It outlaws torture.

But I have a lot of questions to ask.  I want to be sure that I do the right  thing. Why are we rushing into this? I  know we have to comply with the law,  but we should not be in a hurry. I think  we need to do what is right.  b1400  You know, I have some questions.  When  the Geneva Conventions  convened back in 1949, there were at least  200 countries who agreed in what came  out of this convention.

1751,45,2006-09-27,Ms. LEE.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to  thank the gentleman for yielding and  for his leadership and his commitment  to our young men and women in uniform throughout the world.  At a time when even the National Intelligence Estimate has concluded that  the occupation in Iraq has spawned a  new generation of terrorists and made  us, quite frankly, less safe, this bill  now will undermine the security of our  brave troops and hand a victory to  those who believe the rule of  force  should prevail over the rule of law.  I have to say once again, as the  daughter of a 25-year military Lieutenant Colonel who served this country in  many, many capacities through two  wars, that this scares me. It scares me  to death.  What century are we living in when  we trust intelligence acquired through  torture? Clearly, the President fails to  realize that these techniques will destroy the credibility of any verdicts  that use information derived from torture.  Insisting on fairness and just credibility is all we are asking for, credibility in the process. This isn’t about  protecting those who would harm us,  as the Republicans would have you believe, it is about protecting our own  troops and our Nation and not further  alienating our country in the eyes of  the world community.  When we turn away from the legal  and the moral values that have guided  our Nation, we give up the principles  that differentiate us from the terrorists.  I quoted from a prayer given by Reverend Baxter at the National Cathedral  during the memorial service  for the  victims and families of 9/11 5 years ago,  and Reverend Baxter said, and I keep  thinking about this prayer, he said,  ‘‘Let us not become the evil who we deplore.’’  So I just want to urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on  this bill; and I want to thank Mr. SKELTON for his leadership, for his support  for the troops, for his steadfast work  on behalf of our national security, and  for making sure that this body continues to try to uphold the rule of law.

1752,45,2006-09-27,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MORAN).  Mr. MORAN of Virginia . I thank my  good friend, an inspirational leader on  the Armed Services Committee.  I oppose this bill. It would send a  message to the world that the United  States  can  disregard  international  treaties and law and, instead, do as it  pleases. For generations, we have been  the beacon  to guide  the actions of  other nations. If we descend from the  high moral ground, we are, in effect,  losing ground to the terrorists.  Secretary of State Colin Powell was  so accurate when he said, part of this  war on terrorism is an ideological and  political struggle. Our moral posture is  our best weapon to prevail  in that  struggle.  Mr. Speaker, this is not a good bill.  Since the inception of the Geneva Conventions 60 years ago, no other country  in the world has tried to undermine  and negate its provisons its spirit as  this bill would.  For  enemy  combatants,  the  bill  eliminates the right of habeas corpus.  This is a right enshrined in our Constitution that may be abandoned only,  and I quote, ‘‘when in cases of rebellion  or invasion the public safety may require it.’’ The elimination of habeas is  not just illegal, it is flat out wrong.  The purpose of habeas corpus is simple. It is to avoid injustice, to avoid  the detention by government of any individual  that  is  erroneous,  unwarranted, or in violation of law. This purpose and  the values  from which  it  stems do not distinguish among individuals or circumstances. They seek to  avoid any injustice to any detained individuals.

1754,52,2006-09-27,Mr. NADLER.," Mr. Speaker, this is  how a Nation loses its moral compass,  its identity, its values and, ultimately,  its freedom to fear.  It is ironic that the people who use  the word  ‘‘freedom’’ with  reckless  abandon, in everything from fries to a  global vision, should come before the  American people advocating the suspension of habeas corpus, secret star  chamber  tribunals, unlimited detention without review, and, yes, torture.  Yes, we must be vigilant to protect  our safety. But we must not allow the  honor and values of our Nation to be  permanently stained by this detestable  legislation. It is beneath us. It is not  what we stand for.  There are many infamies in this bill,  as others have pointed out. I will concentrate on just one.  This bill would allow the President,  or any future President, to grab someone off a street corner in the United  States, or anywhere else in the world,  and hold  them  forever without any  court review, without having to charge  them, without ever having to justify  their imprisonment to anyone.  This bill is flatly unconstitutional,  for it repeals the great writ, habeas  corpus; not, Mr. SENSENBRENNER,  a  statutory writ,  the  statutory  great  writ.  Turn to page 93, ‘‘No court, justice,  or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear  or consider an application for writ of  habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of  an alien detained by the United States  who has been determined by the United  States to have been properly detained  as an enemy combatant or is awaiting  such determination.’’  ‘‘Awaiting  such  determination’’?  That says it all. Nowhere in this new  law is there any time limit for making  this determination. In fact, it could be  never.  We are told that these procedures are  only for those the President has called  ‘‘the worst of the worst.’’ How do we  know they are the worst of the worst?  Because the President says so. And the  President and Federal bureaucrats, as  we all know, never make mistakes.  Some people held as unlawful enemy  combatants may be put before a military tribunal, but they need not be.  They can be held  forever without a  hearing, without a military tribunal.  So let’s review. The government can  snatch anyone who is not a U.S. citizens anywhere in the world, including  on the streets of this city, whether or  not they are actually doing anything,  and detain them in jail forever, out of  reach of our Constitution, our laws or  our courts.  We rebelled against King George, III,  for  far  less  infringements on  liberty  than this 200 years ago, but we seem to  have  forgotten. This bill makes the  President a dictator for when someone  can order people jailed forever without  being subject to any judicial review.  That is dictatorial power. The President wants to exist in a law-free zone.  He does not want to be bound by the  law of war or our treaty obligations.  He does not want to answer to the Constitution, to the Congress or to the  courts.  Mr. Speaker, rarely in the life of a  Nation is the question so stark: Are we  going to rush this complete repudiation of what we stand for through the  Congress? I hope we are better than  that.  ",2006
1755,52,2006-09-27,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  VANHOLLEN), an excellent member of  the Committee on the Judiciary, 2 minutes.  ",2006
1756,52,2006-09-27,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker, we  now know what  the administration  wanted to hide from the American people: that the consensus view of all 16  intelligence agencies is that the Iraq  war has made the overall terrorism  problem worse, not better; that it has  fueled the jihadist movement and made  us less safe, and not more safe.  The Bush administration was wrong  about weapons of mass destruction.  They were wrong about alleged collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam  Hussein, and they are wrong about this  bill.  This bill will weaken, not strengthen,  our national security. They are wrong  because this bill will place our troops  in Iraq and elsewhere around the world  in  greater  danger  of  torture,  both  today and in future conflicts. They are  wrong because this bill will  further  erode our already tarnished credibility  and moral standing around the world.  Let us always remember that our  strength flows not only from the force  of our military but from the power of  our example. And they are wrong because we have learned the hard way  that  information  extracted  through  torture and extreme coercion can be  unreliable.  Remember when Secretary Powell at  the United Nations told the world that  Saddam  Hussein  had mobile  bioweapons labs? That information came  from a person that we turned over to  Egypt who was tortured, and the CIA  has since acknowledged that information was false, and yet that was important information that was used as part  of our argument to go to war in Iraq.  This is a defining moment for our  Congress and our country. It will define who we are as a people and what  we stand for, and yet it gives the President too much of a blank check to unilaterally decide that answer for all of  us. It gives the President the authority  to unilaterally define what constitutes  specific acts of torture. It gives the  President the authority to unilaterally  decide who  can be detained as an  enemy combatant, including American  citizens, and, therefore, send them into  a legal limbo.  Mr. Speaker, when we take very important decisions in the name of the  American  people, we  better  get  it  right. This bill gets it wrong.  ",2006
1757,52,2006-09-27,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  include  for the RECORD a  letter dated  September 27 from the American Civil  Liberties Union and 41 other organizations.  SEPTEMBER27, 2006.  DEARREPRESENTATIVE: We are writing to  strongly encourage you to reject the ‘‘compromise’’ Military Commissions Act of 2006  and to vote no on final passage of the bill.  More  than anything  else,  the bill  compromises America’s commitment to fairness  and the rule of law.  For the last five years the United States  has repeatedly operated in a manner that betrays our Nation’s commitment to law. The  U.S. has held prisoners  in secret prisons  without any due process or even access to  the Red Cross and has placed other prisoners  in Guantanamo Bay in a transparent effort  to avoid judicial oversight and the application of U.S. treaty obligations. The Federal  government has operated under legal theories which dozens of former senior officers  have warned endanger U.S. personnel in the  field and has produced legal interpretations  of the meaning of ‘‘torture’’ and ‘‘cruel, inhuman and degrading’’ treatment which had  to be abandoned when revealed to the public.  Interrogation practices were approved by the  Department of Defense which former Bush  Administration appointee and General Counsel of the Navy Alberto Mora described as  ‘‘clearly abusive, and . . . clearly contrary to  everything we were ever taught about American values.’’ According to media reports the  CIA has used a variety of interrogation techniques which the United States has previously prosecuted as war crimes and routinely denounces as torture when they are  used by other governments.  Instead of finally coming to grips with this  situation and creating a framework for detaining,  interrogating and prosecuting alleged terrorists which comports with the  best traditions of American justice, the proposed legislation will mostly perpetuate the  current problems. Worse, it would seek to  eliminate any accountability for violations  of the law in the past and prevent future judicial oversight. While we appreciate the efforts various members of Congress have  made to address these problems, the ‘‘compromise’’ falls far short of an acceptable outcome.

1758,59,2006-09-27,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to defend  American values.  The Military Commissions Act—H.R. 6166—  continues Republicans’ despotic assault on  the Constitution.  It  denies  detainees  held  abroad the fundamental right of habeas corpus, which has for centuries protected against  unjust government imprisonment. It limits protections against detainee mistreatment, sanctioning  ‘‘alternative procedures’’ of  interrogation that amount to cruel and unusual punishment. It denies people the opportunity to confront the evidence used against them—even if  that evidence is obtained through coercive and  inhumane practices. It strips our courts of the  jurisdiction  to  review cases—including  those  already pending—concerning detainee abuse.  Some call this legislation a ‘‘compromise.’’ I  call it a capitulation. No sooner had the ink  dried on this deal than the Bush administration  declared that the CIA’s program of secret detention and interrogation could and would continue. That  should  come  as  no  surprise.  Though this bill does not explicitly redefine our  obligations under the Geneva Conventions, it  permits the President to ‘‘interpret the meaning and application’’ of our historic commitment  to  the  international  community—and  theirs to us.  Make no mistake, our disregard  for  international law imperils the safety and security of  our men and women in uniform. Our denial of  due process to detainees invites foreign states  and organizations to indefinitely imprison and  interrogate our soldiers. Our insistence on defining  detainees  as  ‘‘enemy  combatants’’  undeserving of  legal protections encourages  our adversaries to deny these very same protections  to American prisoners. Provided, of  course, we haven’t already done so ourselves:  This legislation allows the Government to declare not only  foreigners, but also U.S. citizens,  ‘‘enemy combatants’’ and arrest and  hold them indefinitely.  This legislation further confirms that Republicans in Congress are no more interested in  fundamental human  rights  than  is President  Bush and his administration.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’  ",2006
1759,59,2006-09-27,Mr. CLEAVER.," Mr. Speaker, I was unable  to personally cast votes today because I was  attending a memorial service for SFC Michael  Fuga. Sergeant Fuga was killed September 9,  2006 in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Sgt. Fuga was  assigned  to  the Missouri National Guard’s  35th Special Troops Battalion based in St. Joseph, MO. He and his family made Independence, in the district I am proud to serve, their  home. Sgt. Fuga was 47 and had spent 28  years of his life in the Army. At the time of his  death, he was training Afghan armed forces to  help bring peace and stability to a nation that  has known neither for decades.  SGM James Schulte, who was in charge of  Sergeant Fuga’s deployment said, ‘‘He was a  true patriot and a great family man. I am truly  honored to have known and served with him.’’  We should all be so lucky to have something  like that be said of us when we are gone.  Sergeant Fuga volunteered  to extend his  time in Afghanistan because, his family says,  he was committed to defeating those who attacked our Nation 5 years ago  this week.  Each day we are blessed  to  live under  the  freedoms which Sergeant Fuga and his colleagues in the Armed Forces so bravely serve  to protect and ensure.  Sergeant Fuga leaves behind his wife and  12-year-old daughter.  I do not  take  the decision  to miss votes  lightly, but hope I can provide Sergeant Fuga’s  family some comfort on what will be a difficult  night.  Today,  the House of Representatives debated and voted on H.R. 6166—Military Commissions Act.  Republicans tried to paint those who were  not in favor of the bill as being soft on bringing  terrorists to justice and meting out just punishment. They implied that those who were not in  favor of the measure were trivializing the heinous crimes perpetrated against American citizens and service members.  They refused to allow an open debate by  suppressing thoughtful and germane amendments designed to strengthen the intent of the  legislation. Once again they rushed through a  piece of bad legislation written to appease an  administration stubbornly determined on doling  out justice as it sees fit. I am disheartened by  the  lack  of  importance  this  administration  places on human rights, on due process, and  on upholding the Constitution of these United  States.  ",2006
1760,59,2006-09-27,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition  to H.R.  6166  and  am  deeply  disappointed that Congress has missed an opportunity to act in a bipartisan manner to prosecute those who would do harm to Americans,  while ensuring  that such efforts would withstand legal scrutiny.  In  June,  the  Supreme Court  ruled  in  Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that President Bush exceeded his authority by establishing military  commissions to try detainees in the global war  on terrorism without explicit congressional approval. That decision presented Congress with  an important opportunity to develop a proposal  to  try some of  the world’s most dangerous  people and  to provide swift  justice  to  those  who engaged in horrendous acts against our  Nation. Unfortunately, instead of proceeding in  a bipartisan manner to craft legislation that enjoys the full confidence of this body, Congress  is faced with a proposal negotiated exclusively  by Republicans and whose actual effectiveness in prosecuting terrorists remains in question.  After  the Hamdan  decision,  the House  Armed Services Committee held numerous  hearings on how Congress should  respond,  and I commend the chairman for his efforts to  ensure that committee members learned the  complexities of this topic.  One constant theme we heard from the witnesses  testifying was  that Congress should  ensure that any system established to try military detainees  followed existing  legal procedures to the greatest extent practicable.  On that point, let us be clear. Despite the  mischaracterizations of some Members on the  floor today, no one has recommended giving  terrorists the same rights as criminals or members of our Armed Forces. Everyone recognizes that many of these detainees are dangerous people, and we agree that the judicial  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:29 Nov 18, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H27SE6.REC H27SE6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006

1762,66,2006-09-27,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Mr.  Speaker, as an original cosponsor of  this bill,  I  commend  the Financial  Services and Judiciary Committees for  working together in a bipartisan spirit  to move it forward. I especially want to  thank Ranking Member CONYERS and  Ranking Member  and  you,  Chairman OXLEY, for your support and  leadership.  This bill provides much needed relief  to Florida’s commercial firms, which  are experiencing severe increases, and I  mean thousands of percent increases in  insurance premiums.  This is not endemic to Florida. It is  really happening across  the Nation.  FRANK Surplus lines are a safety valve on traditional  insurance markets. In some  cases, they are the only way firms can  get insurance when regulated lines fail.  Market perception of unsustainable  increases in catastrophic risk has resulted in the precipitous decline of insurance coverage availability at astronomical cost to consumers.  This bill expands market capacity to  provide  surplus  lines  coverage.  It  eliminates hundreds of billions of dollars in administrative costs and duplicative filing fees, which are passed on  to consumers. Maintaining the status  quo means higher costs for commercial  firms, consumers, and ultimately our  economy.  I encourage my colleagues to support  this bill because it ensures that companies  are  able  to  obtain  insurance,  meaning they can stay in our communities, provide much needed jobs and  keep our economies strong. Companies  in my home State are literally closing  their doors or  leaving Florida altogether because they cannot get insurance.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.  ",2006

1764,66,2006-09-27,Mr. FITZPATRICK of Pennsylvania.,"  Mr. Speaker, the surplus lines and reinsurance marketplace is subject to regulatory problems that hamper efficiency  and pass on higher costs to policyholders.  I  find  it extremely troubling that  surplus lines policyholders in a number  of States are facing skyrocketing rates  due to an unnecessary, inefficient and  burdensome regulatory maze for compliance. In addition, I find it problematic that reinsurance rates are rising  because some State regulators are taking it upon themselves to throw out arbitration agreements between reinsurance providers and primary carriers.  For this reason, I am an original cosponsor of this bipartisan and broadly  endorsed legislation.  This  commonsense  bill  fixes  the  problems created by the multitude of  conflicting State laws and regulations  and by some state-by-state regulators  that are taking it upon themselves to  throw out the agreements between the  reinsurance providers and primary carriers to settle disputes without tying  up the courts.  Congress must correct flaws in the  current regulatory regime of commercial  insurance.  These  policyholders  cannot continue to be picking up the  tab because of the basic problems in  the current insurance regulatory system.  I  commend Congresswoman GINNY  BROWN-WAITEand Congressman DENNIS  MOORE for introducing this legislation.  I strongly urge the Members to vote for  H.R. 5637.  ",2006

Particularly I would say the gentleman from  Kansas has been a very steady contributor to our deliberations regarding the  importance of balance; and given the  physical conditions that have occurred  in Florida and the reaction thereto, the  gentlewoman  from  Florida  (Ms.  WASSERMANSCHULTZ) has been a real  leader in trying to get an appropriate  Federal response to the insurance crisis, and I am glad we were able to take  this step today.  b1700  ",2006

1768,66,2006-09-27,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. Speaker, I certainly  want to start by acknowledging the focused work of our chairman who has  worked diligently on many aspects of  reform, and the bill now pending is one  small piece of a larger puzzle which has  been constructed by the committee in  an effort to facilitate provision of insurance of all sorts, but particularly  focusing on the needs of homeowners.  And a word of  special appreciation  from those of us in Louisiana as a result of the debacles of Katrina and  Rita. We are experiencing a similar circumstance to that of our colleagues in  the State of Florida.  The remedy posed under the pending  bill is an important one. In one small  area, it enables someone to have direct  access to surplus lines policies which  currently  is not  facilitated. Current  rules require you to apply to at least  three separate companies and be denied  coverage before you can approach a  surplus lines company to acquire the  needed insurance. The proposed reform  would enable certain qualifying purchasers of product, whether it be business owners or individuals, to have direct access. And  in the case of the  Katrina-Rita impact areas, this is of  extreme importance in facilitating access  to  insurance which  otherwise  would not be made available.  I also want to speak to those members of the committee who worked diligently on this subject matter. As the  ranking member  indicated,  this has  been a bipartisan effort, and certainly  Mr.  and  Ms.  SCHULTZon their side are to be commended  for  their contributions. Ms.  WASSERMAN  MOORE BROWN-WAITEand Mr. FITZPATRICKand  others on our side have worked diligently as well.  I think the product we now have  pending before the House is a very important step, but should be viewed only  as that, a first step. There is much  work yet to be done to facilitate regulatory commonsense oversight of the  insurance industry, and hopefully provide for enhanced product development  and competitiveness in markets where  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:29 Nov 18, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H27SE6.REC H27SE6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006

It is rare in this House  that a freshman has been able to pass  major legislation as we have before us  today, and it is a real tribute to his  leadership and hard work and the cooperation on both sides of the aisle  that we were able to get this bipartisan  and bicameral bill finished.  We had a most impressive and informative field hearing in the City of  Brotherly Love last November, and it  really did set the template and the opportunity for the committee to move  forward with this legislation.  It is particularly poignant because it  is a natural after passage of Sarbanes-  Oxley, and I know Senator SARBANES  and I both appreciate the work and the  leadership that Mr. FITZPATRICK has  provided  for  us  and  for Chairman  to  move  that  legislation  through his subcommittee.  I want to thank all involved, including the staffers that Mr. FITZPATRICK  mentioned.

I rise in strong support of H.R. 6115,  the Mark-to-Market Extension Act of  2006,  legislation  introduced  by my  friend and colleague from Ohio, Congresswoman DEBORAHPRYCE. This legislation extends the Multifamily Assisted Housing Restructuring and Affordability Act of 1997 for 5 years beyond its current expiration date of September 30, 2006.  Legislation  creating  the Mark-to-  Market program was enacted in 1997 to  reduce the cost to the Federal Government of renewing section 8 contracts.

1788,108,2006-09-27,Mr. KELLER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in support of H.R. 6138, the  Third Higher Education Extension Act  of 2006.  Some of  the most  important programs  in the Higher Education Act,  such as Pell Grants and Perkins student loans, are set to expire on September 30, 2006. Pell Grants and Perkins loans are the passports out of poverty for millions of worthy young people, and they deserve to be reauthorized. H.R. 6138 ensures that these provisions will not expire at the end of this  fiscal year by extending them for another 9 months, through June 30, 2007.  While the House acted on permanent  reauthorization  of  the Higher Education Act by passing H.R. 609, the College Access and Opportunity Act, in  March of this year, the Senate has not  yet acted. The Senate should soon act  to pass their reauthorization bill so we  can negotiate a  final bill and have  these important higher education reforms signed into law. In the meantime, Mr. Speaker, this extension will  allow the important programs of the  Higher Education Act to continue past  their current September 30, 2006, expiration date.  In addition  to extending  the programs under the Higher Education Act,  H.R. 6138 includes additional provisions  to benefit students and  institutions.  Specifically,  it reduces red tape  for  Hispanic-serving institutions by eliminating the 2-year wait-out period between grant applications. The extension repeals an outdated and burdensome requirement that Hispanic-serving institutions document the percentage of low-income students enrolled at  the institution.  H.R. 6138 also eliminates the ability  of  schools  to  circumvent  the  new  school-as-lender restrictions by forming an eligible lender-trustee relationship. And, finally, it provides loan forgiveness  to  spouses and parents of  those who died or became disabled in  the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote  ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6138 because we  must not break our commitment to  America’s students.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time  ",2006

1790,115,2006-09-27,Mr. PEARCE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of the Esther Martinez Native American Languages Preservation Act of 2006 (H.R. 4766).  I would like to congratulate my colleague from  New Mexico, Mrs. WILSON,  for bringing  this  issue forward.  This is important legislation to preserve the  culture and increase fluency in Native American society. Sadly, all across America, Native  American languages are in rapid decline; estimates are that there may be only 20 Native  American  languages  remaining by  the year  2050. These  languages are unique  to our  country and unique to our history. If we do not  preserve them, they will disappear forever.  This bill will establish a series of grants to  help preserve the language and culture of our  Native American people. This will help create  programs that will teach our young people of  the  importance of  learning  the  language of  their ancestors and continuing to preserve the  history and culture of their people.  Finally,  the  language programs created  in  this bill are  locally based educational programs  that will help both children  learn and  preserve languages in households all across  America.  My constituent Dr. Christine Sims, a professor of language at the University of New  Mexico, and Pueblo of Acoma tribal member  says, ‘‘The future of America’s first languages,  those that are indigenous to this country hang  in the balance of what we do as a Nation to  help tribal communities preserve them. Much  has been given up by countless generations of  Native people in the wake of this country’s expansion and growth into the great nation that  it is today. It is only right and just that Congress  consider  the  tremendous  price  that  America’s first people paid in terms of losing  so much throughout the course of this nation’s  history, including the loss of native languages.  Among America’s Native  language communities  remaining  today,  the hopes and  the  dreams that Native elders, parents and tribes  hold for their children are those which include  the maintenance and  revitalization of  tribal  heritage languages. We can do no less in this  country,  therefore,  than  to ensure  that  tribal  communities have  the opportunity and  the  funding resources  that will help make  these  hopes and dreams for their children a reality.  ‘‘Today’s education for the American Indian  student must open the doors for youngsters to  have more opportunities to learn their own languages as provided in the provisions of H.R.  4766. This bill, so aptly named for one of New  Mexico’s  tribal elders, Mrs. Esther Martinez  from San Juan Pueblo ( who tragically died in  a car accident this past week), would not only  honor  the memory of  this  renowned Native  language advocate and  leader, but as well,  demonstrate the commitment that Congress is  WILSON willing  to make  in support of  the  intent and  purpose of the Native Languages Preservation  Act.’’.  Again, I want to thank my New Mexico colleague, Mrs. WILSON, for bringing this bill forward, her hard work and dedication are a  credit to her and she is a credit to our State.  ",2006
1791,115,2006-09-27,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker,  throughout  the  country, Native American languages are experiencing a rapid decline. Of the nearly 300 native languages of the United States, only 210  are still spoken, and all too often these languages are spoken only among  the elderly.  This  is a particularly  troubling development,  given the importance of Native American languages to tribal identity and culture. As such,  I was pleased that Congresswoman HEATHER  introduced H.R.  4766,  the Native  American Languages Preservation Act, which  would provide  federal support  for programs  that provide language training for young children and  their  families.  I would also  like  to  recognize Chairman BUCKMCKEON for the expedited manner in which he has moved this  legislation.  On August 31st,  I had  the opportunity  to  travel to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to participate in a hearing held by the Education and  the Workforce Committee on  the  ‘‘Recovery  and Preservation of Native American Languages’’. We heard  from  representatives of  several tribes regarding their experiences with  this problem and ways in which they have attempted  to preserve  their native  languages.  Fortunately,  efforts  are  underway  to  save  these languages and to encourage a new generation of Native Americans to keep their languages alive as an  integral part of Native  American culture and identity.  I was particularly pleased that a representative from the Oneida Nation of my home state  of Wisconsin was able to testify at this hearing. The Oneida have made language preservation a priority by pairing Elder native speakers with younger English-speakers to train a  new generation to appreciate and preserve the  traditional language. Since 1996, the Oneida  have developed a Language Revitalization  Program  to connect  their  fluent Elders with  trainees  in a  semi-immersion process  that  would produce speakers, and most  importantly, teachers of the Oneida language.  Although tribes like the Oneida have already  begun to develop programs to preserve their  own  languages, Congress  can  help  other  tribes create programs of their own. H.R. 4766  will provide more options for revitalization programs and take advantage of existing grants  within the Administration for Native Americans  Office. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill  and for the revitalization of native languages.  ",2006

It is in response  to the devastating Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita and the impact they had on  the schools of Louisiana.  More than 1,100 public and private  schools were  forced to close  in the  wake  of  those hurricanes. Approximately 158,000 students were displaced  as a direct result of the hurricanes.  Restoration efforts are under way, but  there is still much work that needs to  be done.  As a result of the storms and the  flooding, the local tax base in several  gulf coast communities was decimated.  The loss of business and government  infrastructure,  jobs and housing deprived school districts of local property  taxes that normally fund school operations.  In Louisiana, Orleans and St. Bernard Parishes were the most severely  impacted by Hurricane Katrina. Currently, approximately 23,000 students  are  enrolled  in  the Orleans Parish  School System and Recovery School  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:29 Nov 18, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00115 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORDCX\T37X$J0E\H27SE6.REC H27SE6 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2006
1799,122,2006-09-27,Mr. HINOJOSA.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of H. Res. 1009, a resolution to  support greater public awareness of effective  runaway youth prevention programs. I would  like to thank the gentleman from Nevada, Mr.  PORTER, for bringing this forward. I am proud  to be a cosponsor.  November is National Runaway Prevention  Month.  I am proud that this body, in a bipartisan  manner, comes  together each year  to commemorate this month and to urge our communities  to get  involved  in runaway prevention  activities.  Runaway Prevention Month is a public education campaign spearheaded by the National  Runaway Switchboard (NRS) and the National  Network  for Youth  (NNY)  to  increase  the  awareness of the issues facing runaways, and  educate the public about the solutions and the  role  they can play  in preventing youth  from  running away.  It is a national tragedy that an estimated 1.6  to 2.8 million young people live on the street  each year. One out of seven children in the  United States runs away  from home before  the age of 18. The dangers these young people face on the streets cannot be overstated.  In my home State of Texas, our runaway  and youth crisis hotlines offer crisis intervention,  telephone counseling, and  referrals  to  troubled youth and families. A volunteer workforce of about 60 people answer the phones.  Many callers face a variety of problems including  family conflict, delinquency,  truancy,  and abuse and neglect issues.  The program  increases public awareness  through television, radio, billboards and other  media efforts. Hotline telephone counselors respond to about 40,000 calls annually.  These people are true heroes because they  save lives.  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act represents our national commitment to protecting  and  improving  the  lives of our most at risk  youth. Sadly, funding for these programs has  been eroded with  the across-the-board cuts  we have been seeing  in our appropriations  bills over the past few years.  I hope  that  this year,  this Congress will  commemorate Runaway Prevention Month by  increasing the resources available to keep our  young  people  safe,  healthy,  and  off  the  streets.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  ",2006

This  resolution  seeks to support the goals and the  ideals of Lights on Afterschool!, a national celebration of after-school programs. This year’s Lights on Afterschool! rally, which takes place on October 12, 2006, is expected to include  more than 7,000 events in the United  States and at military bases around  the world. This event is aimed at bringing attention to the need for high-quality after-school programs  that keep  kids safe, help working families, and  improve academic achievement.  I  support  this  resolution  because  after-school programs are an important  part of many American’s student lives.  High-quality  after-school  programs  provide safe, challenging and fun learning experiences that help children and  youth develop their social, emotional,  physical, cultural and academic skills.  I am pleased that we are able to  bring attention to the critical importance of after-school programs. I commend the communities across the Nation that engage in innovative after-  school programs and activities and ensure that the doors stay open and the  lights stay on  for all children after  school.  This resolution is simple and straight  forward.  It  supports  the  goals  and  ideals of Lights on Afterschool!, a nationwide  celebration  of  after-school  programs.

Working  with  local  government  agencies, he demonstrated his commitment to preserving and enhancing public health by playing a major role in  FDA actions in regulatory matters. He  was widely regarded as one of the most  knowledgeable members  in the regulatory environment and made valuable  and  significant contributions  to  the  FDA office in San Juan.  During his Federal career, he  received numerous awards and honors,  including the Commissioner’s Special  Citation  for  the Tylenol  tampering  case, the FDA Commendable Service  Award  for  outstanding  performance  and dedication during Hurricane David,  and in 1993 for his participation in the  criminal  investigation  called  ‘‘operation golden pill.’’  Mr. Toro was a veteran of the Vietnam War and was awarded the National  Defense Service Medal and the Vietnam Service Medal.  After attending Catholic University  in Puerto Rico, he joined the FDA in  San Juan in 1977. Over the course of his  Federal a career he rose to the rank of  Director of Investigations for the Puerto Rico district of the Food and Drug  Administration. He was beloved by his  fellow workers, who relied on his expertise, knowledge and guidance.  It is both fitting and proper to honor  this extraordinary public servant with  this designation.

1818,136,2006-09-27,Mr. GILCHREST.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 362, the Marine Debris Research, Prevention and Reduction Act, was introduced by Senator  of Hawaii and was passed by  unanimous consent in the Senate in  July last year.  The bill would enhance the Federal  Government’s capabilities to remove  and prevent the creation of marine debris that is derived from ocean-based  activities. Marine debris degrades very  slowly, is highly buoyant and can be  carried thousands of miles by ocean  currents. Marine debris poses significant entanglement  threats  to many  marine  organisms,  including  fish,  crabs, birds and marine mammals and  can  have  serious  consequences  on  human health.  The bill would require the establishment of a Marine Debris Prevention  and Removal Program with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to coordinate that agency’s existing activities and  requirements to reduce the impact of marine  debris on the environment and navigation safety.  The bill also would require the Coast  Guard to implement measures to improve compliance and enforcement of  laws and international agreements regarding the discard of plastics and garbage from vessels.  The bill also amends current law to  reactivate the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee,  rather  than  establish  a  new  interagency  forum, as was proposed in the Senate-  passed bill.  The bill before us today is the result  of extensive consultation between the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Resources. The bill has strong bipartisan  support, and I expect the Senate to act  quickly to send this legislation to the  President.  S. 362 will significantly improve the  Federal Government’s programs to prevent and remove marine debris without  creating unnecessary, duplicative programs.  I urge my colleagues to support the  bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2006
1819,136,2006-09-27,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), the great defender  of our Nation’s coastlines.  ",2006
1820,136,2006-09-27,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my colleague from California for those  very nice remarks.  JIM Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.  362, legislation that will address the serious and overlooked problem of marine debris along our Nation’s shores  and beaches.  Marine debris remains a huge issue in  my home State of New Jersey. It was  not too long ago that the New York  Bight, a 19,000-square-mile area off the  coast of New Jersey and New York, was  known infamously as the ‘‘ocean dumping capital of the world.’’  It has taken years of work to clean  up our oceans and our beaches, and S.  362 will help ensure that we never go  back to where we were.  I  applaud my  colleagues  on  the  Transportation  and  Infrastructure  Committee, especially the chairman,  DONYOUNG, and the ranking member,  OBERSTAR, and Resources Committee chairman, RICHARDPOMBO, and  the ranking member, NICKRAHALL, for  their support in clearing this important  legislation  for the  floor. And I  also  thank my  colleague  from San  Diego and my colleague, the chairman  of  our Subcommittee  on Resources  from Maryland, for helping clear this  important legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I introduced the House  companion version of this bill, H.R.  3692, not only because marine debris is  bad for human health and the environment but also because it can be incredibly harmful to our tourism economy  in New Jersey and across the country.  By building on the recommendations  of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, S. 362 will provide additional coordination to prevent and reduce marine debris through the establishment  of an  interagency coordinating committee. The bill will also strengthen  and enhance specific program activities carried out by NOAA and the U.S.  Coast Guard.  This  legislation will provide additional grant resources to reduce the  volume of marine debris,  track  the  origination and subsequent dispersal of  this  trash, and  stimulate new education strategies to build public awareness of the problem. Marine debris is  an issue that we ignore at our own  peril, and I urge adoption of this legislation to finally establish an effective  and coordinated Federal response to  the problem.  ",2006
1821,136,2006-09-27,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker, I think  everything has been said, and I urge  support for the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of S. 362, the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act.  America’s beaches are littered with garbage  washed ashore. At a  time when more and  more people are enjoying being outdoors,  we’re finding more debris on our coasts that  can pose a serious  threat  to beachgoers,  boaters, and divers.  Congress has already passed many  laws  that attempt to address this issue including the  Clean Water Act, the Act to Prevent Pollution  from Ships,  the Ocean Dumping Act,  the  Driftnet  Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and  Control Act, and the Marine Plastic Pollution  Research and Control Act. Yet  the problem  persists.  LOBIONDO S. 362 attempts to address these issues by  having the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA) undertake various initiatives to reduce and prevent the use and adverse impact of debris on the marine environment including—  Assessing the impact of marine debris found  in the navigable waters of the United States  and our 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone.  Mapping and removing marine debris from  our coastal waters.  Requiring measures to prevent the loss of  fishing gear that can kill fish and marine mammals for years after they are lost from a ship.  Establishing outreach and education programs to help those that live on and along our  waters to understand the impact of marine debris on our environment.  Under  this  legislation,  the Coast Guard  is  required to enforce existing laws and treaties  related to marine pollution and to develop new  regulations on  the disposal of plastics and  fishing gear.  Plastic and other materials that are not biodegradable threaten the health of our oceans.  Therefore, we must find a way to make sure  they don’t get into the water in the first place.  As someone who represents a coastal district,  I  look  forward  to  the day when  I can walk  down the beach without seeing it polluted by  marine debris that has washed ashore.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman  YOUNG, Chairman  and Ranking  Member OBERSTAR for the bipartisan approach  that they took to develop this legislation. This  legislation is another step forward in protecting  the world’s oceans from marine debris.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2006
1822,136,2006-09-27,Mr. GILCHREST.," Mr. Speaker,  I  want to thank my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, especially the  gentleman  from  New  Jersey  (Mr.  PALLONE) for his work on this issue.  To use another term, marine debris is  trash and garbage which is massively  discharged into our oceans. Some of it  is degraded within a few days, others  will last for hundreds if not thousands  of years.  As Mr.  mentioned,  the  Ocean Commission dedicates an entire  chapter to the problems of marine debris. This legislation, with the help of  the staff on the Transportation Committee and the Resources Committee,  will go a long way to solve this problem.  Mr. Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on  the legislation.  ",2006
1823,136,2006-09-27,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in strong support of S. 362, the Marine Debris  Research, Prevention,  and Reduction Act.  This bill has been developed in a very bipartisan manner.  The purpose of this legislation is to help fill  in the gaps between existing maritime pollution laws such as the Act to Prevent Pollution  from Ships. Our oceans are becoming the garbage pit for the world. Each year, tons of marine debris, such as plastics and garbage from  vessels, is discarded into the oceans. It’s killing the animals in our oceans and with it the  oceans themselves.  The coastlines of  islands  in  the middle of  the Pacific Ocean are littered with debris that  washes up including massive fishing nets that  are lost each year.

1824,150,2006-09-27,Mr. SHAYS.," Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of  th1s  legislation,  I  rise  in strong  support of H.R. 5160, the Long Island Sound  Stewardship Act. I recognize the vital role the  Long Island Sound plays in the Fourth Congressional District as well as all of Connecticut.  The Long  Island Sound contributes more  than $5 billion annually to the regional economy and is one of the most populated and visited areas of our country.  In  fact, approximately 10 percent of the American population  lives within the Long Island Sound watershed.  It is a source of livelihood, nourishment, and  recreation for many in Connecticut and elsewhere, and it is critical that we treat it well.  This legislation would authorize $25 million  to  protect  and  preserve  areas  along  the  Sound’s shorelines with significant ecological,  recreational, or educational value. The Long  Island Sound Stewardship Act gives  those  most  familiar with  the Sound’s precious and  diverse resources the tools necessary to continue  their conservation efforts, and applies  the most effective methods available to identify, protect, and enhance sites with ecological,  educational, and  recreation  value  in Connecticut and New York.  Protecting and preserving  the environment  is one of the most important jobs I have as a  Member of Congress. We simply will not have  a world to live in if we continue our neglectful  ways.  The Long Island Sound is our Yellowstone.  I urge passage of this legislation so that we  may continue its conservation and protection.  ",2006
1825,150,2006-09-27,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which will help ensure  that future generations of New Yorkers and all  Americans will enjoy a clean, well-preserved  Long Island Sound.  The Long Island Sound is critically important  to our Nation and vital to the health and well-  being of the communities I represent. As an  Estuary of National Significance,  the Sound  provides habitat for a wide array of plant and  animal life, and contributes an estimated $5.5  billion to the regional economy from boating,  fishing and tourism-related commerce. Boating  and fishing are deeply enmeshed in the culture and  traditions of Long  Island, and  the  Sound has long been our region’s gateway to  the seas.  Unfortunately, the effects of millions of people living adjacent to the Sound’s shore have  been profound. At the turn of the millennium,  lobster catch rates plummeted by 90%, costing our local economy between $30 and $50  million. Dangerous levels of toxins continue to  threaten the well-being of the Sound’s diverse  habitats and wildlife breeding areas, as well as  the livelihoods of those who depend on these  resources for their livelihood.  The Long  Island Sound Stewardship Act  supplements conservation and preservation efforts along the shoreline of Long Island and  Connecticut, and authorizes $25 million in federal appropriations over  the next 4  fiscal  years.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect. I strongly support and will continue  to advocate  for  funding at the original proposed level of $40  million annually. Properly conceived, the legislation should include wetlands and underwater  lands within the authority of the Long Island  Sound Stewardship Initiative, which will be established by  this  legislation. Additionally,  I  strongly support fully funding conservation and  preservation  offshore  via  the  Long  Island  Sound Restoration Act, which has fallen victim  to the Majority’s budget cuts.  The Long Island Sound, however, is a national treasure and I believe that any preservation efforts to conserve any part of the Sound  should be embraced. I do support this legislation and I would like to thank my colleague  from New York, the co-chair of the Long Island Sound Caucus, Mr. ISRAEL, for all of his  efforts to bring this bill to the floor and to preserve the Long Island Sound.

(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act  to direct,  facilitate, and expedite the exchange of certain Federal land and non-Federal land in the State to further the public  interest by—  (1) exchanging Federal land that has limited recreational and conservation resources;  and  (2) acquiring State trust land with important recreational, scenic, and conservation  resources for permanent public management  and use.

1830,157,2006-09-27,Mr. PEARCE.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 4750, sponsored  by Congressman Tom Osborne, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to  study the feasibility of a water supply  and conservation project in the Republican River Basin.  This legislation would enact into law  one  requirement  of  the Republican  River Compact Settlement negotiated  between the States of Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado, and approved by the  United States Supreme Court in 2003.  The feasibility study would help clarify the opportunities to increase water  storage in the river basin, and is needed to increase water availability and  encourage more efficient water use.  I urge my colleagues to support this  needed legislation.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2006

1833,157,2006-09-27,Mr. OSBORNE.," Madam Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from New Mexico  for yielding me time and bringing this  forward,  and  for  the  rapidity with  which we are moving through the bills  tonight. We are  sorry  to  slow you  down. But the gentleman from Kansas  (Mr. MORAN) and I would like to say a  few words about this bill. He was a co-  author with me.  As you mentioned, H.R. 4750  is a  study as to how to more efficiently utilize water between Harlan County Dam  in Nebraska and Milford Reservoir in  Kansas. The reason this is so important  is  that Nebraska  and Kansas  signed a compact in 2002, which means  that a lot of Nebraska water goes down  the Republican River into Kansas, and  Nebraska so far has been short. We are  100,000 acre feet short, as a matter of  fact, over the last 3 years.  And this has been exacerbated by an  extreme drought which we have had for  the last 6 years. So this water shortage  has made for a very critical situation.  So if we can, through this study, allocate water more effectively, save some  water, it will help farmers, ranchers,  municipalities both  in Nebraska and  Kansas.  We want to thank you. We want to  thank Mr. POMBO and the resources  staff  for bringing  forth this bill on  short notice. We think it is very important. We urge its passage. We appreciation the cooperation on both sides of  the aisle on this bill.  ",2006

1835,157,2006-09-27,Mr. MORAN  of  Kansas.," Madam  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  New Mexico.  I also thank the gentleman from Wisconsin this evening for  being here in support of H.R. 4750. As  has been indicated, this is a very important  issue  for many  in both the  State of Nebraska and the State of  Kansas. I particularly want to express  my appreciation to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. OSBORNE) and really the  cooperation that has existed on very  difficult issues between the State of  Nebraska and the State of Kansas.  Water is a huge issue in the midwest.  It always has been, probably always  will be. But it is especially exacerbated  by the fact of inadequate rainfall for  now, four, five and six years in much of  Kansas and much of Nebraska.  An agreement was reached, compact  litigation ensued. Ultimately a settlement of that litigation was reached.  And that settlement provides for the  State of Nebraska and the State of  Kansas to come together, provide some  money, share with the Federal Government.  The Department of  Interior would  then conduct a study. The State of  Kansas, and I believe the State of Nebraska has appropriated this money for  the fiscal year. That is why this legislation is so important to be timely considered and timely approved. All that  now remains is for the Federal Government to meet its obligation under the  settlement agreement.  The feasibility study is desperately  needed  to  increase  the water availability to find out how we do that, and  to encourage its efficient use and conservation within our delivery system.  Madam Speaker, the feasibility study  authorized by 4750  is not only necessary to ensure the State remains in  compliance with that agreement, but  to make certain that the economic, agriculture and personal use of water is  done in a very efficient and effective  way.  I urge Members of Congress to approve this legislation.  ",2006
1836,157,2006-09-27,Mr. PEARCE.," Madam Speaker,  I  would remind the Members that this is  a very bipartisan bill, everything being  bipartisan except the name of the river  basin being studied. I would urge passage.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.  ",2006

Madam Speaker, H.R. 4876 settles a  lawsuit between the Jicarilla Apache  tribe and the county of Rio Arriba in  the State of New Mexico. In 1987, the  tribe challenged the validity of a county road located on land owned by the  Apache tribe.

Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Wisconsin.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge  the passage of S. 213, the Rio Arriba  County Land Conveyance Act. S. 213  will  convey  to  the County  of Rio  Arriba approximately 171 acres of Bureau of Land Management land. The  county intends to use this land for a  new public school, county facilities and  a cemetery for the local parish.  Rio Arriba County in northern New  Mexico is a vast, beautiful county with  significant amounts of Federal  land.  The growing population of Rio Arriba  has led to an increased demand for public services but no municipal lands on  which to site them.  Under most circumstances, this sort  of transfer would be conducted administratively under the provisions of the  Recreation and Public Purposes Act  and authorizing legislation would not  be required. This bill is before us today  only because these lands are located on  the Sebastian Martin Land Grant and  were acquired by the Federal Government under the Bankhead-Jones Act.  The Recreation and Public Lands Act  does not apply to acquired lands, but  the legislation is in keeping with provisions of that act.  The Rio Arriba County Manager,  Lorenzo Valdez, and members of the  Rio Arriba Board of County Supervisors worked hard on this and diligently. School Board Chairman Joe  Guillen and School Board members  Leroy Salazar, Ralph Medina and Isaac  Medina worked tirelessly to raise the  money necessary to construct the new  school.  Father Terry Brennan, the Pastor of  San Juan Pueblo Parish, helped on this  effort in order to ensure that his parish  would have the land necessary for a  cemetery.

1871,185,2006-09-27,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, it is, indeed, a privilege to be here this morning to personally hear the words of our  good friend, Senator JEFFORDS, and to  hear other Senators get up and talk  about JIMin such glowing terms.  However,  I must say that all the  years I have known JIMJEFFORDS, he is  an old-fashioned New Englander, which  means he is very modest. That means  he is embarrassed to receive this kind  of praise and adulation. Senator JEFFORDSwill just have to endure it because we love you, we respect you, we  admire you, and you are one of the  most beloved Members of the Senate.  Thirty-two years ago, we came together in the House. You talked about  that. Our colleague, CHRISDODD, was in  that class, and also my colleague from  Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY. I didn’t know  Senator JEFFORDSat that time, obviously. We had just come in as freshmen  Members. I found myself on the Committee on Agriculture with Senator  JEFFORDS. We both sat down at the  end. He was on one side and I was on  the other side because we were just  freshmen.  We had a farm bill coming up. After  a few weeks on the Agriculture Committee, we dubbed Senator JEFFORDS  ‘‘the Senator from Dairy.’’ He was tenacious in fighting for his dairy farmers of Vermont and, of course, New  England. Those  from Iowa and Minnesota and Wisconsin—we had dairy  farmers, too, and there was, shall I say,  a little bit of a conflict in how we  viewed the world of milk and dairy.  That was my first experience with Senator JEFFORDSbecause we had to work  things out. And we did. That was the  first time I got to see the kind of peris and always has  been. He was tenacious in fighting for  his dairy farmers but willing to understand that we all have to live together;  somehow we have to seek our compromises. And we did. We reached a  compromise and we moved the legislation forward. That was the first time I  came to really know and respect JIM  son JIM JEFFORDS JEFFORDS.  As we moved ahead in agriculture, I  found another area in which I respected  and admired Senator JEFFORDS. That  was the area of environment and conservation. In those days, people were  thinking mostly about all the commodity programs, how much money we  could get in the commodity programs.  We were all protecting our interests. I  was protecting my Iowa interests and  Senator JEFFORDSwas protecting his  Vermont interests.  However,  conservation  transcended  everything. That began back  in the  late 1970s,  in the House Agriculture  Committee. We began the move toward  more conservation in our farm bills,  which led to more of a ‘‘greening’’ of  America. He did that work also on Environment and Public Works. When I  think about the environment, cleaning  up  the  environment—clean  water,  clean lakes, clean streams—I have to  think of JIMJEFFORDS. He was there at  the beginning.  Then in 1975, on the Committee on  Education, JIM JEFFORDS coauthored  what later became the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act. I was not  on the Committee on Education, but  because of my family and because of  my  intense  interest  in  disability  rights, especially as it pertained to the  hard-of-hearing and the deaf, I learned  about this bill with JIMJEFFORDSand  with Paul Simon—at that time, Senator Simon—and sort of stuck my nose  in their business, if you don’t mind my  saying that, because I was not on the  committee. I talked about how we had  to help do some of these things. My  focus was narrow at that time, just in  hard-of-hearing and deafness at that  time. My great  respect  for Senator  JEFFORDS, or JIM, at that time grew because he was focused on how we make  sure every kid in America gets an education, make sure kids with disabilities were mainstream, make sure they  got the support in our schools.  It was Senator JEFFORDSwho made  sure that in the bill we passed, the Federal Government committed itself to  providing at least 40 percent of the additional costs to States and local communities in educating kids with disabilities. Forty percent was the goal  we set in the bill Senator JEFFORDScoauthored in 1975.  That moves me up to the year 2001. In  the year 2001, the budget came from  the White House, President Bush’s  budget, which  severely  underfunded  our commitment to increasing funding.  We have never reached 40 percent. I  think the highest we have been is 18  percent. We have never gotten the 40  percent. Senator JEFFORDSwanted to  move that up. Yet the budget came  down and had a severe cut in the funding for the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act. That is when Senator  JEFFORDS said no, he wanted to make  sure that money was in there. That  happened, mostly, on the Republican  side of the aisle. I was not privy to all  of that. That  is when Senator JEFFORDSmade his declaration of  independence. A matter of conscience—he  could not turn his back on all these  years of moving our society forward to  educating kids with disabilities in our  schools and then all of a sudden say:  No, we are going to turn the clock  back; we are not going to do it. He  wanted to keep moving forward. The  budget would not allow it; he fought  hard for it. Based upon the fact that  the administration would not move on  that, he declared his independence and  became an  Independent and  left his  party. We can all imagine how wrenching that must be, to leave the party  that nurtured us, that we grew up with,  that supported us all our adult life. It  is a matter of conscience. You can read  about it in his book, ‘‘My Declaration  of Independence.’’  After that, I  invited Senator JEFto come out to speak at the  steak fry I have in Iowa every year. It  was after the book came out. I will  never forget the scene. We had thousands of people.  It was a beautiful  sunny Sunday afternoon. Thousands of  people came to meet this person, to  hear him and to hear his message.  They had all these little books they  were waiving, ‘‘My Declaration of Independence.’’  He had a wonderful message. His  message was: don’t ever turn our back  on making sure every child in America  has a decent education. It was a simple, straightforward message. But you  should read his book.  Senator KENNEDYmentioned another  thing about Senator JEFFORDSthat not  too many people know about; that is,  his support for a program called ‘‘Everybody Wins.’’ He brought it here to  Washington in the late 1990s and then  began badgering us to participate in it  in his usual tenacious manner. So he  got a lot of us hooked on it.  It is every Tuesday. I see Senator  goes about every Tuesday;  JIM, of course, goes all the time; I go  KENNEDY FORDS VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:11 Sep 28, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G27SE6.010 S27SEPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

1874,199,2006-09-27,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, for 5 years  we have been a nation at war. It is a  war unlike any we have ever before  fought. It is an ideological war against  radicals and zealots. We are fighting a  different kind of enemy—an enemy who  seeks to destroy our values, to destroy  our freedom, and to destroy our way of  life, people who will kill and who will  actually  stop  at  nothing  to  bring  America  to  its knees.  It  is a war  against  an  enemy who won’t  back  down, ever, telling interrogators: I will  never forget your face. I will kill you.  I will kill your brothers, your mother,  your sisters. It  is a war against an  enemy who undertakes years of psychological training to consciously resist interrogation and to withhold information  that could be critical  to  thwarting  future  threats,  future attacks. But it is also a physical war. On  the field of battle, it is a war that demands quick thinking and creativity.  It demands  tactics  that  entice  the  enemy to reveal his weaknesses.  As we learned 5 years ago, safety and  security aren’t static states; they are  dynamic,  constantly  shifting,  constantly moving. We consistently and  repeatedly have to be able to adjust  and take stock and reassess and, when  necessary,  implement changes  in response.  In the past 5 years alone, in this body  we have passed more than 70 laws and  other bills related to the war on terror,  but they haven’t been enough. They  haven’t kept pace with the ever-changing field of battle. There is more we  can do and, indeed, we must do. That is  why over the last month we have focused the Senate agenda on security,  and that is why today we address our  Nation’s security by debating one of  the most serious and most urgent security issues currently facing the Nation:  the detainment, questioning, and prosecution of enemy combatants—terrorists captured on the battlefield.  A few weeks ago, I traveled with several of my colleagues to Guantanamo  Bay. That is where the mastermind of  9/11 currently resides—Khalid Shaikh  Mohammed. This man, the man the 9/11  Commission calls the principal architect behind the 9/11 attacks, didn’t stop  with 9/11. Not 1 month after 9/11, he was  busy again plotting and planning, orchestrating, scheming, and conspiring  to strike us again while we were still  down. His next plot targeted the tallest  buildings on the west coast with hijacked planes, buildings  that house  businesses  and  organizations  absolutely critical to our economic and our  financial stability,  including the Library Tower in Los Angeles, CA. But  this time, we were ready. We thwarted  that plot, and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed now resides at Guantanamo. But  he  wouldn’t  reside  there  and  we  wouldn’t have stymied his evil designs  at that Library Tower if not for the  ability to question detainees.  Soon after 9/11, we detained an al-  Qaida  operative  known  as  Abu  Zubaydah. Under questioning, he yielded several operational  leads. He revealed Shaikh Mohammed’s role in the  9/11  attacks.  Coupled  with  other  sources, the information he gave up led  to Shaikh Mohammed’s capture and detainment. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  currently  awaits  prosecution.  That  prosecution cannot happen until we  act. Our great Nation will know no justice—and his  victims’  families will  know no justice—until Congress acts  by  passing  legislation  to  establish  these military commissions.  Before we recess this week, we will  complete this bill. We could complete  it possibly today but  if not,  in the  morning. The bill itself provides a legislative framework to detain, question,  and prosecute terrorists. It reflects the  agreement reached last week: Republicans united around the common goal  of bringing terrorists to justice. It preserves our  intelligence programs—intelligence  programs  that  have  disrupted terrorist plots and saved countless American lives.  When we capture terrorists on the  battlefield, we have a right to prosecute them for war crimes. This bill establishes a system that protects our  national security while ensuring a full  and fair trial for detainees. The bill  formally establishes terrorist tribunals  to prosecute terrorists engaged in hostilities against the United States for  war crimes. Terrorist detainees will be  tried by a 5- or 12-member military  commission overseen by a military  judge. They will have the right to be  presumed innocent until proven guilty,  the right to military and civilian counsel, the right to present exculpatory  evidence, the right to exclude evidence  obtained through torture, and the right  to appeal.  The bill also protects classified information—our critical sources and methods—from terrorists who could exploit  it to plan another terrorist attack. It  provides a national security privilege  that can be asserted at trial to prevent  the introduction of classified evidence.  But the accused can be provided a declassified summary of that evidence.  Moreover, the bill provides legal clarity for our treaty obligations under the  Geneva Conventions. It establishes a  specific list of crimes that are considered grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.  Ultimately, these procedures recognize that because we are at war, we  should not try terrorists in the same  way as our uniformed military or common civilian criminals. We must remember that we are  fighting a different kind of enemy  in a different  kind of war. We are fighting an enemy  who seeks to destroy our values, our  freedoms, and our very way of life.  To win this war, we must provide our  military, intelligence, and law enforcement communities the tools they need  to keep us safe. By  formally establishing terrorist tribunals, the bill provides another critical tool in fighting  the war on terror, and it provides a  measure of justice to the victims of 9/  11.  Until Congress passes this  legislation, terrorists such as Khalid Shaikh  Mohammed cannot be tried  for war  crimes, and the United States risks  fighting a blind war without adequate  intelligence to keep us safe. That is  simply unacceptable, and that is why  this bill must be passed.  I  look  forward over the next  few  hours to an open and civilized debate in  the best traditions of the Senate. I  urge my colleagues—Republican, Democrat, and Independent alike—to work  together to pass this bill. The American people can’t afford to wait. Even  though we are in the midst of an election year, this issue—the safety and security of the American people—should  transcend partisan politics. The time  to act is now.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",2006

1877,199,2006-09-27,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, first let  me  begin  by  commending  our  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee,  Senator  Senator  MCCAIN, and Senator GRAHAM, for their  effort earlier this month to produce a  military  commissions bill  that will  protect our troops, withstand judicial  review, and be consistent with American  values. The  administration  of  their own party had prepared a bill  that would authorize violations of our  obligations under  international  law,  permit the abusive treatment of prisoners, and allow criminal convictions  based on secret evidence. The three  Senators drafted a different bill,  in  consultation with our senior military  lawyers. When the administration objected to this bill, Senator WARNER  scheduled a markup  in  the Senate  Armed Services Committee anyway,  and we reported that bill out with a bipartisan vote of 15 to 9.  Unlike the administration bill, the  committee bill would not have allowed  convictions based on secret testimony  that is never revealed to the accused.  The committee bill would not have allowed  testimony  obtained  through  cruel or inhuman treatment. The committee bill would not have allowed the  use of hearsay where a better source of  evidence is readily available. The committee bill would not have attempted  to reinterpret our obligations under  international law to permit the abuse  of detainees in U.S. custody.

1879,206,2006-09-27,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I was  particularly taken by Senator LEVIN’s  reference to General Washington and  what General Washington said with regard  to prisoners. But we must be  mindful that General Washington was  facing the King’s Army. Those were  uniformed individuals. Those were individuals  acting  on  behalf  of  the  Crown. That  is totally different—totally different—from what we as a nation and many other nations today are  facing with these terrorists.  Consequently, as a part of the evolution of this extraordinary proliferation of terrorism across the world has  come the definitions and terms relating to the unlawful enemy combatant—  I repeat, unlawful—because those individuals are not wearing uniforms, they  are not following any code of laws or  conduct  that has overseen much of  warfare in the history of the world.  They are not affiliated with any state.  They are driven, in my judgment, by  convictions, much of it religious convictions which are totally antithetical  to their own religion, and willing to  sacrifice their own lives to foster their  ambitions and goals.  We expanded this definition of ‘‘unlawful  enemy  combatant’’ when we  went from the committee bill to a bill  that was worked on by, again, Senator  MCCAIN, Senator GRAHAM, and myself,  and  in conjunction with  the White  House and our leadership and other colleagues.  It was pointed out to us that perhaps  our bill is drawn so narrowly that we  would not be able to get evidence and  support convictions from those who are  involved in hiding in the safe houses,  wherever they are in the world, including here in the United States.  It is wrong to say that this provision  captures any U.S. citizens. It does not.  It is only directed at aliens—aliens, not  U.S. citizens—bomb-makers, wherever  they are in the world; those who provide the money to carry out the terrorism, wherever they are—again, only  aliens and those who are preparing and  using so many false documents.  There were a lot of categories which  we, with the best of intentions, perhaps  did not fully comprehend when we were  working through that markup session.  So at this time, I yield the floor because I see my distinguished colleague  from South Carolina. I thank the Senator. He is recognized for his knowledge as an officer in the U.S. Air Force,  a colonel who has practiced and studied  military law for many years, and we  are fortunate to have had his services  and continue to have them in addressing this legislation.  I would also point out to my colleagues  that Senator MCCAIN, who  worked with us throughout this process, is away attending a funeral of a  very dear and valued colleague, and he  will be returning later this afternoon  and will be fully engaged from that  point on.  I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  yields time?  ",2006

1881,206,2006-09-27,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I would  like to return the compliment that  Senator LEVINgave to myself, Senator  MCCAIN, and Senator WARNER. I have  found Senator LEVINand his staff to be  very good to work with. Sometimes we  reach agreement and  sometimes we  don’t, but all the time we try. As to my  staff, I appreciate the tons of time they  have spent trying to give us the best  product we can get in the legislative  process that will adhere to our values  and allow the war effort to move forward in an effective way.

1899,220,2006-09-27,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, substantively, my amendment would retain the constitutional right of habeas  corpus for people detained at Guantanamo. The bill before the Senate strips  the Federal district court of jurisdiction to hear these cases. The right of  habeas corpus was established in the  Magna Carta in 1215 when, in England,  there was action taken against King  John to establish a procedure to prevent illegal detention.  What the bill seeks to do is to set  back basic rights by some 900 years.  This amendment would strike that provision and make certain that the constitutional  right  and  the  statutory  right—but fundamentally the constitutional right of habeas corpus—is maintained. The core provision is contained  in article I, section 9, clause 2 of the  U.S. Constitution, which states:  The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus  shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases  of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety  may require it.  We do not have either rebellion or invasion, so it is a little hard for me to  see, as a basic principle of constitutional law, how the Congress can suspend the writ of habeas corpus in the  face of that flat language. When you  have an issue of constitutionality, how  can  constitutionality be determined  and interpreted except in the Court?  We had a very extended discussion of  this in the confirmation of Chief Justice Rehnquist, and the Chief Justice  said that the Congress of the United  States lacked the authority to remove  the jurisdiction of the Federal courts  on  issues  involving the  first amendment.  The  same  thing would apply generally. It is a constitutional question.  But here you have it buttressed in addition by an express provision by the  Framers, focusing on the writ of habeas corpus in and of itself, and saying  you can’t suspend it, so that anyone  who  can make an argument about  stripping jurisdiction—I don’t think it  lies on a constitutional issue generally  because if it does, who is going to interpret the Constitution if the Court  does not have  jurisdiction? But the  writ of habeas corpus is so important  and so fundamental and so deeply ingrained in our tradition, going back to  1215 against King John, that the Framers made it expressed and explicit.  It appears to me that this is really  dispositive and you don’t really need  several hours to develop it. But I shall  proceed on the matter as to how we got  where we are and what the Supreme  Court has had to say in four major  cases  in  the  course of  the  last  18  months.  The Congress of the United States  has the express responsibility under article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution to establish rules governing people  captured on land and sea. But the Congress of the United States did not act  after 9/11, and we had people detained  at Guantanamo. Legislation was introduced by many Senators. Senator DURand I introduced a bill. Senator  introduced a bill. Many Senators  introduced  legislation, but the  Congress did not act on it. Congress did  not act on it because it was too hot to  handle. What resulted is what results  many times—Congress punted. It didn’t  BIN LEAHY act, left it to the Supreme Court of the  United States. That took a long time,  to have these cases come through the  judicial process.  Finally, in June of 2005 the Supreme  Court  ruled  in  three major  cases:  Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Rasul v. Bush, and  Rumsfeld  v. Padilla. The  Supreme  Court of the United States rejected the  argument of the Government that the  President had inherent power under article 2 and could act on that constitutional  authority,  and  the Supreme  Court said that habeas corpus was effective.  In Rasul v. Bush, the Supreme Court  said that it applied even to aliens. It  didn’t have to be a citizen; that the  Constitution draws no distinction between Americans and aliens held  in  custody and said the writ of habeas  corpus applied.  In the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,  Justice O’Connor had this to say: All  agree that absent suspension, the writ  of habeas corpus remains available to  every  individual detained within the  United States.  That was held to apply to Guantanamo, since the United States controlled Guantanamo.  Justice O’Connor went on to say that  under the U.S. Constitution, article I,  section 9, clause 2:  The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus  shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases  of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety  may require it.  Justice O’Connor then goes on to delineate statute 2241, which sets the outline of the procedures, and then says  habeas  petitioners would  have  the  same opportunity to present and rebut  facts that court cases like this retain  some ability to vary the ways in which  they do so as mandated by due process.  What has happened in Guantanamo  with respect to the proceedings under  the Combat Status Review Tribunal,  referred to as CSRT, demonstrates the  importance of having some impartial  judicial review to find what, in fact,  has happened. These tribunals operate  with very little information. Somebody  is picked up on the battlefield. There is  no record preserved as to what that individual did. If there was a weapon involved, it has been placed with many  other weapons, and it can’t be identified. The proceedings simply do not  comport with basic  fairness because  the individuals do not have the right to  know what evidence there is against  them.  Repeatedly, the Combat Status Review Tribunal said the information is  classified and the individual can’t have  it.  There was specific reference to the  proceedings in the CSRT in the case action  en  re:  Guantanamo  Detainee  Cases, 355 Fed. Sup. Section 443, 2005.  The U.S. District Court for the District  of Columbia criticized the way CSRTs  required detainees to answer allegations based on information that cannot  be  disclosed  to  the  detainees. The  Court described what might be referred  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:11 Sep 28, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G27SE6.096 S27SEPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006
1900,234,2006-09-27,Mr. COLEMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to discuss the Secure Fence Act  of 2006 and the issue of securing our  northern border. Without question, securing the border  is our most vital  need in dealing with illegal immigrants  and as it stands, our borders lay vulnerable to not only an influx of illegal  immigrants but also transportation of  dangerous materials. The  facts  are  clear—each year over 1 million unauthorized aliens are interdicted entering  the country mostly on the southwest  border. Testimony by the Border Patrol union chief places the estimate of  illegal entrants not interdicted by Border Patrol to be two times those actually caught. Simply put, the Border  Patrol  is overwhelmed by the sheer  volume of the traffic and it is time to  take action.  The Secure Fence Act of 2006 requires  the Secretary of Homeland Security to  take all appropriate actions to achieve  operational control over all U.S. international  land and maritime borders  within 18 months of its enactment. Additionally, the bill authorizes 700 miles  of double-layered fencing at specified  locations along the almost 2,000-mile  southwest U.S.  international  border  with Mexico.  This bill also takes the right approach in terms of northern border security. The legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a study on the feasibility of a  state of-the-art infrastructure security  system  along  the  northern  international land and maritime border of  the United States. The study shall include the necessity of  implementing  such a system, the feasibility of implementing such a system and the economic  impact  implementing  such a  system will have along the northern  border.  In my home state of Minnesota, we  share 547 miles of border with Canada  and 458 of those miles are a water  boundary. I want to make it clear to  my  constituents  and  our Canadian  friends that this legislation should not  be used to  justify construction of a  wall along the northern border but to  take an inventory of the systems that  are working and not working and ensure that we put in place the most effective  approach. We  are  going  to  measure twice before building once.  The United States and Canada share  a long history of working together on  issues of mutual concern. Both countries share a common border and common objectives: to ensure that the border is open for business, but closed to  crime.  The  Canada-United  States  Smart Border Declaration and Action  Plan and programs such as the Security and Prosperity Partnership and  the  Integrated Border Enforcement  Teams are great examples of cooperative initiatives that have proven successful.  I am fully confident this strong relationship and commitment to border security will continue as it is one of the  cornerstones to securing our northern  border.  f  NATIONAL EMPLOY OLDER  WORKERS WEEK  ",2006
1901,234,2006-09-27,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to recognize National Employ  Older Workers Week, a time to celebrate the many older workers who are  redefining retirement and the employers that welcome their talents.  Many older Americans do not see retirement as just a period of leisure;  they continue to contribute to our nation’s  businesses,  communities,  and  economy. And some employers, facing  a shortage of skilled and experienced  workers, have recognized the value of  older workers by changing their policies to attract and retain them.  One of  those  employers  is Mercy  Health System, which is based in Wisconsin and has 63 health care facilities  across Wisconsin and Illinois. AARP  recently ranked Mercy Health System  the top employer for older workers in  the country. Mercy Health System attracts and retains older workers by  providing  flexible work options,  like  its Work-to-Retire Program, which offers reduced and seasonal work schedules while maintaining health benefits.  Yet too few employers have followed  Mercy Health System’s lead in creating  better work options for older Americans. While most older workers want to  work past traditional retirement age,  many do not want to work a traditional full-time schedule. Today, only  about one-third of older workers have  flexible work schedules. Even when employers offer flexible work options like  part-time work schedules, most do not  also offer benefits: only 22 percent of  part-time  workers  have  access  to  health benefits.  So while older workers and some employers have begun to reinvent retirement, we have a long way to go. That  is why I authored the Older Worker Opportunity Act, which aims to expand  opportunities for older Americans to  work longer if they so choose. The centerpiece of this  legislation  is a tax  credit for employers that offer flexible,  reduced, or seasonal work schedules to  older workers while maintaining their  health and pension benefits. Such a  credit would  reward  employers  like  Mercy Health System who are doing  the  right  thing, while  encouraging  other employers to follow their lead.  Greater workplace  flexibility would  not only benefit older Americans, but  would also reduce employer costs by  increasing productivity and job retention.  Just this week, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and  Medicare endorsed the Older Worker  Opportunity Act. In its letter of support, president and CEO Barbara Kennelly offered that the bill ‘‘could help  pave the way for significant increases  in older worker employment.’’ I agree,  and I am proud to have them join our  other  supporters,  including  the National Council on Aging, the National  Older Worker Career Center, Watson  Wyatt Worldwide, the Committee for  Economic Development, the Association of Jewish Family and Children’s  Agencies, and United Jewish Communities. With their backing, this bill will  continue to gain steam.  During National Employ Older Workers Week, we also celebrate the Senior  Community Service Employment Program—SCSEP—which  has  provided  community service and job training to  low-income seniors for 40 years. As our  baby boomers age and seniors become a  growing share of the population, we  must strengthen SCSEP so that all eligible seniors get the help they need.  Many of us were concerned when the  Administration proposed a major overhaul of this program, which would have  been disruptive to both grantees and  participants.  I am hopeful  that  the  Older Americans Act reauthorization  bill will preserve the basic structure of  the program and build on its success.  I urge Congress to pass the OAA reauthorization as soon as possible so  that seniors in need of SCSEP services  have the tools to stay active in the  workforce and their communities. But  beyond reauthorization, we must also  boost SCSEP’s funding, which is currently only enough to serve less than  one percent of the eligible population.  As a member of the Appropriations  Committee, I will continue to press for  additional  funding so that all older  Americans who want or need to work  longer have the opportunity to do so.  As older Americans live longer and  healthier lives, most have the ability  and desire to remain active. Some want  to maintain  physical  and mental  health, some need to improve their financial security, and some want to  continue  to  contribute  to  society.  Whatever  the  reason,  it’s  time  to  change the way we think about retirement. Older Americans are a valuable  asset to our nation’s businesses, communities, and economy, and we must  tap their reservoir of experience and  talents. Our seniors deserve it, and our  economic future may well depend on it.  f  CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES  IMPROVEMENT ACT  ",2006

As the oldest continuing volunteer  club in Brule County, GFWC Travelers  Club has been a  leader  in providing  funding and assistance  in numerous  areas. They have  been  involved  in  founding and supporting libraries, both  locally and nationally, granting educational scholarships, helping to maintain Ellsworth Air Force Base in South  Dakota and many other valuable and  necessary community projects.  It gives me great pleasure to rise and  recognize the great work that GFWC  Travelers Club has done and to wish  them all the best of luck as they celebrate their 100th anniversary.∑  f  RECOGNIZING THE CUSTER  SENIOR CENTER  ∑",2006
1904,241,2006-09-27,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, today I  recognize the Custer Senior Center of  Custer, SD, on  its 35th anniversary.  Custer Senior Center  truly deserves  this recognition for its years of service  to the seniors of Custer and of South  Dakota.  The Custer Senior Center first began  when VISTA  volunteers Peggy  and  David Viers placed an advertisement in  the Custer Chronicle asking those interested in starting a community senior center to meet at the Community  Church on April 6, 1970. The citizens of  Custer came together and the Senior  Center officially opened in May of 1970  with 52 charter members.  Since this time, the Custer Senior  Center has provided an invaluable community  service  by  creating  a welcoming place for Custer’s senior citizens to meet together for fellowship  and support. I am confident that the  Senior Center will continue to bring  together Custer’s citizens of all ages in  the years to come.  I would like to offer my congratulations to the Custer Senior Center on  their 35th anniversary and wish them  the best of luck as they celebrate this  important event.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE  At 9:33 a.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees to the  report of the committee of conference  on the disagreeing votes of the two  Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 5631) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes.

1905,248,2006-09-27,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, to help  start-up small businesses obtain access  to capital, today I rise with my colleague Senator KERRYto introduce the  Access  to Capital  for Entrepreneurs  Act of 2006 or ACE Act. Our bill would  encourage equity investments in qualified small businesses by providing so-  called ‘‘angel investors’’ with a tax incentive to fund new small business enterprises. Angel investors are high-net-  worth  individuals who  invest  in and  support start-up companies in the critical early stages of growth.  As Chair of the Senate Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I  meet with prospective entrepreneurs in  Maine and across the country and repeatedly hear about their dreams of  starting dynamic new businesses. Unfortunately, their hopes can sometimes  be dashed when these entrepreneurs encounter barriers to raising the funds  they need to get their ‘‘start-up’’ enterprises off the ground.  For entrepreneurs and other aspiring  small business owners, a self-evident  truth since the founding of our country  is that it takes money to make money.  Our legislation makes that goal a little  easier for aspiring small business owners by ensuring that our entrepreneurs  have access  to venture capital and  credit markets so they can continue to  drive America’s economic growth and  job creation. Since small businesses  represent 99 percent of all employers  and create nearly 75 percent of all net  new jobs, Congress must do everything  within its power to help them grow and  thrive.  Under the Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs Act of 2006, angel investors  would be eligible for a 25 percent tax  credit to offset up to $500,000 of investments per year. Because the legislation  limits the investment per small business to $250,000, which is the amount a  typical entrepreneur requires to begin  operations, an investor would have to  invest in at least two companies to receive the full $500,000 tax credit. To  qualify for the tax incentive, the angel  investor must  have  an  income  of  $200,000 over a two-year period, or net  worth of $1 million. It’s patterned after  successful tax credits that have been  enacted in 21 states, including Maine.  Recent research shows that venture  capitalists are now targeting their investments for larger businesses or for  later in a business’s development, leaving precious little seed money for new  ventures. Today, venture capitalists invest an average of $7 million per deal,  an amount that far exceeds the needs  of a nascent small business. Moreover,  in 2005, of the $21.7 billion invested by  venture capitalists, just 3.3 percent was  allocated to start-up small businesses.  There were  227,000 angel  investors  who were active in 2005. Yet there are  hundreds of thousands more waiting to  be created. IRS statistics show that  the ratio of potential to active angel  investors is between 7 to 1 and 10 to 1.  There is an enormous untapped market  of future investors who we can call to  help finance emerging small businesses  in virtually every sector of the economy.  Our bill would remedy this situation  by encouraging more angel investors to  fund more of our Nation’s  smallest  businesses. These businesses are critical to the economy, as they generate  60 percent to 80 percent of net new jobs  and contribute more than 50 percent of  non-farm private-sector output.  In addition, if the provisions of the  ACE Act are signed  into  law, many  small businesses that would otherwise  fail  for  lack of adequate  resources  could grow and expand, creating more  jobs  for Americans, and  further bolstering our Nation’s economy. With no  incentive,  angel  investments helped  create 198,000 jobs in the United States  during 2005. Imagine how many more  jobs we could create if we enact the tax  credit we are proposing today.  I am committed to supporting our  Nation’s small business community by  increasing its access to capital. The entrepreneurial spirit of our 25 million  small businesses dates back to our Nation’s founding. From family farms to  software development, small businesses  are the heart of our economy and the  linchpin for the innovation that moves  our country forward. Americans who  assume the risks and responsibilities  inherent  in owning and operating a  business deserve our praise, admiration  and unwavering support.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 3950  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

1906,262,2006-09-27,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to introduce the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and  Safety Act of 2006. I am joined by my  colleagues  from  the  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation  Committee, Senators  and  INOUYE, LOTT LAUTENBERG.  Pipelines are one of the safest forms  of transportation, and in most cases  their safety record has been steadily  improving. Unfortunately however, as  recent  events  in my  State  demonstrate, there is still much to be done.  This bill addresses the problems that  have occurred in Alaska and other safety issues that have been brought to the  Committee’s attention.  The bill  reauthorizes  the pipeline  safety programs of the Pipeline and  Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) for Fiscal Years 2007  through 2010.  Highlights of the bill include:  Increased Department of Transportation Resources Dedicated to Overseeing Pipeline Safety—The bill provides an additional 45 Federal inspectors (a 50 percent increase) over the 4  years of the bill at a cost of $6 million  in Fiscal Year 2010. Currently PHMSA  has 90 inspectors, but the DOT Inspector General has stated in the past that  these relatively low staffing levels are  a matter for concern. Ninety inspectors  translate to one  inspector  for every  18,000 miles of pipeline in this country.  Strengtened  Programs  to Reduce  Construction Related Damage to Pipelines—The bill includes new civil enforcement  authority  against  excavators and pipeline operators responsible for third-party damage incidents  and provides grants to states that have  damage prevention programs in place.  Construction related damage, such as  damage caused by excavation  for a  highway project, is the greatest cause  of pipeline accidents  that  result  in  death or injury. This occurs most often  on the distribution systems that run  through the neighborhoods where people live and work. These incidents have  increased by 49 percent since 1996.  Applying DOT Safety Standards to  the Currently Unregulated Low Stress  Pipelines—On August 31, the DOT announced proposed rules to cover low  stress pipelines in unusually sensitive  areas. Pipeline operators will have to  meet new safety requirements, including  cleaning  and  continuous monitoring, along more than 1,200 miles of  pipelines. However,  low-stress  lines  that aren’t  in  such  sensitive areas  would continue to be unregulated. The  bill goes further than the regulation  and requires DOT oversight of all low-  stress pipelines.  Increased Accountability of Pipeline  Company Officials—The bill includes a  provision that would require senior officials at pipeline companies to certify  that  the  information  they are providing to regulators is accurate.  Enhanced  Pipeline  Research—The  bill would also boost PHMSA’s  research  and  technology  development  budget for pipeline safety issues such  as corrosion by $10 million over the  length of the bill.  A Study of Pipelines Critical to Energy Supply—The bill includes a study  of oil pipelines that are critical to the  nation’s energy supply in order to determine if there are sufficient safety  regulations  in place to ensure their  safety.  The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and  the House  Energy and Commerce Committee are  also working on pipeline safety legislation. I hope that our three Committees  can work together over the next month  while the Congress is out of session to  develop a joint legislative product that  we can pass and have signed into law  when we return in November. Many of  the provisions in the three bills are  similar and we  should have enough  common ground to achieve this goal.  (for himself  By Mr. DOMENICI  and Mr. CRAIG):  S. 3962. A bill to enhance the management and disposal of spent nuclear fuel  and high-level radioactive waste, to assure protection of public health and  safety, to ensure the territorial integrity and security of the repository at  Yucca Mountain, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources.

1907,262,2006-09-27,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I note  the arrival on the floor of the distinguished Senator from Nevada. The legislation that I will be talking about is  of significant interest to the Senator  from Nevada. But it will take many  months on the floor of the Senate before we finish.  Today my fellow Senators I am introducing legislation that I believe will  place the Department of Energy’s nuclear waste program back on track.  As we all know, the history of the  Yucca Mountain  project  has  been  rocky at best. The Yucca Mountain  project has a very long pedigree, starting back to the late 1950’s when the National Academy of Sciences reported to  the Atomic Energy Commission suggesting that burying radioactive high-  level waste  in  geologic  formations  should receive consideration.  In the 1980s, when Congress decided  to pursue a geologic  repository, we  were quite optimistic—so optimistic  that we told the Department of Energy—DOE—to  enter  into  contracts  with utilities that promised that we  would begin taking nuclear waste off  their hands by 1998. Well, obviously  that didn’t happen. What did happen  was that the courts found that the government is liable for its failure to meet  its contractual obligation.  While moving more  slowly  than  planned, DOE’s nuclear waste program  has made progress toward making the  goal of a permanent geologic repository  for nuclear waste a reality. In  2002, the President and Congress approved the Yucca Mountain site, and  instructed DOE to file a license application for the repository with the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission—NRC.  That decision has been made.  With the siting decision made, it will  now be up to the NRC to evaluate the  scientific data and determine whether  the repository will permanently, and  safely, isolate nuclear waste.  Yucca Mountain is the cornerstone of  our national comprehensive spent nuclear  fuel management  strategy  for  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:27 Sep 28, 2006 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G27SE6.079 S27SEPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2006

1915,311,2006-09-27,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Palomar College on their 60th anniversary.  Palomar College is one of the most comprehensive community colleges in the United  States, offering North County, San Diego residents more  than 300 degree and certificate  programs for transfer to four-year universities,  job training, and personal enrichment. Its commitment to lifelong learning and its status as a  cultural center for northern San Diego County  make Palomar College a  tremendous educational asset to California and the Nation.  Palomar began with only 100 students; the  first classes were held on September 23,  1946, on the campus of Vista High School in  Vista, California. It has since grown to become  one of our State’s largest community colleges.  Palomar College now has an enrollment of  over 30,000 students and is widely respected  for its excellent programs, faculty, administration, the success of its students, and the service it provides to the communities of northern  San Diego County.  Mr. Speaker, because of Palomar College’s  dedication to education and the improvement  of individuals, I want to recognize and honor  this institution of higher learning. I congratulate  and applaud Palomar College upon  the observance of its 60th anniversary and for the  valuable contribution it makes to our society  and to the future of its students.  f  A TRIBUTE TO PRIVATE ERIC M.

1916,311,2006-09-27,Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  before you today to honor the life of a Maryland soldier who died honorably serving his  country in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Private Eric M. Kavanagh from Glen Burnie,  Maryland was a dedicated and loyal serviceman. His courage enabled him to be a leader  among his peers.  The 20-year-old private was  trained as a  Bradley tank driver. He was assigned to the  1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat  team,  1st  Infantry Division,  Schweinfurt, Germany. After his  training, he  was stationed in Iraq for 5 weeks.  I commend Private Kavanagh for his courage to serve our country and to fight for freedom in an unsettled world. Without doubt, his  bravery  gives  his  parents, Mr. Kelvin  T.  Kavanagh and Ms. Rhonda Kavanagh great  pride. Private Kavanagh was  the oldest of  three children. He  is remembered  for being  not only a magnanimous and compassionate  soldier but also an incredible brother and son.  Prior to joining the Army, Private Kavanagh  worked for a weekly shopping publication, the  Pennysaver. Co-workers said he was always  happy  and  smiling.  He  attended  Folger  McKinsey Elementary School, Severna Park  Middle School, and Chesapeake High School.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that you  join with me  today to honor the patriotism of Private Eric M.  Kavanagh. His love of country and willingness  to serve his country will  forever  last  in our  hearts and minds. He made the ultimate sacrifice for the United States of America and he  will always be remembered as a hero  from  Maryland.  f  IN HONOR OF DAN ALBERT  HON. SAM FARR  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 26, 2006  ",2006
1917,311,2006-09-27,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor the achievements of Dan Albert, who is  retiring this year after serving as the mayor of  Monterey since 1986. His  long career  represents success, accomplishment, and community service. Dan served on  the City of  Monterey Parks and Recreation Commission  for several years. He is a former member and  Chair of the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), the one local position that he  and I have both held. He was elected to the  City Council  in 1979 and elected Mayor  in  1986, and is now in his tenth term.  But  length of  service  is not everything.  When first elected to the City Council, Monterey was in the economic doldrums. The fishing industry was depressed, the tourism industry was moribund and local military economic  activity was under constant threat. What a difference 26 years of  real  leadership makes.  Last year  the BRAC Commission reaffirmed  the indispensable role that Monterey plays in  supporting  the Defense Language  Institute  and Naval Postgraduate School. Monterey is  the center of a thriving regional tourism economy. Its convention center, its Window on the  Bay Park, aquarium, and coastal  recreation  trail all draw and enrich visitors from at home  and abroad. The City of Monterey is a national  model  for  the participation of  its citizens  in  neighborhood preservation and enhancement.  All of  these  trends, and many others, have  Dan Albert’s quiet leadership at their center. It  is a legacy that has made a permanent mark  on Monterey.  Dan’s previous career spanned 37 years as  a teacher at Monterey High School, where he  coached  the varsity  football  team  for 23 of  those years. He and his wife, Joanne, are lifetime residents of the city and both attended  Monterey High School. They have four grown  children and ten grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I am certain that I have not  heard the last from Dan, as I expect he will remain an active member of the community, but  I do want to wish him and his family the best  as  they enter  this exciting new chapter. On  behalf of the United States Congress, I would  like  to congratulate  the accomplishments of  Dan Albert and express my sincere gratitude  for his commitment to the community.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

Gundlach  had, the year before, opened a small machine  shop to provide tools and equipment for the  local mines and factories.  After college, where he earned a degree in  mechanical engineering, Ted accepted an appointment to the U.S. Naval Reserves in 1943  and served for the duration of World War II.  He was discharged in 1946 with the rank of  Lieutenant J.G.  Returning home  to Belleville, Ted entered  the  family business, T.J. Gundlach Machine  Co. and J.M.J.  Industries,  Inc. Starting as  General Manager, Ted would become President and CEO and expand the Gundlach Machine Co. market reach to six continents.  As much as Ted poured his energy into his  business, he also found time to be personally  involved in his community. Ted has served on  16 different boards of directors, been a member of numerous fraternal, business and civic  organizations and helped to steer many community and charitable projects. He has  received a number of awards  from business,  professional, educational and civic organizations, recognizing his contributions and leadership.  While Ted built his company into a position  of international leadership in their marketplace  and has performed outstanding service to his  community, he has always been devoted  to  his family. Ted and his wife, Patricia, live in  Belleville, Illinois and have two children, Mary  Barbara Compton and Laurie Ann Frillman.  They have three grandchildren, Amanda, Molly  and Lucas.

1922,10,2006-11-09,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, it is with a  heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude  that today I honor the life of a brave  young man from Hammond. Jonathan  Rojas, 27 years old, died on October 3  after being struck by a sniper bullet  while on patrol in Baghdad. Jonathan  risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts,  in a land halfway around the world.  Jonathan spent several years in the  workforce after graduating from Hammond High School before enlisting. He  had been due to return home to Indiana  2 months before he was killed but  agreed to stay longer, promising his  family in Hammond that he would be  home in time for Christmas. Jonathan  was remembered by his brother William as playful and warm hearted,  when he said, ‘‘We’re going to miss him  being himself, doing stupid things, his  company, having a brother, someone to  talk to.’’  Jonathan was killed, while serving  his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, 172nd  Stryker Brigde Combat Team. This  brave soldier leaves behind wife Tasha  Rojas, parents Jose and Catalina Rojas,  brother William  Rojas,  and  sister  Isaura Rojas.  Today, I join Jonathan’s family and  friends in mourning his death. While  we struggle to bear our sorrow over  this loss, we can also take pride in the  example he  set, bravely  fighting  to  make the world a safer place. It is his  courage and strength of character that  people will remember when they think  of Jonathan, a memory that will burn  brightly during these continuing days  of conflict and grief.  Jonathan was known for his dedication to his family and his love of country. He was looking forward to civilian  life and starting a family with his wife  Tasha. Today and always, Jonathan  will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a  true American hero, and we honor the  sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.  As I search for words to do justice in  honoring Jonathan’s sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln’s remarks  as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ‘‘We cannot  dedicate, we  cannot  consecrate, we  cannot hallow this ground. The brave  men, living and dead, who struggled  here, have consecrated it, far above our  poor power  to add or detract. The  world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never  forget what they did here.’’ This statement is just as true today as it was  nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain  that the impact of Jonathan’s actions  will live on far longer than any record  of these words.  It is my sad duty to enter the name  of  Jonathan Rojas  in  the  official  RECORDof the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound  commitment to  freedom, democracy,  and peace.

ROSA L. DeLAURO  OFCONNECTICUT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 9, 2006  ",2006
1924,31,2006-11-09,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pleasure that I rise today to join all administration, staff, and the New Haven community in  extending my sincere congratulations  to  the  Hospital of Saint Raphael as they mark their  l00th Anniversary. The Hospital of Saint Raphael is one of New Haven’s leading employers  as well as one of  the  largest providers of  healthcare in Connecticut. As we commemorate this remarkable milestone, we also celebrate all  that  the Hospital of Saint Raphael  has brought to our community and look forward to the innovations that are sure to come  in the future.  Since its founding by the Sisters of Charity  of Saint Elizabeth 100 years ago, the Hospital  of Saint Raphael has grown from a 12-bed facility  to a 511-bed community  teaching hospital. The Sisters came to New Haven at the  request of a group of  local physicians who  asked  that  they administer a hospital  that  would be open  to all—all members of  the  medical profession and any patient, regardless  of race, creed, color, or economic status. The  Hospital of Saint Raphael, named for one of  the few archangels recognized by many faiths  and who has been long revered as a patron  of the sick and healing, has built on this original vision and has become a local leader in  providing quality healthcare to all members of  our community. In addition to meeting the general healthcare needs of their patients, the administration and staff have developed a myriad  of outreach programs designed specifically to  ensure  that  those most  in need—those who  are  the most  underserved—are  educated  about healthcare and have access to the care  that they need. It is that special vision that has  driven  the success of Saint Raphael’s and  how they continue to make a difference in our  community.  Over the course of my career I have been  proud to stand with the leaders of Saint Raphael’s—those like my dear friends Sister Louise  Anthony, Sister Anne Virginie,  and David  Benfer—to work with them to bring both local  and  national  attention  to  a  number  of  healthcare issues facing our communities. Devoting their lives to the Sisters of Charity, Sister Louise and Sister Anne brought not only  their compassion, but a unique dedication to  the mission of Saint Raphael Hospital. Sister  Louise began her time at Saint Raphael’s as  a nursing student and retired as the chief executive officer. It was under the leadership of  Sister Louise that the Hospital of Saint Raphael opened  the  first  freestanding, self contained  radiation  therapy  treatment center  in  New England as well as became the first community  hospital  in Connecticut  to  perform  open-heart surgery and open a coronary care  unit. Beginning her career as associate administrator, then as president of the hospital. and  finally as president and chief executive officer  of the Saint Raphael Healthcare System, Sister Anne provided Connecticut residents with  the highest quality health care. Today  their  outstanding  leadership  is  followed by David  Benfer who, during his tenure of six years, has  enabled Saint Raphael’s to further its reputation as a clinical pioneer in cardiac, cancer, orthopedic, neurosciences, and geriatric services.  The Hospital of Saint Raphael has been a  long-standing  champion of efforts  to bring  awareness to lawmakers of the seriousness of  today’s healthcare crisis as well as the plight  of uninsured Americans. Saint Raphael’s and  its staff were also one of  the  leading advocates  for and were  instrumental  in  the passage state  legislation which protects women  from  the  dangers  of  drive  through  mastectomies. This is an issue which I have  taken an active interest in at the federal level  and I am grateful for the support I have received from the Hospital, its staff and its leaders. It is this kind of advocacy, compassion,  and commitment to quality healthcare that has  made Saint Raphael’s such a success over  the last century.  It is a privilege for me to rise today to pay  tribute to the invaluable contributions the Hospital of Saint Raphael has made, not only to  our community, but to the healthcare community as well. I am proud to extend my sincere  congratulations  to  this outstanding  institution  as they celebrate their centennial anniversary.  I have no doubt that in the years to come, the  Hospital of Saint Raphael will continue to be  a leader in the healthcare industry and a vigilant advocate on behalf of those most in need.  f  RECOGNIZING  THE  HONORABLE  FRANCES  TYDINGCO-GATEWOOD  ON HER INVESTITURE AS A FEDERAL JUDGE  HON.

According to our most  professional  experienced  intelligence  analysts, the number of terrorists attacks and recruits are up worldwide.  Many of our  enemies are  stronger.  Their reach is greater. Their weapons  of mass destruction are more developed, plentiful and available.  Democrats have an agenda for real  security at home and overseas. It is  time that we require the Iraqis to take  responsibility for their country, and to  begin the phased redeployment of U.S.  forces out of Iraq. At the same time,  we Democrats believe that we need to  double the size of Special Forces to destroy Osama bin Laden and terrorists  networks like al-Qaeda, we need to rebuild a state-of-the-art military capable of projecting power wherever necessary. That is an agenda that will better protect our Nation and is worthy of  strong bipartisan support.  f  THE THREAT OF IRAN  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2006
1927,2,2006-11-15,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to address a growing threat to the United  States and global security: Iran’s nuclear ambitions pose a grave threat,  not only to world stability but also to  our close ally, Israel, the only stable  democracy  in  the Middle East, and  American interests of peace and prosperity throughout the region.  Just yesterday the Associated Press  confirmed that Iran has continued its  experiments to enrich uranium in defiance of the U.N. Security Council.  Led by a tyrannical dictator who denies the existence of the Holocaust and  vows to wipe Israel off the map, the  President of Iran is out of touch with  reality and poses an immediate security threat to its neighbors and the  progress of democracy in the Middle  East.  We must stand firm and united in our  resolve to prevent Iran from becoming  a nuclear state. President Ahmadinejad  seems bent on the destruction of Western civilization. He says Iran will never  give up its right to enrich uranium and  produce nuclear fuel. The consequences  of a nuclear Iran would be catastrophic  and must be addressed.  Mr. Speaker, our commitment to our  allies and for peace in the Middle East  must not be shaken by Iran’s nuclear  weapons ambitions.  I urge my  colleagues to work together to stand in  unity against this gathering threat.  f  RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE  (Ms. SOLIS asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2006
1928,2,2006-11-15,Ms. SOLIS.," Mr. Speaker, the minimum wage, as you know, has not been  raised in the last 9 years and is currently at its lowest level in the last 50  years when adjusted for inflation. Yet  Republicans have continually refused  to  raise  the pay of  these  full-time  workers who struggle to make ends  meet.  During the last 6 years, by the way,  5 million people now live in poverty.  Last week the American people spoke  out  for the Democratic majority  in  Congress, because they agreed that no  one  in  the Nation who works hard  should be denied a  livable wage. In  fact, over 70 percent of Latinos work at  minimum wage to support their children.  These are hardworking Americans,  and they deserve better treatment and  fairness. Now  the American  people  have spoken and call for immediate action to raise the minimum wage. Within the first 100 hours of the Congress,  Democrats will pass a pay increase for  those workers who need it the most. It  is only fair. How can we as a Nation  justify  giving millionaires  tens  of  thousands of dollars  in  tax breaks  while we continue to force more than 6  million Americans to  live with  just  $5.15 an hour?  Mr. Speaker, thanks to the election  results, we will  see a much-needed  raise  in the minimum wage  for all  Americans.  f  A LITTLE SCHOOL WITH A BIG  HEART  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, last Friday in Saluda, South  Carolina, 400 elementary school students gathered at a football field while  a military helicopter  landed  in  the  middle.  Why such a big treat for such a small  school, you may wonder? Hollywood  Elementary teacher Anna Frye learned  of the Flags For Soldiers Project, headed by Alpha Troop Commander Captain  Jason D. Hennigan, and wanted to involve her students.  The project is to raise money to purchase 500 American flags, one for each  soldier serving in a Cavalry Squadron  of the 82nd Airborne Division. During  the past several weeks, these students  donated their snack money and paid a  fee to participate in dress-up days so  they could contribute to this cause.  Captain Hennigan’s  father, Daniel  Hennigan, a retired Army officer, was  so touched by the school’s gesture that  he arranged a special celebration on  Veterans Day. As American  solders  continue  to  fight  for our  freedoms  around the world, we can all learn a  lesson from the students at Hollywood  Elementary.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September 11.  f  AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT  DEMOCRATIC AGENDA  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of  Texas asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)  ",2006
1929,2,2006-11-15,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of  Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  last week  the  American people voted for change here  in Washington. They were not happy  with the party controlling both Capitol  Hill and the White House. They want  checks and balances, but more than  anything, they want us to work together to address the concerns they  face every day.  The agenda that Democrats laid out  over the last year is an agenda that all  of us here in Washington should be able  to support. If you want to help millions  of hardworking Americans who have  not received a pay raise in 9 years, you  will join us in increasing the minimum  raise in January. If you want to help  more teenagers get a college education,  you will join us in making it more affordable by cutting interest rates in  half on college loans.  This is the agenda that the American  people supported last week when they  went to the polls. In January, we will  begin to implement this agenda, and I  hope that our Republican colleagues  will join us in this effort.  f  COLLEGE LOAN INTEREST RATE  CUTS  (Ms. WATSON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

But I want to thank her for  working with me in a bipartisan way,  and I am hopeful that this is a new direction for the coming Congress of bipartisanship.

1940,9,2006-11-15,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," I will  confess  to  sometimes  starting  slow,  and I am getting old. It would probably  be helpful  in the  future  if the gentleman would find some way to signal  when he was being  sarcastic. That  would help my understanding.  ",2006
1941,9,2006-11-15,Mr. MCHENRY.," Thank you.  I certainly appreciate the gentleman’s guidance on signals. I will make sure, going  forward, I smile or wave when I am  being sarcastic. Or the gentleman, who  will be the chairman of my committee  in the next Congress, I will simply just  speak when I am being sarcastic on  your committee in the next Congress,  if that would be all right.  Actually, before I close, I want to  give one final story. Before I got on the  Financial Services Committee, a senior  Member told me that with the ranking  Democrat  from Massachusetts  (Mr.  FRANK) that  if he ever asks you to  yield in a committee debate, say ‘‘no.’’  And I said, why; isn’t that rude? He  says, well, you have never been in a debate with BARNEYFRANK, have you?  Well, sure enough, 6 months in, I say  something and  the  ranking member  asks me to yield. And as a new Member, I mistakenly said ‘‘yes.’’  I will not make that mistake going  forward. The gentleman is quite able  with his arguments, a Harvard educated attorney. I respect his ability to  make an argument and to make the opposition look silly.  And with that, as the opposition, I  would sit down and say, Mr. Speaker, I  have no further requests for time.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2006

1954,16,2006-11-15,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week the American people voted for a  new direction in the Nation’s Iraq policy. If anything, with the mandate this  Democratic majority received, we can  be more unapologetic than ever about  demanding an end to the Iraq occupation and insisting that we bring our  troops home.  But I believe Iraq is a symptom of an  even larger problem, that is, a foreign  policy that chooses saber rattling over  diplomacy and negotiation.  We need an entirely new national security paradigm. For too long, we have  equated national security with war and  with conquest. It is time we used less  brawn and more brains to protect our  people and our interests.  Iraq is exhibit A in the case that  hawkishness does not necessarily make  America safer.  That  is where a SMART  security  plan comes. SMART stands  for sensible, multilateral, American response  to terrorism.  At its core is a belief that war is a  very last resort, that peacekeeping and  diplomacy, not  invasion and occupation, must be the guiding lights of our  foreign policy.  SMART also focuses on stopping the  spread of weapons of mass destruction.  Not by deposing regimes that do not  have them, but with diplomacy, with  vigorous  inspection  regimes and  regional security arrangements.  SMART calls for a renewed commitment to the cooperative threat reduction program and calls on the United  States to set an example for the world  by living up to our own commitments  to draw down our nuclear arsenal.  Because, Mr. Speaker, what moral  authority do we have to pressure Iran  or North Korea about their nuclear ambitions when our government consistently undermines the nuclear and ignores our multilateral obligations in  this very area?  Being smart about national security  means dramatically  rearranging our  budget priorities, which in turn means  fewer obsolete Cold War weapons systems and more investment in strategies that actually address the security  challenges of a new era.  Any smart approach to national security must  include  an  ambitious  international development program for  impoverished nations, debt relief, democracy building, schooling for women  and girls, human rights education, environmental programs,  infrastructure  development and more.  Think about this, Mr. Speaker. With  the money spent on the invasion and  occupation of Iraq, we could have fully  funded global antihunger efforts for 14  years or provided basic immunization  to children around the world for 113  years or fully funded worldwide AIDS  programs for 34 years. We could have  spent hundreds of billions of dollars to  save lives, instead of destroying them.  For the sake of the next generation,  the only future that we have got, before we have  destroyed  civilization  itself, we should strive for nothing less  than the end of all wars.  Because of the insanity of war and its  disproportionate impact on children, I  am pledging never again to cast a vote  in Congress in favor of any military action, barring an attack on the United  States or protecting against genocide  and/or ethnic cleansing, and then only  with multilateral humanitarian intervention.  Nor will I pick sides in violent global  conflicts, except to condemn all acts of  war and terror regardless of ideology,  regardless of national interests or religion that motivates them. I refuse to  decide who is less wrong.  If I could be persuaded that taking up  arms  actually  builds  enduring  stability, I would reconsider my position,  but this notion that war begets peace  is as illogical as it sounds. Our preemptive strike on Iraq has, in fact, been a  catalyst  for  increased  violence  and  higher rates of terrorism. Our continued occupation is emboldening the insurgents rather than defeating them.  Instead of liberating a nation, the Bush  doctrine has ripped it apart, ripped it  apart at the seams, and instead of protecting America, it has dealt a blow to  our very security.  ‘‘War,’’  said Martin Luther King,  Junior, ‘‘is a poor chisel to carve out  tomorrow.’’ Tomorrow belongs to our  children. So for their sake, Mr. Speaker, let us protect America by relying  not on our basest impulses, but on the  most honorable and humane of American values, and let us bring our troops  home now from Iraq.  f  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  SODREL).

1962,23,2006-11-15,Mr. OSBORNE.," Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks  ago I visited Israel, spent about 12 days  there, and traveled the whole country.  We started in the northern part, up  around Caesaria Phillipi, went down to  Elat on the Red Sea, went to Jerusalem, went to Tel Aviv, talked to the  people, and had a very good feel for  what actually is going on there.  So often on CODELs we are  in a  country for 24 hours, 36 hours, and we  move on. And this was a  little different. And so at the present time, obviously, people know that Israel is in a  very difficult spot. Recently they had a  war  involving  Hezbollah  on  their  northern border. And  the Hezbollah  was located in Lebanon, southern part  of it, and fired hundreds, if not thousands, of Katyusha missiles into Israel,  particularly  the  northern  part  of  Israel. And yet, as we visited that part  of  the  country,  it was almost untouched, it seemed. They had repaired,  they had restored, and life was going  on as usual only a couple, 3 weeks after  the conflict had ended.  As many people know, Hamas is very  powerful in Gaza and in the West Bank  and has tremendous influence in the  Palestinian areas. At the present time,  there are rockets being fired by the  Hamas  people  down  in Gaza,  into  Israel.  So as we watch this and as we watch  the continual conflict with the Palestinians and the desire for the Palestinians to have a unified state, unifying the West Bank, on the west bank  of the Jordan and in the Gaza Strip  down in the southwestern part of the  country, you can see that  Israel  is  under tremendous pressure.  Yet, the thing that was rather impressive was the staying power, the resolve, the willingness of the Israelis to  try to see this through. I guess the lessons that I took away from this, and  the concerns, were that, obviously, it is  important that the United States have  that same staying power, that same  will to pull together, that same willingness to survive in the face of adversity.  Because even  though we are protected by two great oceans, the world  has shrunk. Today we are not as secure  as we once were. We face a true global  conflict over the horizon. Many of the  things that we observed  in Israel, I  think, apply to us, even though sometimes we are not aware of it.  Tony Blair made an interesting observation here recently. He stated that  peace in the Middle East will be hard  to come by unless Israel and the Palestinians and Hamas and Hezbollah can  somehow resolve their differences. I believe that is very true.  Our  focus  is on  Iraq here  in  the  United States, sometimes on Afghanistan. But at the heart of much of the  conflict and much of the turmoil in the  Middle East  is the conflict that  involves  terrorist  organizations  and  Israel. I am not here to be partisan and  take Israel’s side versus another nation’s side. I am simply pointing these  issues out that I think are very important.  The things that  I mentioned that  particularly  impressed me about the  Israelis were, number one, a willingness to persevere in the face of great  adversity, and people realize what the  terrorists are attempting to do. But  also not far away is Iran, and the Iranian president has basically said that  he would like to destroy Israel, and everyone knows that at the present time  it does appear that Iran is trying to  build nuclear capabilities. This  is a  very tenuous situation as far as Israel  is concerned. Despite these threats, as  I mentioned, Israel seems to be staying  the course, seems to have great resolve, and I would hope that we would  have the same resolve in our country  in terms of persevering in the face of  adversity.  The second thing that I took away  from that trip to Israel that I think is  important, that may have some applicability to our situation here in the  United States, is a sense on the part of  the Israelis of having great unity of  purpose, a willingness to pull together,  a willingness to avoid all fragmentation. I guess when your back is to the  wall and you are not very big, you realize that unity of purpose is critical. So  we certainly detected that.  I guess I can relate a little bit to my  previous  experience  in  the  athletic  arena in regard to the importance of  unity of purpose. A team of great athletes which was polarized and which  was divided was not able to accomplish  a great deal; and yet a team with less  talent which had unity  of  purpose  would usually prevail over a superior  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:29 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A15NO7.032 H15NOPT1 E S U O H h t i w 2 6 C P D O R P n o l l e w e s e c i r p c         ",2006

1990,37,2006-11-15,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I notice the  majority leader has returned to the floor. I  tried to recount for our colleagues the status  of our discussion, and the understanding that  we had reached, that I would withdraw my  amendment from this bill with the understanding that we would go to the Agriculture  Appropriations bill tomorrow and have a  chance to offer it there. All Senators’ rights  would be reserved. That is the status of it. I  just ask if that is the majority leader’s understanding. If it is, I will then be willing to  withdraw my amendment for the Military  Construction bill and we can conclude that.  ",2006
1991,37,2006-11-15,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, in the last hour  or so we have had numerous discussions on  the floor, as our colleagues have observed,  and many participated in the discussion. My  understanding and the general agreement we  have is to go to the Agriculture Appropriations bill tomorrow. That does facilitate the  progress we need to make on the current bill  that is on the floor, which I hope and expect  to be able to finish tonight. If that is the  case, we plan on going to the Agriculture bill  tomorrow. All rights would be reserved for  all Senators, of course. We don’t have an  agreement, but that is the intention.  The disaster ag relief bill is very important  and has been talked about by Republicans  and Democrats and we expect to debate it tomorrow. It is a more appropriate place for  this amendment. So I think this is a good  understanding.  Mr. President, I withdrew my amendment based on that understanding. I  did it in good faith. I did it to accommodate my colleagues. I did it so other  legislation could move. But now I am  told the agreement is not going to be  kept. That is not acceptable. That is  just not acceptable. That puts me in  the position now of having to object to  proceeding to other business. I have no  alternative but to do that.  I am here representing thousands of  farm  families across our State and  really right down the heartland of the  country. We have 26 cosponsors for this  legislation, totally bipartisan, about as  many Republicans as Democrats on the  bill because we have had the third  worst drought in the country’s history.  That is the reality.  I have a letter on my desk from a  man talking about the disaster. And in  that letter he said to me—this is from  last year when we had terrible flooding—he had 26 inches of rain over a  very short period of time. The result  was he had no production, and he lost  $120,000. Even with the crop insurance,  it did not come close to covering his  bills, and that he and his wife and his  family were going to be forced off the  land if there were not some assistance.  Let me just recount the history. Always in our past when anyone suffered  from natural disaster in this country,  anywhere, Congress  responded. Congress responded. We responded when  there was Hurricane Katrina. We responded when  there was Hurricane  Rita. In fact, this gentleman says: I  urged our delegation to support the  victims of Hurricane Katrina. We suffered the same kind of loss here, a complete economic loss, but there were no  news cameras seeing our disaster. We  had a slow-motion disaster but every  bit as devastating.  The question  is, Are those people  going to be given any kind of helping  hand, the kind of thing we have done  repeatedly in the past?  Now, we don’t budget for disasters.  Some have said it is a budget buster.  No, it is not. No. 1, there is no budget.  No. 2, to the extent we have agreed on  guidelines for spending, it has always  been understood,  it has always been  the case for the 20 years I have been  here that natural disasters are treated  separate and apart from the budget.

1992,51,2006-11-15,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to pay special tribute to the  General Federation of Women’s Clubs  and their recent work to fight domestic  violence. The organization  is a gem  among our midst. Founded  in April  1890, it is one of the world’s oldest and  largest women’s volunteer organizations. More than 150,000 women members in 5,000 local and 20 international  clubs volunteer over 13 million hours  and contribute approximately $35 million through more than 160,000 club  projects.  I can’t underestimate how  powerful and influential this corps of  volunteers is to the health of our Nation.  I am particularly proud that this  year the international president, Jacqueline Pierce, has adopted ‘‘Domestic  Violence Awareness and Prevention’’  as her President’s Special Project for  2006–2008. Nannette White, a member  from Louisiana, serves as the national  chairperson of the President’s Special  Project, and with the support of a national committee of women, promotes  participation in this project. All across  the Nation,  local women’s clubs are  adopting  battered women’s  shelters  and donating needed goods  such as  food,  linens, health care  items, and  more. In Nevada, members sponsored a  public service campaign on radio stations to promote important messages  about  violence  prevention.  In Mississippi, members distributed 2,000 fliers with information on the National  Domestic Violence Hotline and helped  raise funds for the Mississippi State  Coalition Against Domestic Violence.  This is just a small sampling of the  good works being done.

1993,72,2006-11-15,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor an organization with a distinguished history of community service to the Sacramento  capital region. Legal Services of Northern California is celebrating 50 years of providing free  legal services to the low-income residents of  Sacramento County and 22 other counties in  Northern California. As  the staff and supporters of Legal Services of Northern California gather  to  celebrate  this momentous  milestone, I ask all my colleagues to join me  in saluting one of Sacramento’s most important and respected organizations.  In 1956, Legal Services of Northern California, then known as the Legal Aid Society of  Sacramento County, was born out of the insight  of  prominent members  of  the Sacramento Bar Association and a budget of  $12,000. With the assistance of volunteer pro  bono attorneys and a staff consisting of one  part-time attorney and one social worker, the  Legal Aid Society of Sacramento County finished its first year having provided assistance  to nearly 2,900 low-income clients.  From  these humble beginnings 50 years  ago, the Legal Aid Society has grown significantly. In 1967, the organization began to expand its services beyond Sacramento County  and opened offices in Yolo County. By the late  1970s, the Legal Aid Society of Sacramento  County had acquired a state-wide reputation  for resolute and effective advocacy on behalf  of the poor and disabled, and had won significant victories on behalf of its clients. To reflect  its expanding geographic reach, the organization changed its name in 1979 to Legal Services of Northern California, which today operates offices serving 23 counties, with a budget  of over $7 million and a staff of over 120 employees and 1,000 volunteers.  Legal Services of Northern California has  also greatly expanded  its scope of services  beyond providing traditional legal assistance to  low-income individuals. The organization now  operates the Senior Legal Hotline, the Health  Rights  Hotline,  Ombudsman  Services  of  Northern California, and the Disability Employment Rights Advocacy Program, As a testament  to  its  far-reaching services,  the Senior  Legal Hotline  fields almost 9,000 calls each  year from seniors all over California. Also notable was in early 2006 when Legal Services  of Northern California acquired the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program,  an organization that advises thousands of seniors on  the different prescription drug plans  available to them under Medicare.  Mr. Speaker,  for 50 years  the good men  and women of Legal Services of Northern  California have dedicated countless hours to  identifying and defeating the causes of poverty  and injustice. As the staff and volunteer attorneys gather to reflect upon a half century of  exemplary service  to  the community,  I am  proud to recognize such a reputable organization. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Legal Services of Northern California and wishing them many more years of  continued success.  TRIBUTE TO MR. ELMO LOPEZ, SR.  HON.

1994,72,2006-11-15,Mr. CUELLAR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Mr. Elmo Lopez, Sr., as a recipient of  the 2006 Longhorn Legacy Awards, given to  him on October 5, 2006 by the Laredo Chapter of the University of Texas Ex-Students Association.  Elmo Lopez, Sr. is a native of the city of Rio  Grande and now currently resides in the city  of Laredo in the State of Texas. He graduated  from the University of Texas at Austin with degrees in music, a Bachelor of Arts in 1953 and  a Masters in 1957, and thus began a long, accomplished musical career. Shortly after graduation, he worked as Band Director for the Laredo Independent School District, bringing his  experience as a band member of  the UT  Longhorns Band to Lamar Junior High, Martin  High School, and Nixon High School  from  1953 to 1967. During this time, he served in  several posts with the Texas Music Educators  Association.  Mr. Lopez’s passion for music was recognized by the Texas Legislature for promoting  good will between the United States and Mexico  through musical exchange programs. He  also was honored in 1963 with Laredo Paso  Doble, a musical composition written by Professor Clifton Williams at  the University of  Texas at Austin. In addition to having guest  conducted the UT Longhorn Band on numerous occasions, he also conducted the United  States Armed Forces band and  the Special  Presidential Band of Mexico.  In 1987, Mr. Lopez  founded  the Laredo  Chapter of the UT-Exes as a way to keep the  connection between the University of Texas at  Austin and its alumni in the city of Laredo. He  dedicated his time and energy to the University including 12 years of service on the Board  of Directors of the UT Dad’s Association, and  was named Distinguished Alumnus  in 1993  and honored with  the Lifetime Achievement  Award from the Laredo UT-Exes.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have had this  time to recognize the dedication of Mr. Elmo  Lopez, Sr. to his music and to the community  of the city of Laredo.  f  A TRIBUTE TO ESMERALDA  BROWN  HON.

1995,72,2006-11-15,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  recognition of Esmeralda Brown, a distinguished citizen of Brooklyn, New York, and  contributor  to  the world community.  It behooves us  to pay  tribute  to  this outstanding  woman, and I hope my colleagues will join me  in recognizing her impressive service.  As the Resource Center Specialist for Economic and Environmental Justice at the United  Methodist Office  for  the United Nations,  Esmeralda Brown deals with issues of concern  to  the Women’s Division constituency  in  the  area of economics, the environment, and development. Ms. Brown has been  involved  in  organizing several workshops and meetings in  Latin America,  the Caribbean,  and North  America.  Issues discussed  include  racism,  militarization, and  the situation of women  in  the Americas.  Ms. Brown is the chairperson of the United  Nation’s NGO committee on the International  Decade of  the World’s  Indigenous Peoples.  Ms. Brown is also the Southern Co-Chair of  the NGO Steering committee  to  the NGO  Commission on Sustainable Development. Ms.  Brown holds the chairperson position for the  Southern Caucus of NGO’s that form part of  the Regional and National Networks on Sustainable Development in developing countries  of the world. She is also the Economic and  Environmental Justice Specialist at the United  Methodist Office for the United Nations. Additionally, Ms. Brown is a United Nations representative  for  the Commission of Human  Rights in Central America and the Pan African  Movement for the Conference on Environment  and Development (UNCED).  In 1992, Ms. Brown was co-founder of the  Peoples’ Alliance for the Earth Summit. This  organization did the preparatory work for the  Non-Governmental Organizations  invited  to  the United Nations Conference on Environment  and  Development  (UNCED).  Ms.  Brown’s work has not gone unnoticed. In June  1990, she was honored by  the Ecumenical  Program  for  Inter-American Communication  and Action  (EPICA)  in Washington  for Outstanding Contributions  to  the Struggle  for  Human Rights in Central America.  Esmeralda Brown  is a native of Panama,  and holds a B.A.  in Political Science  from  Hunter College of the City University of New  York.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that it is incumbent  on  this  body  to  recognize  the work  of  Esmeralda Brown. Her deep commitment  to  the international community makes her most  worthy of our recognition today.  f  HONORING THE JOHN G. SHEDD  AQUARIUM  HON. DANNY K.

1997,79,2006-11-15,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  honor the work of one of the leaders of the  modern-day  abolitionist movement, Ambassador John R. Miller, who has announced he  will step down as Director of the U.S. Department of State’s Office to Monitor and Combat  Trafficking in Persons.  He will be greatly missed.  As Ambassador Miller has often reminded  us, trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery. With that conviction, he has led his office,  and the whole of U.S. government, on a mission to settle for nothing short of the abolition  of this terrible international crime.  Under Ambassador Miller’s  leadership,  the  U.S. government has grown  in  its commitment—both  at  home  and  abroad—against  modern-day  slavery. His work has helped  spotlight the issue of slavery around the world,  through the annual Secretary of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report, diplomatic engagement, speeches and multiple prosecution, protection, and prevention programs around the  world.  Earlier this year, New York Times columnist  Nicholas D. Kristof praised the U.S. commitment to abolishing modern-day slavery, noting:  [T]he heaviest lifting has been done by the  State Department’s  tiny  office  on  trafficking—for my money, one of the most effective units in the U.S. government. The office, led by a former Republican congressman, John Miller . . . puts out an annual report that shames and bullies foreign governments  into  taking action against  forced  labor of all kinds.  The 2006 Trafficking in Persons Report is  the most comprehensive worldwide report on  the efforts of governments to combat severe  forms of trafficking in persons. Along with previous editions, its findings have raised global  awareness and compelled countries to take effective actions  to counter human  trafficking.  Under Ambassador Miller’s direction, the Report has steadily increased its country assessment total each year—from 124 governments  reviewed in 2003 to 158 countries assessed in  the 2006 TIP Report.  During  that  time, Ambassador Miller also  oversaw crucial refinements to the Report, elevating  the annual compendium  to a  level of  sophistication rarely enjoyed by a publication  of its kind: the Trafficking in Persons Report  has become the gold standard on which governments and  the media are able  to weigh  progress on the global effort to fight human  trafficking.  Annual release of the report has also generated  increasing media  coverage, helping  raise global consciousness of  the existence  and widespread problem of modern-day slavery. Release of the 2006 Report, for example,  produced widespread coverage by national  and international print, broadcast, and Internet  media, reaching, for the second year in a row,  more  than 400 million people across  the  globe. Media coverage was particularly  intense in many of the Tier 3 and Tier 2 Watch  List countries, such as Saudi Arabia and India.  Today, the TIP Report is the essential reference for global benchmarks that challenge  all governments to join the 21st century abolitionist movement. The annual Trafficking  in  Persons Report serves as the primary diplomatic tool through which the U.S. Government  encourages partnership and increased determination in the fight against forced labor, sexual exploitation, and modern-day slavery.  ‘‘In our  judgment,’’ declared Dr. Mohamed  Mattar, Executive Director of  the Protection  Project, ‘‘this report constitutes the primary reference and main source of information on efforts made by foreign governments to combat  trafficking in persons.’’  Armed with  the report, Ambassador Miller  has engaged with governments from Japan to  Jamaica, from Belize to Bangladesh, to bring  about improved law enforcement, victim protection, and prevention of  this odious crime.  Worldwide, Ambassador Miller’s  diplomatic  leadership helped spur new or improved anti-  human trafficking legislation in 41 countries in  2005, along with the establishment of dozens  of new survivor shelters. That effort paid huge  dividends:  anti-trafficking  convictions worldwide increased from several hundred, before  Ambassador Miller arrived at the State Department, to over 4,700 in 2005. Last year’s figure—an increase from about 3,000 the year  before—was especially dramatic among countries in Africa (from 29 TIP convictions in 2004  to 58 in 2005) and East Asia and Pacific nations  (from 348 TIP convictions  in 2004  to  2,347 in 2005).  Specifically, Ambassador Miller’s diplomatic  efforts helped persuade Japan  to vastly  reduce the number of TIP-exploitable ‘‘entertainment visas’’ Japan issued for young women  from  the Philippines—to  fewer  than 5,000,  from a high of 80,000 a year. In addition, Ambassador Miller has carefully honed  the  report’s system of tier rankings to cultivate global anti-TIP efforts. This year, for example, Malawi rose from Tier 2 to Tier 1 on the TIP Report, while Ecuador rose from Tier 3 to Tier 2.  Over  the  last 2 years, Ambassador Miller  helped enhance  the U.S. government’s anti-  trafficking efforts  to  include a greater  focus  against child sex  tourism (CST), a crime  in  which people travel from their own country to  developing countries, such as Laos or Cambodia,  looking  for anonymity and  the availability of children in prostitution. Ambassador  Miller’s  leadership against CST has netted  success,  as  Time magazine  recently  observed:  Those working to protect children in Cambodia agree that the police force has recently  shown a far stronger commitment to targeting pedophiles. But it’s not just law and  order that is doing the trick. A new political  will to root them out is the result of diplomatic incentives and pressures, both the carrots of international donors and the stick of  the U.S. State Department, say child protection workers. . . . But the stick came in 2005  when the U.S. State Department, fed up with  the  impunity enjoyed by traffickers here,  relegated Cambodia to it lowest tier three  rating on its global trafficking report. Cambodia was lumped in with Burma, Cuba and  North Korea, and Washington  threatened  sanctions against Phnom Penh for its inability to comply with ‘minimum standards’ to  combat human trafficking and convict officials involved.  In part because of Ambassador Miller’s efforts, since 2003 over 30 American pedophiles  have been extradited back  to  the U.S. and  sent to jail.  With Ambassador Miller’s  prodding,  the  United States last December became an official party to the U.N. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, also known as  the Palermo Protocol. The Trafficking in Persons  (TIP) Protocol, which supplements  the  U.N. Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, is an important multilateral component of the worldwide effort to combat modern-day slavery. It seeks to prevent trafficking,  protect victims, and promote anti-trafficking cooperation among nations.  As chairman of the interagency Senior Policy Operating Group, Ambassador Miller has  improved coordination among U.S. agencies,  helping to make the panel a decision-making  body whose participants have  furthered  the  U.S. effort against trafficking in person both at  home and abroad. For example, the Department of Justice (DOJ), in 2005 charged 116  individuals with human trafficking, almost doubling  the number charged  in FY 2004. Approximately 80 percent of  those defendants  were charged under  the  federal Trafficking  Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000. Forty-  five  traffickers were convicted, of which 35  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:54 Nov 16, 2006 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15NO8.042 E15NOPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o N A M E L O C C         ",2006

John was appointed by the Veterans Health  Administration as the Director of Veterans Affairs of the Southern Nevada Healthcare System in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 1, 2006.  He was  previously  the Associate Director  since May 6, 2005.  Prior to his appointment in Las Vegas, John  was the Chief Financial Officer at the VA Facilities at Big Spring and Amarillo, Texas since  1998. He has also been the Chief Financial  Officer at Phoenix, AZ and Reno, NV. He  began his career in 1985 at the VA in Seattle,  WA and served in management positions at  VA Hospitals  in Durham, NC, Prescott, AZ,  Battle Creek, MI and San Antonio, TX. John is  a Veteran who served  in  the United States  Army from 1972 through 1975.  As  Director  of  the  Southern  Nevada  Healthcare System, John has continually advocated for the construction of the new Las  Vegas Veterans Hospital Complex. John is devoted to our veterans in Southern Nevada and  goes above and beyond  to ensure  that veterans receive care. He has always been a remarkable resource to the Congressional Delegation and their staff. Dedicated public servants  like John understand  the contributions  that our Nation’s veterans have made and are  an indispensable component of the veterans’  healthcare system.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor John B.  Bright. His  long and distinguished career  in  service to our Nation’s veterans is commendable. I applaud him for all his hard work and  success.  f  PAYING  TRIBUTE  TO  JOHN  L.  CHURNETSKI,  WILLARD  G.  KRESGE, AND LEE W. ECKERT,  FOUNDERS  OF  QUAD  THREE  GROUP  INC.

1999,86,2006-11-15,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to ask you and my esteemed colleagues in the  House of Representatives  to pay  tribute  to  John L. Churnetski, Willard G. Kresge and Lee  W. Eckert,  founders of Quad Three Group,  Inc. in Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  Quad Three Group is a full service architectural, engineering and environmental science  firm that has grown from a single proprietorship in 1967 to a firm employing 70 people  today  in Wilkes-Barre, Scranton and Pittsburgh, PA.  From 1967 through 1987, the company was  a multidiscipline professional engineering firm  known as Utility Engineers which served a  large number of architectural firms, commercial and industrial clients and municipalities. A  large part of the firm’s growth came from contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense.  In 1987, Utility Engineers, which had employed 35 people, merged with the largest architectural design  firm  in  the Wilkes-Barre/  Scranton area, Pyros and Sanderson, which  employed 15 people,  to  form Quad Three  Group, Inc.  Noteworthy regional projects they completed  included Blue Cross Blue Shield of Northeastern Pennsylvania headquarters, Luzerne  County Community College Technology Building, Penn State University Wilkes-Barre and  Hazleton campuses, Martz Trailways Office  Building,  InterMetro  Industries  Corporate  Headquarters Building, the environmental impact study for the Francis E. Walter Dam Hydroelectric Project, Newport, Rhode Island and  Lakehurst, New Jersey Naval Base Utility System Upgrade and the $85 million Steamtown  Mall project in downtown Scranton.  They also completed the Philadelphia Naval  Shipyard Base Re-Alignment  and Closure  project, ten major K–12 and higher education  projects,  the $45 million Wachovia Arena at  Casey Plaza and the $30 million Mount Laurel  Center for the Performing Arts.  Mr. Churnetski  received his bachelor of  science in mechanical engineering from Notre  Dame University. Mr. Kresge  received his  bachelor of electrical engineering  from Penn  State University and Mr. Eckert received his  bachelor of science in civil engineering from  Penn State University. Between  the  three  founders,  they have 127 years of combined  engineering experience.  Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in congratulating these three talented men who have distinguished  themselves  in  the  engineering  world as well as in their northeastern Pennsylvania community.

2000,86,2006-11-15,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate and honor one of my constituents, Charleston firefighter Phil Pfister on becoming the World’s Strongest Man.  This award was bestowed after a long and  arduous competition amongst 25 athletes from  around  the world. The  ten day contest  in  Sanya, China  included events such as bus  pulls, car pushes, stone lifts, and tire turns.  Mr. Pfister, is the first American to win this  competition  in 24 years. After  trailing  in  the  early events, Mr. Pfister focused his strength,  discipline, and determination to win the final  five events leading him to the title. His hard  work and dedication during  training certainly  paid off.  Nonetheless, after all his glory of winning  this prestigious competition, Mr. Pfister  returned to West Virginia a few days later and  promptly resumed his daily work of protecting  our wonderful city of Charleston as a  firefighter.  I am proud to honor Mr. Pfister for his accomplishments in the World’s Strongest Man  competition and his dedication to the Charleston community through his service as a fireman. West Virginia is truly fortunate to have  him as a Mountaineer.  f  CONGRATULATING KEN SMITH ON  HIS  RETIREMENT  FROM  THE  SANTA ROSA  COUNTY  SCHOOL  BOARD  HON. JEFF MILLER  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, November 15, 2006  ",2006
2001,86,2006-11-15,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to congratulate and pay tribute to Ken  Smith, who  is retiring  from  the Santa Rosa  County School Board after 28 years of service. Mr. Smith’s dedication to his community  and the education of its children is profound  and commendable.  Mr. Smith was born in Bagdad, Florida. He  first got active in the school system in Santa  Rosa County when he volunteered at his children’s schools as a PTA member. After serving as PTA President at Oakhurst Elementary,  he was elected to his first term on the Santa  Rosa County School Board in 1978. He is currently  the  second  longest  serving School  Board member in the State of Florida, having  served with 17 Board Members and 3 Superintendents. He has held the positions of Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board 7 times  each.  Through the years, Mr. Smith has served on  several Board committees, most notably  the  Vocational Committee, working with the State  to acquire  the Locklin Technical Center,  the  first and only vocational center  located  in  Santa Rosa County. He has also been active  in the Lions Club, Optimist Club, and the Ferris Hill Baptist Church.  Mr. Smith’s effort  to better Santa Rosa  County schools is admirable. His devotion to  the education of the children of his community  is inspirational. I congratulate him on his accomplishments and his retirement.  f  PAYING  TRIBUTE  TO  PRIVATE  FIRST CLASS PHILLIP B. WILLIAMS  HON. JON C.

2003,93,2006-11-15,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor  the  lives of  the 265 people who  lost  their lives on November 12, 2001 when American Airlines Flight 587 crashed into Belle Harbor in Queens, NY.  November 12 will always be a solemn day  in hearts of many, including my own. On that  fateful day, when the American Airlines Flight  587 crashed  into Belle Harbor Queens and  killed 260 passengers and 5  residents,  it  changed the lives of not just their families, but  also multiple communities here and in the Dominican Republic.  There is no rhyme or reason to such events.  No amount of time or information will ever answer why it happened. Just two months after  the tragedy of Sept. 11, the crash reminded us  all of how fragile our lives are and how precious are the moments we share daily with our  loved ones.  Leaders and government officials on every  level of government have tried to do their best  to ease  the grief of  the  families and bring  some sense of closure  to  this  tragedy. We  have  organized  economic  and  social  resources  for  relatives, pressed  the NTSB  to  conduct a  thorough  investigation, and urged  American Airlines to do what is right when settling with families.  There are, of course, still some outstanding  issues. Yet today, after a lot of hard work, we  will see  the unveiling of a memorial  that  is  more than a reminder of an unexplained tragedy, but a beautiful  testament  to how  they  lived.  They were  like millions of dreamers who  come to this land, strapped with hopes for a  better  life  for  themselves and  their children.  These immigrants bring a dynamic energy to  this land, achievements that can be seen in  every part of society. Yet no matter how successful they are here, no matter how grateful  they are to their American opportunities, part  of their soul still remain in their homelands.  For thousands of Dominicans, that first flight  of the morning—or any flight back to the Dominican—is what they dream about when they  are pulling  the  long hours, working multiple  jobs and stretching their paychecks to survive  in this city. It is more than their reward for a  job well done.  It  is  their chance  to enjoy a  home cooked meal by midday with those they  hadn’t seen  for months or years.  It  is  their  chance to feel complete again—if only for just  a couple of days.  It is not easy, but it is a sacrifice that many  do daily.  And so, while there is much to be sad about  today, we can all take comfort that this memorial will always serve as a  reminder of  the  beauty and strength of the Dominican people.  A reminder that the families of Flight 587 have  not been crushed by the weight of this devastating tragedy or the adversity that has followed.  A reminder that the spirit of a community did  not die  that day, but  instead, continues  to  grow and inspire others.  f  TROOPS TO TEACHERS  IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2006  HON. DORIS O. MATSUI  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, November 15, 2006  ",2006
2004,93,2006-11-15,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, today, my colleague, Mr. PETRI, and I introduced the Troops  to Teachers Improvement Act of 2006. I am  proud to bring this bipartisan effort before the  House.  I  first  learned about  the Troops  to  Teachers program at a California Purple Heart  Veterans Day event  in my district. Two different veterans who are participating  in  the  Troops to Teachers program spoke with me  about  the program and how  it had offered  them the chance to continue to contribute to  our country. After serving their country in the  Armed Forces, they were now able to teach in  high-need school districts.  With a slogan like, ‘‘Proud To Serve Again,’’  Troops to Teachers is a unique program that  provides stipends to military retirees to obtain  the necessary certification for a second career  in  teaching. Equally  important,  the program  places much needed math, science and special education  teachers  in  the classroom.  In  fact, over 46 percent of Troops to Teachers  participants  teach science, a significant  improvement over  the national average of 18  percent. Additionally, veterans who participate  in the Troops to Teachers program fill another  void  for male and ethnic minority  teachers.  Right now, our country is seeing 7 percent of  the Nation’s teaching force leave every year,  and we have a need  for highly qualified  science and math  teachers. Simply put,  the  Troops to Teachers program has never been  more important.  PETRI First authorized in 1993, the program was  designed to help members of the military obtain teaching credentials to teach in large districts with low-income schools. A variety of retired, separated, active duty and transitioning  military members and veterans—including disabled  veterans—are  eligible  to  participate.  Those who are interested are required to have  a bachelor’s or advanced degree, or if applying for a vocational or technical teaching position, are required to have at least 6 years of  experience in the field. The program has successfully recruited and placed almost 10,000  veterans in school districts since then. In my  home State of California, 571 veterans are  currently participating in the program.  Unfortunately, a small change under the No  Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, of 2001 greatly  affected where veterans could teach to fulfill  their stipend. In some areas of the country, retiring military and veterans  interested  in  the  program now have to drive 50 to 100 miles to  find an eligible school. This has resulted in a  20–30 percent drop-off in veteran participation,  which has seriously hindered  this productive  and necessary program.  The bill  that my esteemed colleague Mr.  and  I are  introducing  today would  fix  this error. The bill would allow participants to  fulfill  their  teaching obligation at any school  that receives title I funding, and is therefore,  considered a high-need school. Prior  to  the  NCLB change, participants were able to fulfill  their teaching obligation in any school within  my district in Sacramento, as they all receive  title  I  funding. However, under  the more restrictive rule, only 211 of the 350 schools in  my district are eligible. Currently, 61 percent of  the high schools in my district are not eligible.  I believe in this program and want to see  disabled and retiring military have a second  chance at serving our country. Recently, the  Disabled American Veterans magazine published a story about William Mimigia, a retired  Marine Corps major who proudly served in our  military  for 31 years. Now a middle school  special education teacher, Mr. Mimigia was recently named the 2006 Middle School Teacher  of the Year by the California Troops to Teachers program.  In  the article, he  is quoted as  saying, ‘‘I served with good people who sacrificed so much  for our country.  I promised  myself I would find a way to help them some  day. What better way than to help their kids  and the kids some of them would never have  a chance to have? Teaching lets me do that.’’  Mr. Mimigia’s  dedication  to  serving  our  country and contributing to future generations  is honorable. This program offers our returning  veterans an opportunity for them to feel the  same sense of fulfillment that Mr. Mimigia expressed. Troops to Teachers brings important  math, science, and foreign language expertise  to our  classroom and  fills a  critical need  among our educators. These characteristics  make Troops to Teachers an excellent source  of highly qualified educators and my colleague  and I bring this bill before the House today to  ensure that others can continue to serve our  country—whether  in  the military or  in  the  classroom. I hope that we can work swiftly on  this bipartisan bill to do just that, and will continue to support the ideals behind the Troops  to Teachers program in the 110th Congress.

2005,8,2006-12-27,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, it has  been an honor and a privilege to work  with Senator BILLFRISTfor the past 12  years. BILLhas been a solid leader for  our party and he has served the people  of Tennessee with distinction.  Senator  came  to  politics  through  a  nontraditional  route—  through the operating room. BILLgot  involved in politics because he believed  he could do even more  for his patients—and the people of Tennessee—in  the Senate. And he was right. BILL’s  meticulous approach to this job is exactly what you would expect of a person with his training. He never gave up  on his goals and worked tirelessly to  see them into law.  I became President Pro Tempore of  the Senate close to the time when BILL  became our majority leader. I enjoyed  working by his side and thank Leader  for including me—as President  Pro Tempore—in all leadership meetings. Senator FRISTalso traveled with  us to China for U.S. Interparliamentary Group meetings. Once our meetings were finished, he continued on to  Africa for medical mission work.  As majority leader, BILLcarried the  administration’s message. He  fought  hard for the President’s judicial nominees. And as we saw yesterday during  his  farewell address, BILL leaves us  with great honor and recognition. Our  leader will now return to where,  in  some ways, his heart has always been—  FRIST Senate  the practice of medicine. But deep in  my heart, I feel that public service will  again call BILLto give of his time and  talents to help preserve our democracy  and our freedoms. Catherine and I will  miss being with BILLand Karyn.  RICKSANTORUM  Mr. President, yesterday I was moved  by the emotional farewell of Senator  RICKSANTORUM. He said he still feels  the thrill of coming to work in this  building every day. The energy he put  toward his work in this Chamber, I will  remember  as  one  of  Senator  SANTORUM’s most striking qualities.  Senator SANTORUM’s enthusiastic direction of the Republican conference  rallied our majority. I believe he jeopardized his own future in Pennsylvania  by urging us to think and act for the  national good. Pennsylvania has been  served well during his time in Congress  and so has our Nation.  RICK’s energy has been of great benefit  to many charities, and he has  taken a  special  interest  in helping  those affected by autism. His efforts on  behalf of each of these causes have  been exceptional. And despite his many  commitments, RICK’s dedication to his  family and personal convictions never  wavered. Catherine and I wish RICKand  his family well.  GEORGEALLEN  Mr.  President,  Senator  ALLENhas served the Commonwealth  of Virginia with honor and integrity.  is a principled person,  folGEORGE  GEORGE lowing bedrock beliefs gained growing  up in a strong family.  These principles have led GEORGE to  promote and defend  freedom  in this  country and around the world. His legislative accomplishments are aligned  with this philosophy.  Senator ALLEN’s major accomplishments include the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, the 21st Century  Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, increased benefits for the  families of fallen troops, funding to upgrade telecommunications  infrastructure for minority-serving institutions,  and greater protections for intellectual  property.  In all of this, Senator ALLENhas not  forgotten who his  real boss  is:  the  American people. He has always, and  will continue, to put the interests of  this country above his own. That is a  true mark of a  leader, ald all Virginians can be proud to have been represented  by  a man with  Senator  ALLEN’s character.  As many of his constituents, colleagues,  and  friends know, Senator  ALLENclosed much of his correspondence with the words ‘‘keep winning.’’  Just like his dad, a Hall of Fame coach  who reached great heights and suffered  tough losses on the gridiron, we know  GEORGEwon’t let this setback define  him. We all expect him to ‘‘keep winning’’ for Virginia.  Catherine and I wish him and Susan  the very best.

2006,15,2006-12-27,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate a fellow Minnesotan,  Congressman MARTIN of Minneapolis,  on his distinguished career of public service.  The neighboring cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, MN, are known as the ‘‘Twin Cities.’’  As  the  representative  from St. Paul,  it has  been my privilege to serve in Congress with  my ‘‘Twin brother’’ MARTINSABO. After I was  first elected to the U.S. House, he immediately  became an expert mentor, always generous  with time-tested insights. I will never forget the  much-needed help he and his staff offered me  as I made a difficult transition into Congress  following the death of my predecessor, Congressman Bruce Vento. Six years on, we are  partners working to solve the problems facing  the  families of St. Paul and Minneapolis.  Through these collaborations, I have come to  admire his wisdom—garnered through his personal experience, knowledge and  integrity—  and recognize what the Congress will lose following his much-deserved retirement.  Martin’s public  life began 45 years ago  when he was elected to the Minnesota State  House of Representatives at the young age of  22. He went on  to serve with distinction as  both House Speaker and minority leader until  his election to Congress in 1978.  During his nine terms in the U.S. House of  Representatives, Mr. SABO’s patient dedication  to results and sound governance earned him  the respect and trust of his colleagues. In his  position on the powerful Appropriations Committee, Congressman SABO directed  federal  funds  to advance Minnesota’s  transportation  system and improve the quality of life for U.S.  soldiers and their families. As Chairman of the  House Budget Committee in 1993, he played  a central role in shaping and supporting President Clinton’s landmark budget, which righted  America’s fIscal course and set the stage for  years of unprecedented economic growth and  prosperity.  Outside of the House Chamber and Capitol  Hill committee rooms, Mr. SABO championed  causes close to his heart. He promoted educational and cultural exchanges between the  United States and Norway as a co-founder of  the Friends of Norway Caucus in the House.  As a fellow Norwegian, I can attest to the success of  these exchanges  in  reinforcing  the  bonds between Minnesota and Norway. Mr.  also combined his passion  for Minnesota Twins baseball with big league Washington politics by serving as  the  long-time  manager for the Democratic squad at the annual congressional baseball game where,  in  my opinion, he equaled Minnesota Twin greats  Tom Kelly and Ron Gardenhire.  Congressman SABO’S tactical mastery and  commonsense approach in the dugout is an  SABO honest metaphor for his model of leadership in  Congress. He worked on behalf of Minnesota  in the tradition of Minnesotans—with quiet dignity, progressive ideals and intent of purpose.  His instinct for good policy and a focus on the  needs of real people over partisan politics has  served his constituents and his country well.  We are honored to inherit his legacy of a public life, honorably lived. While I am certain his  wife Sylvia and his children and grandchildren  look forward to spending more time with him,  he will be dearly missed by his colleagues at  the Capitol.  f  HONORING MR. GEORGE MARTIN  FOR  HIS  LIFELONG  COMMITMENT TO PEACE AND JUSTICE  HON. GWEN MOORE  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 27, 2006  ",2006
2007,15,2006-12-27,Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to pay tribute to my constituent, Mr.  George Paz Martin, a longtime activist, community  leader and cherished  friend who  is  being honored  this month with  the Lifetime  Peacemaker Award by the Wisconsin Network  for Peace and Justice. I can think of no more  appropriate recipient for this award. Throughout his life, Mr. Martin has exhibited tireless  activism, a limitless command of skills and approaches, and a relentless pursuit of  justice  and peace.  There is scarcely a social justice issue on  which George Martin has not served a crucial  leadership  role. Coming of age  in  the civil  rights movement, he  fought  for equality and  desegregation in housing, education, and employment, among other things. He has served  numerous organizations that provide community development and services  for housing,  healthcare, and economic development. An  internationally  renowned peace activist and  Green Party leader, he is also extremely involved in local efforts to address the needs of  the veterans’ community.  Not only do his social justice interests know  no bounds, but his combination of skills and  approaches to the pursuit of justice make him  a relentless champion. Having worked in the  corporate world, he understands the utility of  marketing and promotions  in broadening  the  peace movement. He has built local, national  and  international coalitions against violence  within neighborhoods and among nations. He  is a highly sought-after public speaker, who  has participated in nearly every major peace  rally since the invasion of Iraq. He has traveled  throughout  the world building  relationships with other peace movements, and serving as a witness to the devastation caused by  war and violence.  Finally, Mr. Martin demonstrates seemingly  limitless personal commitment. He brings care  and compassion  to every struggle.  It  is  the  hallmark of his style  that he has crafted a  movement against the Iraq war that takes account of  the humanity of everyone  involved,  including  those  involved  in  the  fighting,  the  policymakers,  the peace  leaders and  those  who support the war.  I am indebted to George for his expertise,  his friendship, and the example of his leadership and I am honored to have this opportunity  to  thank him  for his  lifelong commitment  to  equality, peace, non-violence and justice.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

2008,15,2006-12-27,Mr. FATTAH.," Mr. Speaker, had  I been  present for the vote on H. Res. 1088 and H.  Res. 1091, I would have voted ‘‘yea.’’  f  COMMENDING CHAIRMAN HENRY  HYDE  HON. BETTY McCOLLUM  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 27, 2006  Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to commend Chairman HENRY  HYDEon a remarkable career and to congratulate him on his retirement from the U.S. Congress.  Chairman HYDE has honorably served  the  citizens of Illinois’ 6th District since 1975. He  has an impressive record of legislative accomplishments, has led two powerful committees  and has been conferred 8 honorary degrees.  I have had the honor to serve under Chairman HYDE on  the House  International Relations Committee for the past four years. During a time of growing international pressures,  he has led this committee with skill and dignity. His commitment  to  the  integrity of  the  House has taught me a great deal about the  legislative process. His respect for the minority, interest in listening to all voices and his  common-sense leadership has been critical in  ensuring civil debate and productive solutions  to extremely difficult problems.  This leadership was evident during the successful passage of the President’s Emergency  Plan  for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, which has  helped to bring needed urgency and attention  to this global crisis. Mr. HYDEand his committee staff enabled me, as a first term member,  to ensure  that my amendment  to set  aside 10 percent of funding for orphans and  vulnerable children was passed as part of this  bill. The enactment of this legislation is a testament  to Mr. HYDE’s ability  to bring people  and ideas together to make a real difference  for families around the world.  In March of 2005, I had the pleasure of traveling with a congressional delegation  led by  Chairman HYDE to Mexico and Panama.

FAILURETOENSURETHELAWSARE  FAITHFULLYEXECUTED  (1) Self-Exemption from Laws upon Signing.  (2) Suspension of Basic Legal Proceedings.  (3) Promoting Illegal War.  (4) Promoting Torture.  (5) Promoting Kidnappings and Renditions  for Torture.  (6) Use of Illegal Weapons.  II. ABUSEOFOFFICEANDOFEXECUTIVE  PRIVILEGE  (1) Obstructing Inquiry and Detection.  (2) Replacing the Veto with Signing Statements.  III. FAILURETOPRESERVE, PROTECTAND  DEFENDTHECONSTITUTION  (1) Suspension of Due Process.  (2) Unreasonable Searches and Seizures.  (3) Non-Cooperation with Congress.  (4) Establishment of an Unconstitutional,  Parallel Legal System.  I. FAILURETOENSURETHELAWSARE  FAITHFULLYEXECUTED  Under Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution of the United States of America, the  President has a duty to ‘‘take Care that the  Laws be faithfully executed.’’ George Walker  Bush, during his tenure as President of the  United States, has repeatedly violated the  letter and spirit of laws and rules of criminal  procedure used  by  civilian  and military  courts, and has violated or  ignored regulatory codes and practices that carry out the  law, has contravened  the  laws governing  agencies of the executive and the purposes of  these agencies, and in conducting the foreign  affairs of the United States of America has  proceeded in flagrant violation of the core  body of  international  laws, to which the  United States of America is bound by treaty.  With respect to domestic law, this conduct  has included one or more of the following:  (1) Self-Exemption from Laws upon Signing. Since assuming the office of President of  the United States, George Walker Bush has  attached signing statements to more than  one hundred bills before signing them, within which he has made over eight hundred  challenges to provisions of laws passed by  Congress, a  figure that exceeds the total  number of such challenges by all previous  presidents combined, and has used this practice to exempt himself, as President of the  United States, from enforcing or from being  held accountable to provisions of the said  laws.  (2) Suspension of Basic Legal Proceedings.  In dereliction of his duty to uphold the law,  George Walker Bush has systematically violated basic  legal and criminal procedures  that require any search, seizure, arrest or detention to be non-discriminatory, based on  probable cause and sufficient evidence to  warrant a stated charge, that provide access  to legal counsel, arraignment and the option  of bail within a period of days, and that require reasonable and non-coercive interrogations, rights of silence, as well as privy communications with counsel and with others,  pending an outcome of either release or a  speedy and public trial, conducted in accord  with federal and state statutes on criminal  and court process, the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, applicable  international  law,  or  appeals  to  higher  courts that apply. By ordering mass arrests  and  indefinite detentions based on  indiscriminate profiling of specific populations,  George Walker Bush has also systematically  violated  laws  prohibiting harmful  extraditions, secret arrest and custody, and denial  of defined and legal periods of detention or  incarceration.  With  respect  to  international  law,  this  conduct has included one or more of the following:  (3) Promoting Illegal War. Abraham Lincoln wrote in 1848, ‘‘Allow the President to  invade a neighboring nation whenever he  shall deem it necessary to repel an invaslon  and you will allow him to do so whenever he  may choose to say he deems it necessary for  such purpose, and you will allow him to  make war at pleasure. If today, he should  choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may  say to him, ‘I see no probability of the British invading us,’ but he will say to you, ‘Be  silent; I see it, if you don’t.’’’ In direct violation of Articles 41 and 42 of the United Nations Charter, a treaty ratified by the United  States Senate in 1945 and therefore the supreme law of the land as according to Article  VI of the Constitution, George Walker Bush  has advanced and executed a policy based on  so-called  pre-emptive  or  preventive war,  whereby  the United  States  of America  claims the right to unilaterally assault, invade or occupy other nations without first  engaging in collective measures with other  member states of the United Nations or first  gaining the prior assent of the United Nations Security Council, and whereas George  Walker Bush did apply  this doctrine by  launching a war of aggression against the  sovereign nation of Iraq, resulting  in the  deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians  and thousands of United States military personnel, without United Nations Security  Council authorization, whereby said George  Walker Bush, as President of the United  States, by advancing a doctrine of preventive  war and initiating and continuing the invasion and occupation of Iraq by United States  forces did commit and was guilty of precisely such abuses as Abraham Lincoln foresaw.
