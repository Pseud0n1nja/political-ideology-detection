0,House,100,-0.431,10,2,Mr. HOWARD.," Mr. Speaker, I ask  unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5legislative days in which to  revise and extend their remarks in re spect  to  the  concurrent  resolution  presently under consideration.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore  (Mr.  MuRTHA). Is there objection to the re quest  of  the gentleman  from New  Jersey?  There was no objection.  ",1987
1,House,100,0.178,10,2,Mr. ROEMER.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank, along with my colleague, Mr.  TAUZIN, and I am sure my colleagues  who follow, Mr. LIVINGSTON particular ly,  the leadership of the House and  the committees involved in working on  this problem.  I would  like  to  thank  JIM HOWARD specifically and BOB ROE.  Chairman RoE has worked with the  Louisiana delegation for some time in  trying to do the right thing, trying to  draw  the  line  legally  between our  desire for clean water and our need to  protect the interests of the citizens of  Louisiana, both those who have  jobs  involved  and  those who drink our  water.  The problem with the clean water  bill was not the heart of the bill. It  was good. We supported  it for  that  reason. But section 306 in that bill did  undercut the rights of the State and  concerns of  the citizens over clean  water vis-a-vis the dumping of gypsum  in the Mississippi River.  0 1235  This solution found  in the concur rent resolution, drafted in large part  by  the gentleman  from New Jersey  [Mr. RoE], with some help from the  Louisiana delegation,  is an excellent  solution.  It does not mean that the problem  will go away;  it just means that the  gypsum cannot be dumped arbitrarily  and without some findings as to the  health results. I think it is the higher  ground; I think it is the clean ground,  and if we put these two items togeth er, H.R. 1, the clean water bill, and the  concurrent  resolution <H. Con. Res.  24), I think we have a chance to attest  to  the people of Louisiana  that we  have done the right thing.  So, in closing, I would like to thank  my colleagues in the Louisiana delega tion who have worked most diligently  on  this,  including  the gentlewoman  from Louisiana [Mrs. BoGGs] and the  gentleman from Louisiana  [Mr. Liv INGSTON] and others. I would also like  to thank the leadership of the Com mittee on Public Works and Transpor tation and the leadership of the House  of Representatives.  ",1987
2,House,100,0.253,10,2,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the able  gentlemen from Louisiana  [Mr. Liv INGSTON],  a  former member of our  Committee  on  Public Works  and  Transportation.  ",1987
3,House,100,0.326,10,2,Mr. LIVINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  want to join with my colleagues, the  gentlemen from Louisiana, Mr. TAUZIN  and Mr. RoEMER, and with the dean of  our delegation, the gentlewoman from  Louisiana, LINDY BOGGS,  in thanking  the leadership on both sides, the gen tlemen from New Jersey, Mr. HowARD  and Mr. RoE, on the Democratic side,  the gentleman  from Arkansas, Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT,  and  the gentleman  from Minnesota, Mr. STANGELAND, on  the Republican side for their working  with the Louisiana delegation to cure  this problem.  In  fact,  section 306 was defective  when it was first concocted. There is  still  some degree of mystery about  how it was concocted, and I am still  deeply resentful that there was some  representation made by non-Members  of the House to Members of the other  body to the effect that the Louisiana  delegation was all on board on  this  provision as  it  is  currently written.  That simply was not the case, but we  have  to come  together here  in  the  House today in a somewhat convolut ed procedure to remedy what was done  previously.  I  just want to reemphasize how ap preciative I am of the leadership for  their working together with the Lou isiana  delegation  in  rectifying  this  past mistake.  In fact, the provision was vague as it  was originally written. It appeared as  if it might have mandated the dump ing of harmful materials in the river.  The provision that we are about today,  House  Concurrent  Resolution  24,  clearly sets forth the fact that the ma terials,  if,  in fact,  they are harmful,  will not go  into  the  river without  ample opportunity granted  to oppo nents to object.  This provision allows the experts to  weigh in on this most serious problem  and to make their own determination  about its impact. It retains to all par ties  the option of  taking their case  through  the natural processes, as  if  they might  have  done  before  this  problem arose.  We have passed H.R. 1. The other  body will  soon pass  a  like  edition.  House Concurrent Resolution 24,  if  passed here and  in  the Senate, will  amend section 306 to the agreement of  industry,  environmentalists,  the  sewage and water board, and the Lou isiana delegation. Again,  it is  in the  spirit of compromise and cooperation  with all parties that we are able  to  come here today to make this adjust ment and ultimately send on H.R. 1, as  it should have been sent initially, to  the President for his signature.  I want to again thank all the leaders  for working together with us and hope  that this provision will be expeditious ly passed, not only in the House, but  in the other body as well, and that it  will be added to the major bill-H.R.  l-as it currently stands.

4,Senate,100,-0.355,23,2,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, today,  along with 55 of my colleagues, I am  introducing the Prompt Payment Act  Amendments of 1987. The purpose of  this legislation is simple and direct; To  eliminate  the ambiguities and close  the loopholes in the Prompt Payment  Act of 1982. My colleagues will recall  that the Prompt Payment Act address es problems  in getting  the Federal  Government to pay its bills on time to  those contractors who furnish goods  and services to the Government.  At the outset, let me point out that  the amendments to the Prompt Pay ment Act made by this bill are identi cal to those contained in S. 2479, the  Prompt  Payment  Amendments  of  1986. S. 2479 was unanimously passed  by the Senate in the closing days of  the  99th  Congress.  Unfortunately,  time did not allow for consideration of  this important measure in the House.  The Prompt Payment Act has led to  significant  improvements  in  the bill paying practices of the Federal Gov ernment. Unfortunately, many Feder al agencies exploit ambiguities or loop holes in the act to pay contractors late  while avoiding late payment interest  penalties called for in the act.  ",1987
5,Senate,100,-0.362,36,2,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, as  chairman of the Committee on Small  Business, I am pleased to join as a co sponsor of the Prompt Payment Act  Amendments of 1987, which is being  introduced by my good  friend  from  Tennessee, Senator SASSER. The small  business community has consistently  sought vigorous enforcement of  the  Prompt Payment Act of 1982,  ever  since they won the hard-fought fight  to see it enacted into law. Having had  4 years of experience under the act,  they now are calling upon Congress to  close loopholes and clarify certain pro visions, which the executive agencies  have skillfully used to deny the act's  protections  to many  small business  government contractors.  The Prompt Payment Act Amend ments of 1987 make the same modifi cations to the Prompt Payment Act as  S. 2479, which passed the Senate in  the closing days of the 99th Congress  but which, unfortunately, was not con sidered by the House. S. 2479, was in troduced by Senator TRIBLE, who was  then a member of the Small Business  Committee, and was  the product of  oversight hearings conducted by our  committee. These were first congres sional oversight hearings  conducted  regarding the implementation of the  Prompt Payment Act. At the time of  its passage, S. 2479 had garnered 44 co sponsors, including a majority of the  members of the Small Business Com mittee. Senator SASSER's bill, which  has Senator TRIBLE as its principal co sponsor, has won even stronger bipar tisan support with 56 cosponsors.  The Small Business Committee has  been in the forefront of the effort to  see that Government contractors, and  especially small business government  contractors, who have performed their  contracts  to  the Government's satis faction are paid in a timely fashion, or  else  awarded  late-payment  interest  penalties as provided  in  the act.  would  like  to  share with my  col leagues, Mr. President, a brief history  of  the Small Business Committee's  long-term dedication  to prompt pay  reform.  The committee held the first con gressional hearing on the problem of  I  ",1987
6,Senate,100,-0.309,140,2,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent that the Journal  be approved to date, even though this  is not a day following an adjournment.  ",1987
7,Senate,100,0.322,140,2,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I  thank  the distinguished majority leader. We  will pursue the possibility of clearing  the committee funding resolutions. I  understand  there could be, possibly,  one  amendment on  staff  allowance  that could be offered. I have asked my  staff to see precisely what the amend ment might be and check with Senator  STEVENS, who is the ranking Republi can on the Rules Committee.  So we would hope  that we  could  work out something to dispose of the  committee  funding  resolutions,  I  would assume, unless  there  is  some  controversy, without votes. Most of  them are rather routine. Perhaps we  could do that tomorrow. As the distin guished minority  leader  indicated,  there is also the arms control resolu tion which,  I understand,  is  in  the  final stages of clearance. Perhaps that  could be ready, as he suggested, by to morrow.  So it would be my hope that we can  accommodate the distinguished major ity leader. As I have said at the outset,  it is good to expedite the business of  the Senate. We want to be a party to  it. That may not always be possible. It  seems to me in these early days there  is no need for much pushing and haul ing. We will have enough of that I  assume later on in the year.  BICENTENNIAL MINUTE  JANUARY 21, 1861: JEFFERSON DAVIS' FAREWELL  ADDRESS  ",1987
8,Senate,100,-0.379,153,2,Mr. MATSUNAGA.," I thank the Sen ator from Maine, Mr. President, and I  ask  the distinguished floor manager  for the minority and ranking minority  member of the Subcommittee on the  Environment, Mr. CHAFEE, whether or  not he concurs with the chairman of  the subcommittee, Mr. MITCHELL, and  this Senator from Hawaii, on the ex pressed legislative intent of section 306  of H.R. 1?  ",1987
9,Senate,100,0.084,153,2,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, if the  junior Senator from. Hawaii will yield,  I wish to state for the record that I  fully agree with his expressed under standing of  the  legislative  intent of  section 306 of H.R. 1.  ",1987
10,Senate,100,-0.347,153,2,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President,  I  would like to comment briefly in re sponse to some of the remarks made  by  the distinguished Senator  from  Idaho  in  support of  the substitute  amendment and in opposition to H.R.  1, the legislation that has been over whelmingly approved by the Congress  previously.  Just two points: The Senator argues  that sewage treatment preventing the  pollution of our Nation's waters ought  not to be a responsibility of Govern ment. He said that the answer to this  problem is to turn the private sector  loose on it, and we ought not to have  any kind of Government program. My  response to that is that before 1972 we  did not have any significant Federal  program to deal with the problem of  water pollution in our country. And as  a result, almost every major river in  the United States was a stinking, open  sewer. The American people could not  swim. They could not fish. They could  not boat in their Nation's rivers.  Since 1972, since we passed the Fed eral Clean Water Act, hundreds and  hundreds  of American  rivers  have  been cleaned up. And  the American  people overwhelmingly want this pro gram to continue.  So in response to that point, I say  that we have had a  long experience  with what  the Senator  from  Idaho  suggested is the answer to this prob lem, and it was demonstrably not the  answer  to  the problem. The answer  lies in passing H.R. 1.  Finally, before I yield to the distin guished Senator from Massachusetts,  who I note has come onto the floor, I  would respond to a second point made  by the Senator from  Idaho. He op posed that provision in H.R. 1 which  deals with nonpoint sources of pollu tion by repeating the statement made  by the distinguished minority leader  last week who said it is Federal land  use planning. He said it is a mandatory  program that will force the farmers to  do what they otherwise would not do.  I say that is absolutely false. There  is nothing in this bill which requires  any State in the country to adopt a  program to deal with nonpoint source  pollution. The bill provides that each  State will make an assessment of the  problem. If a State does not make an  assessment of the problem, the EPA  will make one in that State for the  purpose of establishing national data  on  this problem. This  is a problem  which the EPA itself, the Reagan ad ministration EPA,  says causes more  than half of the remaining water pol lution problem. After that, no State is  compelled to adopt a program to con trol nonpoint source pollution.  If the State of Idaho, the State of   Kansas,  the State of Maine or any  other State says, ""We do not want a  program,"" that is it, there will be no  program.  The decision on whether to adopt a  control program with respect to non point source pollution  is  entirely a  State decision. If a State does decide  to go forward, as most sensible States  will, then there is a participating pro gram in which they can request assist ance. So it is absolutely false, untrue,  and misleading for anyone to say that  this is Federal land use planning.  The bill was carefully crafted with  the interests of the States in mind,  and that is what is contained in the  bill.  I urge Members of  the Senate  to  look  at  the  provisions  of  the bill  before making a  judgment with  re spect to this allegation regarding Fed eral land use planning.  Mr. President, I now yield 3 minutes  to the Senator from Massachusetts.  ",1987
11,Senate,100,-0.443,153,2,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  I  think it is only appropriate that the  Senate of the United States face this  extremely compelling issue as one of  the first items on the agenda of this  Congress. I think one of our most im portant  responsibilities  is  to  try  to  ensure that America the Beautiful will  be inherited by the next generation.  One of the key elements in America  the Beautiful  is  having  the  clean  streams, clean rivers, and clean har bors which have been so much a part  of our history and tradition and which  have been despoiled in past years, par ticularly during  the  industrialization  of America.  Now we are at a critical crossroads.  We must face the crossroads by pass ing this measure in a bipartisan way  this afternoon.  I wish to speak about the region and  the State which I represent and about  what  this  is going  to mean  in  the  cleaning up of one of the important  areas of New England-the Boston  Harbor.  The kinds of efforts which are being  undertaken at  the State  level  and  among the communities that border  on the harbor have really been out standing. Many of those people who  live in the area near the harbor have  middle or lower incomes. They are pre pared  to see a dramatic  increase  in  their rates in order to invest in trying  to provide for the cleaning up of one  of the most important waterways  in  our country at this time.  The way  this program has been  fashioned, the way it is supported by  the States and the local communities  is a  tribute  to  the very deliberative  and bipartisan style by the members  of  this  committee. This  legislation  really offers enormous hope and op portunity to those who are committed  to the clean water of this country.  It has important and long-lasting im plications in terms of eliminating from  our streams, rivers, and harbors, the  hazards which can affect the quality  of  health  of  the most  vulnerable  people in our society, the children in  our Nation. This  legislation makes  sense from every point of view. It is a  sound investment in America.  Many people on this floor are debat ing this bill on the budget issue. Cer tainly, that is a consideration. But the  most important consideration is what  we are doing for our country. This is  the bill,  this is  the time,  this is the  issue. I am hopeful that this bill, H.R.  1, will be passed by an overwhelming  majority on both sides of the aisle.  Mr. President, I support H.R. 1 and I  urge my Senate colleagues  to vote once again-to send a  strong Clean  Water Act to the President. This bill  addresses the critical nationwide prob lems of polluted harbors and water ways and provides vitally needed re sources for  the construction of new  sewage treatment facilities  to ensure  clean waters for the future.  Last year,  in an  ill-advised action,  President Reagan chose to pocket veto  the bill after Congress had adjourned,  but now we have a chance to pass it  again and enact it into law.  I am especially pleased that the bill  contains $100 million for the cleanup  and revitalization of one of the Com monwealth's most  important natural  and  economic  resources-Boston  Harbor. Few cities have a resource as  magnificent  as  the harbor.  It  is  a  unique asset that witnessed a signifi cant part of our Nation's history. With  its scenic shoreline, its 30 islands and  thriving port facilities, the harbor is a  priceless economic and environmental  treasure.  It has suffered heavy environmental  damage from the tremendous industri al  and  residential  growth  of  the  Boston area in recent decades. The re sulting pollution and decay has threat ened the natural beauty of the harbor  and  jeopardized  the  prospects  of  ",1987
12,Senate,100,-0.266,166,2,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr.  President,  today I rise to speak about a matter of  critical importance to the proper man agement of one of this Nation's most  precious resources. Due to the arid cli mate in my own State, the value of  water  is  temendous. Precipitation  is  not plentiful and water is not natually  renewed as fast as it is used. There fore, water treatment facilities carry a  great  burden  in  providing  quality  water for the citizens of New Mexico.  It is for this reason that I urge swift  passage of S. 1, a bill to fund the initi ation  and  continuation  of much  needed  water  treatement  projects  across  this  country.  In addition  to  such projects, water pollution prob lems  requiring  immediate  attention  continue to rise at alarming rates and  cry out for immediate attention.  This bill will renew funding for ex isting water  pollution  control  pro grams, and begin efforts  to control  certain pollution problems  that  the  current law has not given proper at tention to.  The measure also gradually phases  out the Federal Construction Grants  Program. To ease  the  transition  to  State and local responsibility, the bill  provides grants for the establishment  of State  revolving  loan  funds. The  State revolving funds would be used to  make low-interest loans to communi ties in need of sewage treatment sys tems. Loan repayments would later be  used to make new loans, thus provid ing a self-sustaining source of money  for States to finance local construction  after the Federal Construction Grants  Program ends.  A Federal grants program  to help  cities construct sewage treatment sys tems is badly in need of reauthoriza tion.  In addition,  this bill creates a  new State-Federal program to control  polluted  runoff  from  farmland  and  city streets, tightens controls on toxic  pollutants, and authorizes funding for  various other activities to clean up the  Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams. To gether, the State revolving fund pro grams  and  the  construction  grants  would  receive $18 billion over fiscal  years 1986 through 1994.  While this is an enormous figure, I  believe that this is a  reasonable and  responsible figure for several reasons.  Without  this reauthorization, com munities in New Mexico would lose as  much as $11.9 million. Albuquerque,  for example, would  lose $5.2 million  for continuation of waste water  in struction and, as a result, it would put  a halt to the $7 million total project.  While $18 billion may be interpreted  by some to be exorbitant, it is, in fact,  small compared to the total cost of  needed projects, now estimated by the  Environmental Protection Agency  to  be over $75 billion. The fact is that the  longer we wait to fund these needed  projects, the higher the cost will be.  So it is cost efficient to act now.  In  addition,  this  authorization  is  consistent with the commitment, made  by the administration as part of the  1981 amendments to the Clean Water  Act, to support funding at the $2.4 bil lion level through fiscal year 1991. In  return for this long-term funding com mitment, Congress  agreed  to  lower  annual authorizations-authorizations  in fiscal year 1979 and 1980 were $5  billion-a  lower  Federal  share  of  project costs-55 percent rather than  75 percent-and a  reduction  in  the  types of projects eligible for Federal  assistance. As a result, this legislation  is the fulfillment of the commitment  already made by the Federal Govern ment, and without it we are leaving  many local  jurisdictions in my State  and elsewhere high and dry.  Furthermore,  of  the  $18  billion  amount, $8.4 billion will be used to es tablish State  revolving  loan  funds.  These State funds will be paid back by  communities and will provide a  long term investment in water quality fa cilities.  This bill  is a very  responsible ap proach to a critical problem. It repre sents  a  substantial  compromise  be tween the costs of the many necessary  water quality projects and the need to  control Federal spending. Most impor tantly, I feel that this legislation ad dresses the need to properly manage  and improve a resource that is certain ly a vital element in all biological proc esses;  in our water sources  lies  the  very basis for  life  itself. In light of  storm and farm runoff, industrial and  sewage pollution, acid rain and other  water contaminants, I believe that this  bill will have a beneficial effect on this  planet's  future  capacity  to  sustain  animal and plant life.  Again, I urge strong support for the  Clean Water Act of 1987. It is a wise  and  necessary  investment  in  our  future.  ",1987
13,Senate,100,-0.313,166,2,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President,  4  months  ago,  the Senate  considered  legislation  to  reauthorize  the Clean  Water Act. This reauthorization was  literally years in development. It rep resented a true compromise, with sub stantial cost-sharing provisions, and a  revolving loan program as well as Fed eral grants. The legislation broadened  Federal responsibilities: Nonpoint pol lution and urban runoff, storm water  control,  the  cleanup  of  toxic  ""hot  spots""  for especially degraded water  quality, etc. At the same time, the leg islation retained a solid financial com mitment  in  the part of the Federal  Government to assist regions and lo calities with  the  less glamorous but  ",1987
14,Senate,100,0.495,192,2,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, I send a  joint resolution to the desk and ask  for its immediate consideration.  ",1987
15,Senate,100,0.115,205,2,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent,  the Tax Reform Act of 1986  made several changes that will signifi cantly affect the tax liability of all of  the Nation's taxpayers. One of  the  provisions of the act raises the amount  that  taxpayers must have withheld  from wages from 80 percent to 90 per cent of tax liability. Individuals who  fail to meet the new withholding re quirement are subject to both penal ties and interest under section 6654 of  the Internal Revenue Code.  Today I am introducing legislation  along  with  Senators  DANFORTH,  .WALLOP, ARMSTRONG,  and BOSCHWITZ  that would waive the penalty and in terest provisions of section 6654  for  those individual taxpayers whose esti mated tax and withholding payments  satisfy at least the 80 percent test of  prior law. This waiver is temporary; it  will only apply until April 15, 1988.  And it only applies to individuals, not  to corporations.  Mr. President, anyone who has had  the opportunity to review  the latest  IRS W-4 withholding allowance form  will understand why it is  imperative  that this legislation be adopted. The  new withholding  form  is  incredibly  complex. At four pages in length, it is  twice as long as the form it replaced  and more complex than many actual  1040 income tax returns.  In order for many taxpayers to com pute  their withholding  allowances,  they will have to do a variety of com plex calculations and fill in as many as  46  separate  lines  of  information.  Indeed the form  is so complex that  IRS suggests that taxpayers consult  four  separate  IRS  publications  to  make sure that their withholding  is  correct.  One of the reasons we adopted the  Tax Reform Act of 1986 was to dimin ish some of the complexity that has  befuddled taxpayers  in recent years.  Unfortunately, the new W-4 does just  the opposite. I strongly urge that IRS  give serious consideration to replacing  the new W-4 with a shorter and sim pler form that is intelligible to those  of us who do not have graduate ac counting degrees.  Mr. President, I would note that last  week,  the distinguished chairman of  the Senate Finance Committee, Sena tor LLOYD BENTSEN, wrote to the IRS  asking the Service to  issue a similar  W-4  form. Although  I  applaud  the  chairman's action, I believe more must  be done to ensure that taxpayers are  not penalized for the bureaucratic in difference of the IRS.  The  failure of  IRS  to develop  a  simple and straightforward W-4 form  makes  it difficult,  if not  impossible,  for  most  individual  taxpayers  to  comply with the 90-percent withhold ing requirement that we adopted  in  the Tax Reform Act. I can assure you  that millions of taxpayers will make a  good faith effort to fill out the W -4  only to find out that when their tax  returns are due, they have not met the  90 percent test.  To subject  these  taxpayers  to  the  penalty and interest charges of section  6654 would  just not be fair. That is  why I have introduced this legislation.  It recognizes that taxpayers will inevi tably make errors in calculating their  withholding only because the IRS has  not provided a suitable form for calcu lating withholding. The  90-percent  withholding  requirement allows  tax payers little margin for error. This leg islation  allows  taxpayers  greater  leeway in 1987 to assess the appropriate amount to withhold without being  subjected to statutory penalties.  Once taxpayers have had a chance  to compare their 1987 withholding cal culations with their final 1987 tax li ability, they will be able to recompute  their withholding in 1988 to meet the  90-percent test. In the meantime, IRS  should make every effort to redesign  the current W -4.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the bill be included in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 350  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION I.

16,Senate,100,0.196,205,2,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr.  President,  Senator DOLE,  Senator  GRAMM  of  Texas, and I are introducing today a  bill which would  require mandatory  random drug testing of safety-sensitive  personnel related to the railroad  in dustry  and  the  aviation  industry.  These would  include,  in  the case of  aviation, employees not only of air lines, but of the FAA as well.  Under present  law, Mr. President,  there are no  requirements for drug  testing for airline personnel. There are  no  requirements  for  drug  testing  under present law for the FAA.  With respect to railroads, there is a  requirement for testing in the case of  initial employment, in the case of an  accident or for probable cause. Other wise, there is no requirement for rail road personnel.  The tragedy of the accident of an  Amtrak train and Conrail train several  weeks ago brought home to all of us  ",1987
17,House,100,-0.088,270,2,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Speaker, we do  not have unlimited funds to fund all  the things that the Government would  like to do. In the field of national de fense, we particularly have needs that  need to be met and must be expedi tiously and fully met.  In view of that, we should not rush  into  spending  a  large  amount  of  money, a crash program for SDI.  I have asked the staff of the Com mittee on Armed Services to come up  with a  figure, an appropriate figure,  for this year. The figure they have so  far given me is $3.1 billion, not the $6  billion that the President is asking for.  He is asking for $5.8 billion plus $500  million,  and  that  is  an  excessive  amount of money, a crash program  that  is bound  to  lead  to waste and  bound  to keep us from having ade quate funds for our conventional war fare.  to  GIVE US A CHANCE TO DEBATE  55  <Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend her remarks.)  ",1987
18,House,100,0.238,270,2,Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska.," Mr.  Speaker, when we debate the rule on  the highway bill today, we will have  an opportunity to defeat the previous  question.  I urge my colleagues to vote no on  the previous question.  Voting down the previous question  will not delay further consideration of  the bill.  And  that's important. We need  enact a highway bill.  But voting down the previous ques tion will give us another chance  to  debate whether turning the business  of making  traffic  laws back  to  the  States is a good idea.  We want to have the opportunity to  debate  an  amendment  that would  allow-not require-the States to  in crease the speed limit to 65 miles per  hour on  interstate  routes  in  rural  areas  for  a  5-year  demonstration  period.  I think this amendment is fair and  extremely reasonable. So reasonable,  in  fact,  that  if  the House were  to  debate  it  today,  it would probably  pass.  Let's do  ourselves  a  favor.  Let's  debate this, vote on it, and return the  business of setting speed limits to the  States-where it belongs.  CONGRATULATIONS TO THE  DENVER BRONCOS  <Mrs. SCHROEDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",1987
19,House,100,-0.225,270,2,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, I  would like to join the many football  fans throughout the country in con gratulating  the Denver Broncos on  winning  the American  Conference  championship and earning a  trip  to  Pasadena to play the New York Giants  in the Super Bowl.  I would  also  like  to congratulate  those devoted Bronco fans in Colorado  who have supported the team through  good times and bad times, in the best  of weather and in the worst of weath er, in normal costumes and in not so  normal costumes. They have packed  the stadium since 1970,  leading  the  AFC in most consecutive sellouts and  have consistently applauded the Bron cos since their first game in Denver in  1960. It is  fitting  that the Broncos,  who began their AFC career with a  record of 4 wins, 9  losses, and 1 tie  would end  their  last regular season  with a record of 11 wins and 5 losses.  I  realize that the odds makers are  predicting the Giants to win the Super  Bowl by 9 points, but I am confident  the Broncos will pull an upset and  leave such a strong taste of ""Orange  Crush"" in the mouths of the Giants  that it will take more than a barrel of  Gatorade to wash it away.  ",1987
20,House,100,0.162,270,2,Mr. RAVENEL.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing a bill which would pro vide for the continuation of the sus pension of any duty on certain men thol feedstocks that are utilized by do mestic manufacturers to produce syn thetic menthol. There being no domes tic menthol  feedstocks  capacity, we  must import these raw materials from  abroad, primarily from West Germa ny. If the suspension of this duty were  permitted to expire it would impose an  unnecessary economic burden on the  American manufacturer by increasing  production costs.  To relieve this unnecessary burden  Congressman Hartnett, my predeces sor, introduced a bill in 1984 to tempo rarily suspend the duty on menthol  feedstocks. That bill was ultimately in corporated  into  the Miscellaneous  Tariff Act of 1984, Public Law 98-573.  Under Public Law 98-573 the suspen sion of this duty will expire December  31, 1987.  Unfortunately,  the situation facing  our domestic menthol industry has not  changed since 1984: There are still no  American producers of menthol feed stocks, so  the American menthol  in dustry must still import raw materials  and compete with highly subsidized,  cheaply produced menthol products in  foreign markets. In 1984, the market  price for the finished menthol product  was $10.70 per pound.  In 1986,  the  market price steadily declined due to  foreign subsidization and protection of  their menthol producers. This price  decline has had a severe impact on our  domestic industry. The United States  has only one manufacturer of men thol, whose plant is located in my dis trict. This company has maintained its  market share over the past few years,  however this situation will not contin ue if the suspension of this duty is not  extended.  My bill would simply provide for the  continuation of  the duty suspension  for 5 more years, until December 31,  1992. I understand that Senator THUR MOND will be introducing a companion  measure in the other body.  Mr. Speaker, I  realize this bill will  not solve all our country's trade prob lems, but it will allow one domestic in dustry  to  compete  against  foreign  manufacturers and help many Ameri can workers to keep their jobs. I trust  the House will help me in the early  passage of this legislation.  0 1435  A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE  MINIMUM WAGE  <Mr. KLECZKA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1987
21,House,100,-0.322,270,2,Mr. KLECZKA.," Mr. Speaker,  the  time has arrived for Congress to raise  the minimum wage. Since it was last  increased in 1980, inflation has eroded  the value of the wage by over 25 per cent.  In some areas of  the country an  adult with two children can actually  receive more from basic welfare bene fits than from a job that pays the min imum wage. Raising the wage provides  individuals with a strong incentive to  find work, and would help to break the  cycle of dependency on public assist ance.  ",1987

25,House,100,-0.258,296,2,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to engage  the gentleman  from California [Mr. ANDERSON]  in a  colloquy to address the need for con struction of two highway projects in  my district.  The  surface  transportation  bill  which  is now being considered has  been crafted  to address  the serious  problems faced by States and localities  across the Nation charged with main taining and  improving  the Nation's  transportation infrastructure. It is my  hope that the passage of this legisla tion will help alleviate these problems  and will help expedite the construc tion of much needed highway  im provements in rural areas which have  not benefited from the construction of  the  Interstate System.  I  represent  such an area, and two much needed  projects in my district, the Highway  156 Hollister bypass and the Highway  101 Prunedale bypass, have been de layed  for  years  largely  because  of  problems with  the Federal highway  program in California.  Fortunately, as we've discussed, the  surface transportation bill now under  consideration  includes  a  provisiOn  which  should  help  alleviate  these  delays. As  I  understand  it,  section  117(a) would allow States to transfer  up to 20 percent of their Interstate 4R  funds to the Federal-aid Primary Pro gram. This would allow States greater  flexibility  in allocating funds  to the  areas with the greatest need. In Cali fornia, I believe, the greatest need in volves primary route projects in dis tricts such as mine which have no  interstate routes. It is my understand ing  that  this  provision will  allow  States to expedite the construction of  projects  such  as  the Hollister  156  bypass and the Prunedale 101 bypass.  ",1987

27,House,100,0.283,296,2,Mr. GRANDY.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to take this, my first opportunity to  address my colleagues of  this 100th  Congress, to rise in support of H.R. 2,  The Surface Transportation and Uni form Relocation Assistance Act  of  1987.  There are many provisions of this  bill that are of great concern to the  people of Iowa and rural America; spe cifically  the elimination of  the one half-percent minimum guarantee for  interstate construction, and the pro posed change in the Interstate 4R for mula. However, these provisions shold  not jeopardize the timely passage of  the entire package. This may not en tirely be the bill we want. It is the bill  we need, and we need it by March of  this year at the latest.  I know that many of the Members  from States in the Northeast, North west,  and  upper-Midwest  share my  fears  that, should Congress prolong  its' deliberation of this bill, the 1987  construction season may be lost, which  could mean a loss of almost 10,000 jobs  in Iowa alone, jobs that are directly re lated to the estimated $164 million al located for the State in 1987.  For  Iowa and  the people of  the  Sixth District, this would be a serious  blow to an already faltering economy  suffering from a lack of jobs, a need  for economic diversity, and a farm-to market infrastructure heavily depend ent on its' highways and bridges.  I hope the House passes this legisla tion quickly,  I hope the other body  passes their legislation quickly. And I  hope the conference committee swiftly  returns a bill that is equally favorable  to both urban and rural America.  ",1987
28,House,100,-0.422,348,2,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, on January 7,  1987,  I  introduced  legislation  to  create  a  Center on Biotechnology  Information within  the National Library of Medicine of the Nation al  Institutes of Health-essentially a manhat tan  project-to  formulate an  understanding  about the most debilitating and common dis eases, such as heart disease, arthritis, and  cancer.  Scientists now generally agree  that killing  and crippling diseases such as cancer which  claims the lives of 420,000 each year, arthritis,  which  afflicts  16  to  20 million Americans  today, and heart disease, which claims about  800,000 lives annually are influenced in com plex ways by the functions of one's genes. My  belief is that one of the best investments this  country can make will be  in supporting  re search  to help understand some of  these  complex relationships.  Five  decades ago,  I came  to  the U.S.  Senate and chaired the Subcommittee on War  Time Health and Employment. This subcom mittee was created subsequent to the finding  that nearly 4 million young men were rejected  from  the draft because they were not phys ically or mentally equipped. We recommended  the first major increases in Federal financing  for health  research-the outcome of which  reaped enumerable benefits for the health and  well-being of millions of Americans.  By 1950, 6 of the existing 12 National Insti tutes of Health were enacted into law. By the  early 1970's,  five more  Institutes were cre ated, leaving the last-the National Institute of  Arthritis-which I sponsored, to be signed into  law this last Congress.  These  last four decades of growth  in  the  Federal Government's  commitment  to  re search has vastly improved the American way  of life. The miracles of our efforts are every where to be seen.  We have vaccines that have virtually elimi nated most  childhood  diseases;  sanitation  systems and pasteurization  that have  taken  the clout out of infectious diseases; the high  technology of microsurgery, kidney dialysis,  vital-organ  transplants,  coronary  bypasses,  plastic surgery, machines that scan the body  and the brain and do the work of the heart.  We have conquered diseases  that have  killed millions over the centuries and have ex tended  life expectancy beyond  the wildest  predictions of just a generation ago.  Yet,  in spite of our immense progress, the  mysteries of many debilitating and deadly dis eases,  like cancer and Alzheimer's disease,  cystic  fibrosis, Parkinson's, arthritis and  the  like, still remain to be solved.  Today, we are confronted with a similar  challenge-the need to enhance our research  commitment  for  the betterment of mankind.  That is why I am today introducing legislation  which would create a Center on Biotechnol ogy Information within the National Library of  Medicine of the National  Institutes of Health.  This Center would serve as a repository and  as a national base for distribution of molecular  information.  How will  the creation of a National Center  on Biotechnology  Information help  in our ef forts to conquer many diseases against which  we are now relatively helpless? Quite simply.  The world's top scientists now agree  that  biotechnology holds great promise for unlock ing  the mysteries of many debilitating dis eases.  Because of biotechnology, we already can  prenatally detect some 15 genetic diseases,  including cystic fibrosis, Duchenne's muscular  dystrophy, sickle cell disease, and hemophilia.  Work is also progressing on other diseases  that are {suspected of having a genetic basis,  including heart diseases and cancer. New nat ural drugs and vaccines. Life saving therapies.  Pain-saving interventions.  All  these are the result of biotechnology research and development  involving  the all  important molecules that control our life proc esses-how our bodies grow, how we age,  whether we suffer a host of mental and physi cal diseases.  The  central  focus  of  biotechnology  is  DNA-deoxyribonucleic acid-the long,  twist ed threads in the nucleus of each of our 1 0  trillion cells.  Like the rapid escalation of aerospace tech nology which led from Kitty Hawk to the Moon  in less than 70 years, the pace of acquisition  of vital information about inner space is accel erating dramatically.  Unfortunately,  information systems now  in  use  to gather and analyze  this data cannot  keep pace with this surge of new information.  In order  for society  to benefit  from  the  in creasing rate and volume of new knowledge  in this field of biotechnology, great advances  will also be required in the science of comput er storage,  retrieval, and comprehension of  the detailed records of the new discoveries.  If we are to prevent our scientific progress  from grinding to a halt, we need a central re pository for storing and sharing  the  informa tion  resulting  from current genetic research.  The National Center on Biotechnology  Infor mation, which my bill would establish, would  accomplish that objective.  Working with the laboratories from which in formation comes, experts at this center would  seek to coordinate data as it is accumulated to store, process and make it available to the  research community, nationwide.  At such a center, computer scientists-with  the help of some of the world's outstanding  molecular  researchers working next door at  the  National  Institutes  of  Health-would  create new computer information systems so  that investigators throughout the country could  ask questions and get answers quickly.  They would encourage consistent terminolo gy for researchers and data bases so that re search results entered into computer systems  could be shared and be made widely avail able.  We need such a center to prevent duplica tion of research and to get more out of our re search dollar. We need  it to fit together the  pieces of the genetic puzzle and acquire the  knowledge  that would benefit humankind  in  many ways.  With  such knowledge, we  could develop  deeper understanding of the root causes of  diseases  that still plague us. This  is  true of  diseases we know are  inherited, of course,  like sickle cell anemia or thalassemia.  Scientists feel  that our  likelihood of falling  victim  to the common and serious diseases,  like heart disease, cancer and arthritis, may  well be influenced in complicated ways by the  workings of our genes.  Researchers aim now to learn more about  these genes, and their relation to each other.  From  this deeper understanding would come  exciting new cures and interventions.  It  is estimated  that $10 million per annum  will be required to carry forth the provisions of  my bill and make the center a functional reali ty.  Under no circumstances should the financ ing of the new Center for Biotechnology Infor mation utilize funds diverted from those to be  made available  for other research. This  is a  new effort-an ambitious venture-an invest ment  for our  lifetimes and  for  the  lives of  unborn generatior .s.  It is a well calculated attempt to meet the  most  important medical  challenges of our  time. The basic knowledge  learned from se quences  the human genome  is predicted  to  unlock secrets which help  in our efforts  to  fight many diseases against which we are now  relatively defenseless.  The genetic code contained  in our cells is  nature's language of life. Hopefully in under standing  the gene,  the health status of all  future Americans will be vastly improved.  I urge my colleagues to support this mean ingful bill.  CURBING  DRUG  ABUSE-THE  NEED  FOR A  SUSTAINED BI PARTISAN EFFORT  ",1987
29,House,100,-0.435,348,2,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, with  the pas sage last year of omnibus drug control legisla tion Congress sought to devise a comprehen sive, bipartisan strategy to curb drug abuse.  Regrettably,  the bu_dget submitted by  the  Reagan  administration  ignores,  to a great  extent,  the  funding  levels  recommended by  Congress  in  that  historic  legislation.  The  Reagan  budget  proposes  to  eliminate  all  funds authorized to assist State and local gov ernments  in  their drug enforcement efforts.  Funds for prevention and education programs  are drastically reduced below the  levels au thorized by Congress.  How can we expect to win the war on drugs  if we are not willing to commit the necessary  resources to do it?

30,,100,-0.404,387,2,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  acknowledge before Congress  the  fine and  always  entertaining  work  of Mr.  Richard  Simon,  the Sacramento Union's first full-time  arts critic. During his 21 years with the Union,  Mr. Simon has both enlightened and amused  us with his humorously avant-garde reviews of  Sacramento's varied cultural offerings, and  I  am sad to note his retirement in early Decem ber of this year.  Originally from Cleveland, OH, Mr. Simon at tended the University of Chicago, majoring in  French and graduating in 1949. After several  years of traveling and teaching in England and  France, he worked as a publicist in New York  before moving  to  the west coast, where he  began his journalistic career in the 1950's.  Mr. Simon's  first  position was with  the  Solano Republican in Fairfield. Later he acted  as  the news editor for  the daily Democrat's  Davis bureau. On September 10, 1965, Mr.  Simon began his long and fruitful association  with the Sacramento Union.  1805  Over the last 21 years, Mr. Simon has es tablished himself as an  institution, a  touch stone  in Sacramento's art world. Yet  it was  not  longevity, nor even his  trademark pun filled prose which did  this;  rather,  it was his  sense of honesty and  integrity when dealing  with artistic concerns. Mr. Simon was not a re viewer to constantly praise or belittle perform ances.  Instead, he brought vitality and genu ine critique to the field. His unique and often  thought-provoking observations sprang  from  an unusually perceptive and educated mind.  Mr. Simon has deemed it time to move on,  and his contributions to Sacramento's artistic  community will be greatly missed. Mr. Speak er, on behalf of the people of Sacramento,  I  would  like to congratulate Richard Simon on  his extended achievement and service to our  city, and offer my sincere best wishes to him  in all of his future endeavors.  THE SPACE PROGRAM: AN  INSIDE VIEW  HON. ROBERT J. LAGOMARSINO  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 21, 1987  ",1987
31,,100,0.378,387,2,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  there  has been a lot of discussion during the past  11 months about what went wrong with our  space program. I would like to share with my  colleagues some  thoughts from someone di rectly involved in the program, and therefore,  imbued with a certain sense of realism and  perspective. I include the remarks of my con stituent, Mr. Donald Sharp, at this point in the  RECORD:  I have worked in aerospace project man agement/planning for over 26 years. I have  experienced successful and failed launches,  the Apollo fire tragedy, reductions in force  brilliant and inept/biased management, and  numerous  other  high  and  low  points.  Throughout, I have been proud of our space  program and my association  in unmanned  launches and manned missions in Mercury,  Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle.  Subsequent to the Challenger disaster, I  am appalled  that our program has now  become subject to  the emotions of politi cians and a  few prima donna astronauts  that have brought our program to a stand still. This is of particular importance when  we  should  be  establishing  and working  toward new firm goals to again become the  world leader in space exploration and devel opment. Yet since the Challenger disaster  we have dithered like children. It is obvious  to me they do not understand the inherent  nature of aerospace. Further, they appar ently have little concern for the thousands  of people who have been affected by their  emotional overreaction.  On  the  first manned  launch we knew  there was an extreme risk to the astronaut  on board. As a test pilot, he was also well  aware of the risk. As we successfully proc essed flight after flight we knew the proba bility of a disaster was greatly increasing.  Thru a malfunction we almost lost a lunar  mission. But, we were heroes, no lives were  lost as a realtime resolution safely brought  the  crew  home. Although  emphasis has  always been to launch as safe a vehicle as  possible we always knew there could never  be a 100% safety factor when considering  ",1987
32,,100,-0.413,400,2,Mr. COELHO.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  early  this  month,  the Edison Electric  Institute held  its  governmental affairs conference  in Phoenix,  AZ. Among those who addressed the confer ence was the chairman of the House Subcom mittee on Water and Power Resources, Con gressman GEORGE MILLER.  In  his  speech,  Chairman MILLER outlined several  important  priorities  for  the  subcommittee. Of  special  note is his concern with public power prefer ence and  the Bonneville Power Administra tion's intertie access policy. I thought my col leagues would be interested in reading his re marks:  INTRODUCTION  Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate this  opportunity to address EEl's annual govern mental affairs conference. EEl has a  long  and distinguished reputation of service  to  the electric utility industry. I'm pleased to  have this opportunity to address those who  represent the industry so ably on Capitol  Hill and in State capitols.  As Chairman of the Interior Water and  Power Subcommittee,  I'll be directly  in volved in a number of issues affecting you  and your companies. In addition, as ranking  Democrat on the Full Interior Committee,  January 21, 1987  I'm sure our paths will  cross on other  energy or nuclear safety matters.  Since I haven't had  the opportunity  to  work with most of you, I thought I'd take  this chance to let you know more about me.  My preferences and prejudices; what I'm for  and against; the approach I'll take on issues  affecting your industry.  YOUR PRINCIPLES  Environmental laws  During my  twelve years  in Congress,  I  have developed a strong voting record on  environmental  issues.  I'm proud of  that  record and I don't intend to change. I be lieve  strong and  effective  environmental  laws are essential and should not be ignored  or  abused. However,  environmental  laws  must be flexible and allow for reasonable  economic development, including energy de velopment.  It is inevitable that conflicts will arise be tween development and preservation. The  Interior Committee will face a classic case  when we consider  legislation  to open  the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and  gas leasing. I believe we must address each  of these conflicts openly. I can assure you  that I will be open, accessible and willing to  listen to both sides.  Subsidies  Throughout my career,  I  have worked  hard  to  reduce or eliminate subsidies  to  those who  develop  resources  on  public  lands. These resources shouldn't be  indis criminately ""locked up,"" but on the other  hand, they shouldn't be given away at ""rock  bottom prices.""  A fair and competitive price for public re sources  is often  the best mechanism  for  judging whether such resources should be  developed, when and where. Too often in  the past, we  have made  these  resources  available  at  ridiculously  low  prices  and  under lax development standards. The re sults are predictable.  The Federal treasury has been denied bil lions of dollars in revenue and environmen tal conflicts have needlessly developed. Our  present need for  revenues  to balance the  budget demands that we receive top dollar  for Federal resources.  Nuclear power  Concerning nuclear power, I recognize it is  an  important element  in our energy mix.  However, safety is a major concern wth the  public and that concern can't be ignored.  I don't believe nuclear power will assume  increased importance as ari energy option  until it regains the public's confidence. This  won't be done with slick advertising cam paigns. Plants will have  to be operated  safely and efficiently. Waste will have to be  transported and stored safely.  The best test of nuclear power's viability  remains the private market place. If nuclear  power is  to gain a  larger share of energy  production,  several  things will  have  to  happen. The industry will have to recognize  the concerns regarding safety and their re sponsibilities under Price-Anderson to share  the  costs  of  accidents. They  shouldn't  expect a free ride.  The Federal government, on  the other  hand, has a responsibility to address such  problems  as nuclear waste and  licensing  reform. The Government must do so in a  manner which develops public confidence  and trust, rather than suspicion about using  these programs as a political football.  ",1987
33,House,100,0.466,413,2,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker, in the 4  years  I  have been  in  the Congress  there  is one  impression  that stands  out and that is the quality of our col leagues. The dedication  to our  jobs,  the hard work and the long hours is  proof of our commitment to service but that is not the issue.  The issue is the integrity of the in stitution. A democracy works because  of a bond that exists between its lead ers and its people. That bond is based  on faith and credibility.  How do we  ask  the people back  home to have faith in our leadership  when we will not do what we  are  asking them to do; that is, to ask less  of Government or pay higher taxes to  solve the deficit problem.  ",1987
34,,100,0.523,478,2,Mr. CHENEY.," Mr. Speaker, I have today in troduced  legislation  to preserve  the Aban doned Mine Lands Reclamation Program by  making it clear that program expenditures and  the  Internal  taxed by  benefits are not to be  Revenue Service.  This  legislation became necessary after a  recent district  IRS  ruling  in Ohio which has  cast a pall over mine reclamation programs of  the  Federal Government  and  the  several  States.  The  IRS  case  concerned  a  reclamation  project sponsored by the State of Ohio under  its Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program.  The State paid part of the cost of cleaning up  an area seriously damaged by past mining.  The district office of  the  IRS subsequently  ruled  that  the entire amount of  the State's  payment  had  to  be  considered  as  gross  income by  the  taxpayer participating  in  the  project, even  though part of the project was  located on a neighbor's property, and even  though a significant portion of  the project's  benefits accrued to the public at large, rather  than the taxpayer.  Although  this  ruling applied only to a par ticular case  in Ohio,  it has already had  the  effect of seriously disrupting  reclamation ef forts throughout the country. Citizens involved  in  reclamation activities are  reluctant  to pro ceed for fear of the tax consequences raised  by this action.  For example, the program manager of Wyo ming's Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program  indicated in a recent letter that[TJhe current undefined nature of  the  problem places the AML Program in a posi tion where it cannot accurately inform land owners of  the potential  tax consequences  when they consent to have their land re claimed or the hazards on their property  abated. Unable  to obtain  landowner con sent, some $20 million worth of construction  work shall be delayed by late spring, 1987.  Officials at the U.S. Department of the Inte rior who administer  the Federal Abandoned  Mine Land Reclamation Program have ex pressed  a  similar  concern.  In  September  1985, Assistant Secretary Steven Griles wrote  a letter to IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs  seeking the withdrawal of the Ohio opinion on  the grounds  that  it contained  ""both  factual  and legal errors * * *."" Mr. Griles noted, ""We  are particularly concerned about the possibility  that this opinion may be considered for appli cation on a national basis.""  Mr. Speaker,  it would be a shame  if  the  considerable  worthwhile  activity  going  on  throughout the country to heal the scars and  clean up  the messes caused by past mining  were to be hindered because of this obscure  action by the IRS.  To keep that from happening, the legislation  I have introduced would change current law to  specify  that gross  income does not  include  payments or economic benefits resulting from  payments under the Federal Abandoned Mine  Reclamation Program enacted by Congress in  1977.  For the benefit of those who are not familiar  with the problems caused by the Ohio ruling,  following  is  the  test of  the  Interior Depart ment's letter to IRS.  It makes clear the need  for legislation.  I invite my colleagues from States with Mine  Reclamation Programs to join in cosponsoring  this bill, Mr. Speaker.

DEAR COMMISSIONER: We are enclosing a  District Internal Revenue Service Opinion  concerning  the  tax  consequences  for  an  Ohio  family  that participated  in a State  sponsored mine land reclamation program.  We believe the opinion includes both factu al and legal errors and respectfully request  that the opinion be withdrawn. We are par ticularly  concerned  about  the  possibility  that this opinion may be considered for ap plication on a national basis.  The case  in question concerns  two cost sharing grants  from  the State of Ohio  under its Abandoned Mine Land Cost-Share  Program, Ohio revised Code 1513.28. This  program funded solely from State revenues  provided grants  to  landowners  to reclaim  lands that have been adversely affected by  past mining practices. These mining activi ties have imposed social and environmental  costs in the form of unusable unreclaimed  lands, water pollution, erosion, loss of fish  and wildlife resources and a decline in the  natural environment.  In many  instances,  the condition of these lands creates serious  health and safety  threats  to  the general  public through uncontrolled refuse and un derground  fires, unstable spoil and waste  piles and unsafe impoundments. Indeed, the  lands are  truly ""abandoned"" in the sense  that neither current nor prior landowners  have a legal responsibility to reclaim them.  The Ohio reclamation program, much like  other reclamation programs, seeks  to cor rect this past legacy by providing landown ers funds necessary to restore the land to its  original productivity. It is the general public  that gains from this program and not specif ic individuals.  The case in point involved the restoration  of 132 acres of strip-mined land owned by  the taxpayer and 68 acres owned by a neigh bor. There was no agreement between the  taxpayer and this adjoining landowner for  reimbursement, and the State required the  reclamation of the entire 200 acres in order  for the taxpayer to participate. Pre-apprais als of the taxpayer's land placed the value  of approximately $15,200 or at about $100  an acre. The land in question contained old  refuse piles and sediment filled streams that  caused the flooding of nearby agricultural  lands which were not owned or controlled  by the taxpayer. To correct this continuing  threat to the public at large and to prevent  further economic decline of local agricultur al production,  the State provided the tax payer $930,000 in two grants to remove the  sediment from the streams and reclaim the  old gob piles. The post-appraisal of the 200  acres placed its new market value at $35,000  with its highest and best use still being wild life habitat or pasture land. The benefits de rived from  this project clearly accrued  to  the community at large and not to the tax payer.  The  local  Internal  Revenue  opmwn  found, based on these facts, that the total  cost-share payments <$930,000) for the rec lamation of the taxpayers' 132 acres and the  68 acres of his neighbor were includable in  the gross  income of  the  taxpayer  in  the  years received.  In our opinion,  this  is an  absurd result, one that would have dire con sequences for many Government sponsored  reclamation programs.  Our specific concerns with  Opinion are:  the District  ",1987
35,Senate,100,-0.598,504,2,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, the  Senate Banking Committee has  just  completed 3 days of intensive hearings  on urgently needed banking  legisla tion. As chairman of the Senate Bank ing Committee, I expect the commit tee to report legislation to the floor of  the Senate next month  for  action.  Some of this legislation has virtually  unanimous support from our commit tee. Some of it is controversial. There  is no question we need action on this  legislation. We  need  it now. Why?  Why do we need this action so urgent ly?  First, if Congress fails to pass legisla tion to strengthen the Federal Savings  and  Loan  Insurance Corporation known as FSLIC-a number of savings  and loan institutions located primarily  in the Southwest and West will  fail  under circumstances that will serious ly threaten the savings and loan insur ance fund. In fact, it could mandate a  multibillion dollar appropriation from  the Federal Government to make good  the  implicit  ""full  faith and credit""  commitment that lies behind Federal  insurance of the Nation's savings and  loans.  Meanwhile what happens with every  month  that passes without congres sional action? Consider: FSLIC is the  federally backed S&L insurance fund.  That fund has been depleted because  of a sharply  increased series of fail ures of insured S&L's. More such fail ures  are  expected  later  this  year.  Faced with  this outlook,  the Home  Loan Bank Board is kept from moving  promptly to remedy the situation be cause it has insufficient resources to  do so. The consequences: The eventual  losses of the system sharply increase.  The likelihood that FSLIC funds will  become  inadequate greatly  increases  because the need for funds will be so  much greater because FSLIC did not  act in a timely way.  So what are  the  long-term actions  the industry must take to prevent the  situation  from getting worse? What  must the industry do to move onto a  sound basis in the future?  Certainly Congress should promptly  pass legislation to meet the imperative  borrowing needs of FSLIC. This will  not effect the budget. It will not come  from appropriated funds. It will come  from borrowing from  funds supplied  by  the  regular  insurance  premium  charge on the country's S&L's.  Aside  from  this,  should Congress  mandate a substantial increase in the  notoriously  low  capital  ratios with  which so many S&L's now operate?  How can Congress require savings and  loans  throughout the country  to  in crease their capital ratio within a rea sonable period? Can this be done with out closing many more S&L's that  cannot reach a  reasonable standard?  Why is it that this industry was able  to  function  for so many years with  little  difficulty  and  few  failures  through a number of recessions? Why  has there been such a series of failures  in the recent past? Is it related to the  end of the S&L's advantage that was  enjoyed with  their  favorable  regula tion Q differential? Has it been caused  by  the movement of S&L's out of  home financing and into much riskier  and more speculative areas? These dis asters have not occurred in a deep de pression. They have occurred in the  middle of one of the longest uninter rupted economic recoveries in the past  50  years.  Imagine  the problem we  could face when the country has  its  next recession, which is overdue right  now.  One action the Senate could take to  help the savings and loan industry is  to end the potential big-scale invasion  of  their  deposit  base  by  nonbank  banks. Nonbank banks  also pose  a  threat to S&L's because they dramati cally diminish  the market for failed  S&L's. Why should a big bank or S&L  that is anxious to get into a particular  market do so by taking over a failed  S&L when it can avoid that grief and  achieve  the same end by  forming a  ",1987
36,,100,0.203,517,2,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, today, I am  introducing a package of five bills covering a  number of agricultural areas which need our  attention. Included are three bills dealing with  dairy policy, a bill to ensure that agricultural in terests are properly  represented at  the up coming General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade [GATT] talks and a bill which would es tablish a blue  ribbon  commission  to  study  ways  to  improve  the quality of  life  in  rural  America.  The dairy termination program which was in cluded in the Farm Security Act of 1985 has  been highly successful  in  reducing  the dairy  surplus. The slaughter of nearly 1 million head  of dairy animals already has significantly de creased  total milk production,  reduced Gov ernment purchases of cheese,  butter, and  nonfat dry milk and increased milk prices.  The  Minnesota-Wisconsin  price  series,  which  is  the base price  in determining what  dairy producers around the country receive for  their milk,  increased a total of 93 cents and  reached a high of $11.91  in November 1986.  In general, dairy economists from around the  country are predicting higher prices for farm ers in 1987 than they received in 1986.  So, why am I introducing legislation that will  change our current dairy policy when every thing seems to be going quite well?  Considerable study of the current dairy pro gram and the future course it should take will  be considered both inside and outside of Gov ernment over  the next several months. The  National Milk Producers Federation, which  represents about 70 percent of the milk mar keted  in  the United States, has created a  study committee to consider the future of the  current dairy price support purchase program  and whether it should be replaced by an alter nate program.  In addition,  the National Dairy  Policy Commission, which was  established  through the Food Security Act of 1985, is also  evaluating our current dairy policy and will be  making recommendations to Congress.  DAIRY TARGET PRICE ACT  Believing it is the proper time to provide in centives to the dairy industry to better market  and distribute our dairy products while still  supporting the dairy producer, I am reintroduc ing my Dairy Target Price Act which will direct  limited  Federal  dollars  to  our  smalland  medium-sized  family  farms, create additional  sales of dairy products, promote orderly mar keting of those products and eliminate Com modity Credit Corporation purchases.  Specifically, a target price would be estab lished at $12.1 0 per hundredweight of 3.67  percent butterfat milk. A dairy producer will re ceive a direct deficiency payment equal to the  amount by which the target price exceeds the  greater of the M-W series price for a particu lar month and  the  recourse  loan  rate  of  $10.10 per hundredweight which would be  available to plants and processors.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Payments would be made directly  to pro ducers on a quarterly basis and would be lim ited to $20,000 per producer.  Due to the fact that the Dairy Target Price  Act would replace  the current purchase pro gram, a recourse loan program is created for  plants and processors to provide  for  the or derly marketing of dairy products.  If a plant or processor cannot sell a product  due  to poor market conditions, a  loan  from  the Federal Government in amount of $10.10  per hundredweight of 3.67 -percent butterfat  milk equivalent to  facilitate  in  the storage of  dairy products until market conditions improve.  The loans would be made on a recourse basis  and bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per  annum. Loans would have to be repaid within  9 months-products could not be forfeited to  the CCC.  FREEZING THE PRICE SUPPORT LEVEL  The dairy price support  level was reduced  to $11.35 per hundredweight from $11.60 per  hundredweight on Jaunary 1, 1987. Another  25-cent reduction is scheduled for October 1 ,  1987. Since the dairy termination program has  brought supply and demand  into better bal ance,  the authority for the Secretary of Agri culture to reduce the price support level is no  longer necessary. Being able to assure farm ers of a stable minimum price over the next 4  years and knowing  the possibility  that major  dairy legislation will not be considered by Con gress, prompted me  to  introduce this bill.  In  the short term, this legislation may be the one  vehicle in which we can gain consensus in the  dairy industry.  Specifically, the bill eliminates the authority  for the Secretary of Agriculture  to  impose a  25-cent cut in the support price this October  and the additional 50-ce_nt cuts slated for Jan uary 1, 1988, January 1, 1989, and January 1,  1990 if dairy products exceed 5 billion pounds  on those dates. The bill gives dairy producers  an  incentive to cut back by keeping  the au thority to raise the support price by 50 cents  annually if CCC purchases are projected to be  below 2.5 billion pounds annually.  CONSOLIDATION OF MARKET ORDERS  The present system of marketing fluid milk,  with  the 44 separate Federal milk marketing  orders, has restricted  the marketing of fresh  fluid milk to areas which experience shortages  of milk at certain times of the year from those  areas which can supply fluid milk needs year  around.  The bill would remove the artificial barriers  to the transportation of milk which are now in  place and thus provide greater market flexibil ity. By regionalizing the transportation of milk  we would permit more equitable sharing of  proceeds  from  the  sale of  fluid milk and  reduce the consumer cost of fluid milk through  smaller transportation differentials.  Specifically,  the bill would consolidate  the  44 Federal milk market orders  into a single  national order with between  three and  six  basing points. A basing point is the place from  which transportation differentials-the cost of  moving fluid milk-are calculated.  AGRICULTURAL ADVISERS FOR THE GATT  For the first time ever, agricultural trade will  be a focal point in the GA TI talks. The Food  Security Act of 1985 has brought the major  1935  agricultural  trading  countries  to  the GA TI  table because of their concern over the grain  and export provisions  in  it. Perhaps, at no  other  time  in history has  the United States  had so much to gain and so much to lose with  regard to agriculture trade.  The upcoming GA TI talks are providing us  with a forum  in which we can strengthen our  export share and regain lost markets. Due to  the vital importance of agricultural trade to our  economy it is  imperative that our negotiators  receive  the  proper  advice  on  agriculture  issues  from Members of Congress who are  experienced and knowledgeable in the area of  agriculture.  My bill would allow  the Speaker of  the  House to select members of the House Agri culture Committee and the President pro tem pore of  the other body  to select members  from their Agriculture Committee to advise our  negotiators at  the GA TI talks  in Geneva,  Switzerland. These advisers would be in addi tion to the advisers appointed from the House  Ways and Means Committee and  the other  body's Finance Committee.  NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF RURAL  AMERICA  rural ~merica.  The  problems  in  rural  Ame~ica ar~ not  uniquely farm problems. The ent1re soclo.eco nomic  fiber and  the  traditional  institutional  base of  rural America are  threatened. Our  transition in agriculture is forcing a transition in  rural communities. It is time we call upon our  best experts  in America  to guide us  in  the  necessary steps  to maintain or u.pgrade  th.e  quality of life and delivery of serv1ces to th1s  changing rural landscape.  Farmers and members of their communities  have made progress  in developing solutions  to the problems they face. The bill would es tablish a blue ribbon Presidential commission  which would make recommendations  to pro mote and develop  the agricultural and non agricultural economic base  in  The commission would study ways to Improve  the  integrity and delivery of quality  care, education, housing, and  transportation  service to our rural areas.  The President would appoint a bipartisan  group of 28 commissioners, who would be pri vate citizens or representatives of State and  local government.  Certainly, we have seen positive results and  made significant strides in reducing our dairy  surplus. The dairy related bills I am intro~uc­ ing today are viable and passable alternatives  to our current dairy policy and give us a posi tive, long-term approach to dairy policy.  Likewise, the bills to appoint agriculture ad viser to the GA n  talks and the establishment  of a commission to study ways to improve the  agricultural and nonagricultural base  in  rural  America will give farmers a voice in the trade  talks and the opportunity to come to Congress  with a unified position on what needs to be  done  to ensure  the  future economic vitality  and quality of life of our rural community.  he~lth  ",1987
37,House,100,-0.186,556,2,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, when I  was watching  the Super Bowl  on  Sunday,  I was watching with very  mixed emotions. I had hoped that the  Washington Redskins would be in that  preeminent affair but, of course, the  New York Giants were.  So I was somewhat saddened but my  heart was  lifted when  the perform ance of the little native, Phil Simms,  quarterback for the New York Giants,  actually not only won the bowl game  but earned him most valuable player  honors.  As  the Chamber knows,  it  is my  honor to represent the community of  Louisville  and  Jefferson County  in  which Phil grew up and played high  school football.  Of course, he played his college foot ball  in  the Commonwealth of Ken tucky at Morehead State.  Let me  just say that it was with  mixed emotions, but the general emo tion and the one that won out at the  end was to salute Phil Simms and of  course Tom Jackson, who played with  Denver and played his collegiate ball  at the University of Louisville, on a  job well done for America and since  that game was beamed around  the  world to sort of introduce football at  that level to the entire globe.  I wish you well, and good luck to you  in the coming year.  WELCOME BACK, MR.  PRESIDENT  <Mr.  SOLOMON  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",1987

39,House,100,-0.038,556,2,Mr. HUBBARD.," Mr. Speaker,  to night President Reagan will deliver his  seventh annual State of the Union Ad dress to the 100th Congress at the be ginning of the 200th anniversary of  the Federal Constitution.  When future historians  reflect on  the events of recent years, they will no  doubt hold us all accountable for the  continued record Federal budget defi cits and accompanying collapse of the  congressional budget process that has  characterized the past several years.  We are currently leaving a legacy of  debt for our children and grandchil dren vividly symbolized by  the now  routine use of the continuing resolu tion.  The  continuing  resolution  has  become an annual escape mechanism  which confounds a  rational Federal  fiscal policy.  I urge President Reagan in his State  of the Union Address tonight to issue  the 100th Congress a warning-that he  will not tolerate another bloated con tinuing resolution. He should say to night that he will veto any continuing  resolution that reaches his desk and  thereby  force  the Congress  to pass  each of the 13 appropriations bills separately and on time before October  1.

41,House,100,-0.361,569,2,Mr. MANTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of House Joint Resolution 1 02 to pro vide an urgent supplemental appropriation of  $50 million  to aid  the homeless. This much  needed legislation would  transfer $50 million  from the Disaster Relief Program operated by  join  the Federal Emergency Management Agency  to FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Pro gram.  Mr. Speaker, there are an estimated 2 to 3  million homeless people in the United States.  Furthermore, a rising number of families who  have lost their homes and cannot find afford able housing are  joining  the  ranks of  the  homeless. In New York City and in many cities  across the Nation, the problem of homeless ness has reached crisis proportions. Local au thorities and nonprofit groups are unable  to  handle the rising number of persons seeking  shelter from the elements.  House Joint Resolution 1 09 will provide the  funds  necesssary  to meet  the  immediate  needs of the homeless by providing emergen cy shelter while  the Congress develops a  long-term plan to address this national trage dy.  I have joined a number of my colleagues  in cosponsoring  legislation, H.R. 558,  to es tablish a comprehensive homeless relief plan.  This bipartisan legislation would provide $500  million for emergency shelter, food and health  care programs to assist the homeless. In addi tion  to  funding FEMA's Emergency Shelter  Programs,  funding would be provided  for a  newly authorized transitional housing program  that would move the homeless out of shelters  and  into group homes with support services.  In addition,  the measure would establish a  new program to convert underutilized Govern ment buildings to shelters for the homeless.  While  this comprehensive  legislation envi sions a long-term solution to the problem of  homelessness, there is an  immmediate prob lem which we must address. Congress must  enact House Joint Resolution 1 02 to provide  emergency assistance to those less fortunate  Americans who are without shelter.  Mr. Speaker,  I want to commend you and  the distinguished chairman of the Appropria tions Committee for bringing  this emergency  legislation to the floor. I urge my colleagues to  vote for House Joint Resolution 1 02.  ",1987
42,House,100,-0.578,569,2,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of House Joint Resolution 1 02,  the  emergency  supplemental  appropriations bill  that had been approved last week by the Ap propriations Committee,  transferring $50 mil lion from the Federal Emergency Management  Agency's [FEMA] Disaster Relief Program  to  its Emergency Food and Shelter Program  to  aid  the homeless in our society. The Appro priations  Committee's  actions  follow  the  House Democratic Steering and Policy Com mittee's resolution on January 21st, urging this  Congress  to  take a  leadership  role  in  the  effort to provide the food, shelter, and critical  medical  assistance  needed  by  homeless  people throughout America.  Mr. Speaker, homelessness  is an urgent  and growing problem. It is a problem that we  would be inhumane to ignore. Although exact  statistics have been subject to debate,  it is,  nevertheless, clear that more Americans are  homeless  today  than at any  time since  the  Great Depression, and the number is growing.  This  reality becomes even more disturbing  when we  consider  that  the needs of  the  homeless extend  far beyond  the need  for  simple protection from the elements.  According  to a recent study conducted by  th'9 U.S. Conference of Mayors,  in 1986, our  Nation experienced a 20-percent increase in  the demand  for emergency shelter. Further more, it is anticipated that homelessness will  increase by 87 percent in the 25 largest U.S.  cities in 1987.  According  to  the U.S.  Task  Force  on  Hunger and Homelessness, an average of 24  percent of the demand by American cities for  funding support for homelessness is currently  unmet, causing cities to turn away an average  of 32 percent of individuals seeking food and  shelter. The Task Force's findings also con clude that among the current homeless popu lation  in  the United States, 56 percent are  single men, 28 percent are families with chil dren, 15 percent are single women, 29 per cent are chronically mentally ill, and only 20  percent are employed in full or part-time jobs.  Many homeless persons are disabled and  will never be able  to adequately care  for  themselves. Others suffer from serious mental  health disorders and require appropriate psy chiatric care.  It  is also estimated  that  the  homeless suffer the more common  illnesses  and diseases in greater proportions than the  average person. Due to their exposure to ex tremes of heat and cold, stress, hunger, and  street violence, homeless people have seven  times more  limb disorders, six  times more  nerve problems,  four  times more colds, and  three  times more skin  troubles  than other  Americans.  Who are  the homeless? They are black,  white, Asian, and Hispanic. They are the very  old and the very young. They are to be found  in every  region and every State. Both  their  needs and their numbers are too great to be  ignored.  Mr. Speaker, as we begin the historic 1 OOth  Congress,  I urge my colleagues to follow the  lead of  the Democratic Steering and Policy  Committee, and support legislation and fund ing levels that adequately address the needs  of the homeless.

44,,100,-0.318,595,2,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker,  last year  I had  the privilege of knowing a little 18-month-old  girl named Julianne Mclaughlin. Julianne was  a patient at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.  She was a little girl who would die unless she  received a liver transplant.  As it turned out Julianne did not receive a  new liver and her passing added to the thou sands of Americans who have died for want  of transplanted organs since the 1984 Nation al Organ Transplant Act was enacted.  Last year  I  introduced H.R. 5587, a bill  which would  have  established  a  national  organ donor  registry with available organs  being allocated strictly on a basis of medical  need. The bill also called for required request  provisions to be utilized in any hospital receiv ing Medicare or Medicaid  funding. Patients  would at least be informed about the possibili ty of potential organ donation when hospital ized.  Each aspect of H.R. 5587 was made  law  with the enactment of the 1987 Budget Rec onciliation Act. Now, finally, a workable organ  donor system is in place.  The following column written by Ellen Good man, however, points to new and disturbing  signs that the administration intends to thwart  the will of the Congress-and what is now the  law. I urge my colleagues to read this column  and to keep it in mind when meeting with con stituents. The 99th Congress accomplished  much in the field of organ transplants. Mem bers can be proud of their record and should  be aware of the intentions of the administra tion.  The article follows:  HANGING UP ON DESPERATE FAMILIES  <By Ellen Goodman>  BosTON.-Get out your note pads, your  television cameras and your hankies. Here  come the anecdotes:  It is July 1983, and President Reagan is  talking on  the  radio about  little Ashley  Bailey  from Texas, who needs an organ  transplant. ""Time is running out,"" he says.  ""I'm issuing a plea to the nation to find  Ashley a donor.""  It is May 1986, and the first lady is on the  telephone calling the family of Alex Girard,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  a 9-month-old waiting in Massachusetts for  a liver transplant. She offers sympathy and  an Air Force jet to rush a donor organ to  their baby.  Now put away the note pads, cameras and  hankies. Here comes the public policy.  It is January 1987, and the budget submit ted by the president is missing something.  It's missing the $500,000 for the Office of  Organ Transplantation. It's missing the $1.2  million for the national computer network  to match donors with the people who are  waiting.  In Year Seven of the Reagan administra tion, we have grown used to these gaps be tween Reagan sentiments and actions. We  have grown used to presidential sympathy  for  the victims of his own decisions. We  have grown used to the fact that some inter nal connection is broken, a synapse unmade,  between the man and the policy maker. But  for the hundreds of Americans waiting for  livers,  hearts, pancreases,  this particular  patch of  ground  between  publicity  and  policy seems especially barren.  In  recent years,  the waiting  room  for  those who need organ transplants has often  looked like a wrestling ring where families  compete for a scarce resource. We have seen  people who use money and the media  to  jump to the top of the list. There have been  organs wasted in one state while patients  waited in another.  This is why Congress passed the National  Organ Transplant Act in 1984, and passed it  almost unanimously. The cornerstone of the  bill was the network to match donors with  recipients and to make sure organs were dis tributed on medical grounds and priorities.  The administration opposed this bill when  it was in Congress, insisting that these pro grams should be privately financed. When  the bill-finally signed by the president became law, the administration went on re sisting it. The money for the network was  withheld  until  the  last  possible  legal  moment, Sept. 30, 1986. Now, a mere four  months later, it has axed the fledgling pro gram out of the new budget.  As Sen. Albert Gore, Jr. of Tennessee,  who has watchdogged this program, notes in  frustration,  this  is not an administration  bothered much by  the  laws of Congress:  ""They think they're above the law. It makes  very little difference if the Congress passes  a  law, even if the margin is 366-6 in the  House, and 100-0  in the Senate. If some  willful, ideological bureaucrat thinks it's in consistent  with  his  philosophy,  that's  enough to countermand the whole system.""  What  is  true in foreign policy  is  true at  home.  This transplant bill is a small ticket item.  It adds up to less than $4 million in a $1 tril lion budget. If the president refuses to put  it back in, Congress can. But it is a revealing  miniature of an administration that com forts with one hand the people it strikes  with the other.  Gore sent the president a polite and per sonal  plea  reminding  him-in  case  he  forgot-""both you and Mrs. Reagan have  shown a great deal of personal interest on  behalf of so many of these families. Your  pledges to help have been a source of com fort for many of them."" He has yet to hear  back.  Without this national system for gather ing and  fairly distributing such a  scarce  human resource, we are back in the game of  wait  and waste. Desperate  families will  again compete for publicity. Their best hope  will be to become the anecdote of the week.  Remember that when you read about the  next sympathy call from the White House.  2013  A TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN R.  OLENICK  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 27, 1987  ",1987
45,,100,-0.082,595,2,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like  to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Ste phen R. Olenick, a constituent from my district  who will be honored at a public dinner on  March 1 for a long and distinguished career.  Mr. Olenick will be retiring in March as Me honing County auditor, a position he has held  for the past 24 years. Unopposed in his last  three elections, and having held this position  longer than any before him, he has been a  public official who has truly endeared himself  to the respect and gratitude of the people of  Mahoning County.  Mr. Olenick will be ending his public service  career after nearly 40 years. After serving as  county councilman  for  the seventh ward  in  Youngstown for 8 years, he then went on to  serve as State senator for three terms. This  long career also  included having served as  deputy sheriff and deputy of courts, as well as  having served as Mahoning County Democrat ic Party chairman and a three-time delegate to  the national convention.  In addition, he  is past president of County  Officials of Ohio, Northeastern Ohio County  Auditors Association and the County Auditors  Association of Ohio.  Mr. Olenick has been more than a dedicat ed public servant of his many supporters in  Mahoning County. He has been, and contin ues to be, an active supporter of his commu nity and church. He has been a member or  chairman of several groups,  including having  been a member of the local bicentennial com mittee.  He was a great baseball player in his youth  and has managed seven  local championship  teams over the years. In 1933 he pitched for  the St. Stanislaus baseball team when it won  the first national amateur championship. More  recently, he was  just inducted by  the Curb stone Coaches Hall of Fame and was elected  to his 11th term as president of the Baseball  Oldtimers Association.  Mr. Olenick has also given of himself to his  local  church, St. Mathias,  not only as a  member, but as a church councilman and na tional chairman of Slovak Catholic Sokols.  Stephen Olenick has contributed much  to  Mahoning County, by way not only of his long  and distinguished public career, but by his  commitment to caring for and contributing to  his community and society in private  life as  well. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I  pay tribute  to Stephen and also  to his wife  Ann who has supported his successes for 48  years.  I wish  them both  the best of luck  in  Stephen's retirement, much deserved after a  lifetime of distinguished community service.  ",1987
46,,100,-0.644,608,2,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, the situation in  South Africa continues to deteriorate. The op pressive regime has arrested close to 9,000  children  in  the  last 6 months. Some have  been  subjected  to  torture. Black  relocation  continues. Press censorship has increased.  Significant  pressure must  be  applied  to  South Africa to bring the South African Gov ernment to a change of policy. To this end, I  will  soon  reintroduce  the  full  sanctions bill  which passed the House in the last session of  Congress.  Many United States companies are now  withdrawing from South Africa. The Eastman  Kodak Co. has announced a plan which  is  consistent with the intent of my sanctions leg islation. It is a model to be followed.  I would  like  to share with  the House  the  Kodak  announcement of withdrawal  issued  last November.  The Kodak announcement follows:  KODAK ANNOUNCES WITHDRAWAL FROM  SOUTH AFRICA  RocHESTER, NY, Nov. 19.-Eastman Kodak  Company today announced plans to with draw from South Africa.  Under terms of the withdrawal, no Kodak  unit anywhere in the world will be permit ted to supply products to South Africa, and  the assests of Kodak South Africa will be  sold. Employees will be terminated with a  generous separation package.  Kodak chairman and chief executive offi cer Colby H.

47,House,100,0.043,621,2,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of House Resolution 55, a resolution  in  remembrance of  the crew of  the space  shuttle Challenger. I commend the gentleman  from New Jersey [Mr. ROE] for introducing this  resolution which sheds light upon the tragedy  which  took  the  lives of seven brave Ameri cans.  A year ago  today millions of Americans  watched  in disbelief at  the explosion which  destroyed the space shuttle Challenger and its  crew of seven. It was a moment that very few  of us will ever forget and that we never should  forget. We must  remember  those  seven  heroes who lost their lives for this great coun try of ours and use this tragedy as an inspira tion  to  return  to  safe space  flight and  to  secure our position of  leadership  in space.  The families of those seven courageous astro nauts have continued to move ahead and so  must we.  These  seven Americans  should  be  en shrined forever in history so our children and  grandchildren  can  learn  of  their  unselfish  deeds for years to come.  The  mission  commander,  Francis  R.  Scobee, who flew on the space shuttle as the  pilot of mission 41-C in April 1984;  The mission pilot, Capt. Michael J. Smith,  was on his  first shuttle flight after being se lected an astronaut in 1980;  Mission specialist Lt. Col. Ellison Onizuka,  who flew on the first military mission in Janu ary 1985, aboard the space shuttle Discovery  and  was  the  first  Japanese-American  in  space;  Mission specialist Judith A. Resnick,  the  first Jewish astronaut as well as one of the  first women on board;  E.  Mission  specialist  Ronald  McNair  became one of the  first black astronauts  in  1978;  Payload  specialist  Christa McAuliffe,  a  school teacher, who was to conduct a series  of classroom  lessons from orbit and conduct  several basic classroom experiments; and  Payload specialist Gregory Jarvis, a Hughes  Aircraft  specialist, who was  to  perform  a  series  of  fluid  dynamics  experiments  that  would support satellite redesign.  This week, many Americans will remember  those heroes  in ceremonies and memorials  throughout  the country.  In my own congres sional district  in Monticello, NY, citizens and  clergy will  join  together  in a  remembrance  ceremony for the severn Challenger 1 o astro nauts.  I know that we all will be joining them  in spirit for that event.  It  is hoped  that this  tragedy will not deter  our space program but rather that the pioneer ing spirit of the dedicated crew of the Chal lenger will inspire us and motivate us to con tinue to pursue /our explorations of space.  In  closing, I am reminded of a quote by an anon ymous author:  ""Looking back  is sometimes  painful. But,  if we don't,  their sacrifices will  have been in vain.""  ",1987
48,House,100,-0.135,621,2,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, 1 year has  passed since  the  tragic  loss of  the space  shuttle Challenger and her crew. As we  re member  that disaster and  its aftermath, we  mourn not just for a symbol of our country's  1  progress,  but  for  individuals-Capt.  Dick  Scobee, Michael Smith, Judith Resnik, Ellison  Onizuka, Ronald McNair, Gregory Jarvis, and  Christa McAuliffe.  This  loss  saddened  all  Americans,  but  touched painfully close to home in my district  in Houston. Several of the crewmembers were  my constituents, and  their deaths cast a pall  over  the neighborhoods near  the Johnson  Space Center.  During  the past year, we have gradually  come to terms with our sorrow, and resolved  as a nation  to pursue  the goals  that  these  men and women gave their lives for. We have  come  to realize  that  the commitment of the  crew is best honored by our own rededication  to their dream.  Each of us can help keep the dream alive.  First, we can support the Challenger families  in their effort to build children's space life cen ters-designed to give hands-on  learning ex periences to the next generation. Their plan is  to establish centers in Washington and Hous ton  first, and  then assist  in developing addi tional ones around the country. The nonprofit  National Challenger Center Foundation estab lished  to  fund  the centers, with an office  in  Houston and Washington, can use any and all  help.  The second avenue is continued funding for  NASA's exploration and  research programs,  despite our current budget problems. Federal  spending for NASA has always been cost-ef fective, providing secondary benefits and ad vances  in  technological development, private  sector  job creation, and scientific education  and  training.  It is  important that we continue  our Nation's commitment and  leadership  in  space.  Finally, we must all  join  the employees at  NASA  in  rededicating ourselves  to  the ulti mate goal of safety in the space program. We  in  the Congress,  like many Americans, had  begun  to expect  flawless performance  from  the space shuttle, becoming  irritated or sur prised by malfunctions and delays.  If there is  one  lesson of  the Challenger disaster,  it  is  that the safety of human lives must be our No.  1 priority. Nothing  is more sacred, or more  worthy of remembrance.  ",1987
49,House,100,0.478,621,2,Mr. DREIER of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  none of us will ever forget the shock and an guish we felt on this day last year upon learn ing that the space shuttle Challenger and  its  crew had been  lost only 73  seconds after  launch. Along with all Americans, we not only  shared  the grief of  the crew members' fami lies, but also concern over the general safety  and future of the space program following the  Challenger mishap.  One year later, we are still saddened by the  tragic loss of seven brave Americans. Howev er, the direction of the space program is once  again clear:  full speed ahead. The challenge  NASA has  faced-restoring  the  confidence  necessary  to maintain  public  support-has  been as great as  the challenge it faced get ting the first space shuttle off the ground. The  shuttle, and  indeed  the entire manned  flight  program, could have been  jeopardized had  the American people not been willing to thor oughly and honestly examine  the mistakes  that had been made and correct them.  It has  indeed been a struggle  to  turn  the  Challenger tragedy  into a positive  reassessment of NASA's  technical  and managerial  processes. However, with  the next shuttle  launch scheduled  for  just over 1 year  from  now, a majority of Americans not only support  continuing  the program,  but are willing  to  accept  the painstaking delay necessary  to  ensure the safety of the launch.  Those who would scale back  the shuttle  program  because of  the  dangers  involved  might be  interested  in  the open  letter com memorating  the  tragedy which was  released  today by the families of the seven crew mem bers. The letter tells us that, if the Challenger  crew were alive today, they would encourage  us to ""not fear risk. All exploration, all growth  is calculated  risk. Without  frontiers, civiliza tions stagnate."" Our greatest memorial to the  crew would be to follow that advice, to contin ue  learning all  that our space programs can  teach about our universe.

50,House,100,0.33,621,2,Mr. BUECHNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup port of House Resolution 55, a commemora tive resolution in memory of the seven brave  astronauts who  lost  their  lives 1 year ago  today  in  the  tragic Challenger accident. The  seven: Michael Smith, Ellison Onizuka, Francis  ""Dick"" Scobee, Judy Resnik, Ronald McNair,  Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe will for ever live in our memories.  After 1 year of mourning our great loss, and  learning from that loss, let us take this occa sion to recommit ourselves to our fine space  program. We  can  look  forward  to a bright  future  in  space exploration, but only  if we  have the courage to make it happen.  The  families of the Challenger crew wrote  an open letter to the Nation in which they im plored us to ""carry on Challengers mission.""  They write:  Since their loss, we have been troubled by  the incompleteness of their mission * * *. If  they were alive and could speak to all Amer icans, we believe the Challenger crew would  say this: Do not fear risk. All exploration,  all growth is a calculated risk. Without frontiers, civilizations stagnate.    That  is  the challenge before us  today. To  carry on  that same spirit of exploration. To  push onward to greater frontiers. To complete  the Challenger mission.  ",1987
51,House,100,-0.228,621,2,Mr. BONER of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am proud to join my colleagues in saluting the  seven Challenger astronauts and  the spirit of  adventure which they embodied.  As we remember Commander Dick Scobee,  Pilot Michael Smith, Astronauts Judy Resnik,  Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, and Gregory  Jarvis,  and  civilian  school  teacher Christa  McAuliffe, we recall their bravery and commit ment. Like the many explorers who preceded  them, the seven Challenger astronauts exhibit ed a selfless devotion to bettering our under standing of the universe and our place in it.  It is our curiousity about the unknown, our  amazement at the wonders of nature, and the  excitement of discovery which characterizes  our Nation's explorers and, most particularly,  the members of our astronaut corps.  Many of these traits are  found  in our chil dren and, perhaps most appropriately, one of  the consequences of  the Challenger tragedy  has been our Nation's efforts to improve edu cation and further foster the childhood excite ment and curiousity about the stars.

55,,100,-0.27,764,2,Mr. LEHMAN of California.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I am  introducing  legislation which will  address a serious flaw in  the Aid  to Families  With Dependent Children Unemployed Parent  Program  [AFDC-UP]. The  flaw  is commonly  known as the 1 00-hour work rule.  The AFDC-UP Program, which currently op erates in 23 States, the District of Columbia,  and Guam, provides benefits  to needy  two parent  families where  the  principal wage  earner is unemployed.  In this program unem ployment is currently defined as, ""not working,  or working  less  that 1 00 hours per month.""  Consequently, when the principal wage earner  works 1 00 hours or more,  regardless of  the  amount of income he receives, he becomes  ineligible for all aid.  In 1984,  the average AFDC-UP payment  per family was $479 per month. Simple math  tells us  that the primary wage earner would  have to work 140 hours at minimum wages in  order  to match  this average grant payment.  The  Federal Government,  however,  takes  away all his benefits  if he works  just 1 00  hours.  It  is my view  that this 1 00-hour work  rule results in a clear disincentive to find em ployment.  It discourages  the wage earner in  an AFDC-UP family from accepting job offers,  or results in the principal wage earner limiting  his or her hours of work  to  less than 1 00  in  order to protect vital benefits for the family.  It is time to address this shortcoming in the  AFDC Program and to eliminate the work dis incentive that has evolved. The bill I am intro ducing will do precisely  that.  It encourages  participation in the job market by establishing  demonstration projects nationwide where  the  1 00-hour rule would be waived. Wage earners  would be allowed  to work  in excess of 1 00  hours a month without the threat of losing all  AFDC and  other  related  benefits  such  as  medicaid. Families, instead of becoming ineli gible  for assistance would see  their AFDC  grants reduced. As a result there would be a  reduced expenditure of AFDC Program funds   for each family receiving earned income.  The  potential  significance  of maintaining  policies  that  discourage  employment  are  great. We need to implement policies that enJanuary 28, 1987  courage, not discourage AFDC  recipients  to  enter  the  job market. Penalizing  recipients  who work over a 1 00 hours a month does not  make prudent policy and will ultimately result  in a longterm dependency on  the AFDC-UP  Program.  The time has come to allow more flexibility  in our welfare programs so that we can  test  the waters on new approaches  to  reducing  welfare dependency. We need  to break  the  cycle of welfare dependency passed on from  generation  to generation of welfare  families.  Working parents set role models, restore dig nity and provide hope in families caught in the  welfare trap.  Waiving  this 1 00-hour  rule will allow able  bodied citizens  to work without placing  their  family's health and welfare in  jeopardy.  I en courage my colleagues to join me in efforts to  enact this important legislation.  TRIBUTE TO LEE LIBERMAN  HON.

Last year the Congress enacted the  most sweeping tax reform legislation  in a generation. I supported this legis lation because I think that it is impor tant to lower tax rates and make the  Tax Code fairer and more simple for  the average taxpayer. One of the pro visions of last year's Tax Code revision  that hasn't gotten the attention given  to the new lower rate structure and  the elimination of tax loopholes is the  provision which awards court costs to  taxpayers who prevail in proceedings  before the Tax Court.  Title XV of  the Tax Reform Act  calls for awarding of attorney's fees to  the prevailing party in tax cases. For  years, taxpayers have had to bear the  cost of any action before  the Tax  Court even when  they won. Maybe  this change will make the IRS think  twice before dragging a taxpayer into  Tax Court on a flimsy case-if so, this  is an important improvement in the  law. I am very pleased that this provi sion was made part of the Tax Reform  Act, because it was included in my tax payer's bill of rights, which had 50 co sponsors in the House of Representa tives last Congress.  The awarding of attorney fees  to  taxpayers who win their case was a  good first step. However, more needs  to be done to protect taxpayer's rights  in order to complete the job of tax  reform we started last year. There can  be no more appropriate  time  than  during the 200th anniversary of the  adoption of our Constitution to finish  the job of tax reform by enacting a  taxpayer's bill of rights to insure that  taxpayers are protected from abuses  of Government power by the Internal  Revenue Service, just as our constitu tional bill of rights protects citizens  from other types of abuses of Govern ment power.  We can soon start down the road to  complete the job of tax reform. Next  week I will  introduce my  taxpayer's  bill of rights which will:  Require the IRS to prepare a decla ration of taxpayer's rights and obliga tions;  Enable  a  taxpayer  to  take  legal  action against an IRS employee who  violates a taxpayer's rights;  Establish an Office of Ombudsman;  ",1987
69,Senate,100,0.257,842,2,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, my  recollection  is  that in 1920  the U.S.  Congress, when our budget was about  $4 billion and had about 800,000 Fed eral workers, got on the track of ap propriating every year and we created  the  appropriations  process.  The  budget is now a  trillion dollars. The  appropriated portion I  think exceeds  $500 billion, that which goes through  this process. Back yonder when we  started  there were  just a  few pro grams. There are  literally hundreds  start  now.  Somehow  or  other we  things and we never change.  What we are saying today  is  that  reform is necessary. And let us be real istic. We can talk about restructuring  committees. We can talk about having  less to do, doing more oversight, but  the plain truth is there is very little  chance any of those will pass.  Senator Bellmon, now the Governor  of Oklahoma, in leaving this institu tion made a  very  interesting state ment. I think he really was the states man of that time and we did not know  it. He said, ""In a 2-year congressional  period, why do we have a budget every  year? Why not take a year of the two  and do all the fiscal matters and leave  the other year for the other work.""  In essence, Mr. President and Mem bers of the Senate, the Roth-Domenici  proposal builds on  that. We  feel  it  really is an overly time consuming ac tivity to appropriate every year. Why  not appropriate for 2 years, and pro vide a mechanism for emergencies and  the supplementals, and why not pro vide a budget resolution that covers 2  years, with some process to update it  in  terms of economics. That means  Congress would have, out of each Con gress, 1 year to do fiscal things and 1  year to do other things, including au thorizations.  It is imperative that we strengthen  the  authorizing  process,  that we  strengthen the appropriating process,  so that it can get its work done, and  tied into all of that is doing our budget  work and being able to do all of it on  time and with thought. It is simplicity  that makes this approach have a real  chance of getting  through and suc ceeding-! year  to do your budget,  fiscal and appropriating work, 1 year  to do oversight and authorizations.  That is  its simplest form. There are  other things that have to be done, but  basically that is what we are asking  the appropriate committees of Con gress  to do  for us,  for our people.  Sooner or later we have to do it.  This bill will not cure everything.  Let me say to those listening, it will  not cure willpower  shortcomings,  it  will not cure our  inability  to make  tough decisions, it might not even cure  confrontations between Congress and  the President, and it may not cure our  current deficit, but it clearly gives us a  better chance of doing our job right  and it is reasonable and simple. Sena tor ROTH has sent the bill to the desk  along with the attachment which goes  through the bill section by section. I  am delighted to be a cosponsor. I hope  we get it done. I yield the floor.

72,Senate,100,0.631,842,2,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, on Tues day of this week, the United States for  the first  time established diplomatic  relations with the Communist regime  in Outer Mongolia. At the same time,  the Deputy Secretary of State, John  C. Whitehead, has begun a tour of sev eral Soviet bloc countries behind the  Iron  Curtain,  including  Poland,  Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria. These  two events are coupled together in a  strange irony.  I recently had a note informing me  of the establishment of relations with  Mongolia from Dr. Gaston Sigur, the  Assistant Secretary for East Asian and  Pacific Affairs. Now Dr. Sigur is one of  our most respected experts on Asia,  and I have a high regard for him. But  I wonder if he really thought about  the letter he signed. He stated:  As you may have known, the Mongolian  People's Republic was  admitted  to  the  United Nations in 1961 and has been a fully  functioning member of  the  international  community for several decades. Since last  December,  the Department of State has  been engaged  in negotiations with repre sentatives of the Mongolian People's Repub lic with a view to establishing diplomatic re lations between our  two countries which  will enable us  to expand educational and  cultural contacts, develop trade, and provide  better protection for American travelers in  Mongolia.  The irony is that you can only con sider Mongolia to be a fully function ing member of the international com munity if you think that a Communist  country can be considered a fully func tioning country. In my book, any Com munist regime ought to be considered,  by definition, a violation of the most  fundamental human rights. By lend ing the prestige of our diplomatic rela tionship  to  such  a  regime, we  are  taking a step backward in the protec tion and development of human rights  everywhere. What possible good can  be gained by establishing normal rela tions with a nation that is dominated  by external forces and that crushes  the political, religious, and cultural as pirations of its people? The diplomatic  triumph, but for the American people,  this is a day of shame.  What this means, Mr. President, is  that Mongolia will be regarded by the  United States as  a normal country  when  everything  about  the  regime  that controls it is abnormal. Is this to  be the fate of Afghanistan in a  few  years? Do we no longer seek to liberate  a nation once a Communist revolution  has been stabilized by crushing the  people?

76,Senate,100,-0.371,868,2,Mr. BURDICK.," Mr. President, today  is the day we will finally vote up or  down on the congressional pay raise  package.  As you already know, I do not sup port these raises.  I have never sup ported the process of further  lining  our own pockets when people in each  of our States continue to go hungry.  These raises are obscene.  And as I have already stated, I plan  to return every penny of increase in  my take-home pay to the U.S. Treas ury. This is a small step-but it is a  step in the right direction. I hope that  many of you will join me in rejecting  this increase in our pay.  I would  like  to conclude with the  thoughts of one of my constituents,  Mr. Bill Snyder, of Fargo, NO. Mr.  Snyder dared me to include his poem  in  the CONGRESSONAL RECORD. Well,  here it goes, Mr. Snyder.  Chop the old folks,  Cut the young,  Slice the budget,  Rung by rung.  But never, never,  Vote away,  Any boost  In Congressman's pay!  to  sug These are  the views of  just one  person, but I would wager that each of  you has more than one Bill Snyder in  your State. Something for each of you  to think about.  ",1987
77,Senate,100,0.52,868,2,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER  (Mr.  DECONCINI). Without objection, it is SO  ordered.  ",1987
78,Senate,100,0.551,881,2,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, first,  let me  commend  the  distinguished  chairman of  the Budget Committee,  the Senator from Florida, for making  the point that I think is obvious to ev erybody; that is, we all know there is  not  enough money  in  the disaster  relief fund  to pay for  the disasters  that are likely to occur this year. Even  if we did nothing, even if we did not  take the money out, the chances are  that we are going to be back before  the fiscal year is over voting to put  money into this account.  The problem is you can vote to take  money out of the disaster account, you  can make  the whole process deficit  neutral, and meet the point of order  requirement as the distinguished Sen ator from New Mexico said, but unless  you can get the Lord to sign onto the  bill  to reduce  the disasters, you are  just perpetrating a fraud on the Amer ican people and our commitment  to  balance the budget.  So I want to commend the distin guished Senator from Florida for pro posing the legitimate way to do this if  you want to do it, which is simply to  say that now we are going to come  along and waive the Budget Act, claim  that because this is such a high priori ty item it is more important than our  commitment  to balance  the budget.  That is what the waiver says.  I agree with the distinguished Sena tor from New Mexico to a point. But  that point ends pretty quickly. This is  not an irrelevant vote. This is the first  in a long line of votes we are going to  have  in  this Congress which  tests  whether or not we were shooting with  real  bullets when we  adopted  the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  law. What  we are voting on here is whether we  are going  to perpetrate a  fraud by  taking money out of an account set up  for disasters-which in all probability  is deficient already-knowing  it will  have  to  be  replenished,  or  simply  waive the act itself by saying that this  is of such high priority that it is more  important than balancing the budget.  The point I would like to make, Mr.  President, is there is another alterna tive. There is a better alternative if  you really believe that this $50 million  is so vitally important. The newest fig ures that we have show that we have  already provided $70 million of funds  for emergency food and shelter pro grams, and only $3 million have been  spent. Perhaps we ought to have a res olution demanding that the other $67  million be spent. We could do  that  within the requirements of Gramm Rudman. Why do we not do that?  Or you know we are actually spend ing a total of 1 trillion and 16 billion  dollars this year. Surely somewhere in  that $1.016 trillion there is $50 million  that is not as  important as helping  people out on the streets.  So I submit to my colleagues that  while I seldom differ from the distin guished Senator from New Mexico I  strongly differ with him on this sub ject. As he pointed out, even as we  speak, another $100 million bill for the  same purpose is on its way. Did we say  when we adopted Gramm-Rudman we  wanted to balance the budget except  for the homeless? Will it be next week  that we want to balance the budget  except for national defense? Do we  want to balance the budget except for  the Contras? Do we want to balance  the budget  except  for  the  farmer,  except  for  the veteran,  except  for  every  special  interest group  in  the  country that has some claim on the  Federal Treasury, and that appeals to  us in the name of compassion?  Quite frankly,  I  think the budget  ought to be compassionate, but I never  get confused about one thing. Compas sion is what I do with my money. It is  not what  I  do with  the  taxpayers'  money. That says nothing about how  compassionate I am. What I am will ing to vote somebody else's money for  .says nothing about my compassion.  What I do with my own money says  something about my compassion, not  what I would like to do with yours.  We may be talking about the com passion of the Government here. But  we are not talking about the compas sion  of  100 Members  of  the U.S.  Senate. Our compassion is measured  by what we do with our own money.  I submit, Mr. President, that while  the hour is late and we all want to go  home, what is $50 million, or 50 cents  a taxpayer? I will tell you what it is. In  this 100th Congress it is the first test  of whether or not we are going to live  up to a commitment we made which in  large part said we were going to set  out a budget, and we were going to try  to live by it. We have not quite made  it, but we set out a procedure, in which  we make the commitment that if we  had breached the budget and some body came along with a great idea to  spend money that we would have to  take the money away from other other  purpose.  We do have the procedure of a 60vote margin to waive a point of order.  But I submit  to my colleagues that  while this cause that we are debating  here may be important, does anybody  here really believe that in a $1.016 tril lion budget that we cannot find a real  $50 million to take away from some  lower priority item to spend for this? I  submit we can. In fact, we can take $50  million  right out of  the emergency  food-shelter program because we have  $67 million sitting there we already  appropriated for exactly this purpose  that has not been spent.  Does  anybody here  really believe  that the winter is not going to be over  ",1987
79,Senate,100,0.287,894,2,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, this  morning the Appropriations Commit tee amended and reported House Joint  Resolution 102, the emergency supple mental for the Emergency Food and  Shelter Program of the Federal Emer gency Management Agency  [FEMAl.  This  resolution  includes a provision  disapproving  the  proposed  deferral  <D87-33) in the amount of $28,559,000  relating to the Temporary Emergency  Food Assistance Program CTEF APl.  Funds for TEFAP are administered  by the Food and Nutrition Service of  the  Department  of  Agriculture  through  grants  to  State  agencies  which operate commodity distribution  programs. Allocation of the funds to  States is based on a  formula which  considers  the States' unemployment  rates and the number of persons with  incomes below the poverty level.  In fiscal year 1985, almost a billion  dollars' worth of surplus commodities  were distributed to assist needy indi viduals. Donations continued in fiscal  1986. Precise  levels  of  commodities  made available for distribution depend  upon the availability of surplus com modities and requirements regarding  displacement. Over  $56,800,000 was  used in fiscal year 1985 to help State  and local authorities with the storage  and distribution costs of providing sur plus commodities to needy individuals;  $50,000,000 was appropriated for fiscal  year 1986 and was allocated  to  the  States for their use.  For fiscal year 1987, $50,000,000, the  full authorized level, was again appro priated and included in the continuing  resolution. However, just yesterday a  message was sent to Congress propos ing deferral of all unobligated TEF AP  funds as of January 5, 1987. Mr. Presi dent, deferral of these funds will cause  widespread disruption in the Tempo rary Emergency Food Assistance Pro gram, and most States will be forced  to curtail or discontinue the distribu tion of the much needed surplus agri cultural commodities  to  the hungry  and homeless. By  taking action  to  overturn this deferral now, States will  be able to proceed with their programs  without disruption.  In view of the need to provide emer gency food, clothing and shelter assist ance, I urge my colleagues to support  this supplemental resolution and the  disapproval of this proposed deferral.  ",1987

81,,100,0.635,946,2,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Speaker, whether we rec ognize it or not, our economy is becoming an  increasingly global one. It's not enough to be  competitive at home, economic survival today  is measured by a  firm's ability  to compete  against domestic and  foreign manufacturers  and service providers.  Who benefits from this global competition?  We all do, though at times we have to wade  through some persuasive and pervasive myths  to get the whole picture. For instance, you'll  rarely  find an advocate of  restrictive  trade  policies argue  that  international  trade hurts  consumers. Adopt  that approach and you'll  find yourself arguing that American consumers  don't know how to spend  their own money.  More often than not, though, you'll hear that  America's manufacturing base is eroding and  that American  jobs are threatened by global  competition.  The  facts  just don't support  the charge.  Manufacturing as a percentage of GNP has  remained  relatively constant at 20 percent  over the last 25 years. And while manufactur ing employment has dropped  from approxi mately 25 percent of the workforce to 18 per cent,  it's pretty clear that the productivity of  manufacturing employees has increased and it  now takes less people to make more goods.  That's responding to international challenges,  not putting up barriers to inhibit global com petitiveness.  And what about the charge that American  jobs are being  lost. Today, we have more  people working  than ever before.  In  relative  terms-comparing America with other econo mies-the  results are even more  startling.  Since 1975, the American economy has cre ated 25 million net new  jobs.  In  the same  period, all of Europe combined created zero.  Unfortunately, there are some who are ar guing  that  protectionist  trade  policies  are  needed to protect jobs and American consum ers  from  foreign competition. But as Arshad  M. Khan points out  in  ""Import Restrictions  Just Intensify Trade War,"" it's American busi ness and consumers who'll pay the bill for the  folly of protectionism.  America has nothing  to gain  from beggar  thy neighbor trade policies and a lot to lose.  Trade restrictions deny consumers the oppor tunity and the freedom to buy the best goods  or service available at the  lowest price. Just  as importantly, they artificially relieve the com petitive pressures which force firms to adapt  and change and respond to the discipline of  the marketplace.  As a professional economist, I, too, am con cerned with  the subject of competitiveness.  Yet, before we embark on some willy nilly  Government policy designed  to address and  correct every economic malady we  faceJanuary 29, 1987  something which  the  Federal Government  can't and shouldn't do-we need  to define  competitiveness, or why America isn't as com petitive as it once was.  To my understanding, competitiveness  in  economic terms means declining productivity  growth,  rising  labor costs, a deplorably  low  savings  rate, stagnant or declining R&D ex penditures and, most visibly, a large trade im balance. To say  the  least,  these are symp toms of an economy in adjustment. A more  alarming  indictment, but perhaps more de served, these economic ills are characteristics  of an overregulated economy or a product of  incoherent and  irrational Government  fiscal  and monetary policies.  We all want increased productivity, a strong  industrial  base,  growing  employment,  in creased exports  (as opposed  to  limited  im ports) or, more simply, a higher standard of  living which presents Americans with more op portunity, and more choices. But the answer  does not  lie  in protectionist  trade policies.  These are counterproductive and can only ex acerbate our current problems.  But  before  embarking  on  trade  policies  which penalize consumers and actually hurt  the very firms they seek to protect, I'd would  commend  to my colleagues Arshad Kahn's  thoughts on shortsighted and counterproduc tive protectionist trade barriers.  We can't ignore the fact that to be competi tive today means responding  to international  economic challenges. But protectionist trade  policies are not  the answer. With sensible  Government policies-designed  to create a  fertile field for economic growth and not build  a fence around fortress America-1 have no  doubt that American firms are more than ca pable of meeting international challenges and  prospering in a global economy.  IMPORT RESTRICTIONS JUST INTENSIFY TRADE  WAR  <By Arshad M. Khan)  The U.S. trade deficit is likely to be $170  billion this year. And both the new speaker  of  the House, Jim Wright, and  the new  chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,  Lloyd Bentsen, have given high priority to a  trade bill. Just in case there is any doubt, a  trade bill means less, not more,  trade;  it  means import restrictions; and it means that  trading partners will retaliate with counter  restrictions.  Trade restrictions cost you and me, the  general consumer, and benefit just the few  they are designed to protect. It is variously  estimated,  for example,  that the ""volun tary"" quotas forced on the Japanese five  years ago cost the consumer about $400 per  car.  The argument for the quotas-that they  would provide time for our auto industry to  shape up-has not been sustained. Yes, the  industry has been profitable-domestic car  prices rose soon after the quotas were an nounced-but, according to industry analyst  J.D. Power Associates, the quality of most  of our cars has not improved. As for oper ations, one need go no further than indus try leader GM, which has announced 9,000  planned layoffs and 11 plant closings in four  states. As in autos, so in steel, so in textiles,  so in ...  Import restrictions are much like squeez ing a balloon-the bulge appears elsewhere.  We restrict Korean steel, and it starts to  come in as Korean toasters, irons and cars,  ",1987
82,,100,-0.1,959,2,Mr. TALLON.," Mr. Speaker, since my elec tion to Congress, one of the most heartbreak ing problems I have had is trying to help con stituents and  their families who are facing a  catastrophic  illness-illness requiring prohibi tively expensive or long-term treatment. I have  seen  the spirit of many  families broken not  only by the anguish of a disease, but also by  its overwhelming financial burden.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The  threat of catastrophic  illness  is very  real to all of us. Skyrocketing health care ex penses in addition to nursing home and home  care costs are draining the life savings of both  young and old. The President has recognized  the severity of the catastrophic health  insur ance gap and has issued a report on it.  What is clear is that no one is immune from  the devastating effects of catastrophic illness  because almost no one  is protected from  it.  Contrary to popular belief, Medicare does not  cover the extensive costs of catastrophic care  and  insurance  from  catastrophic  illness  is  simply beyond the financial means of individ uals and families.  Take  the case of a retired schoolteacher  whose 70-year-old husband became  ill with  cancer. They had Medicare coverage. They  had also bought supplemental coverage which  they assumed would pay any expenses not  covered by Medicare. His illness necessitated  three operations,  long-hospital stays, numer ous doctors' visit, and, finally, a nursing home  stay that  lasted until his death. The school teacher discovered that Medicare left substan tial costs uncovered. She also discovered that  their  supplementary  policy  covered  little  except  the Medicare deductible and copay ment charges  for  the hospital stays. They  were finally forced to sell their home and turn,  practically penniless, to the Medicaid Program  for assistance.  Or take the case of a divorced mother of  two who was self-supporting until she became  chronically ill at 33 years of age. She is now  39, exists on  intranvenous  feeding, and  is  hospitalized most of every  year. Her only  source of  income  is a disability check. For  reasons she does not understand she is not  eligible for her State's Medicaid Program, and  her health care bills far exceed her Medicare  coverage and private insurance benefits. The  pays what she can and is steadily increasing  her debt with hospitals and physicians. Her re curring nightmare is that she will die and leave  her children with her mountain of unpaid medi cal bills.  America has  the  finest medical system  in  the world. However, when  it comes to cata strophic care it is clear that we face a huge  health  insurance coverage gap. Catastrophic  costs will wipe a family out. Yet, today 30 mil lion Americans  lack health insurance and 1 0  million more lack adequate insurance to pro tect them from the risk of catastrophic illness.  More difficult, however, than the question of  whether the problem of catastrophic and long term health care should be addressed, is the  question of how. A number of options are cur rently  under  consideration  by  Congress.  These  recommendations differ according  to  the degree of Government  involvement and  cost.  One proposal,  titled  ""U.S. Health,"" would  provide comprehensive Federal public health  insurance for all Americans. This Federal pro gram would cover all patients and services, in cluding  basic  health,  long-term  and  cata strophic care.  A second option recommended by the Sec retary of Health and Human Services would  expand Medicare  to cover all health  care  costs for the elderly beyond $2,000 a year, in cluding catastrophic care. This proposal would  2377  require a $4.92 a month increase in Medicare  premiums.  A frequent argument against both of these  proposals is the substantial increase in public  spending they would require. A third alterna tive, however, would reduce excessive Feder al expenses by providing expanded Medicare  coverage while maintaining compulsory cost sharing for those who can afford it. The elder ly would still be protected  from catastrophic  costs although the upper limit for cost sharing  would vary with the income of the patient.  A  final  ""private sector"" plan calls  for  tax  and other incentives to induce health insurers  and businesses to cover nursing home care.  Savings would be put aside in tax-exempt indi vidual medical accounts, similar in principle to  an IRA.  These and other ways of coping with  the  catastrophic health care crisis will be a priority  for the 1 OOth session of Congress. Any ap proach must address the preservation of indi vidual choice and responsibility while also pro viding for the affordable financing of needed  health services.  Catastrophic health care  is not a problem  that will go away. Until we decide how cata strophic and  long-term care can best be  fi nanced-through public programs,  insurance  and other private means, or a combination an increasing number of young and older per sons in need of such care will expend all of  their  financial  resources and eventually be  forced to rely on Medicaid.  Private  sector  initiatives and  responsible  Government action can  lead  to a strength ened health care system and the ultimate res olution of this  important problem. Failure  to  act now will not make the problem disappear.  Indeed, delay may make it harder to solve as  the population ages.  MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.  NATIONAL HOLIDAY  HON.ROMANOL.~OU  OF KENTUCKY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 21, 1987  ",1987
83,,100,-0.186,959,2,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, I am particularly  proud, once again,  to  join all Americans  in  honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the oc casion of the second national holiday, com memorating his birthdate.  Dr. King's life and work  inspire and uplift.  His commitment to equality and justice is an  example  each  of us-whatever our back ground or state in life-should emulate.  As recent incidents in areas as far apart as  New York City and Forsyth County, GA have  shown, we as a nation still have not entirely  erased bigotry, hatred, and distrust. And eco nomic analyses show sharp differentials in the  earnings and employment outlook between  the races. Yet, as Dr. King once said:  ""We  must learn to live together as brothers or we  shall all perish together as fools.""  It behooves Americans to pull together, and  one mechanism toward that laudable goal  is  the national holiday we celebrate in Dr. King's  honor. We are afforded on  this holiday a  chance collectively to  look back  in  time  for  advice and counsel on how to look forward to",1987
84,House,100,-0.479,972,2,Mr. MINETA.," I thank our very fine  chair of the California delegation, Mr.  EDWARDS, for having taken the leader ship to get the time for all of us to  speak.  I  also wish  to  join all  the other  Members who have been touched in  many ways by both Phillip and SALA  over the years.  So as with the others, I extend our  deep  sympathy  to  the  immediate  family, Joy and her husband, to the  in-laws, John Burton, Bob Burton, and  all the others.  Frankly, I think all of us are part of  that family because I think SALA and  Phil thought of it in that way.  There is no question that she in her  own right was a strong person, consid ered a helpmate and partner to Phil lip.  In my thinking, her seniority began  when Phillip was sworn in here in the  House, but she really blossomed here  in her own right and continued in her  service as a Member of the House as a  loving, caring, strong person.  In 1983, I went through a cancer op eration but I was fortunate enough to  have, through surgical skills, have the  cancer  removed. Unfortunately,  the  ravages of cancer have taken a very  fine colleague from us. But we can all .  look back to various ways in which we  worked with her, whether it was the  redress issue impacting on Americans  of  Japanese ancestry,  to  something  that we will be doing tomorrow which  is overriding  the veto of  the Clean  Water Act by the President.  There is a provision in that Clean  Water Act tomorrow in which there is  a call for a study of the toxics and pol lutants in the San Francisco Bay that  SALA BURTON  loved SO much. I knOW  she is working with all of us in trying  to make sure that we get the necessary  votes on the override of that veto. But  everything she has been involved  in  has, as everyone has indicated here,  been laced with  love. Her caring of  things, her caring for people,  things  that were inanimate or animate, she  considered the same and she treated  respectfully in that same manner.  So she leaves a  legacy not only in  terms of public service, but a legacy of  legislation to whom all of us are very  much indebted.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to our colleague,  the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr.  SIKORSKI].  ",1987
85,House,100,-0.217,972,2,Mr. SIKORSKI.," I thank the gentle man from California.  SALA BuRTON was a very real gentle woman and a  true representative of  the United States. She was  fiercely  proud of her Polish origin, her Jewish  religion, her husband and partner, her  family, her city, her State, and her  country.  She cared deeply and worked hard  on her convictions. She hated intoler ance, but never displayed intolerance.  I think that is best exemplified in an  old prayer: Where there is hatred she  sowed  love, where  there was  injury,  pardon; where there was doubt, faith;  despair,  hope;  darkness,  light;  and  where there is sadness she sowed joy.  She sought not so much to be con soled as to console, not so much to be  understood as to understand, and most  importantly she sought not so much  to be loved as to love.  ",1987
86,House,100,-0.265,972,2,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I want to take a  couple of moments to comment on  the very  sad passing of my friend and colleague, SALA  BURTON.  In her all  too brief career in  the House of  Representatives, she established herself as  someone who could be  trusted and as a  power for the people she represented. SALA  saw the national problems and tried to shape  solutions that would help the people.  I well remember talking with her about the  Synthetic Fuels Program,  the national impor tance I saw to it, and how dramatically a prob lem could potentially affect the economic and  jobs picture in  the area I represent. She  lis tened. She evaluated. She disagreed with the  overall program, but  recognized  the  impor tance  it could have  in  the  lives of so many  people in Pennsylvania. And  in the end, she  voted with us. She voted for people. That was  the kind of commitment SALA brought to Con gress-to make  the  institution work  to help  people throughout America.  Some of that can probably be traced to her  own childhood  in Poland. She fled ahead of  the Nazis. She later remarked it started her in terest  in politics because  ""when  the Nazis  were moving, you learn that politics is every body's business.""  SALA BURTON  left her mark on Congress  and the Nation. And she will long be remem bered by  those of us who were her friends  and colleagues. We are all better for knowing  her, and the institution and America suffer for  her death.  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker, I heard the news  this morning  that SALA BURTON had passed  away, and, like a loss of any close relative or  friend, it is hard for me to accept the reality of  this loss.  The papers  talk about  the  ""public"" SALA:  The Congresswoman who worked  for  those  whose voices are often ignored-the poor and  minorities; who believed that our responsibility  as lawmakers was to help those less fortunate  in this Nation and who believed that it was our  responsibility to assure future generations that  they would live in a safe world.  But what about the woman who we knew as  a colleague and a  friend-the woman who  shared our frustrations and our victories? The  SALA  I knew believed that politics was not a  business or power trip. SALA believed that pol itics is everybody's business and that to earn  your place  in  these halls you have to go to  every constituent and ask for that right.  It  is hard  for me  to believe  that SALA  is  gone now, but when I'm on the floor or when  we're debating the issues that she fought so  hard  for-arms control, education,  the envi ronment-the loss will be all too real and all  too apparent.  I would also like to extend my condolences  to my  friend  and  former  colleague,  John  Burton. He should know that we all share in  this human  loss. The grief and void  that we  feel now, will be soothed by the memories of  how  full a  life SALA  lived,  the victories she  achieved, and  the  joy  that she brought  to  others, simply  through her words,  thoughts,  and actions.

87,House,100,-0.644,972,2,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, words cannot  express the ache in my heart and soul today.  On Sunday, February 1, our colleague and my  dear friend, SALA BURTON, was taken from us  at the young age of 61 by that hideous enemy  of life, cancer.  Less  than 4 years ago,  in April 1983, her  husband, my congressional mentor, and fierce  friend, Phil Burton, was struck down by an an eurysm. To those who knew and loved them,  SALA and Phil were  true partners  in every  aspect of  life-in marriage and  in politics.  They were dual inspirations and loyal friends,  ",1987
88,Senate,100,-0.301,998,2,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, I  thank the distinguished Senator from  Louisiana for his very clear explication  of the matter before us. He is indeed  correct.  The Committee on Environment and  Public Works has kept precisely to the  provisions of  the budget  resolution  adopted in the 99th Congress. This is  the unfinished business of the 99th  Congress that we are about.  He is particularly apt in pointing out  that we have to get this legislation en acted by  the first of March at the  latest.  I do not know why we cannot have it  the end of  this week, perhaps we  cannot,  but  immediately  after  the  recess surely we can.  In absence of  that, we are going to disrupt the or derly business of the Nation in main taining and  in building  its highway  system.  I would like to record that I have  noted the statement of  the Senator  from Louisiana,  that  if  there  are  amendments  to  this  legislation  that  raise the authorizations involved they  are subject to the budget provisions  and should we come back from confer ence with a measure that exceeds our  limits it too will be subject to a point  of order and there will be a general  pileup all around.

90,Senate,100,-0.224,1011,2,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of passage of the Federal-Aid  Highway Act of 1987. I want to con gratulate the distinguished chairman  of the Committee on Environment and  Public Works  for his  leadership  in  moving  this  legislation  quickly  through his committee. Also to be con gratulated is the distinguished ranking  minority member of  the committee,  the Senator from Vermont, both for  his efforts this year and for his work  on this bill in the last Congress. I also  want to thank the Senator from New  York and the Senator from Idaho for  their work in assuring quick consider ation of this much-needed legislation.  Mr. President, failure to act on high way authorization  legislation  in  the  last Congress threatens highway work  in all States. All States have been  forced to finance Federal-aid highway  projects with Federal apportionments  carried over  from  last year. These  funds are running out.  In Florida, approximatley $500 mil lion  in annual Federal-aid highway  funds cannot be apportioned until this  legislation  is approved. The Florida  State Department of Transportation  reports that some funding categories  will be exhausted in March. Almost all  carryover funds will be used up by  summer.  In is clear that we need to act quick ly, but also wisely, if disruption of our  highway program, at considerable ex pense to the taxpayers, is to be avoid ed.  It is also clear, in looking at the his tory of our commitment to highways,  that Federal  funds  alone  are  not  enough to finance needed capacity in  many States. More and more dollars  are being spent on maintenance, and  that work is clearly needed. But this  shift has come at the expense of new  construction.  Many of you know all too well the  result of dollars not spent on needed  new  capacity.  Urbanizing  areas  become congested. Traffic snarls, time  is wasted, and economic productivity  declines. States facing the problems of  rapid growth cannot build new arteries  fast enough.  Mr. President, the need exists now  for  added  capacity. The  problems  must be dealt with now. Delay will  only compound the problems, increase  the congestion, hurt the quality of life  and decrease economic growth and ef ficiency in many areas of the country.  We must face the reality that Feder al dollars alone will not meet  this  need. I am pleased that the committee  recognized  that States must be al lowed more  flexibility  in  financing  new capacity, and included a provision  for limited, noninterstate construction  utilizing Federal-aid and toll financ ing.  I am especially grateful to my new  colleague,  the distinguished Senator  from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, for his  outstanding leadership on this issue in  the  committee.  Senator  GRAHAM  joined with me and Senators NUNN,  'rHuR.MOND, HUMPHREY, and SPECTER in  introducing the Toll Facilities Devel opment and Improvement Act of 1987  earlier this year.  The  action of  the  committee  in  adopting  the  toll  provision  speaks  clearly on the need for this approach.  The provision is the same one adopted  by the Senate last September with the  support of numerous groups, including  the American Association of State,  Highway,  and Transportation Offi cials, the National Governors' Associa tion, the National Conference of State  Legislatures, the National Association  of Regional Councils,  the American  Consulting  Engineers  Council,  the  American  Transportation  Advisory  Council,  the  International Bridge,  ",1987
91,Senate,100,-0.214,1024,2,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, the more  I listen to this debate the more confus ing  it becomes. When I hear stateyield  I  the  ments by my good  friend and col league from New Jersey  that would  lead the Senate to believe that those  of us who want to give the States the  option to go up to 65 miles per hour  are  inviting  wholesale  additional  deaths on the highways, I wonder if  my friend from New Jersey knows the  percentage of deaths on the highways  of the United States for the year 1985.  I wonder if he would state if he knows  what  those percentages are of  the  total percentage of deaths on the rural  Interstate System as opposed to the  broad category of highway deaths that  I believe the Senator from New Jersey  would concede were the thrust of his  remarks,  therefore not pertinent  to  the argument and  the discussion of  giving the States the option to raise  the speed limit.  Does the Senator from New Jersey  have  the  percentage  of  highway  deaths on the Interstate System na tionwide  as  compared  to  the  total  highway deaths?  ",1987

He has served as chairman of  the Early  Education  Program  at  Albion  Elementary  School and the Lincoln High School Advisory  Council. He has also served as vice chairman  of Committee D, Title I Citizens Compensatory  Education Advisory Committee and of the Los  Angeles Unified School District's Bilingual Ad visory Committee.

GROUNDHOG DAY  HON. WILLIAM F. CLINGER, JR.  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 2, 1987  ",1987
93,,100,0.176,1076,2,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Speaker, today is one of  the most important and most celebrated days  of the entire year. Today is Groundhog's Day.  And it just so happens that the most famous  groundhog in the world, Punxsutawney Phil, is  a constituent of mine. He  lives a  relatively  quiet  life  for most of  the year  in his  little  borrow in Punxsutawney, PA, coming out once  a year on this date to tell us what the rest of  the winter will be like. He is the most accurate  weather-forecasting groundhog that ever lived  because he's never been wrong. And  this  morning,  just  like clockwork, he crawled out  from his burrow on Gobbler's Knob, and at  7:29 a.m., Punxsutawney Phil saw his consid erable shadow and proclaimed that there will  in  fact be 6 more weeks of winter.  I would  now  like  to  include  the official proclamation  that was made  this morning on  the chilly  slopes  of Gobbler's Knob  by  James  H.  Means,  the president of  the Punxsutawney  Groundhog, on this,  the 1 OOth anniversary of  Punxsutawney Phil's  famous weather  fore casts:  Here ye, here ye. On this the lOOth anni versary of Groundhog Day,  true believers  here on Gobbler's Knob and around  the  world have just seen history in the making.  As president of the Punxsutawney Ground hog Club, I, James H. Means, proclaim that  the only reliable weather forecaster, Punx sutawney Phil, has come out from his offi cial home to celebrate a century of accurate  predictions. He stood proud for a moment,  then he saw his shadow at precisely 7:29  a.m. Even though it is his anniversary, the  kind of all grounghogs has gone back into  his borrow. Like him, we will now have to  wait 6 more weeks for the arrival of spring.  That is the lOOth anniversary forecast from  the weather capital of the world, Punxsu tawney, PA.  BIRTHDAY CONGRATULATIONS  TO GERTRUDE M. WATSON  HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 2, 1987  ",1987
94,,100,-0.502,1076,2,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  pay tribute to Gertrude M. Watson of Reading,  February 2, 1987  MA, a truly outstanding  resident of my con gressional district on the occasion of her 90th  birthday on February 4, 1987.  Living  for 90 years certainly is remarkable,  but  it  is  the quality of Gertrude's life  that  I  commend. As  the years pass, we  inevitably  notice the process of our own aging. Probably  at age 50 we first see evidence of our own  physical limitations. A little later in life, maybe  at age 70, we  sometimes notice  that our  memories are no  longer perfect. We must  concede  that our younger colleagues and  family members are more capable than we of  meeting many of life's demands. Though age  may impose limits on our physical strength, it  never imposes  limits on  the development of  the human spirit. We always have the ability to  continue to grow in wisdom.  We live this life in order to learn certain les sons. Early in life we learn to test our physical  strength and our intellectual prowess. We are  here to learn to accept life on its own terms,  to be  tolerant of  the weaknesses of others  and ourselves, and  to continue  to place our  faith  in God  that this world  is  fundamentally  very good.  It takes love and patience to raise a family  and Gertrude has raised 5 sons, all veterans  of World War  II, and 2 daughters, who have  given her 25 grandchildren, and 35  great grandchildren. By the courageous, loving, and  generous way  in which she has  lived, Ger trude has set a wonderful example  for her  family and friends.  Congratulations, again, and I send my best  wishes on this happy day.  WESLEY HOMES, INC.  HON.GEORGE(BUDDY)DARDEN  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 2, 1987  ",1987
95,,100,-0.161,1076,2,Mr. DARDEN.," Mr. Speaker, this week in At lanta, the Nation's first geriatric teaching and  research hospital is being dedicated.  I would  like to call  the attention of my colleagues to  this latest project of Wesley Homes. Inc., the  largest agency providing care for the elderly in  the United Methodist Church.  The $20 million hospital to be dedicated this  week will operate  in collaboration with  the  Robert W. Woodruff Health Sciences Center  at Emory University.  Its medical staff will be  comprised of community physicians and facul ty from the Emory University School of Medi cine.  The  two-story, 1 00,000-square-foot  facility  will provide comprehensive evaluation, diagno sis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, as  well as psychiatric care  for  the elderly and  acute medical care for the aging.  In addition  to studies of Alzheimer's research will  focus  on depression, sleep disorders, Parkinson's  disease and other problems of  the central  nervous system.  It is a tribute ot the enterprise of those in volved in the Wesley Homes ministries that no  Federal funds are involved in the construction  of this facility.  I know  that my colleague, Mr. PEPPER of  Florida, this body's renowned spokesman for  the needs of the elderly, will be among those  ",1987
96,House,100,0.372,1089,2,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, although  I  voted  for  the clean water bill,  I  would like to urge my colleagues today  to  join me  in sustaining  the Presi dent's veto of it.  My position is not as contradictory  as it may first seem. My vote for the  bill was my way of saying, ""Yes, I am  for clean water too-who isn't?"" I rec ognize and strongly support the need  for national commitment in this area.  It was my way, I guess, of telling the  administration that they were a day  late and a dollar short on helping to  craft a compromise. But the President  made his decision  to veto, and  that  changes the complexion of the situa tion, at least for this Member.  We can ask again: How much should  we spend, and how should we spend it?  The clean water bill, like everything  else that comes before us these days,  must be  judged not only in terms of  what  it seeks  to do, but  in what  it  costs taxpayers to do it.  There is an environmental consensus  in this country. It embraces conserv atives and liberals, Democrats and Re publicans. It seeks to preserve and ra tionally use our environmental herit age.  But there is also an equally strong  budget consensus to see to it that the  policy goals that we seek are reached  by wise and prudent use of tax dollars.  That is the issue before us today not whether we will spend tax dollars  for clean water, but, rather, what  is  the prudent balance to be struck be tween  tax-dollar  expenditure  and  policy goals.  The President says that we can do  better. I suspect we can. If we can do  better, then we ought to.  By way of a brief review, the Clean  Water Act Construction Grant Pro gram, which this legislation funds, is a  classic example of how a well-inten tioned, short-term program ballooned  into  open-ended,  long-term  commit ments costing billions of dollars more  than anticipated or needed. Since 1972  the Federal Government has helped  fund the construction of local sewage  treatment facilities, and I might add  that I recall that debate very vividly  where there were marked differences  on both sides as to what our obligation  was  at  the Federal  level  and  the  amounts and all  the  rest.  It was a  matter that historically and properly  was  the  responsibility of State and  local governments up  to  that  time.  The Federal Government's first spend ing in this area was intended to be a  short-term effort to assist in financing  the backlog of facilities needed at the  time to meet the original Clean Water  Act requirements.  When the program started, the cost  of the commitment to the Federal tax payers was estimated at $18 billion. To  day we have put $47 billion appropri ated  funds  into  the program. Now  H.R. 1 proposes  to put still another  $18 billion of  taxpayers' money  into  the program.  0 1305  Despite all this, only 67 percent of  all municipalities have actually com pleted  the  construction  needed  to  comply with the Clean Water Act pol lution limits. On the other hand, non municipal  treatment  systems, which  have  received  no  Federal  funding,  have completed 94 percent of the con struction needed for compliance with  Federal pollution standards.  The President, in his veto message,  predicted that he would be overridden  today, but he also said ""It is time we  did the right thing-all of us-regard less of the political fallout.""  He went on to remind us that when  he delivered his State of  the Union  Message right here in this Chamber,  the Congress all rose up in unanimous  applause when he declared from  the  Speaker's  podium  that  the  ""U.S.  budget deficit was unacceptable and  outrageous."" And  everyone  rose on  their feet and applauded and applaud ed.  91-059 0-89-35 (Pt. 2)  ",1987

121,Senate,100,0.261,1141,2,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I do  not believe anyone can be against the  regulation  of  billboards  along  our  Interstate System. This amendment  would  require  the  removal of bill boards, and I support that goal. But I  cannot support what amounts to con fiscation or condemnation without fair  compensation.  If a building is taken down because a  new roadway is built, just compensa tion is mandated. The same thing, it  seems to me, should apply in the case  of billboards.  Mr. President, a compromise on this  issue is needed, and I believe we can  reach a fair compromise on this diffi cult issue if we work with the billboard  language that has been added in the  House. Therefore,  I will be voting  against this amendment today, and I  will support the efforts of the confer ees to reach the goal of highway beau tification  in  a  fair  and  equitable  manner.  ",1987
122,Senate,100,-0.095,1141,2,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I would  like  to point out that the Highway  Beautification Act is not an environ mental issue, but it is one  involving  property rights.  Clean air and clean water are not in volved, nor are our national parks, na tional  forests,  or  scenic  highways.  What is involved is the ability of a le gitimate  industry  to do business  in  commercial  and  industrial  areas,  where  service  stations,  fast-food  chains, retail stores, and the like are  allowed to thrive.  Just as important as the right to do  business is the right to possess private  property, without fear that the State  or  its subdivisions can confiscate  it  without payment of cash compensa tion.  Police  power  removal  of  signs  through amortization has not reared  its ugly head in Alabama until the last  few years, when it appeared in a Tus caloosa ordinance. Birmingham now  has such an ordinance under consider ation. I do not want to see this perfect ly  legitimate  industry decimated by  amortization.  Mr.  President,  this  amendment  would jeopardize that right to private  property and  I hope my colleagues  would reject this amendment.  ",1987
123,Senate,100,-0.396,1141,2,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. President, I intend  to vote against  this amendment not  because I object to its goals but rather  because I object to the way in which it  seeks to realize them.  I certainly do not dispute the desir ability of reducing visual pollution nor  do I deny the esthetic value of control ling billboards.

125,Senate,100,-0.322,1167,2,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to support the inclusion of im portant language in the 1987 Highway  Authorization bill which  is critically  important to the State of Arkansas.  Senator BUMPERS has introduced-and  I have cosponsored-5 pieces of legisla tion to accomplish our goals. In addi tion, we have written the chairman of  the Environment and Public Works  Committee-Senator  BURDICK-and  the ranking minority member-Sena tor STAFFORD-urging them to include  this  language  in  the  committee  amendment to  the bill. As  I under stand it, the committee has agreed to  our request, with the exception of the  amendment to section 144 for bridge  replacement.  The Senate and/or the House have  approved these provisions previously,  but last year due to other controver sial issues, the Highway bill conferees  were unable to produce a compromise  bill which could be sent to the Presi dent for his signature. We are very  hopeful the conferees will be able to  quickly resolve their differences this  year, due to the pressing need for re lease of Highway Trust Funds dollars  to the States, so they can be prepared  for the coming construction season.  Mr. President, the need for reloca tion of Highway 71  in northwest Ar kansas  is  apparent  to anyone who  travels  this winding and dangerous  thoroughfare in the Ozark Mountains.  Although State efforts are underway  to improve what is now a frightening  situation, Federal support is essential.  The precious lives of the State's youth  depend on this project, since 71 is the  highway which  leads  to  the main  campus of the University of Arkansas  at Fayetteville.  The Waldron Road project  is an other  important  transportation need  ",1987
126,Senate,100,-0.492,1180,2,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I am pleased that the Senate today is  acting  on  the  critically  important  highway  legislation. We must make  every effort to enact this bill into law  as soon as possible. Therefore, I do not  intend to speak at length on the sub ject.  The need for quick action is obvious.  According to the American Association  of State Highway and Transportation  Officials, many States will  face  the  loss of their entire 1987 construction  seasons  if a bill  is not passed and  signed  into  law  by  the  President  before spring.  My own State of Ohio has a limited  construction season. There is simply  no way  the State can compress  a  year's construction program  into  6  months. The bid and contract process  alone usually takes 2 to 3 months.  Each additional day of delay results  in more job loss and more dangerous  roads. At  this  very moment  141  projects, costing $323 million, and di rectly affecting some 7,655 jobs, are on  indefinite hold-in Ohio alone.  I am concerned about the fact that  there are major differences between  this bill and the highway bill passed  by the other body on January 21.  I  hope the Senate will see fit to pass  this bill  today. Furthermore, I hope  the conferees will see fit to set aside  their differences and  to produce a  final measure as expeditiously as pos sible.  ",1987
127,Senate,100,0.262,1180,2,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I join  my distinguished colleagues who have  gone before me in supporting prompt  enactment of S. 387, the Federal-Aid  Highway Act of 1987. My colleagues  on the committee have already testi fied to the dire need for this legisla tion in eloquent  terms. Therefore, I  will speak only to what this legislation  means to the Commonwealth of Vir ginia.  Because of congressional failure to  enact a bill last year, the Virginia De partment of Transportation has al ready been forced to delay advertising  some $70 million in needed highway  projects across the State. These delays  only  add  significant  costs  to  the  projects the State is ready  to begin  construction  on.  In  addition,  the  delays mean that the entire construc tion program must be pushed back.  Last September, the Virginia Gener al Assembly completed an historic spe cial session which was devoted entirely  to the transportation needs of Virgin ia's citizens. The  general  assembly  worked from a package of recommen dations submitted by a specially ap pointed commission on transportation  in the 21st century. Acting upon those  recommendations, the general assem bly enacted some of the most sweeping  changes  in Virginia's  transportation  history.  Foremost among these changes was  the passage of a $422 million revenue  package. Therefore, the delays caused  by Congress  in getting  the Federal  highway moneys to Virginia have an  exacerbated  effect,  because  of  the  State's newly approved and highly am bitious program. Projects across  the  transportation realm will suffer. All  systems-interstate, primary,  second ary, and urban-that receive matching  Federal funds will be affected.  Mr. President, I would like to con gratulate the members of the Environ ment and Public Works Committee,  upon which  I now serve as a new  member this year-for their speed in  bringing this legislation to the Senate  floor. I must say that it is a testament  to the importance of this legislation  that the committee markup took but a  couple of hours. I would like to thank  especially  the  new  chairman,  the  senior Senator from North Dakota,  Senator BURDICK, as well as the com mittee's last chairman, our colleague  Senator STAFFORD. I would also like to  thank the new chairman of the Public  Works  and Transportation Subcom mittee, the Senator from New York,  Senator MOYNIHAN, and the Senator  from Idaho, Senator SYMMS. I find the  leadership of Senator SYMMS on this  issue to be worthy of special note.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to act expeditiously on passage of this  bill so that the conferees can begin the  difficult task which no doubt awaits  them.  PRIORITY PROJECTS  ",1987
128,Senate,100,0.068,1180,2,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I wish  to speak in support of projects of great  importance to my State of Pennsylva nia. These projects will benefit from  the  improved  flexibility  given  the  States in financing them through any  Federal-aid funding category.  EBENSBURG BYPASS  Construction  of  the  Ebensburg  bypass in Cambria County will require  $28 million between 1987 and 1991.  Currently,  traffic on Route 219  is  abruptly forced off the multilane, lim ited-access  highway  and onto  local  streets, where it is consequently im mersed  in local  traffic where Route  422 crosses it at Ebensburg. Construetion, for which the Pennsylvania De partment of Transportation has al ready begun engineering, would divert  traffic to a relocated 5.1-mile segment.  ROUTE 220  Construction of Route 220  in Blair  County will require $90 million over  the life of the Federal-Aid Highway  Act of 1986. The project will demon strate the cutting edge of techniques  to guide drivers,  such as pavement  markings and vegetation, which great ly enhance highway safety. An antici pated 10,000  ears daily will benefit  from improvements on this new seg ment, which will close the only gap11.9 miles-in the multilane  limited access road connecting the Pennsylva nia Turnpike and the Tyrone bypass.  BASIN STREET RAIL CROSSING  Traffic tieups where Basin Street in  Allentown intersects a Conrail grade  crossing  have  plagued  the Lehigh  Valley for more than a decade. This  crossing has restricted the traffic flow  in East Allentown significantly and  has hampered economic development  in  the  area  for many  years. The  project would require $6 million over 3  years, and is no less deserving of con sideration today than when I original ly requested its inclusion 2 years ago.  SOUTHERN EXPRESSWAY  A project deserving of priority desig nation  is  the Southern Expressway,  which will serv1e  the most important  economic development project in west ern Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh Air port Midfield Terminal. The Southern  Expressway, which will  require $5.5  million in 1987 for preliminary engi neering and desi.gn, is an essential ele ment of the airport improvements, as  it will enable traffic to bypass airport  and local roads that hamper access to  the Pittsburgh Airport.  NEW SEWICKLEY TO CONWAY  A project very worthy of mention is  construction of a two-lane highway be tween the township of New Sewickley  and  the borough of Conway. This  project will demonstrate methods of  accommodating increasing truck traf fie and improving highway safety, and  will require $13.4 million in 1990.  JOHNSTOWN ACCESS ROAD  A sum of $720,000 authorized to be  spent in 1987 will enable the State to  upgrade a 1.3-mile access road to the  Johnstown Flood National Memorial  in  the vicinity of Croyle Township,  PA.  KITTANING TO BROOKVILLE  We have reQ.uested that $2 million  be spent over the life of this bill tore construct approximately 30 miles of a  two-lane road on the Federal aid pri mary system between Kittaning and  Brookville,  PA.  The  cost-effective  method proposed will improve a rural  highway so that it will be better able  to  accommodate wider  and  longer  trucks.  ",1987
129,Senate,100,-0.293,1206,2,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to introduce legislation rein stituting  the military  draft.  I  am  pleased that my colleague from Idaho,  Senator SYMMS, joins me in this effort.  We need the draft for many reasons most importantly, we need it in order  to  remain  true  to  the  ideals which  built this country.  I  believe  the need  for a military  draft has been and continues to be the  most  compelling,  but unrecognized,  priority facing us. The ability and will ingness of our Nation  to meet  its  future security needs and those of our  allies hang in the balance. Unfortu nately, like in other urgencies, such as  with the massive deficits, the Congress  reaches a gridlock when action on the  draft is warranted and has failed in its  responsibility  to  solve  the problem  before time runs out.  The All-Volunteer Force is a product  of the Vietnam mindset.

130,,100,-0.196,1245,2,Mr. VOLKMER.," Mr. Speaker, now is not the  right time. Now is not the time to tell our con stituents we need an increase in our salaries.  Incomes in my district are stagnant. Farmers  in my district are  suffering  from  low-cash  prices. The elderly are surviving on generally  fixed incomes. It's the wrong time.  The President has asked us to increase our  own salaries. I cannot accept the President's  premise that we have the ethical right to raise  our salaries at a time when so many  in  the  low and middle classes of this country have  been asked to make sacrifices.  It is time to change the way Congress con siders pay raises. No pay raise should  take  effect until  after  the  next election.  I will  oppose this pay raise.  THE  NEED  TO  CREATE  AN  OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENER AL IN THE POSTAL SERVICE  HON. MICKEY LELAND  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 3, 1987  ",1987
131,,100,-0.596,1245,2,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  today my col league, the Honorable FRANK HORTON, and I  are introducing legislation to create an Office  of Inspector General in the U.S. Postal Serv ice.  The Postal inspector general would function  in the same manner as the inspectors general  in the executive agencies, operating as an in dependent unit conducting audits and investi gations relating to fraud, mismanagement and  abuse, and promoting economy and efficiency  in the Postal Service. The independent Postal  inspector general would be appointed by the  President, confirmed by the Senate and would  report directly to the Congress, as do other in spectors general.  Currently, responsibility for investigating  in ternal  fraud and abuse rests with  the Postal  Inspection Service which  is also responsible  for enforcing criminal laws involving the Postal  Service. The Chief Postal Inspector is appoint ed by, and reports to, the Postmaster General.  In hearings held by  the Postal Operations  Subcommittee  in  the  last Congress, several  key witnesses,  including a current  inspector  general, the head of GAO's Fraud Prevention  and Audit Oversight Group, and  the Deputy  Director of OMB, all stated that of crucial im portance  to  the effectiveness of the  inspec tors general was their independence from the  head of the agency to which  they were as signed.  The need for an  independent fraud detec tion and prevention unit at the Postal Service  has never been more evident than  in recent  months with  the uncovering of scandals  in volving Postal management. As a  result of  criminal action  involving  the STARS  [source  time and attendance  recording system] proEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  curement, two postal managers are now serv ing prison terms. Last May, a member of the  Postal Service Board of Governors resigned  and is also now incarcerated for using his po sition on the Board to influence the awarding  of a multimillion dollar Postal Service contract.  Finally, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics  was sharply critical of actions taken by the im mediate past chairman of  the Postal Board  after it was revealed that he had a ""financial  interest"" in a law firm hired by the Board.  During Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee hearings on mail fraud legislation in the  97th Congress, it was determined that in order  to better protect the public, the Postal Serv ice's investigatory process must be acceler ated and its enforcement tools made more ef fective. The legislation that we introduce today  would give the Postal Service's law enforce ment efforts  the needed  independence and  authority to carry out internal ""watch dog"" ac tivities. Additionally, the Inspection Service will  still be  responsible  for  the  investigation and  prosecution of  fraudulent and abusive mail  schemes, and providing for the safety and se curity of the mail, postal personnel and postal  property. With  the additional powers of  the  inspector general, the Postal Service must also  become more accountable to the public. Ac cordingly,  the Postal Service's inspector gen eral will be required to make annual reports to  Congress, as do other inspectors general.  I urge my colleagues to support us  in  legislative effort.  this  MAKING THE TAX CODE FAIRER  TO THE AMERICAN WORKER  AND AMERICAN BUSINESS  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 3, 198 7  ",1987
132,,100,-0.245,1245,2,Mr. JONES of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  I have introduced legislation to disap prove the President's deferral of $28,559,000  from the TE!mporary Emergency Food Assist ance Program. This program provides  funds  for the distribution of surplus commodities to  the poor and was funded at a modest level of  $50 million f'or this year.  The Temporary Emergency Food Assist ance Program has been a successful one for  6 years. In Tennessee alone, it provides more  than 700,000  individuals with  supplemental  food. Over one-half of the 125,000 homes uti lizing the program depend on the program as  a major food supply. The $50 million funding  level appears very modest in comparison  to  those served by this important program. A de ferral of ovor $28 million will effectively elimi nate  the distribution of surplus commodities.  The State and local agencies will be forced to  halt their distribution services almost immedi ately,  thus.  leaving  surplus  commodities  unused and families hungry. There is no need  for  the disruption of  this most helpful and  modest program. We should not  let surplus  food go to waste while people go hungry in  our Nation.  On January 29, 1987, the Senate passed an  amendment  disapproving  of  this  deferral  action by the administration. I hope the House  will follow the lead of the Senate and disap prove of the President's action. We should be  helping the hungry people in our country and  this program of surplus commodity distribution  is an effective means of accomplishing  this  goal.  I urge thet support of my colleagues in this  effort to disapprove of the deferral of funds  for  the Temporary Emergency Food Assist ance Program.  ",1987
133,House,100,-0.438,1258,2,Mr. FORD of Tennessee.," Mr. Speak er, it is time for us to act as a body to  raise the minimum wage for the nUl lions of working poor in this Nation.  The number of family breadwinners  working year round and earning $7,000  per year-the minimum wage-is  in creasing at an alarming rate.  A minimum wage worker, with two  children,  has  a  standard  of  living  which is 24 percent below the poverty  line.  The low minimum wage undermines  the work ethic. In many areas of the  country an adult with  two children  can actually receive more income from  basic welfare benefits  than  from  a  minimum wage  job. This makes wel fare dependency a sound economic de cision for many families who must put  food on the table: Wages such as these  provide no incentive to work.  An increased minimum wage would  provide many unemployed, especially  welfare  recipients,  the necessary  in centive to become self-sufficient. A job  with sufficient income to provide an  improved standard of living for those  trapped  in poverty will  reduce  the  public assistance costs to our Nation.  Self -sufficiency based on earning an  adequate minimum wage which will  support basic needs is a fundamental  right we all should desire.  I urge my colleagues to support leg islation  to  increase  the minimum  wage.  CLEAN WATER VOTE  <Mr. UPTON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1987
134,House,100,0.339,1258,2,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker,  it was  with a heavy heart that I cast yester day's vote to override the President's  veto of H.R. 1, the clean water bill. As  a  fiscal  conservative  and  former  Reagan administration official, I can  understand many of  the President's  objections to some of the expenditures  in this legislation. However, I believe it  is  important for us all  to remember  that this is only an authorization, not  an appropriations bill. Therefore, the  actual dollar figures provided for  in  this legislation are by no means final.  When the appropriations bill is consid ered on the House floor, then we can  debate spending limits.  As  things now stand, the cost-shar ing provisions of this bill, as well as its  overall goal of providing for an effec tive system of clean wa~ter manage ment, merit enactment of H.R. 1. I am  confident  that my constituents who  live on the shore of Lake Michigan, a  body of water that I hope will remain  forever clean, and those who live on  lakes  and  rivers  throughout  my  Fourth District, will support my deci sion on this legislation.  RELEASE OF FUNDS FOR EL  SALVADOR  <Mr. McCOLLUM  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, on  June 19, 1985,  four young American  men and nine Salvadoran women and  children were brutally sladn by a  ter rorist bomb set off in a crowed cafe in  San Salvador. Since that time, terror ists acts committed by guerrillas in El  Salvador have claimed many civilian  lives. In 1985, though San Salvador is  a city of over 1 million people,  the  police had very  few cars, no radios,  and no antiterrorist training.  This body has twice approved funds  for antiterrorist training :for the civil ian police forces of El Salvador. The  funding for this program also provides  for  such necessary  items  as  police  radios, and the purchase of police cars.  It has come to my attention that the  chairman of the Appropriations' For eign Operations Subcommittee,  the  gentleman  from  Wiseonsin  [Mr.  OBEY], has unilaterally defied the will  of this body and placed a hold at the  State Department and blocked the use  of these funds in this fiscal year. This  is not the first time th:at the gentle man has acted on his own in defiance  of this body: Last year h.e delayed this  program by nearly 5 months; 5 months  of no training, no purchase of radios.  All the while terrorists were killing in nocent civilians in El Salvador. Most  surprising  is  that one of the young  boys killed in June 198S, while peace fully sitting in a cafe, w:as Robert Pat rick Kwiatkowski,  a  native  of Mr.  OBEY's hometown of Vlfausau. What  do we say to the family of Mr. Kwiat kowski: That we have  the means to  train and equip San Salvador's police  to prevent more senseless deaths at  the hands of terrorists, but one man,  Mr. OBEY, for some unknown reason,  does not want this to happen?

I urge all of my colleagues to vote  for House Joint Resolution 102.  ",1987
136,House,100,-0.173,1271,2,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. Speaker, I appre ciate very much the opportunity af forded us yesterday by the gentleman  from Michigan [Mr. FoRD]  to say our  piece on the proposed pay increases.  I have cosponsored House Joint Res olution 123, offered by the gentleman  from New Hampshire  [Mr. SMITH],  which does not provide for the pay in crease to us as Members of Congress.  We talked yesterday about the issue  of whether or not this kind of increase  was constitutional. I do not want to  talk about that today.  We talked about whether or not in creases should go  into effect at mid term. I frankly do not wish to address  that, either.  Let me just say that I think that we  have to pay Members of Congress a  reasonable  level of compensation  in  order to attract good people. Our fail ure  to do  that  really  invites  three  things: One of  those  is a House of  Lords,  club of millionnaires,  if you  wish; another is people who are going  to serve here but really only serve part  time and be out making speeches and  writing books and doing other things  in order to supplement their pay hon estly; or maybe, worse yet, the third  alternative would be that we would go  out and do something dishonest or un scrupulous to supplement our income.  I do not think we want any of those  things, and I  think it is appropriate  that we  raise our pay from  time  to  time.  Having  said  that,  the question  is  what is a reasonable level of compen sation? I would simply contend that  the level at which we are now paid,  $77,000,  is a reasonable level of com pensation.  A couple of questions came  to my  mind during yesterday's hearing. One  of those questions was how long has it  been  since  you  or  I  have  seen  a  Member of the Congress, the House or  the Senate, step down during midterm  because we were insufficiently paid? I  might also add, how long has it been  since we have had an open seat, a  vacant seat, either midterm or at the  end of a term, that went unfilled be cause  Democrats  and  Republicans  were unwilling to run for the position  because we  thought the pay was  too  low?  I cannot recall that; nor can I think  any of you recall instances where that  actually did occur.  Let me just say that what I think we  should do is vote to raise our pay commensurate with the increases we pro vide  to all Federal employees. Last  year, we froze their pay. Similarly, we  froze our pay.  This year, we provided a 3 percent  pay  increase  for Federal employees;  this year, we provided the same for  ourselves. I think that is a good model  for us  to  follow and would suggest  that we do that.  We have a long way to go to reach  our deficit reduction target for next  year.  0 1540  Mr. Speaker, we are clearly going to  be above our target for this year. I do  not  see  a  ground  swell of support  coming up on either side of the aisle  here to raise taxes. As a result, we are  going to have  to focus on spending,  and to the extent we are willing to  tighten our belts just a little bit, it is a  lot easier for me and, I suspect, for all  of us to go to the rest of the people in  this country and ask them to tighten  their belts so  that we might bring  down these budget deficits.

157,Senate,100,-0.314,1388,2,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, enact ment of the Water Quality Act of 1987  represents,  in the strongest terms, a  commitment by the Federal Govern ment to clean up and protect a most  valuable resource---:-the Nation's water.  Through this bill, Congress sets the  course  into  the next century  for a  comprehensive program to restore and  protect thousands of rivers, lakes, and  streams across the Nation.  We are at a crossroads in our com mitment to achieving the goal of fish able,  swimmable waters  throughout  the  country. The  choice  that  lays  before us  is  just one of many  that  Congress and the American people will  have  to decide on  in  the next  few  years-what are we going to leave for  our future generations? We have made  a start in leaving our children cleaner  waters, but the job is not complete.  We no longer see rivers catching on  fire because they are so clogged with  pollutants, and Americans have seen  progress in bringing life back to lakes  that were once declared dead. The  worst cases are being dealt with, but  there is more that needs to be done.  The choice we must make is whether  to keep the commitment to cleaning  up the Nation's waters, or to put it on  hold, hoping  to pick  it up at some  later time. This is the time in which  we have to look at an effort, decide if  ",1987

159,,100,-0.295,1531,2,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing  the Tank Farm Safety Act,  legislation  which would prevent the recurrence of a po tentially catastrophic situation. On January 7,  1983, a Texaco storage tank in Port Newark,  NJ, exploded, burned 3.3 million gallons of  gasoline, caused the death of one person, in jured 23 persons, and  resulted  in over $15  million worth of property damage. One of the  principal causes of  the explosion was over filled fuel storage tanks.  The fire burned for several days creating an  inferno equal  in area  to  two  football  fields.  The  tremendous  force of  the blast knocked  out windows in Jersey City and Bayonne, and  was even  felt by  some  residents  in  Long  Island 70 miles distant.  Its magnitude might  not have been limited to the series of storage  tanks set afire  in chain  reaction. Within  the  shadow of the smoke and  fumes  lay a large  propane company which, if involved in the fire,  would have caused untold  loss of  life and  property damage.  Tank  farms such as  these are distributed  throughout the Nation. Nearly 3,000 of these  facilities are located in New Jersey. A matter  as crucial as  the safety of these containers,  which are often concentrated  in or around  heavily populated urban areas, warrants  the  passage  of  this  legislation. My  bill would  ensure the safe and efficient operation of tank  farms  by  requiring  alarm  systems  at  all  manned  fuel storage  facilities. This  type of  alarm would activate  in  case of container  overfill or if the standard signaling device itself  is not working, and would sound  in  time  for  monitoring personnel  to shut off the  flow of  liquids into the tank. Only alarm devices ap proved by the National Fire Protection Agency  could be used at these terminals.  This legislation also mandates that an alarm  system with  automatic  shutoff devices be  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  used at unmanned terminals. This would notify  anyone  in  the area  that there  is a problem,  even as the flow of fuel is being automatically  stopped.  Plans and specifications for any new, high level alarm system to be  installed under this  act would be submitted to the Assistant Sec retary of Labor  for Occupational Safety and  Health  for approval prior  to  its  installation.  OSHA would be responsible for checking the  system once  it  is  in place, and  the terminal  owner would be required to inspect the facility  every 3 months. The results of the tests would  be filed with OSHA.  Proper  standards  of  plant management  would be maintained  in addition to an effec tive automatic alarm system. Terminal proce dures to verify property lineup and receipt of  fuel would be established  in order to ensure  that the right amount of fuel goes to the right  tank.  In addition,  the bill would  require  that  plant personnel are  adequately  supervised  and monitored.  Automation in the tank farm industry is long  overdue, and invaluable in ensuring the future  safety of our citizens. The protection of our in dustrial areas, and the well-being of residential  communities which  lie  close  to  industrial  zones depend upon prompt consideration of  this bill. An explosion  in a container storage  area can result in untold deaths and injuries to  both workers and residents alike. It can leave  a prosperous  industrial zone devastated; se verely damaged nearby residential neighbor hoods; waste billions of gallons of precious  fuel; and add  to  the environmental decay of  the surrounding area.  I respectfully urge my  colleagues to support this important bill.  THE BOMBER DEBATE  HON. BYRON L. DORGAN  OF NORTH DAKOTA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 4, 1987  ",1987
160,,100,-0.267,1531,2,Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.," Mr. Speaker,  in the weeks ahead, Congress will face some  tough choices about needed improvements to  our strategic deterrent. As we  in Congress  continue to insist on genuine, verifiable weap ons  test bans and arms  reduction, we also  have a responsibility  to make sound choices  about our own defense forces and  the mod ernization of our aging bomber fleet.  After frequent visits tq the two Strategic Air  Command bases in North Dakota, Minot AFB  and Grand Forks AFB,  I became convinced  that our B-52 bomber force had become so  old as to create a future threat to the safety of  our air crews and the credibility of our deter rent. Accordingly,  I determined  that  it made  sense to invest in a limited buy of B-1 bomb ers as a hedge against the anticipated devel opment of the advanced technology or Stealth  bomber.  A recent feature in the Baltimore Sun aired  the debate of how to modernize our bomber  force. My own view is that we should wind up  the B-1 purchase and move toward the pro curement of  the  truly modern  technologies  embodied  in  the Stealth bomber. But  these  are tough and expensive choices and I would  invite my colleagues  to  review carefully  the  2949  debate engendered in the Sun articles by Jef frey Record and Joseph Zentner which were  carried in the February 2, 1987 edition.  The articles follow:  [From the Baltimore Sun, Feb. 2, 19871  BOMBERS: THE B1 ...  <By Jeffrey ReLvrd)  WASHINGTON.-Once  again,  the  B-1  bomber is back in the news. Canceled by the  Carter administration but revived in an ad vanced version by the Reagan administra tion, the B-1 is the first strategic bomber to  appear in the United States since the last B52, a 40-year-old design, left the factory in  1962.  The B-1 is moreover a rarity among major  U.S. weapon systems today. It is being pro duced on the basis of a fixed-price contract,  and delivered to the military months ahead  of schedule and hundreds of millions of dol lars below its congressionally-imposed pro gram cost ceiling of $20.5 billion  in fiscal  year 1981 dollars for 100 planes.  The Air Force's recent request for $600  million to make last-minute improvements  in the B-1 does not, contrary to some opin ions, constitute a cost-overrun: the original  fixed-price contract anticipated the need for  ""fixes"" derived from actual flight tests and  the $600 million will come out of the over  $700 million the Congress earlier took back  from the program precisely because it was  ahead of schedule and under cost. Com pared to most Defense Department procure ment programs these days, the B-1 program  is a model of good management and cost dis cipline.  These are not, however, the aspects of the  B-1 program that have elicited the recent  critical comment, which has virtually  ig nored the program's managerial and budget ary successes. Rather, the focus has been on  alleged  deficiencies  of  the  plane  itself,  which has been dubbed a ""lemon"" and a  ""flying Edsel.""  What is remarkable about the criticisms is  the underlying  ignorance  they  reflect of  modern bomber  tactics,  the great differ ences between the old Carter B-lA and the  new B-1B, and the even greater differences  between warplanes and commercial aircraft.  Consider,  for example,  the charge  that  the B-1 cannot fly as high as most commer cial airliners in service. The charge is true.  It is also irrelevant. Ever since Francis Gary  Powers and his high-flying U-2 spy plane  were shot down over the Soviet Union  in  1960 by a Soviet surface-to-air <SAM> mis sile, it has been recognized by real experts  that tv fly high over the Soviet Union in a  hostile aircraft  is almost certainly  to die  high. The modern SAM and missile-firing  supersonic  interceptor have made World  War 11-style high-altitude bombing attacks  suicidal. It was for this reason that the B70,  the first intended replacement for the  B-52, was canceled  in  favor of  the B-1,  which  is designed  to fly at altitudes-200  feet or  lower-where enemy SAM  radars  cannot  distinguish  them  from what  is  known as ""ground clutter."" The B-1 has  been built to survive in hostile air space, not  to  ferry  vacationing  civilians  through  friendly skies.  Another charge is that the B-1B is at least  41  tons heavier than the old B-lA, which  presumably compromises the B-IB's range  and maneuverability. This is also true, and  it's also highly misleading. The B-1B actual ly weights only 3.5 tons more than the B1A. The significant difference in weight lies  not in the planes themselves but their pay",1987
161,Senate,100,0.589,40,8,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President,  last December the brutal Soviet occu pation  of Afghanistan  entered  its  eighth year. The horrible condition of  human rights in Afghanistan was re cently described in a United Nations  report as:  ""A Situation Approaching  Genocide.""  As chairman of  the Congressional  Task Force on Afghanistan, I have re ceived thousands of letters from Amer icans across the Nation who are out raged at the senseless atrocities being  committed  today  in  Afghanistan.  Many of these letters are from Ameri cans who are shocked at this Nation's  relative  silence  about  the  genocide  taking place in Afghanistan.  In the weeks and months ahead, I  plan  to share some of  these  letters  with my colleagues. I will insert into  the RECORD two letters each day from  various States in the Nation. Today, I  submit two letters from the State of  Vermont and ask that they be printed  in the RECORD.  The letters follow:  DEAR MR. HuMPHREY: We are very con cerned about the people of Afghanistan and  wish you people  in Washington could do  something about it. It looks to us like an other Nazi Germany and we said we would  not let that happen again but it is happen ing and people are being wiped off the map.  We hope everyone who reads the Reader's  Digest will write to you and let you know of  our concern.  Sincerely,  LEONA CHAMBERLAND.  CHESTER, VT.  I  I  DEAR SENATOR HUMPHREY: I have just fin ished  reading an article  in  this month's  Reader's Digest entitled ""Agony in Afghani stan"". Once again I find myself sitting here  in my  nice  comfortable  home  thinking  about how awful this situation is half-way  around the globe in Afghanistan. Other ar ticles I have read on the same subject have  left me feeling  the same way, but please  bear with me as I share some of my feelings  with you.  During the time we had forces fighting in  Vietnam this country became a house divid ed. There was hardly a day that went by  without mention of  the war  in the news  media. The coverage it received, to a great  extent,  shaped our policy  regarding our  military objectives in that entire region.  believe  that the results of that war have  been  felt  in almost every major  foreign  policy decision we have made since  then,  causing us to be more timid than bold when  formulating our position.  say  this even  though I feel that our President, along with  some members of Congress, has tried hard  to get this country to understand that the  only thing the Soviets fear is a force greater  than theirs. Senator, we are the only nation  with enough resolve to be that force. The  President, and Congress, have done much to  make our Armed Forces just that, an armed  force. However, a  strong military  is only  part of the anwser to a world at ""peace"".  There must be a citizenry that is supportive  of the role of our military in keeping that  peace throughout the world.  I believe this  to be  true even  if  the peace  speak of  means some action must be taken to keep it.  We  in America have  long suffered  from  what I call the ""Ostrich Syndrome"" when  dealing with affairs outside our boundaries.  As we both know there are many instances  of  this approach in our history. Unfortu nately, for those that may think this way,  the world has become far too small to afford  us the luxury of not becoming involved in  it's affairs. Especially  if  they  involve  the  slaughtering of innocent civilians from the  unborn to the aged.  I am most disturbed over the total lack of  concern on the part of most Americans with  regards to the atrocities being committed on  the Afghan people. One has to wonder as to  where the protesters of the sixties and sev enties have disappeared to. Certainly they  all aren't marketing their latest home video  on aerobics! As you know, a group of people  have protested recently in Senator Leahy's  I  I  Vermont office over the Contra Freedom  Fighters  in Central America. This action  made me sick. While I certainly cannot con done any atrocity, by either friend or foe, I  certainly do wonder why these same people  have not said word one about what is taking  place every day  in Afghanistan. Where is  the public outcry when it is the Soviets who  are engaged in a war that can only be la beled ""Holocaust II""? Why do we not take  action today? Are we still trying to forget  what happened in South East Asia, to the  extent that we turn our backs on the inno cent Afghan people? Perhaps we  should  consider adopting the Ostrich as our new  national symbol! Think about it, have you  ever seen a bumper sticker protesting the  Soviet's war effort in Afghanistan? It's in teresting to note, however, the number that  exists protesting our involvement in Central  America. I also cannot accept the position  that tries to draw a parallel between our ac tions in South East Asia and what is hap pening in Afghanistan. There is little com fort to me in knowing that the Soviets are  faced with a very difficult military situation  that is also a diplomatic embarrassment to  them. You and I both know that without  support that it  is only a matter of  time  before  the  resistance  there cannot  resist  any  longer.  believe we have  turned our  backs long enough on those freedom fight ers who are valiantly giving up everything  to save their families, their homeland and  what is left of their future.  If we take a look at another part of the  globe today receiving a great deal of atten tion one must wonder as to why there is so  much concern over some while there is so  little concern for others. The area of which  I speak is, of course, South Africa. I assure  you that I bring this issue up out of interest  for human rights and not for any racially  motivated reason. The situation  in South  Africa is, to me, another travesty of justice  simply on a smaller scale. I am pleased to  see that the world attention that the gov ernment  there has  received  seems  to be  having a positive effect. However, consider ing man's inhumanity  to man  in South  Africa, it is still a paradise compared to the  hellish reign of terror that is now known  even  to  the children  in Afghanistan. The  fact  still  remains  that nearly all of  the  media coverage  is devoted  to  the events  there with hardly a whimper over the other.  I realize that there isn't much available for  us  in  terms of ""good  footage""  from  the  Afghan front, but that cannot be used as  our  excuse. Please understand  that  this  letter is not intended to be an indictment of  the  news media  in  general. They must  report on those things that will make for in teresting reporting, This is a  reflection of  what we  indicate to them we want to see,  hear and read. At this time the American  people simply don't want  to be bothered  with news of what seems to be a problem be longing  to someone else. The  image  that  comes to mind is one of the three famous  monkeys. ""See, Hear, and Speak No Evil"".  I'm afraid that this phrase must be amended  to now read; ""See, Hear, and Speak About No  Soviet Evil""!  Senator, I don't believe that I am alone in  my sentiments about  this  topic.  believe  that there are many in our country who feel  the same way. My hope, and prayer, is that  we wake up today to what is happening in  Afghanistan before we wake up to the same  thing in America?  Sincerely yours,  I  DANA J. TUSCHER.  MILTON, VT .   ",1987
162,House,100,-0.336,248,8,Mr. BONKER.," The gentleman had a  worthwhile proposal and the commit tee was only too pleased to incorporate  it in the export promotion section of  the bill.  The gentleman makes reference  to  the Foreign Commercial Service, and  this is one Federal agency that is in a  position to help promote U.S. exports,  to help facilitate export opportunities  for U.S. businesses, and yet as impor tant as that program is,  it pales by  comparison  to what  other  govern ments are doing to aid their exporters.  In one recent study we found that  Japan,  for  instance, has over 7,000  Government employees  in  their em bassies throughout the country, their  foreign commercial service throughout  the world helping their exporters. At  last count, the United States had 733  U.S. nationals assigned to the foreign  embassies,  helping  U.S.  exporters.  Indeed, when one looks at how many  are stationed here versus Japan and  other countries, we also pale by com parison. Japan has some 5,000 of their  foreign  commercial  service  people  inside Japan helping their exporters  get a competitive edge. In the United  States we have fewer than 500.  When one goes through the list it is  not only Japan, but it is West Germa ny, England, Italy, France, Canada, all  the other major industrialized coun tries have devoted far more of their re sources  to  helping  their  exporters  than has the U.S. Government.  The Foreign Commercial Service has  only been around for a few years, but  in the past our philosophy has been  the Government really should not be  involved  in  the private  sector. We  should not be putting taxpayer dollars  at the disposal of U.S. businesses to  help  them compete abroad. But the  real question is if other countries per sist in doing this, if they have govern ment programs that substantially help  their exporters and we do not, then  eventually we are going to lose these  markets, and the trade deficit is going  to go up, and it will be more difficult  to restore our competitive position.  So we do this reluctantly because it  is necessary if we are going to main tain any kind of competitive position  in this very difficult global economy.  ",1987
163,House,100,-0.267,261,8,Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.," But  the gentleman will admit that what ever  the  real  figures are,  the  trade  deficits  have  grown  geometrically.  Trade deficits represent a very serious  problem, and we can provide  incen tives to death in the next 50 years, but  the fact is that until our trading part ners believe we are finally serious, the  situation will not change.

164,House,100,0.3,261,8,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker,  I applaud Con gressman DELAY  for his exceptional  leader ship on the issue of American trade, which  is  one of  the most  important concerns facing  this Congress.  The United States is at an economic cross roads. By the choices we make, America can  either  continue  and  expand  the  domestic  growth and advancement begun under President Reagan or return to the spirit of malaise  and conditions of economic decline that exist ed under President Carter.  By many measures, the United States now  is doing very well. The country  is  in  its fifth  year of economic expansion, one of the long est periods of continuous economic growth in  the  last 40 years. Since 1982,  the average  annual inflation rate has been almost one-third  of what it was in the preceding 9 years and is  lower than in most European countries; manu facturing productivity has been high; and per  capita  income has outpaced  the consumer  price  index  raising  the purchasing power of  the average American.  In  this country, 12 million new  jobs have  been created since late 1982. By comparison,  the 12 countries of  the European Economic  Community created a net total of only 500,000  jobs. Even Japan which  is acclaimed for  its  rapid growth created only 1.6 million  jobs in  this period. America has  truly become  the  ""great employment machine."" But we can do  better.  Although  the United States  is one of  the  world's largest exporters, the value of our ex ports has remained  relatively constant since  1980. It has not kept pace with the 35-percent  increase  in our gross national product since  that date. As  a  result,  in  terms  of value  shipped, exports as a share of GNP have de creased from 12.8 percent in 1980 to 8.9 per cent in 1986. In contrast, the value of our im ports has remained at about 11.5 percent of  GNP, thus causing our large trade imbalance.  America must commit itself to having strong  and active foreign trade. U.S.  industries have  relied  too exclusively on our  large domestic  market, and have not concentrated enough on  foreign trade. Only 12 percent of the estimat ed 225,000 U.S. manufacturers export. Today,  250 firms account for 85 percent of all U.S.  exports. Yet, a study by the General Account ing Office estimates that there are an addi tional 11 ,000 firms capable of exporting goods  and services. With one-fifth of  the  industrial  production of the U.S. exported and 70 per cent of the goods we produce facing foreign  competition, Americans must  recognize  that  the future well-being of the Nation is linked to  our performance  in  the  international market place.  Expanding America's share of world mar kets, which I will call competitiveness, requires  three major  conditions  operating  together.  First, American goods and services must be  price attractive  in world markets. A 3-, 4or  even 5-percent  increase  in  productivity will  have  little effect on  the price of American  goods in another country, if there are 40 to 50  percent swings in exchange rates. Widely fluc tuating exchange rates cause uncertainty for  those  making  investments  for  producing  goods and services for export, disrupt trade,  cause unemployment, and often lead to calls  for protectionism.  Since  the United States has  the world's  strongest and safest economy,  the dollar  is  used as money by other countries. Foreign  demand for the dollar creates an upward pres sure on the exchange rate and causes a pre mium on American  farm  and manufacturing  exports.

171,,100,-0.348,287,8,Mr. HOCHBRUECKNER.," Mr. Speaker, today  I would like to call to the attention of my col leagues here in the House of Representatives  the life of an artist whose work many people  have seen but whose name is hardly known.  Alonzo Chappel was born  in 1828 in New  York City. By the age of 12 he was earning   $1 0 painting portraits. At 17 he studied at  the National Academy of Design and his work  was exhibited at the American Institute.  Alonzo Chappel's  passion was  painting  scenes from the history of our Nation, espe cially scenes of the American Revolution and  the Civil War. Thomas Bayles, who studied  and wrote about  the history of Long  Island  wrote  that  ""Mr. Chappel seemed  to under stand a subject completely and  to be pos sessed of the ability to portray the subjects of  his imagination with striking effect. No written  labels were necessary to explain the charac ter of individual figures."" His work is so effec tive in evoking the spirit and character of the  subjects he portrayed  that his paintings of  Washington's  inauguration and  the Battle of  Long Island are still used in history text books  today.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In 1869, Alonzo Chappel moved to the vil lage of Middle Island and bought a farm near  Corwin's Pond. Here he lived and worked on  paintings until  his death  on December 4,  1887. As a result of his residence, Corwin's  Pond has since become known as Artist Lake.  This year marks  the 1 OOth anniversary of  the death of Alonzo Chappel. The  life and  work of Alonzo Chappel was brought to my at tention by Robert Hoffman,  the historian of  the Artist Lake Condominiums Golden Age  Club. Robert Hoffman shares the artists' dedi cation  to bringing our Nation's history to  life  for the people of today. He has donated much  of his time speaking at elementary schools in  my district teaching students about the history  of central Brookhaven. Robert Hoffman is the  leader of efforts to commemorate the location  of Alonzo Chappel's house and the 1 OOth an niversary of his death. I appreciate his efforts  to recognize  the accomplishments of Alonzo  Chappel and am proud  to participate  in  this  endeavor.  DONALD STOLTZ, ALWAYS A  LEADER-ALWAYS A DOER  HON. GUY VANDER JAGT  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 27, 1987  Mr. VANDER JAGT. Mr. Speaker, I want to  pay this special tribute to a very good friend  and a very special  individual as well, Donald  Stoltz of Holland, MI. In the many years that I  have known him, Don has exhibited  the ex traordinary energy, dedication and community  spirit that have made him a leader in the Hol land, as well as  the western Michigan area.  He has always been guided by the values of  friendship,  family, church and community. He  has given a great deal to all who have been  privileged to know him and to work with him. I  take great pride  in sharing his accomplish ments with my colleagues today.  A  resident of Holland  throughout his  life,  with the exception of his military service in the  U.S. Army as an officer personnel section  chief (S-1), Don graduated from Holland High  School and Hope College. His major field of  study was economics, with an additional con centration  in  educational  administration  at  Michigan State University.  Don Stoltz personifies commitment to hard  work,  intense preparation,  leading  to excel lence. The citizens of Holland owe a great  debt to Don for his dedication and concern for  their well-being. He has helped  to promote  Holland  in  the best  tradition of community  spirit. His effectiveness, influence and abilities  rank him among  the best leaders in Holland  and Ottawa County and his quiet effective ness behind the scenes has contributed to in numerable achievements.  While operating his own piano and organ  business for over 30 years, Don still finds time  to be a  leader  in every major program and  project  in Holland and Ottawa County. A  member of the county board of commission ers-four times, past president of the Holland  Area Chamber of Commerce, past president  10037  of the Holland Rotary ~lub, past chairman of  the Tulip Time 50th Anniversary Committee  and member of the Maple Avenue Foundation  are but a few of Don Stoltz's important roles.  He is also a past president of Tulip Time, Inc.,  a past executive committee member of  the  Ottawa County chapter of the American Red  Cross, an active member of the Maple Avenue  Christian Reformed Church and a member of  the  campaign  committee  for  the Christian  School  International.  Additionally,  he  has  served the Republican Party in Ottawa County  with great distinction  in every capacity and  has assisted in various fundraising drives for  Hope College over the years.  In further detailing his remarkable work with  the Republican Party, Don has been a block worker,  precinct  chairman, ward  chairman,  delegate  to State and  county conventions,  served on many convention committees, a di rector of political education, a member of the  executive committee and a county  finance  chairman. He also serves as vice chairman of  the Ottawa County Finance Committee.  On a personal note, Don has been excep tionally close and good to me in our efforts to  serve  the Ninth Congressional District  of  Michigan.  I shall always be grateful  for his  support and trust. Back in the earlier days of  my  congressional  tenure, Members of  the  House of Representatives were restricted  to  one trip back to the district per month at Gov ernment expense. Don  knew  I wanted  to  come back more often and so he founded the  Flying Vander Jagt Club whereby  individuals  could contribute to a fund to pay for any nec essary additional trips.  Further, in order to promote the best possi ble working  relationship between  the people  of Ottawa County and  their  representative,  Don  founded an annual ""Breakfast for Guy""  which has continued for nearly 20 years. He  was also instrumental in securing the Holland  Christian High School's participation  in  the  1969 Presidential  Inaugural Parade  and  in  convincing the Ninth District Republican lead ership to support me for election to the House  leadership as chairman of  the National Re publican Congressional Committee.  I appreci ate this opportunity to publicly thank him  for  his loyal support for all these years and to let  him know how much his loyalty and friendship  has meant to my wife, Carol, daughter Ginny  and me.  Donald Stoltz has worked  tirelessly to  im prove his community,  to help his neighbors,  and  to support the values he holds so dear.  His invaluable contributions of time and talent  in promoting the growth of his community is a  fine example to us all. He has a strong per sonal  influence for good-a unique individual  who combines a strong determination with a  genuine sense of caring for people. ""A good  friend, a generous and unselfish leader and a  truly outstanding American"" all describe Don  Stoltz.  I know my colleagues will  join me  in  wishing him continued success and fulfillment  in all his endeavors.  What  this country needs are a  few more  Don Stoltz's in each and every community. He  is that kind of guy-just super.  ",1987
172,Senate,100,0.322,313,8,Mr. SIMPSON., I announce that the  Senator  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr.  HEINZ] is necessarily absent.  ,1987
173,Senate,100,0.275,417,8,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President,  numbers don't lie-but they sure can  mislead you if you don't look at them  long and hard enough. Never has that  been  truer than  in  the case of  the  higher tax rate on capital gains  im posed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Although income tax rates are lowered  substantially under the new law,  tax  rates on long-term capital gains rise  enormously. Despite  that  increase,  economists  tell us  that neither  the  Federal Treasury nor those seeking or  investing capital will benefit.  The new tax law repealed the 60-per cent capital gains exclusion of prior  law. Under the new law, every dime of  a capital gain will be taxable. There  will be no exclusion. As a result, the  new law raises the top marginal tax  rate on long-term capital gains from  20 percent to as high as 33 percent.  But, unfortunately, that is only half  the story. When you combine the new  law with the State income taxes, the  results are so much higher they are  breathtaking.  For  instance,  in my own State of  Minnesota, a $1,000 gain from the sale  of  a  business or  investment would  have cost $215  in Federal and State  taxes in 1986. Under the new law, the  tax bite on that same gain could jump  to $396. Nationally, the top State/Fed eral combined rate goes from $235 per  $1,000 of gain-Arkansas and North  Carolina-under the old  law  to $422  per $1,000 of gain-New York-under  the new law. In fact, there will be four  States-and the District of Columbia where  the  top combined  rate could  now exceed 40 percent. In no State  will  the maximum  combined  rate  under the new law be less than $330  per $1,000 of gain.  Such a massive increase is unwise in  many ways. It will reduce investment  and venture capital. It hits especially  hard at middle-income earners, whose  largest capital gain is often the result  of the sale of a single, large asset, like  a farm or business. Much of that gain  may be inflationary gain as opposed to  real economic gain, and repealing the  exclusion leaves them with no cushion  against inflation.  Also, while our new Tax Code gener ally is very competitive internationally  for the individual, not so in the case of  long-term capital gains. According to a  recent study by the Arthur Andersen  accounting  firm,  11  industrialized  countries,  including  Japan, Taiwan,  West Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, and  South Korea, impose no taxes on long term capital gains, and most others  have rates lower than ours.  There is a better way to deal with  capital gains, a way  that recognizes  the difference between assets that are  held only a short time and a long-term  asset. Earlier  this year I  introduced  legislation to provide a two-tiered cap ital gains exclusion for individuals. In  the case of assets held at least 1 year  but less than 3 years, 40 percent of the  gain would be excluded from  taxes.  For assets held 3 years or more, the  exclusion would be returned to 60 per cent. Under this proposal, the sale of a  91-059 0-89-14 (Pt. 8)  $1,000 asset in Minnesota would result  in $238 of State and Federal tax if it  was held between 1 and 3 years and  only $158 of tax if it was held 3 years  or  longer. Still high  internationally,  but certainly more attractive to inves tors-particularly  longer  term  inves tors.  While this proposal lowers the tax  hit on long-term gains,  the available  evidence  suggests  that  it will  not  result in any  loss of revenue  to  the  Federal Government. History  shows  that lowering capital gains tax rates  generally  increases  revenues  to  the  Federal Government-because  there  are more  transactions-while  raising  rates  normally  decreases  revenues.  People won't sell if they get killed by  taxes. Recent work on the issue by Dr.  Martin Feldstein and by Prof. Law rence Lindsey of Harvard University  also suggests that a proposal like mine  would not result in a loss of revenue,  and that the optimal rate to maximize  capital gains collections is 16 percent.  Mr. President, I will be speaking out  on the importance of a capital gains  rate differential again.  I understand  that neither  the President nor  the  Congress is anxious to reopen the Tax  Reform Act. Neither am I. But this  issue is so important to our economy  and our international competitiveness,  so  important  to all Americans who  hold property, that we must make an  exception. It took my friend, the late  Congressman Bill Steiger, years to get  the  rate down. The mood  is better  now. The proof is clearer. Let us hope  we can get it done quickly. In this case  the numbers speak for themselves.e  BUDGET SCOREKEEPING  REPORT  ",1987
174,House,100,-0.358,430,8,Mr. BRYANT.," Mr. Speaker, as we  begin to debate H.R. 3,  the omnibus  trade bill, I urge Members to keep in  mind that what we are debating is our  national security, every bit as much as  when we debate  the defense appro priations bill.  Our independence and our ability to  determine  our  future  course  as  a  leader among nations is very much at  stake, and until we have a policy that  demands  fairness and  reciprocity  in  trade, one that demands that foreign  nations either let our American prod ucts  into  their markets or get their  products out of our market, we are in viting other nations to continue taking  advantage of us.  We need  strong  sanctions against  trading partners who refuse to play by  the rules. I strongly urge the adoption  of the Gephardt amendment because  it demands results and gives us  the  means to enforce them.  Our choice is clear; to step aside as  we lose control over our economic des tiny, or to take the steps necessary to  put us back in charge.  OUR STANDARD OF LIVING IS  ALSO AT STAKE  <Mr. WATKINS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1987
175,House,100,-0.126,430,8,Mr. WATKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of the trade bill and specifi cally  in  support  of  the Gephardt  amendment.  A  lot of people are criticizing  the  Gephardt amendment, but let me say  this. In my opinion, it does not go far  enough.  Today we find that in that particu lar amendment, it allows the President  to waiver it, if it is in law, and there  has to be a strong pattern of unfair  trade practices by any country before  it is actually implemented.  Let us look at what is stake. What is  at stake today is our national security  and the standard of living for our chil dren and our grandchildren.  Today we are importing as much oil  as we did back in 1973 before the oil  embargo  took place. This past year,  for several months, we imported more  agricultural products than we export ed, even  though we are  the garden  spot of the world.  We are  importing more computer  chips and robots. Even though we in vented robots, 60 percent of them that  are being utilized today in our country  are made by the Japanese.  Eighty  percent  of  the  computer  chips are furnished by the Japanese.  The Japanese have seven of the larg est banks in the world. Nine out of ten  of the American people say that they  feel we  are  losing our  competitive  edge, and they have a reason to feel  that we  are  losing our competitive  edge because  the  trade performing  index in just 6 years has dropped 48  percent.  We are exporting a third less today  than we were just 4 years ago. So the  people are justified in their concern.  As I have said before, the people are  way out in front of the Congress. They  want something done about the trade  imbalances and unfair trade barriers  that are put up against the products  of  the United States' hard-working  men and women and our farmers of  this country.

178,House,100,-0.184,469,8,Mr. BILBRAY.," Mr. Chairman, I would like to  take  this opportunity to commend  the chair man of the  full committee, Mr. FASCELL,  for  his support and efforts to facilitate legislative  action on title Ill of H.R. 3.  I especially would like to recognize the work  of the chairman of the Subcommittee on Inter national Economic Policy  and  Trade, Mr.  BONKER, and the ranking member, Mr. ROTH,  for their hard work and diligence in putting to gether a trade bill. As a freshman Member,  and a new member of  the subcommittee,  I  want  to personally recognize  their help and  leadership.  Mr. Chairman, we are considering  today a  measure which can  restore America's com petitive edge in  international trade and begin  to reduce our trade deficit. Since 1981 , when  our trade deficit was $40 billion, we have seen  it grow to a record $148.5 billion and about  $170 billion in 1986. At 4 percent of GNP, the  trade deficit is unprecedented in both size and  the speed with which it grew.  Additionally, it is becoming increasingly evi dent that the U.S. high-technology industry will  post its first ever trade deficit in 1986. Only 6  years ago, this industry had a $27 billion sur plus.  These figures point out that we need to re examine our export control laws and consider  making significant changes that will help our  high-technology industry compete overseas.  A major source of information that was pre sented before the subcommittee regarding our  current export license system was the report  prepared by  the National Academy of Sci ences.  I won't take the time to review the findings  and  recommendations of  the  report, but  I  would  like  to emphasize one aspect of  the  report. And  that is that export controls have  cost the American economy $9.3 billion and  188,000 jobs a year and worsened relations  with allied nations, without significantly improv ing national security.  Mr. Chairman, I believe that the subcommit tee has taken the  findings of the report and  has  incorporated  them  into a bill  that will  insure that our high-technology industry gets  back into the world's competitive market.  Title Ill of the bill contains initiatives to open  new markets for U.S. exports, to protect U.S.  business  interests abroad, and  to streamline  our export control system  in a way that will  enhance national security while strengthening  America's high-technology industrial base.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to address sever al provisions in the bill that I feel are impor tant.  Recognizing the need for export promotion,  the  legislation gives  the U.S. Foreign Com mercial Service statutory authority. The Serv ice  is currently engaged  in developing new  markets overseas and has been particularly  helpful to small-and medium-sized business es. The measure authorizes more overseas  positions for the Foreign Agricultural Service  and provides additional resources for the de velopment of overseas agricultural markets.  In  the export control area,  the package  carefully balances  the protection of our na tional security and promotion of U.S. exports  necessary  to strengthen our high-technology  industrial base. The bill streamlines the export  licensing system to focus on high-technology  goods that are critical  to U.S. security inter ests, and to reduce licensing requirements on  exports of  low-technology goods to Western  countries.  Low-level goods that are no longer militarily  important are  removed  from  the control  list  and ineffective unilaterial controls are limited.  We also establish an Export Administration  Reform Commission  to examine  the current  export control system and  report on  recom mendations and reforms for a more effective  and efficient system.  This proposal, which I authored in subcom mittee, will  review  the effectiveness of our  export licensing system and make recommen dations to Congress to strengthen the control  system to be more effective in protecting U.S.  and Western military technology.  Mr. Chairman,  I  insert  in  the RECORD a  letter sent  to Chairman BONKER  from Mr.  Lionel Olmer,  former Under Secretary  for  International Trade, in support of the Commis sion.  Mr. Chairman, the main goal of this legisla tion  is  to  restore America's competitiveness  around the world. I urge support of it.  Mr. Chairman,  I include the following  and excerpts of sections 339 and 340:  PAUL, WEISS, RIFKIND,  WHARTON & GARRISON,  letter  Washington, DC, March 30, 1987.  Hon. DON BONKER,  Chairman, Subcommittee on International  Economic Policy and Trade, Committee  on Foreign Affairs, House of Representa tives, Washington, DC.  DEAR DoN: Many thanks for the opportu nity to share with your Subcommittee my  thoughts on current efforts to reform the  U.S.  export control  system. Despite  the  ""winds of change"" being felt in recent weeks  and the committed efforts of Secretary Bal drige and Paul Freedenberg, it remains my  sincere belief that fundamental reform  is  necessary. The establishment of a  ""blue ribbon""  commission  to  shape  enduring  reform is essential.  During  the question and answer period  following my testimony, the issue was raised  as  to the utility of ""commissions."" I  fear  that my response was not satisfactory. On  reflection, I believe a strong case can and  should be made for the usefulness of com missions. Admittedly, commissions are not  always an effective solution for every prob lem and sometimes have been used to post pone actions or sidestep  tough decisions.  But  in  fact  they have proved extremely  useful in many instances of recent vintage.  Four examples come to mind:  The President's Social Security Reform  Commission <the ""Greenspan Commission"">  took the politically intractable Social Secu rity dilemma and  reached a  compromise  suitable to Congress. The Commission rec ommended benefit changes and payroll tax  increases which restored financial stability  to the Social Security trust funds;  The President's Commission on Strategic  Forces  (the  ""Scowcroft  Commission"")  bridged divisions between the Administra tion and Congress over the MX missile and  paved the way for full-scale development of  the small ICBM;  The President's Blue-Ribbon Commission  on Defense Management  <the  ""Packard  Commission"") made a number of recommen dations for broad organizational changes in  the Department of Defense, many of which  were adopted by Congress and are being im plemented; and  The President's Commission on Industrial  Competitiveness <the ""Young Commission"")  served to generate interest and focus debate  on many  trade-related  issues  currently  under  consideration  in  the House  and  Senate; even though there has been criti cism expressed as to the lack of adequate at tention to this report, there is no doubt it  stands as one of the premier statements on  ''competitiveness.''  I believe similar success is possible for the  proposed export control commission. It is  now more than ten years since the ""Bucy  Commission"" examined the premises-tech nical, strategic and practical-on which the  export control system is based. This decade  has witnessed astonishing change  in  the  character, content, and complexity of tech nology. It is time to reexamine these prem ises again. I note that the proposal for the  export control commission's establishment  has been reported out of the Foreign Affairs  Committee. I look forward to helping in any  way I can to see that this provision is en acted.  Sincerely,  LIONEL H. OLMER.  SECTION 339-EXPORT ADMINISTRATION  REFORM COMMISSION  This  section  directs  the President  to  create, not later than 60 days after enact ment of this bill, an Export Administration  Reform Commission,  to examine  the cur rent export control system and report on  recommendations and reforms for a more  effective, efficient system. Membership on  the Commission is to be comprised of 24 in dividuals knowledgeable in relevant scientif ic, business, or legal matters, 12 of whom  are appointed by the President and 12 by  the Congress.  One of the most difficult yet fundamental  export control issues concerns the definition  of what is militarily significant. The current  export control system is based on control ling items which could enhance the military  capability of adversaries, yet nowhere  in  statute or regulation is there a definition of  ",1987
179,House,100,-0.133,495,8,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Chairman, the  Agriculture Committee provisions con tain the enhancement or the augmentation of something called the export  enhancement program, which is really  the primary message under which the  United States will meet unfair trading  practices by others, as has been the  case in North Africa and the Middle  East in meeting the European Com munity subsidies.  Under  this provision we would  in crease  the export enhancement pro gram's authorization level to $2.5 bil lion, we would extend the program for  2 years, and we would change the ac counting method to use market value,  which has  the  effect of  increasing  commodities used in the program by  30 percent.  What the EEP or export enhance ment program is, Mr. Chairman, is a  tool by which our foreign competitors  who play the game in an unfair and a  very subsidized manner with respect to  exports overseas will know by our de termination to use the EEP Program  that we will meet fire with fire, and  that we will not permit them to take  advantage of us by offering unfair sub sidies around the world.  Our goal in the Agriculture Commit tee hopefully is that we will not have  to use these EEP subsidies to fight fire  with fire, and that we can get agree ments with the Argentines, the Cana dians, and the Europeans, particularly  the Europeans,  to  stop using  these  kinds of subsidies and  to  reach an  international agreement in connection  with the production of grains in this  world, although the EEP does apply to  other commodities as well, not  just  grains. But if those countries choose  not  to  join with us  in an effort  to  reduce unfair pricing practices in the  world and unfair subsidies, then they  need to know that the United States  of America is going to devote its full  effort and complete agricultural policy  to fighting fire with fire, and in that  case we will use these increased EEP  authorities which this bill provides.

181,House,100,0.014,495,8,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  want to talk to the Members  today  about the dairy amendment which is  in the bill and about which we have  heard considerable controversy. It is  section 662 of H.R. 3, which will be  before us to vote on tomorrow.  First of all, I would like to remind  the Members that this is not the first  time we  have  talked  about  these  issues. I would like to take the Mem bers back to 1983, when the gentleman  from Virginia,  the gentleman  from  Massachusetts, and I had long debates  on similar issues. Again in 1985 we had  similar debates.  Many figures are flying around, and  that always happens when we get into  these dairy  issues. We have  figures  going this way and that way, and the  question is, what figures do I use in  making my judgment on how to vote  on this?  I would ask the Members to take a  look at history, to go back and take a  look  at what we  told  you would  happen in 1983, what our opposition  told you would happen in 1983, and  see what did happen. Everything we  told you would happen did happen.  We brought the surpluses down, we  saved  the  taxpayers money, and we  began that long tortuous course, with  dairy farmers contributing, to bringing  stability to the milk market.  In 1985, we again debated this issue.  They made their statements, we made  ours, and I ask the Members again to  look at what happened,  to establish  credibility as  to what may and will  happen  this  time. We  told  you  it  would again  reduce  the cost of  the  program by over $1  billion,  that  it  would bring things into balance, and it  would allow us hopefully sometime to  have  stability. That  again has  oc curred,  except  that we  have  some  problems, one created by casein, and  the second created by the fact that  east of the Rockies we do now have an  imbalanced situation which could be  very, very detrimentally affected by  any further price cuts.  So what does section 662 provide?  Now is the time to stop subsidizing  European Economic Community dairy  farmers and killing U.S. dairy farmers.  The Agriculture Committee amend ment, section 662 of H.R. 3, is a very  reasonable incentive for the adminis tration  to use  its authority  to stop  American subsidization of European  farmers. The American consumer is fi nancing these subsidies by hundreds  of millions  of dollars.  In  addition,  during surplus periods, taxpayers have  paid billions of  dollars  because  of  casein  imports.  Furthermore,  these  subsidized  imports are driving 5,000  U.S. dairy farmers out of business.  By the end of this year, the effective  dairy support price will have been cut  by $2 per hundredweight since Decem ber 1983. Current law calls for a fur ther cut of 50 cents on January 1,  1988, if the dairy surplus is above 5 bil lion pounds. Latest  estimates  from  USDA  indicate  a  surplus  figure  of  about  5.7  billion  pounds  for  1988,  down from an average of 12.9 billion  pounds over the past 3 years, but not  sufficient to avoid further price cuts.  However, about 28 percent of the es timated Government purchases of sur plus dairy products can be directly at tributed to increases in casein imports.  In  addition,  according  to USDA's  own  studies,  imports  of  subsidized  casein from Europe and New Zealand  are not only displacing domestic dairy  production,  but,  are  increasing  the  cost of the Dairy Program by $300 to  $800 million annually.

184,House,100,-0.341,521,8,Mr. PRICE of North Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, I am pleased today to rise in  support of title XIII of H.R. 3,  the  Small Business Trade and Competi tiveness Act, and I applaud the efforts  of Chairman JoHN LAFALCE in working  with other members of the Small Busi ness Committee to add this important  and needed provision to the Omnibus  Trade bill.  Small business has created nearly  two thirds of our country's new jobs in  the last decade, and many of the ad vances in our Nation's technology can  be attributed to the efforts of small  businesses.  Small  businesses  are  a  growing, vibrant part of our economy  and we need to channel this energy  into  the expansion of our overseas  markets  and  the  reduction  of our  trade deficits.  The small business provisions in the  trade bill expand our ability to com pete in the international economy in a  number of ways. First, it enlarges the  mandate of the Office of International  Trade, within the Small Business Ad ministration, to include the promotion  of sales opportunities for small busi ness goods and services abroad. It also  requires the Office  to aid export fi nancing  for  small businesses by ag gressively marketing existing SBA and  Export-Import Bank export financing  programs,  and  to  provide help  for  small businesses with the processing of  loan applications.  Second, it gives the Small Business  Development Centers [SBDC'sJ explic it instructions to develop export pro motion and  technology  transfer  for  small businesses. Specifically, SBDCs  should provide management and tech nical assistance to small businesses in  these areas and serve as an active in formation and dissemination service  delivery mechanism for existing trade  promotion, trade finance, trade adjust ment and  trade data collection pro grams. In addition, any Small Business  Development Center can apply for an  additional grant to be used solely for  the development and enhancement of  exports by small business concerns.  I am especially pleased with this pro vision of the bill because it recognizes  the partnership which needs  to be  strengthened between our universities  and small businesses. The Small Busi ness Development Center in my dis trict already works  effectively with  both universities and small businesses  and this bill will help to enhance and  promote these ties.  Finally, these provisions aid the cap ital formation of small businesses in volved with exporting by authorizing a  new guaranteed loan program for the  purchase of plant and equipment used  in the production of goods and services  sold overseas. We all  recognize  the  problems small businesses face in ob taining capital and this is a good start  toward addressing these needs.  Mr. Speaker,  the House can pass  H.R. 3 with confidence that it realisti cally addresses the needs of small busi ness. As the Small Business Legislative  Council recently wrote about this leg islation:  ""The  bill  contains  several  positive  initiatives  to enhance small  business  position  in  the  export  market. If the House of Representa tives includes the Small Business Com mittee's recommendation as part of  the trade bill, it will set a tone for the  future of small business and interna tional trade policy.""

204,,100,0.312,534,8,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, my distinguished  colleague  from New Jersey, JIM COURTER,  has written a thoughtful piece for the Wash ington Post which compares the 1961 Bay of  Pigs  invasion with  the current Iran  imbroglio.  Mr. CouRTER contrasts the manner in which  Presidents Kennedy and Reagan  reacted  to  these political crisis. Since his comments offer  a historical perspective on our present situa tion, I submit them for your study.  Mr. CouRTER observes  that  there are nu merous similarities between the Iran and Cuba  incidents-the possibility of  illegal acts;  the  President's contention that he was not fully in formed; operational oversight by a risk-taker;  use of private humanitarian aid to rescue hos tages; and appointment of a Presidential  in vestigatory commission which concluded that  the Presidential style of management and the  lack of a written record were partly to blame  for the policy confusion.  Mr. CouRTER concludes, however,  that by  immediately accepting  full  responsibility and  then quickly  launching major space and de fense  initiatives, Kennedy cut his losses and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  revived a forceful Presidency. Though he has  wasted  precious  time,  perhaps  President  Reagan may yet overcome the Iran preoccu pation by shifting his energy and the Nation's  attention to more important issues and chal lenges.  [From the Washington Post, Apr. 9, 19871  WHAT REAGAN SHOULD HAVE LEARNED FROM  KENNEDY'S BAY OF PIGS  As  <By Jim Courter)  President Reagan's  Iran  initiative was  hardly America's first foreign policy failure.  Although Iranscam is compared with Wa tergate, a more revealing precedent is the  Bay of Pigs fiasco.  President Kennedy escaped the political  hurricane that has engulfed Reagan only  partly because the Kennedy administration  was in its honeymoon period and Congress  was controlled by Kennedy's party. There  are valuable  lessons  in statesmanship  to  learn by comparing these  two policy fail ures.  U.S.  forces  trained and equipped about  1,300 Cuban exiles and, in April 1961, landed  them at the Bay of Pigs. American B-26 air  strikes against Cuban air bases preceded the  landing. The invaders soon ran out of am munition, and all but 100 were captured by  Castro's communist forces.  President Eisenhower began the plan for  ~hat became an  invasion. Originally,  the  tdea was  just for exiles  to  infiltrate  the  mountains and establish a Castro-style guer rilla force for freedom. The proposal soon  evolved  into a  full-scale  invasion. Shortly  before the action began, the landing areas  was moved to the Bay of Pigs. Just as Rea gan's Iran opening was transformed into a  different policy, it became clear to Kenne dy, according  to Ted Sorensen's account,  ""that he had in fact approved a plan bear ing little resemblance to what he thought  he had approved.""  president-elect,  Kennedy  already  doubted the whole scheme. But he was con vinced that he would be thought weak if he  canceled his Republican predecessor's plan.  With no forceful opposition from his secre taries of state and defense, he assumed his  senior advisers were all in favor. <Foreshad owing George  Shultz's protestations  in  Iranscam, Chester Bowles, an undersecre tary of state, infuriated Kennedy by leaking  a post-facto story that Bowles always op posed the project.)  The CIA, not the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  mastermined  the Bay of Pigs operation.  Only a handful of administration personnel  knew the details. Peter Wyden's book ""Bay  of Pigs"" describes CIA Deputy Director  Richard Bissell in terms Oliver North would  recognize  instantly: he ""relished risks-in  his mountain climbing, as skipper of his  boat, as commander in chief of the Richard  Bissell Air Force with  its  fleet of U-2s   thumbing noses at the whole earth. To con trol the never-before-controlled, to systema tize messes, in economics as in spying-his  life was made of  such challenges."" The  plan's principal architect was Bissell rather  than the senior Allen Dulles.  Attorney General Robert Kennedy helped  put together $53 million in private humani tarian aid, which the president later gave  Castro  to  rescue  the  1,200 POWs. The  White House even provided the donors with  special tax benefits. (Thus, William Casey's  1985 proposal to create a  tax-free corpora tion for contra contributors had a Kennedy  root.)  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee  held some closed-door hearings, but no new  April 28, 1987  congressional committees were created  to  look into the defeat. Kennedy himself ap pointed an investigative commission includ ing then-retired general Maxwell Taylor as  chairman, Allen Dulles, Robert Kennedy  and Adm. Arleigh Burke, chief of naval op erations. <A similar Reagan board,  instead  of the Tower Commission, would have in cluded Bill Casey, Ed Meese, Adm. James  Watkins and perhaps Gen. Al Haig.)  The Taylor Commission criticized the ad ministration for its decision-making proce dure and the Kennedy ""style of manage ment."" Normal  processes  had  been  by passed. The CIA, like Reagan's National Se curity Council, had gone beyond its mission.  Plans were changed under pressure from  Cuban ~miges. <In Iranscam, Israelis, Arabs  and financiers were variously blamed.)  The Taylor group found that ""top level di rection was given through ad hoc meetings  of senior officials without consideration of  operational plans in writing and with no ar rangement for recording conclusions and de cisions reached."" During operations, serious  misunderstandings among Kennedy and his  advisers became apparent as to what they  had approved. Lacking written records, a 44year-old president is no less liable to confu sion than a 76-year-old is. With some name  changes,  Kennedy's Taylor  Commission  could have written Reagan's Tower report.  Considering the similarities, why has Rea gan's crisis become so deep and protracted?  It is not because Reagan secretly  traded  arms for hostages while publicly promising  not to. Five days before the invasion, Ken nedy played fast and loose with the truth,  asserting ""there will not be, under any con ditions,  an  intervention  in Cuba by  the  United States Armed Forces.""  Nor does  the difference stem from  the  charge that illegalities were committed in  Iranscam. CIA actions in the Bay of Pigs  episode were questionable, and the Neutrali ty Act,  international  law and/or certain  treaties may have been violated.  One difference  is  that Kennedy, unlike  Reagan, consulted the Senate in advance in  the person of Foreign Relations Chairman  William Fulbright, who  lobbied  strongly  against the invasion.  The decisive difference,  though,  is sim pler. Kennedy quickly announced that he  alone was responsible for the failure. That  he privately also criticized ""the experts"" for  giving bad advice does not detract from his  public self-blame.  Sorensen's comment in 1965 says it all:  ""By taking full blame upon himself, he was  winning the admiration of both career serv ants and the public, avoiding partisan inves tigations and attacks, and discouraging fur ther attempts by  those  involved  to  leak  their versions and accusations.""  A few days after the fiasco, Kennedy ex pressed little interest in such exotic topics  as a moon shot. Yet a month later Kennedy  gave  Congress  an  extraordinary  second  State of the Union address, offering solid  proposals  to  strengthen  our  defenses,  capped with a breathtaking plan to land a  man on the moon before the end of the  decade. By refusing to wallow in the Bay of  Pigs, Kennedy cut his losses and advanced  the nation's agenda.  Reagan, unfortunately,  took a different  course. He insisted that he was in the dark  about the facts. He fired two individuals he  said were responsible. He practically invited  Congress to form the panels that have still  not held televised hearings. It took him four  months to admit he was to blame. By then  the damage was done.  ",1987

210,Senate,100,-0.395,612,8,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, for more  than 20 years, Father Casimir Paul sen, an American priest of the Mar iannhill Mission, has worked  to  im prove the well-being of the people of  southern Africa. Not a politician, not a  leader of masses, Father Cas-as his  friends call him-has been instead a  soft-spoken  preacher,  a  teacher,  a  counseler,  a healer of  the spirit, a  helper to the poor-in short, a diligent  doer of God's work among individuals  and their families. He has been par ticularly concerned with  the young,  those on whom the future of that tor tured region depends.  Over the years, amid growing injus tice, oppression, and violence, Father  Cas has spoken out against what he  saw as growing evil by man against  man. Suddenly, last December, in the  Transkei, where he had been assigned  since 1978, he was arrested and taken  away. And, as he revealed later, he was  tortured, in a fruitless effort to make  him confess to being party to acts of  resistance  which  the  government  there was and is trying to put down.  The  improper,  cruel detention of  Father Paulsen was protested by many  of us, here and across the country. We  talked, we wrote letters, we explored  whatever  channels  we  could,  we  banged and banged again on the Gov ernment of South Africa. And finally,  after 3 months, Father Cas was re leased, as abruptly as he had been  seized, with no explanation, much less  an apology, just an order of explusion.  Since then, in safer places, Father  Cas has been  recuperating, and  re counting his terrible experiences to his  colleagues and superiors in the church  in Africa  and  in  Europe.  Easter  Sunday he was in Rome and partici pated  in a mass celebrated by  the  Pope. And last week, for the first time  in several years, he returned  to his  native shores. He will soon head back  to his home State of Michigan, to be  with family and friends there and to  celebrate his 25th anniversary in the  priesthood.  At a  recent news conference  that  Senator RIEGLE and I hosted for him,  Father Paulsen discussed his harrow ing experiences and shared his obser vations on  the  terrible  events  that  have been occurring in South Africa.

211,Senate,100,0.491,612,8,Mr. HECHT.," Mr. President,  I will  ask that excerpts from an excellent ar ticle by Mr. Lev Navrozov  entitled  ""Zbigniew Brzezinski's Third Reincar nation,"" be printed  in  the RECORD.  This is a very interesting and well re searched article, and I commend it to  my colleagues. While Zbigniew Brze zinski  has  served  former President  Carter well, he  is also  today saying  some good things in support of Presi dent Reagan's strategic defense initia tive and national security policies.  I  am glad that Zbig is now on the side of  a  tough,  anti-Communist  foreign  policy, and Republicans welcome his  support for President Reagan's efforts  to restore America's strength.  Mr. Lev Navrozov emmigrated from  the Soviet Union  in 1972, and since  then Lev has been one of the most in cisive  analysts of American  foreign  policy.  Lev's article was published  in  the  Winter  issue of Global Affairs. This  journal is a strong new voice in inter national affairs. Global Affairs pro vides the Congress with a realistic per spective on international relations. It  is an outstanding new publication now  in its second year, which provides a  forum for responsible and expert views  on  international  security  affairs.  It  pages are filled with hard facts, realis tic analysis, and not rhetoric. It is pub lished by  the International Security  Council,  an  organization  aimed  at  deepening the public understanding of  the dangers confronting free societies  everywhere. Updates on the Interna tional Security Council's activities are  published in each issue of Global Af fairs. These updates are statements,  signed by seasoned experts on interna tional  relations, who  attended  the  council's  international seminars and  conferences. Global Affairs  is ""must  reading"" in a town filled with publica tions.  I ask that the excerpts from the arti cle be printed in the RECORD.  The excerpts follow:  ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI'S THIRD  REINCARNATION  <By Lev Navrozov)  The books  and  articles  that Zbigniew  Brzezinski published before 1962, between  1964 and 1976, and since 1983 seem to have  been written by three strikingly different  individuals who have never even met to ex change their strikingly different views.  Let us take as an example the treatment  of mainland China.  In his Memoirs of the National Security  Adviser, published in 1983, Brzezinski recalls  how he wrote to President Carter that ""we  would  acknowledge  the Chinese position  [that is, the position of the post-1949 rulers  of mainland China] that there is one China  and that Taiwan is part of it.""

215,House,100,-0.45,755,8,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, I would  not have supported this amendment 3  years ago, but I do today.  I do not believe that trade barriers  are the major reasons for the squeeze  on family  income  in this country in  the last 6 years. I  think the biggest  reasons are irresponsible fiscal policy,  ineffective currency management and  an insufficient commitment to quality  on the part of many American manu facturers. Most of our trade problems,  I think, are made in America. But we  cannot deny the fact that many of our  trading partners have been  running  their economies in ways which impede  world  economic  growth  and  block  trade. They are simply not facing up  to their responsibilities to manage the  world economy as well as their own. It  seems to me we have to react to dem onstrate that they have that obliga tion.  We are not dealing here today with  protectionism. This is a question of al ternative  approaches  to  free  trade.  Some people who believe in virtually  unlimited military  spending  as  a  means of bringing the Soviets to the  bargaining table seem  to  think that  unilateral disarmament is the best ap proach to winning concessions in the  field of  trade. If nothing else,  this  amendment puts this body on record  for a new era of toughness in Ameri can trade negotiations. That action is  a necessary step  toward turning the  corner on family  income, wages and  balanced regional growth and expand ing the world's economy.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge support for  the Gephardt amendment.  ",1987
216,House,100,-0.547,755,8,Mr. BONIOR of Michigan.," Mr.  Chairman, I thank my friend, the gen tleman  from Montana,  for  yielding  this time.  Mr. Chairman, over the last 5 years,  the U.S.  trade deficit has  set one  record after another. We have stood  idly by in this Congress and in this  country as factories have closed down  and jobs have been lost.  The bleeding of American industry  must stop. Trade barriers must end.  Behind  the  rhetoric of  the  trade  debate,  the  fact  remains  that  trade  barriers are real and that their effects  on the American economy and Ameri can industry are devastating. In fact,  in the last 6 years over 2 million jobs  have been  lost due  to declining ex ports.  The work ethic in my district and I  am sure in most districts across this  country runs deep. Our workers are  rea,dy  to compete; but high  tariffs,  import quotas, closing of markets, and  bureaucratic  redtape  are  tying  the  hands  of  American  industry  and  American workers.  Vve  can no  longer afford  the ap peasement policies of this administra tion. Last year we were tough on trade  when the deficit was at $148 billion.  Today it is $170 billion. We can afford  to be no less tough.  The Gephardt amendment gives us  the  leverage we need  to open world  markets to American goods. It is the  key  to  letting  the world know  that  America means business.  ",1987

222,House,100,0.23,794,8,Mr. WYLIE.,"  With respect to the Competitive Ex change Rate Act, first of all, Congress  is not attempting to fix a specific set  of exchange rates. No, what we are ba sically doing is this: we are saying that  the policy the Reagan administration  followed from 1981  through Septem ber of 1985  is wrong. What we are  saying is that if there is an overvalued  dollar that has contributed in a major  way to our trade deficit-and we say  the overvalued dollar has contributed  in a major way to our trade deficit then the U.S. Government, working in  concert and coordination with other  governments,  should attempt  to do  something about that.  Jim Baker  in September of  1985  changed the policy of the Reagan ad ministration. In a sense, what we are  doing is endorsing it. In a sense what  the Wylie substitute does, perhaps un wittingly, perhaps unknowingly, is to  go back earlier to the first 4 years of  the Reagan administration's approach  when  they said  that the overvalued  dollar,  the strong dollar,  is  a  good  thing for the American economy. That  is wrong.  ",1987
223,House,100,-0.051,807,8,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the Olin amendment.  With section 662 we are not chang ing farm policy. We are injecting fair ness  into the dairy policy. What we  called for in the farm bill of 1985 was  not an automatic cut in the price sup port in January of 1988, but the possi bility of a cut, if the surplus still ex ceeded 5 billion pounds.  Every region of the country, except  California, brought production levels  down. It is unfair to the producers in  those other regions  to  take an addi tional price support cut when  they  have met the requirements of the law.  Furthermore, we would be under the  5 billion pound trigger if we did not  have significant casein  imports. But  every producer across the country will  take a price support cut due to some thing-casein  imports-which  they  have no control over.  I do not see the gentleman from Vir ginia  [Mr. OLIN]  recommending an  elimination  of  the  discrepancy  be tween price supports from one region  to another; but it would save us a lot  more money if we would do that.  Instead, we in the Midwest who al ready have a lower price support than  Virginia are being asked to take it on  the chin and let the rest of the regions  get off with a much higher price sup port.  The fairness issue is what is involved  here. The Olin amendment would lead  to an additional price cut in those re gions that have met the requirements  of  the 1985  farm bill  to reduce  the  dairy surplus. That isn't fair. The Olin  amendment should be defeated.  ",1987
224,House,100,0.28,807,8,Mr. SCHUETTE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the gentleman from Vermont  [Mr.  JEFFORDS]  for yielding me  this  time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Olin amendment, and  in strong  support for the Jeffords language in cluded in H.R. 3 for four facts.  Fact one, the committee amendment  would merely require the Secretary of  Agriculture  to take into account the  amount of casein imports when calcu lating future dairy price support re ductions.  D 1720  That is one fact. Second fact: The  European Community  subsidizes  its  own casein industry to the detriment  of the American dairy farmer.  Third, the American dairy farmers  are in compliance with the 1985 farm  bill. They play by the rules. But no,  foreign casein  imports, foreign dairy  producers  bend  the  rules  and  the  losers are the American dairy farmers.  Fact No. 4: So the imports of casein  into our country displace our domestic  market to the detriment of the Ameri can dairy farmers; it is our responsibil ity, Congress' responsibility,  to  take  action and to remedy that imbalance.  That is why we should adhere to the  Jeffords language in the bill and vote  ""no"" on the Olin amendment.  ",1987
225,House,100,0.232,807,8,Mr. MARTIN of New York.," I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, I  think part of the tragedy in today's ac tivities in the passage of the Gephardt  amendment  is  going  to mean  an  almost certain veto. We need a piece of  trade  legislation,  that goes without  question. I far prefer the original ver sion.  One of the reasons is that the provi sion that the Agriculture Committee,  Mr.  JEFFORDS, placed  in here.  Infer ences were made that  this does not  belong in a  trade bill. Let us keep in  ",1987
226,House,100,-0.506,820,8,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Chairman,  while the Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology did not report any provisions for  H.R. 3,  the  trade bill, many of the programs  within  the  committee's  jurisdiction  have  a  major bearing on the degree of U.S. competi tiveness  in world markets. The committee  is  holding hearings  this week which  focus on  several  bills affecting U.S. competitiveness  which have been referred to the committee or  drafted by committee members. Potentially,  each of these bills could fit within the frame work of H.R. 3, should the Senate choose to  legislate in  these areas.  In  that event, these  hearings will help develop a House position  for a conference committee. Alternatively the  hearings will determine  if  it makes sense  to  report some of these bills either individually or  collectively as a Science Committee competi tiveness initiative. The specifics of the bills are  described below as part of a day-of-day de scription of what the committee plans to ac complish in these hearings.  APRIL 28-THE !ROLE OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU  OF STANDARDS lNBS] IN COMPETITIVENESS  Senator Holl:ings and Congressman Ritter  have both written bills which would com bine the NBS and the Office of Productivi ty, Technology and Innovation <OPTD into  a single more powerful component of the  Department of Commerce that aggressively  promotes U.S.  industry  use  of  advanced  technologies such as automated manufac turing. Yesterday, witnesses discussed  the  appropriatenes,s of such a role for the NBS  as well as the desirability of permitting the  Federal Government  to branch  into  this  area which ha:> been traditionally reserved  for the private sector. Other aspects of the  Hollings competitiveness bill were consid ered as well. Witnesses also  advocated a  major  increase, perhaps even a  doubling  over a five year period, in the NBS budget  for current programs. This would permit  NBS to provide additional calibration serv ices and standard  reference materials,  to  verify the accuracy of engineering data and  provide the verified data on line, and to es tablish the capability to help create a meas urement base for emerging industries, such  as biotechnology, advanced materials and  fiber  optics. Witnesses  also  called  for  a  quadrupling of  the Director's Competence  Fund which allows NBS to do basic research  that  leads  to  the competence  to develop  more precise  standards. Clearly  there  is  broad interest in strengthening this crucial  but badly neglEcted agency whose standards  work often underpins the competitiveness of  American industry.  The Committee also considered my bill,  H.R. 1965, which amends the 1976 Metric  Act. This bill would require most govern ment programs and procurements to be run  in metric. Of particular concern to the com mittee is whether the continued U.S. use of  the English system of measurement is plac ing American small business at a competi tive disadvanta:5e in a world market which is  almost entirely metric outside  the bound aries of the United States.  APRIL  29-REORGANIZATION OF  THE  FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT  REGARDING  INDUSTRIAL  RE SEARCH AND m;:VELOPMENT  This morning,  the Committee examined  the Federal Government's capability of pro viding research funds  to  industries which  are  competitively  disadvantaged without  picking winners and losers among specific  technologies and companies. My National  Policy  and Technology Foundation  bill,  H.R. 2165 and Department of Science and  Technology bill, H.R. 2164 were considered.  Both bills would create foundations which  could give research grants to develop fur ther promising discoveries which may be im portant to specific industries. Both agencies  would  have  the  information  gathering  policy, and coordination functions generally  associated with the Japanese agency MITI.  The semiconductor industry was then dis cussed as an example of how these agencies  might  function  in practice, and  to probe  whether the appropriate federal role should  be geared  towards basic research or some  point further along the development path.  Mr. Valentine's bill to create a National Ad visory Commission on Semiconductors <H.R.  2191) was also considered. Witnesses includ ed representatives of the semiconductor in dustry and academia who are interested in  the competitiveness of  the semiconductor  industry. The General Counsel of the De partment of Commerce also presented testi mony on Administration proposals concern ing competitiveness,  including  the  recent  Executive Order implementing the Technol ogy Transfer Act of 1986.  APRIL  30-TECHNOLOGY  TRANSFER,  GOVERN MENT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMPETI TIVENESS  Proposed changes in technology transfer  and intellectual property laws are being pro moted to improve competitiveness. Tomor row,  legislation by Congressmen Boehlert  and MacKay promoting the use by Ameri can companies of  the research  results of  government-funded research will be consid ered as a method of getting American indus try interested in the best ideas of our uni versities. A second piece of  legislation  to  promote domestic  technology transfer will  be presented by its Senate sponsor, Senator  Dale Bumpers; the chief House sponsor is  the Honorable Claudine Schneider. The  President's Science Advisor will  testify on  new Administration initiatives that are re lated to the transfer of government inven tions and innovations to the private sector  and the collection and dissemination of for eign scientific and technical literature.  In the government patent field, the Com mittee will consider making patent rights  available to all companies running govern ment owned/contractor operated laborato ries. The Committee will examine whether  there is any reason to treat GOCO's operat ed by big businesses differently from others  since the benefits of licensing these patents  accrue to the laboratories rather than the  parent companies. The General Counsel of  the Department of Energy has been  re quested to testify about how his department  plans to implement the recently promulgat ed  federal  regulations.  Various  private  sector witnesses will then comment on the  day's proposal.  Mr. Chairman, it is clear that the Committee  on Science, Space, and Technology has much  to add to the solution to our competitiveness  problems,  to a  large extent building on our  work in this area of the last decade. We stand  ready to contribute our expertise as appropri ate both  in  the subsequent development of  this  legislation and  in  future  legislative  initia tives during the 1 OOth Congress.  ",1987
227,,100,-0.081,846,8,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  introduce  legislation  to  reform  the Davis Bacon Act. This proposal is the result of many  months of careful study by the Subcommittee  on Labor Standards of comments and com plaints that have been brought to our attention  during my term as chairman.  As many of my  colleagues will  recall,  I  made a commitment during the last Congress  to take up this issue and study the effects of  Federal construction prevailing wage law. I am  an individual who takes my promises very seri ously. Since  last August, when  the Davis Bacon amendment to the armed services bill  offered by Mr. HAWKINS and myself passed  the House overwhelmingly, I have held sever al hearings. We have carefully reviewed  the  record of those hearings as well as proceed ing  in other committees which  relate  to  this  subject.  The amendments to the act that I am intro ducing today will eliminate problems identified  with  the  application  of  the  act  to  small  projects as well as answer criticism about en forcement.  To those who in good faith have urged that  the Davis-Bacon Act be updated, I believe this  April 29, 1987  measure will be welcome news. To  those  whose support  for Davis-Bacon  reform has  been a Trojan horse approach  to abolishing  the act, I am quite certain this measure will be  a disappointment. The  committee  believes  very strongly in the continuing need for statu tory minimum  labor standards protection  for  American workers.  A free market economy is not a free for all.  There are basic rules which govern the rela tionship between employers and their employ ees. Those basic  legal protections are as  timely today as they were when they were en acted. The  idea  that market  forces  alone  should control  fundamental matters such as  minimum or prevailing wages,  occupational  safety and health or for that matter, even with  respect to investors under our securities laws,  is certainly a  failed notion whose  time has  come and gone. Last year's vote on Davis Bacon and this week's vote on  trade regula tion would seem  to  indicate that the majority  of this body and the American people under stand the need for continued government in volvement  to  insure  fair competition  in our  economy.  Last year, the Members spoke very strongly  in favor of raising the threshold for application  of  the Davis-Bacon Act. An  increase  in  the  threshold  to $25,000 for military construction  and military housing passed  the House by a  vote of 406 to 5. My bill will take the threshold  for new construction to $50,000 which is twice  as high as  the measure which passed  the  House on August 15, 1986. I believe that this  proposal which raises the threshold 25 times  its present level will provide a fair and realistic  procurement exemption for small projects.  This bill acknowledges  the differences be tween new construction and repair work. We  have set a  threshold  level of $15,000  for  repair, alteration,  renovation,  reconstruction,  or rehabilitation. This is a sevenfold increase  in  the present  threshold yet still  recognizes  the fact that repair work is more often award ed under small contracts and  is much more  susceptible  to  fragmentation of projects  into  even smaller contracts  to avoid  the  require ments of the act.  Along with our adjustment in  the threshold  we have undertaken a comprehensive revision  of the act. Despite strong judicial or adminis trative precedent  interpreting  various provi sions, we have encountered a number of situ ations where disputes have arisen between  granting  agencies  and  the Department  of  Labor on how the act should be applied or en forced. This Davis-Bacon  reform bill codifies  the authority presently vested in the Secretary  of Labor pursuant to Executive order. Clarifi cation of administrative authority, streamlined  enforcement mechanisms, more  timely wage  determinations  and  other  improvements  should go a long way to improving administra tion of the act. A comprehensive reform of the  act will free all of us from the annual attempts  to attach Davis-Bacon amendments  to de fense, transportation or other vital legislation. I  believe  this measure accomplishes  the dual  objectives of providing greater  flexibility  to  granting agencies as well as continued protec tion for workers.  Included  in  the RECORD  following my  re marks is a section-by-section analysis of this  ",1987
228,,100,0.043,859,8,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, as many Mem bers know, the month of May has been desig nated as ""Older Americans Month."" There are  an estimated 29 million senior citizens 65 or  over, more than one out of every ten Ameri cans, with the numbers growing everyday. Our  older Americans have contributed many years  of service to their families, their communities,  and  the Nation, representing  the bulk of our  wealth of knowledge and experience. During  May, we should acknowledge our older Ameri cans  for  their accomplishments and dedica tion with appropriate programs, ceremonies,  and activities. But we should not stop here.  We should provide  them with quality health  care programs, adequate social security bene fits, and sufficient social services programs.  Protecting the life-savings of our senior citi zens from  the high medical costs associated  with catastrophic illnesses must be a top pri ority of the 1 OOth Congress. During the month  of May we should rededicate ourselves to ef forts to enact comprehensive health coverage  for our senior citizens which will protect the  savings  they  have accumulated  over  their  working lives. The Ways and Means Commit tee's Health Subcommittee recent approval of  a package of significantly expanded Medicare  benefits for victims of catastrophic illnesses is  a positive step toward reaching this goal. But  must also consider subsidizing other major ex penses not covered under Medicare, including  nursing home care and prescription drugs.  Congress must also have certain  that we  provide sufficient social services to the elder ly,  including meals-on-wheels, adult day care,  senior citizens centers,  legal services, pre-re tirement counseling and  transportation. The  Olders Americans Act of 1965 has provided  these services  to our senior citizens to help  enable  them  to adapt  to  the  rising cost of  living. In 1987, a total of $1.38 billion was au thorized, with $976 million going  for social  services and nutrition. Congress will be asked  this session to reauthorize the immensely pop ular Older Americans Act for 4 years at levels  5 percent above  fiscal 1987  levels. Also  in cluded  in  this  legislation  is a provision  that  persons with Alzheimer's disease and  their  families to be among those eligible to receive  the new in home services for the frail elderly.  This would help our senior citizens meet their  financial  burdens while  coping  with  their  trauma at home with  their  loved ones. And  while Congress is working to ensure the avail ability of low-income housing for the poor, we  should see  to  it  that affordable housing  is  available to all senior citizens.  Despite the continued build up of the Social  Security Trust Fund reserves, legislative action  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  must be taken to safeguard against future dis investment of Social Security Trust Funds for  purposes not outlined  in  the Social Security  Act. The Social Security Program was de signed in 1935 to replace income lost due to  retirement, disability, unemployment or death.  We must ensure that the Social Security Fund  is used for  its intended purpose. Many older  Americans rely on  their social security check  as their only source of income. It is therefore  our duty  to ensure  that  these savings are  available to them.  I have outlined just a few concerns of our  older Americans which must be addressed by  Congress. Along with  the  invaluable assist ance of my Senior Advisory Committee, I have  worked to address these and other issues of  concerns of my older constituents. We must  direct our energy  to meet the needs of our  seniors  in order  that  these Americans can  continue  to play an active role  in  the life of  the Nation.  INVADING THE PRESIDENT'S  RIGHT TO CONTROL TREATIES  HON. JIM COURTER  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 29, 1987  ",1987
229,,100,0.269,859,8,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Speaker, Bruce Fein  has published an article  in  the Washington  Times pointing out that the House of Repre sentatives has no constitutional ground on  which to assert control over the Executive au thority over treaties.  I highly recommend  this  article to remind Members of the limits of our  powers.  It has never been quite clear what this ad ministration thinks  it is doing by downplaying  its exclusive  right  to control,  interpret, and  where  necessary  terminate  participation  in  treaties. What is certain is that if these excu tive prerogatives are not reasserted periodical ly by the administration, the House of Repre sentatives  and  the  Senate will  gradually  assume  them by a kind of squatters'  right.  And as harmful and dangerous as  it  is  for  Congress  to claim power over  treaties,  the  danger to  the conduct of successful  foreign  policy  is  increased by an administration  too  paralyzed  to protect  its  rights against Con gress. Worse yet when the same administra tion is the one that says it takes seriously the  original intent of the Constitution.  INVADING REAGAN'S TREATY TURF  Time is out of joint. The Constitution ex plicitly denies the House of Representatives  any role  in the formation of treaties. Yet  House Speaker Jim Wright, Democrat of  Texas, recently headed a congressional dele gation to Moscow to meet and confer with  Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on arms  control.  Glowing with optimism after the consulta tions and voicing hopes that defense spend ing would be slashed if arms control agree ments were concluded, Mr. Wright appeared  on national television  to communicate his  views on Soviet-U.S. relations.  Mr. Wright,  however did not  stop  at  words. Last Friday, he ramrodded through  the House of Representatives a supplemen tal appropriations bill by a vote of 208-178  that would  compel President Reagan  to  10609  comply with the unratified SALT II treaty  regarding numerical limits on nuclear weap ons and two nuclear test ban agreements.  Mr. Wright declared he had secured an un derstanding with Mr. Gorbachev that the  U.S.S.R. would likewise adhere to the nu merical nuclear weapons limits of SALT II.  Waiting  in  the wings  is undoubtedly a  House bill that would exploit the power of  the purse to compel the president to inter pret the 1972 ABM treaty with the Soviet  Union  to preclude the testing in space of  President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initia tive technology based on new physical prin ciples.  These constitutional frolics of the House  of Representatives into the forbidden  ter rain of treaty-making authority portends a  wholesale  clash with  the President  and  Senate over the role of the House  in the  forging of  foreign  and national  security  policy. The power of the purse does not in variably trump other constitutional prerog atives.  The Constitution empowers the president  to make treaties, with the advice and con sent of  two-thirds of  the senators voting.  John Jay, in ""Federalist 64,"" explained that  the  important  treaty-making power, espe cially as it relates to war or peace, was en trusted  to the president and the senators  because they possessed a longevity of office,  knowledge of foreign affairs, and a capacity  for continuity of policy that is indispensable  to success in making treaties.  The president was endowed with exclusive  negotiating authority to ensure the secrecy  and dispatch essential to exploiting oppor tunities in the negotiating process.  The House of Representatives, on  the  other hand, was excluded from the treaty making process. Its ""fluctuating and multi tudinuous composition,"" Alexander Hamil ton observed in ""Federalist 75,"" was incom patible with the qualities necessary for ex ercising treaty-making responsibilities: com prehensive knowledge of foreign politics; a  firm  and  systematic  adherence  to  long range goals; an unyielding defense of na tional dignity; and decisiveness.  Mr. Hamilton's view was shared by Alexis  de Tocqueville, who noted 150 years ago  that democratic institutions with numerous  members are generally inept in foreign af fairs because of a propensity  to obey mo mentary passions and to insist on immediate  results.  The House appropriations bill that would  give long-moribund portions of SALT II the  status of law nicely demonstrates why the  House of Representatives was fenced off by  the Constitution  from  the  treaty-making  process.  1. Lack of comprehensive knowledge of  foreign affairs:  The vast majority of the House members  are  foreign-policy amateurs. They devote  most of their cerebral time and energy to  satisfying parochial constituent needs and  planning re-election campaigns at two-year  intervals. These tasks representatives gener ally perform with virtuosity.  In contrast, most representatives are un schooled in the intricacies and evolution of  foreign-policy or national-security measures.  Their votes on these matters reflect more  feelings of the heart than sober judgments  of the head. The House appropriations vote  on SALT II reflects a natural yearning for  hopes and symbols of international peace,  but neglects the unsentimental realities of  Soviet behavior.  The bill denies  the president  funds  to  deploy strategic nuclear weapons in excess  ",1987

DAVID DREIER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 29, 1987  ",1987
231,,100,0.478,872,8,Mr. DREIER of California.," Mr. Speaker, we  often wish we could run the Federal Govern ment in a more business-like manner, that we  could adopt some of the same approaches to  cost control that private industry uses. Today I  am  introducing  legislation  to promote wider  use of one such approach, value engineering,  in Federal construction and procurement.  Value engineering is a management tool de veloped by General Electric over 40 year ago  which seeks  to systematically eliminate un necessary costs  in manufacturing and con struction. The value engineer's role is to care fully study existing plans for any potential im provements which would lead to savings with out reducing quality. The process of value en gineering has been likened to a doctor giving  a second opinion, but  it  is much more  than  that. The value engineer is an expert in mate rials, standards, and processes, and can pro vide insights which may escape the best build er or design engineer.  The  technique has already provided great  savings within  the Federal Government.  In  fact,  the Department of Defense estimated  that it saved over $300 million in 1985 through  limited use of value engineering reviews. GAO  has completed numerous favorable reports on  value engineering over the past 1 0 years, con cluding that every dollar spent on this process  yields an average savings of $10.  My bill would create a Value Engineering  Council  appointed  to  identify Federal  pro grams which might benefit most from utilizing  the process. Saving money  is a bipartisan  issue, and  the 16-member council would be  bipartisan, as well, with no more  than  10  members from the same party serving.  Value engineering is a proven money-saving  technique whose wider use  throughout  the  Federal Government will yield great savings.  Mr. Speaker, we are always seeking the most  painless routes to deficit reduction-the better  management that value engineering could pro vide is an outstanding opportunity to achieve  such responsible savings.  ",1987
232,House,100,0.353,924,8,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong opposition to section 703 of  H.R. 3 which would impose additional,  unfair reporting requirements on for eign investors, and in favor of the Lent  substitute, which makes the requirements  slightly more  palatable  by  granting the Secretary of Commerce  the authority to waive them in certain  cases.  Section 703, which I would call the  maybe we can get our interests rates  up  to 20  percent again amendment  mandates the following: Privately held  companies in which a foreigner has ac quired  a  25-percent  interest must  report for public disclosure the loca tion of  all  facilities  in  the United  States, the identity and nationality of  directors and officers and their com pensation,  related  business  transac tions, officers, and ""significant civil  litigation."" Similar requirements apply  to  foreigners with an  investment  in  U.S. property.  Lacking any arguments  that  they  care to articulate clearly, proponents  only mention that we have a right to  more information about foreign inves tors because  they are somehow sus pects. My guess  is that the real mo tives lie along the lines of harassment.  This  provisiOn,  discriminatory  against foreigners, would violate  the  principle of national  treatment and  undercut U.S. efforts to eliminate bar riers to U.S. investment abroad. A top  objective for  the Uruguay Round of  Trade Negotiations which this bill au thorizes, getting an agreement on in vestment restrictions will be difficult  to achieve  if we have  just increased  our own. If our trading partners en acted mirror restrictions against  the  foreign investments of U.S. companies  they would be  tempted  to pull up  stakes I am sure.  Federal Reserve  Chairman,  Paul  Volcker, and other economists have  testified in numerous occasions before  the Ways and Means Committee that  economic expansion  in  this country  and lower interest rates are due in no  small measure to the faith that for eigners have in our market and their  willingness to invest here. If this were  not the case, we would be denied the  foreign capital that supported 3 mil lion jobs in the United States in 1985.  As  dissenters  in  the  committee  report point out, the United States is  known  for  its  respect  for  personal  property and the privacy of  individ uals. Sending  signals  that we  now  intend to hassle foreign investors is, I  believe,  a misguided  and  somewhat  dangerous way to proceed. The retro active nature of  the requirements  is  highly unfair to those who decided to  invest here based on current regula tions.  Finally,  the Department of Com merce  and  the Securities  and Ex change Commission already have nu merous reporting mechanisms in place  to monitor foreign investment if that  is the intention of the proponents of  this  section.  Comprehensive  data  exists and to require more paperwork  and public disclosure of foreign inves tors will only send their needed capital  fleeing to stock exchanges and plant  sites in other countries.  The substitute language offered by  Mr. LENT to subsection J of the section  703 would authorize the Secretary of  Commerce to exempt a person, inter est, or class of interests from the re porting requirements if he determines  the exemption is necessary to prevent  a ""substantial impairment of benefi cial foreign investment in the United  States."" It's the least we can do to im prove an exceedingly unwise provision  and I urge my colleagues to support  the Lent substitute.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Texas [Mr. FIELDS] stated the case ac curately a few moments ago. Under ex isting  law,  the Department of Com merce keeps sufficient data so  that  policymakers can make responsible de cisions.  The extra data required by the gen tleman from Texas [Mr. BRYANT], arti cle  703,  is  expensive  to maintain,  would not be much help, and is going  to discourage  foreign  investors  from  investing in the United States.  It  is  a  pretty  simple proposition.  This country has  the  lowest savings  rate in the industrialized world. Our  closest competitor is Canada, with a  rate  twice  our  size. Germany  and  Japan have from three to five  times  higher rate of savings than we do.  Because our Congress  is profligate  and openhanded, we incur about $200  billion of deficit every year. With our  consumers on  their usual  spending  binge, as was noted here yesterday,  there simply is not enough capital in  the United States of America to carry  our economy and provide more jobs.  0 1050  Thank heaven for offshore capital,  for imported capital to keep this coun try going,  to  provide  jobs  for our  people. If we pass the Bryant amend ment, we can't keep it out. We can re capture those old glory days of Jimmy  Carter when we had interest rates of  20 percent and more.  Do not pass this amendment which  is calculated only to harass foreign in vestors. What I will do  is discourage  the marginal  investors,  and  deny  America the capital it needs to move  forward.  If you like high interest rates, you  will  love,  the Bryant amendment.  I  only wish the Lent amendment would  strike  it all  instead of  touching  it  lightly with a glove.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge support for  the Lent amendment.  ",1987

234,House,100,0.372,937,8,Mr. KONNYU.," Mr. Chairman,  yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman,  this bill  is,  as  the  gentleman from Ohio just said, is true  veto bait. The U.S. Trade Representa tive has said  that,  the Secretary of  Commerce has said that, the President  is against this bill because he knows  what it will create.  I have already told you about Toy otas built in Freemont in cooperation  with GM, semiconductors built mostly  in the United States that are not going  to be able to be sold at the Federal  level.  The amendment is simply amending  the Buy America Act of 1933. Think  about when  it was created. In 1933,  the days of the Depression, and that is  the thinking that is prevailing behind  this  amendment; more Depression  type thinking.  Instead of recognizing, as obviously  some in this room have not, that this  is the time of international trade. It  would cost California, if you cut off all  the trade, 1 million jobs in California,  1 out of every 10 jobs, 1 million jobs.  That is what the Governor wrote me  in  a  letter  expressing  his  concern  about what is going on in Congress.  That is Depression-era thinking.  The macho thinking of this bill; for getting about  foreign  retaliation,  if  you are an aircraft worker from Wash ington State building  those Boeing  747's, you might as well forget a bunch  of your jobs, workers in Washington,  because this bill in not going to allow  Boeing  to sell  those aircraft  to Air  France, to Lufthansa, to British Air, to  JAL, because it is the government air line, a government owns that and they  are going to retaliate against America.  This, Mr. Chairman, and Members,  is a  terrible provision. That is why I  really believe in opposing it. This is a  macho bill that will  feel good  today  and hurt us for decades to come.  ",1987

MOST-FAVORED-NATION TREATMENT TO  PRODUCTS OF IWMANIA.  (a) CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.-The Con gressC 1) notes that the Department of State, in  the publication Country Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 1985, determined that  ""In the area of human rights, major dis crepancies exist between generally accepted  standards, for example as embodied in the  Helsinki Final Act of the Conference on Se curity and Cooperation in Europe, and Ro manian practice . ... The party,  through  the Government, continues to restrict and  control the right to free speech, free assem bly  and association,  and  the practice of  one's religion."";  (2)  is aware of numerous accounts from  the Department of State, Congressional del egations, and various human rights organi zations,  that Romanian citizens are being  arbitrarily harassed,  interrogated, and ar rested by Romanian government authorities  for the exercise of civil and religious liber ties;  (3)  finds  that official Romanian harass ment of  religious believers has not only  been extended to the arrest of persons for  carrying Bibles and other religious materi als, but even carried to the point of destroying places of worship, including most recent ly  the country's largest Seventh Day Ad ventist Church and  the Sephardic  syna gogue in Bucharest;  (4) further  finds that the United States  trade deficit with Romania <which contin ues to be high) is a result of our extension  of  nondiscriminatory  treatment <most-fa vored-nation treatment) to that country and  can be considered as an endorsement of that  nation's abusive internal practices;  (5) is aware of the severe limits placed on  the rights of Hungarians and other ethnic  minorities within Romania to express and  maintain their cultural heritage, as is illus trated by the attempts made by the Roma nian government to eliminate systematically  Hungarian  churches,  schools,  traditions,  and even the Hungarian language from Ro manian society;  (6) recognizes and emphasizes the contin ued dedication of the United States to fun damental human rights Cas noted in section  402 of the Trade Act of 1974) and is con cerned with  Romania's  commitment  to  those rights; and  (7) commends the President for withdraw ing Romania's eligibility for duty-free treat ment under the Generalized System of Pref erences because of Romania's violation of  ""internationally recognized worker rights"".  (b)  0BJECTIVES.-The objectives of  this  section are to effect( 1) the termination of the current policies  and practice of the Government of Romania  under which< A> its citizens are denied the right or op portunity to emigrate,  <B> more than a nominal tax is imposed  on emigration or on the visas or other docu ments required for emigration, and  <C> more than nominal taxes, levies, fines,  fees, or other charges are imposed on citi zens as a consequence of their desire to emi grate to the countries of their choice; and  (2) substantial progress in halting the per secution by the Government of Romania of  its  citizens  on  religious  and  political  grounds, and the repression by such Gov ernment of Hungarians and other ethnic  minorities within Romania.  DEFINITIONS  OF  RIGHTS  PERIOD.-As used in this section,  ""rights review period"" means( 1) the 6-month period referred to in sub section (d)(l); and  (2) each successive period of 180 consecu tive calendar days occurring after the last  day of  the 6-month period referred  to  in  paragraph ( 1).

241,,100,-0.321,1093,8,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  introducing, with Mr. DYMALL Y, Mr. TORRES,  Mr. WHEAT, Mr.  PEPPER, and Mr. LENT your  amendments to H.R. 27, FSLIC minority insti tutions bill which will extend  the  forbearance  and oversight provisions to a unique and en dangered group of FSLIC-insured  institutions,  minority owned or operated associations.  It is  my understanding that these provisions will be  incorporated  into H.R. 27 as Chairman Pep per's amendments.  The first amendment broadens the present  definition of institutions eligible for capital for bearance contained in section 202 and, by ex tension, institutions eligible for the Capital Cer tificate Program of section 203, by adding mi nority associations  50  percent or more of  whose  loans are minority  loans and 50 per cent or more of whose originated loans are for  one  through  four dwelling units or consumer  loans. This  two-part definition  is  intended  to  identify those minority associations which are  clearly serving  the minority community and  which are performing the classic funtions of a  thrift  institution. Minority  is defined  to mean  black, native, Hispanic, and Asian Americans.  The second amendment includes regulation  of minority associations among the topics for  which quarterly reports to Congress are man dated by existing section 209.  The urgent need for legislation assisting mi nority associations and recognizing the special  difficulties they confront is revealed  in a few  stark statistics. From a peak of 85 minority as sociations in 1982, there were only 64 remain ing associations by yearend 1986, and  the  number continues to decline. Those 64 minoriEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ty associations had combined assets of $4.8  billion, and 19 had regulatory net worth of less  than 3 percent. Of the 19, 4 are in Florida, 4  are in California, 2 are in Texas, and 2 are in  Louisiana.  Minority associations provide a unique serv ice  to their customers despite economic and  cultural barriers. They often must overcome  inner-city adversity and welcome as  their cli ents  individuals shunned by conventional  fi nancial institutions. They are pioneers in their  promotion of minorities to executive positions  and in their ability to raise capital from within  the minority community. They are very often  the only source of  financial services that are  accessible and affordable  to minorities, and  must contend with  the  fact that the costs of  administering minority transactions are gener ally greater due to the smaller average size of  deposits and loans.  Current conditions in the thrift industry com pound the obstacles that minority associations  must  overcome.  The  private  initiative  and  public service demonstrated by minority asso ciations deserves our encouragement.  In  this  period of  financial  turbulence and  regulatory  uncertainty,  every effort must be made  to  foster  those minority associations which  find  themselves  in a distressed condition through  no fault of their own.  This bill  recognizes  the special need and  importance of minority associations, and are  eminently entitled to our support. I urge each  of the Members of  this body  to support this  legislation.

243,,100,0.091,1106,8,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, on April 8, 1987,  I introduced eight bills which will amend and  strengthen  the Older Americans Act. These  bills are wide ranging and as the following de scriptions indicate, they are efforts to fine tune  this important legislation.  THE CAREGIVER REFERRAL ACT OF 1987  This bill requires the Commissioner to con duct a study to determine the efficacy of de veloping a nationwide  referral system using  the area agencies on aging and State units on  aging for geographically remote caregivers of  older persons.  Recent research has shown  that 80  to 90  percent of care is still provided by the family.  Adult children  living  in geographically distant  parts of the country are not necessarily any  less concerned about the well-being of  their  aged parents  than are  the  family members  who  live  in close proximity. Many attempt to  perform  the  role of caregiver at a distance,  but their tasks are more difficult because they  do not know how to access available, reputa ble services in another community. Their con tinued involvement could be enhanced if there  were a way to identify services for older family  members who are geographically distant. The  Older Americans Act consists of over 660  area agencies and 56 State units all of which  provide a variety of services  that could be  made available to geographically distant family  caregivers and which could serve  to assist  them  in  their caregiving  role. This bill would  determine  if  a  nationwide  referral  system  could be developed.  THE RURAL ALLOTMENT ACT OF 1987  This bill updates the current pr.ovision that  in each fiscal year the State agency will spend  for services  in  rural areas an amount of not  less than 1 05 percent of the amount expend ed for such services in 1978.  This bill will update the base year from 1978  to 1986 in order to better reflect the growth in  the need for services in rural areas.  THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE COORDINATION ACT OF  1987  This bill  requires  that AAA's work closely  with  local Alzheimer's disease organizations  for the purpose of coordinating services to in dividuals and  families with Alzheimer's dis ease.  Each of us is aware of the devastation that  Alzheimer's disease causes the victim and the  family. Requiring the Older Americans Act net work  to better coordinate their activities with  organizations providing support services  for  Alzheimer's disease will serve  to strengthen  both the network and the community organiza tions involved in this important activity.  OLDER AMERICANS DAY CARE AND RESPITE SERVICES  ACT OF 1987  This  bill  requires  that,  where  possible,  AAA's encourage the use of older volunteers  in the provision of adult day care and respite  care services and includes the provision that  not less than 15 percent of new title V monies  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  must be spent on employment in day care adult and child-and respite care projects.  Increasingly,  family caregivers have  identi fied  the need  for day care and  respite care  services, creating a potentially large demand  for these services as a means of staving off  more  costly and  less personal  institutional  care. On  the supply side, older persons who  have an  interest or expertise  in  the care of  frail or dependent adults should be encour aged  to volunteer  to provide assistance  in  these areas. Title V workers should be chan neled  into work in day care and respite care  as  these workers can bring  important skills  and  increase the available supply of services  identified by caregivers as essential.  THE MEDIGAP AND LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE  COUNSELING ACT OF 1987  This bill allows  for the  training and estab lishment of volunteer programs  to evaluate  the provisions of medical insurance policies long-term care and Medigap-which older per sons are considering purchasing and requires  the State to develop consumer education  in formation on such plans.  Presently, approximately 65 percent of older  persons purchase Medigap insurance. While it  is unclear how many have more  than one  policy,  anecdotal  information  suggests  that  many buy multiple policies on which their mar ginal gain may be very small. The purpose of  this  insurance counseling program, modeled  after  tax  counseling  programs  currently  in  place, would be to inform older persons what  benefits  they can expect  from purchasing a  given Medigap or long-term care policy as well  as the value of multiple policies. As older per sons are  increasingly  targeted by  insurance  companies for television and direct mail sales,  the ability to evaluate policies will be essential  in assuring  that older persons get value  for  their dollars.  OLDER AMERICANS TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 1987  This  bill  requires a study of  how Older  Americans Act money is being spent on trans portation, what  it  is  buying  and  how  this  money could be better leveraged through tap ping into mass transit systems.  Transportation services are both essential  and  expensive  services.  Under  the Older  Americans  Act,  transportation  has  been  funded as a means of providing access  to  services. Particularly in rural areas, transporta tion  is  the  key  to  adequate  utilization  of  needed services. The purchase of vehicles,  staffing and maintenance consume a share of  the Older Americans Act, but how  large  the  share and what  is being purchased has not  been documented; neither has  the extent to  which Older Americans Act moneys can be  used to draw mass  transit and other alterna tive systems of  transportation  into  the net work. A study of these factors will enable the  network to plan for the rational use of trans portation without establishing parallel systems  to those which are already in place.  THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH COORDINATION ACT  OF 1987  This bill  requires AAA's  to  include  in  their  plans  the provision  that  they will coordinate  with  community mental health  centers and  other public and private nonprofit organiza tions.  Historically,  older persons have underuti lized mental health services. Better coordinaApril 30, 1987  tion among  those who provide mental health  services and the AAA network help to insure  that the elderly in need of mental health serv ices will have improved access.  AREA AGENCY ON AGING UNIFORM LISTING ACT OF  1987  This bill requires that all area agencies uni formly  list themselves  in  the  telephone book  under area agency on aging  for purposes of  easy access by consumers.  Area agencies across the country use differ ent names and are located in different sites that is, some are private while others are part  of  local government. The point of a uniform  listing provision  is  to assure  that  those who  wish to obtain service can do so by knowing  that, wherever they are, they can gain access  to the local area agency on aging. The use of  a uniform listing is an essential step in estab lishing an easily accessible nationwide net work of area agencies on aging.  As each of you knows  from your constitu ents, the Older Americans Act is important far  beyond  the confines of its $1 billion budget.  This act and  the network of area agencies  and State units has focused national attention  on the needs and concerns of older persons.  As we  consider  the  reauthorization  of  the  Older Americans Act in 1987, I hope you will  join me in supporting these provisions and in  further strengthening a 22-year-old success  story.

244,,100,0.505,1106,8,Mr. NIELSON.," Mr. Speaker,  the  following  letter was sent  from  the U.S. Trade Repre sentative Clayton Yeutter to the chairman of  the Government Operations Committee, Mr.  BROOKS,  regarding H.R. 1750, which was in corporated into title X of H.R. 3.  The letter follows:  THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE,  Washington, DC, April2, 1987.  Hon. JACK BROOKS,  Chairman, Government Operations Com mittee,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: We are both eager to  find solutions to our trade problems. Howev er, I have concluded that H.R. 1750, which  was introduced on March 23, will have some  serious negative unintended effects. After a  careful evaluation of the bill, I believe that  it could not be effectively  implemented,  that it is too costly from both an economic  and a policy perspective, and that it would  not  improve  the  existing  situation. For  these reasons, the Administration is strong  ly opposed to its enactment.  As  I understand H.R. 1750,  this bill  is  aimed at expanding the foreign government  procurement markets available  to U.S. ex porters while  the Administration and  the  Committee share  the same objectives-our  exporters deserve  the same access  to mar kets overseas  that foreign exporters enjoy  in our markets-we  are  very  concerned  about  the strategy you have proposed for  pursuing this objective.  H.R. 1750 would force closure of U.S. Gov ernment procurement markets as  the pri",1987
245,,100,-0.174,1119,8,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to  pay tribute to the students and faculty of the  Annunciation-St. George School in Shenando ah, PA. On May 20, 1987, the school will be  celebrating the Bicentennial of America's Con stitution in a special way with a commemora tive show for the school and  the entire sur rounding community.  Students  from  kindergarten  through  the  eighth grade will be the stars of the perform ance. Under  the  caring guidance of Sister  Frances Anne, they have been diligently prac ticing and are anxiously awaiting for May 20 to  come. They plan to portray the history of our  Nation  through  dance, poetry, music,  and  drama. This is indeed a special event. In com memoration of the performance, the Pennsyl vania Department of Education's bicentennial  project has officially recognized  the students  and faculty for their commitment to recogniz ing  the historical  importance of our Nation's  Constitution. It is my honor to also recognize  these fine young men and women on this oc casion. I know that my colleagues will join me  in honoring the students and faculty of the An nunciation-St. George School and  in wishing  them continued success and good  fortune  in  the years to come.  TRIBUTE TO DR. JOYCE  YERWOOD  HON. STEWART B. McKINNEY  OF CONNECTICUT  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April30, 1987  Mr. McKINNEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask my col leagues to join me in giving proud recognition  to one of my constituents, Dr. Joyce Yerwood.  The Union Baptist Church,  the  citizens of  Stamford, CT, and  I are honoring  this very  unique physician for her dedicated service as  a leading woman  in  the medical field and for  her outstanding contribution to the black com munity.  Dr. Yerwood earned her medical degree  from Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN,  in 1933, an accomplishment nearly unheard of  for a black woman at that time. After complet ing her internships in Kansas City and Phila delphia, Dr. Yerwood settled in Stamford with  her husband, Dr. Joseph L. Garwin, to  raise  their  son,  Joseph. Remarkably,  she main tained  an  active medical  practice  in  Port  Chester, NY, from 1937 to 1955.  In 1955 Joyce moved her practice to Stam ford and set a precedent by becoming the first  black,  female  family practitioner  in Fairfield  County. She devoted  her practice  to  low income women and children. She also recog nized the vital need for a community organiza tion to promote both the educational and cul tural  needs of black youth. Dr. Yerwood's  commitment to improving the quality of life for  her patients and her community  led her  to  start  the Negro Youth Theatre Group, which  later grew into the West Main Street Commu nity Center, and, in 1976, became the current ly active Yerwood Center. Furthermore, she  was among the first to recognize the emerging  drug problem  in Stamford and  in  the 1960's  was involved in a federally sponsored drug re search program. Finally, she was instrumental  in starting  the NAACP chapter in Greenwich.  Although now retired from her formal prac tice,  Joyce  should be  commended  for her  continued activity. She is the medical director  of  the Methadone Clinic of Liberation pro grams  in Stamford, she  is a member of  the  board of directors of Yerwood Center, and  she is chairman of the trustee board of Union  Baptist Church.  Many honors have been bestowed upon the  deserving Dr. Yerwood. A  few of  the more  outstanding  include  the naming of  the Yer wood Center and an appointment to serve on  the National Advisory Council of Comprehen sive Health Manning Programs under HEW.  She has been  the  recipient of  the mayor's  award,  the  Alpha  Kappa  Alpha  Heritage  Award, and  the Hannah G. Solomon Award.  Dr. Yerwood is listed in ""Who's Who of Ameri can Women,"" appears in the Connecticut His torical Society list ""Black Women Against the  Odds,"" and  is mentioned  in  the publication  Stamford: an Illustrated History.  Because of her many contributions  to  the  welfare of mankind, Dr. Joyce Yerwood de serves  the  respect and admiration of young  and old alike. To quote Pal Kusso, chairman  of the Permanent Commission of the Status of  Women, ""Dr. Yerwood is a pioneer woman in  the  true and most wonderful sense of  the  word. She  is  a  shining  example  of what  women can achieve.""  H.R. 2228 AN AG TAX PACKAGE  HON. HAL DAUB  OF NEBRASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 30, 1987  ",1987

The bill has 11 provisions . . . but it has  only 2 goals-fairness and simplification.  Last year  I supported  the Tax Reform Act  because I believed, and still do, that it was a  big  improvement  over  its  loophole  ridden  predecessor.

249,House,100,-0.472,1197,8,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Hawaii  [Mr. AKAKAJ who is cosponsor of the  bill.  ",1987
250,House,100,-0.419,1197,8,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding. I want to  thank  the gentleman  from Arizona,  for his work on this bill, the gentle man from Minnesota [Mr. VENTO] for  his long hard work trying to get this  bill together, and also the ranking mi nority member  the gentleman  from  California [Mr. LAGOMARSINO], and all  those who have supported this bill be cause this bill is very important to the  safety of the people who travel in our  national parks.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 921 and urge my colleagues to  join me in voting for this important  bill. Now is the time to confront the  problems associated with overflights  of our national parks.  Aircraft noise is a serious problem in  Hawaii's national parks. Over the past  10  years,  sightseeing  aircraft  oper ations have increased, particularly on  the  islands  of Kauai, Maui,  and  Hawaii. It is not unusual for visitors to  some wilderness areas to be subjected  to  low-altitude overflights  every  15  minutes. Nowhere are  the problems  more serious than in Hawaii's two na tional parks, Haleakala National Park  on Maui and Hawaii Volcanoes Nation al Park on Hawaii.  In 1984,  there were over 1 million  visitors  to Haleakala National Park.  Many came  to view  the spectacular  volcanic crater, Haleakala, the ""House  of the Sun."" The crater area can be  reached by hiking or by air. Haleakala  experiences an average of 30  tourist  helicopter  flights a day. The crater  itself, which is about 3,000 feet deep  from  rim  to  floor, magnifies noise  caused by helicopters as  the sound  bounces  off  its walls,  particularly  when helicopters are flown inside the  crater, below the rim.  A University of Hawaii graduate stu dent, Al Perez, surveyed 44 park visitors on the trails of Haleakala. Seven ty percent of those surveyed said they  came to the park for silence and soli tude. Without prompting  from  the  interviewer, 41 percent said that heli copter noise was the most disagreeable  aspects of  their visit.  In addition,  I  have  received numerous  statements,  letters and testimony from community  leaders,  local  officials, Hawaii  resi dents and park visitors which further  describe the problems with these over flights.  I have also  reviewed Park Service  cases of aircraft complaints by park  rangers and visitors. These records in dicate  that  sightseeing  helicopter  flight practices often go beyond being  a  nuisance  and  create  unnecessary  safety  hazards.  Complaints  from  horseback riders have been filed after  low-flying  helicopters  startled  their  mounts. Several stockmen with trail riding concessions in the park have re marked that this is a recurring prob lem. Complaints have also been filed  by park rangers who have observed  actual unsafe flight practices, some in  violation of a Federal air regulation  requiring helicopters carrying paying  passengers to maintain a minimum al titude of 300  feet  above populated  areas.  It is time to address these problems.  Since 1984, an FAA advisory has been  in effect requesting aircraft to fly at  least 2,000 feet above the highest land form of any national park. Unfortu nately, this advisory has been ignored,  particularly with respect to Haleakala  National Park. We need the temporary  restrictions over Haleakala which H.R.  921  provides during  the  study and  review period. We need not only  to  protect our. national parks but also  public  safety.  Finally, we  need  to  study  the problems associated with  aircraft overflights of our national  parks by passing H.R. 921. I urge my  colleagues to join me in this effort.  ",1987
251,House,100,-0.553,1197,8,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker,  yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of this legislation, and commend our  distinguished colleagues on the Com mittee on Interior and Insular Affairs  and  the Subcommittee on National  Parks and Recreation  for  their fine  work on this bill. I also thank them  for  their most cooperative and con structive efforts in working with the  Committee  on  Public Works  and  Transportation and the Subcommittee  on Aviation to accommodate our Com mittee's interests and concerns. Be cause of this cooperation, the Commit tee on Public Works and Transporta tion, which shares jurisdiction on this  legislation, was able to quickly agree  to the bill being brought to the floor.  Our interest in the problem of over flights of the national parks is nothing  new. Three years ago, Congressman  SEIBERLING, then chairman of the Na tional Parks Subcommittee, and Avia tion Subcommittee Chairman MINETA  urged changes  to FAA-recommended  operating procedures  covering  over flights of national parks. The change  was to advise pilots to fly 2,000  feet  above canyon rims in units of the Na tional Park System for noise abate ment reasons. We recognized then, as  did the Federal Aviation Administra tion, that flying below the canyon rim  in national parks, like Grand Canyon  and Yosemite, produced noise incom patible with the purpose of a national  park-that  being  establishment  of  areas where citizens can enjoy our na tion's natural beauty and quiet.  This change in recommended operat ing procedures has had a positive ben efit, but it has become apparent that  we now need to go beyond recommen dations or advice to the aviation com munity, because there continue to be  abuses resulting in environmental deg radation of some units of the national  parks.  I will not  reiterate what my col leagues from the Interior Committee  are proposing in this legislation. They  have already ably described the com prehensive approach in this legislation  of study and  regulation of airspace  over  specific  units of  the national  parks.  I would like to take a few moments  to describe  the  legislation  from an  aviation safety perspective. The Avia",1987

253,House,100,-0.473,1210,8,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I move  to suspend the rules and pass the bill  <H.R.  1207)  to  amend  the Federal  Food, and Cosmetic Act  to ban the  reimportation of drugs produced  in  the United States, to place restrictions  on the distribution of drug samples, to  ban certain resales of drugs by hospi tals and other health care facilities,  and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 1207  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the  United States  of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCE.  (a) SHORT TITLE.-This Act may be cited  as the ""Prescription Drug Marketing Act of  1987"".  (b) REFERENCE.-Whenever in this Act an  amendment or repeal is expressed in terms  of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section  or other provision,  the reference shall be  considered to be made to a section or other  provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  The Congress finds the following( 1) American consumers cannot purchase  prescription drugs with the certainty that  the products are safe and effective.  (2)  The  integrity  of  the  distribution  system for prescription drugs is insufficient  to prevent  the  introduction and eventual  retail  sale of  substandard,  ineffective, or  even counterfeit drugs.  (3) The  existence  and operation of  a  wholesale submarket, commonly known as  the ""diversion market"", prevents effective  control over or even routine knowledge of  the true sources of prescription drugs in a  significant number of cases.  (4) Large  amounts of drugs are being  reimported to the United States as Ameri can goods  returned. These  imports are a  health and safety risk to American consum ers because they may have become subpo tent or adulterated during foreign handling  and shipping.  (5) The  ready market  for  prescription  drug reimports has been the catalyst for a  continuing series of frauds against Ameri can manufacturers and has provided  the  cover for the importation of foreign coun terfeit drugs.  < 6) The existing system of providing drug  samples to physicians through manufactur er's representatives has been abused for dec ades and has resulted in the sale to consum ers of misbranded, expired, and adulterated  pharmaceuticals.  <7> The bulk  resale of below wholesale  priced prescription drugs by health care en tities, for ultimate sale at retail, helps fuel  the diversion market and is an unfair form  of competition to wholesalers and retailers  that must pay otherwise prevailing market    (8) The effect of these several practices  and conditions is to create an unacceptable  risk that counterfeit, adulterated, misbrand ed, subpotent, or expired drugs will be sold  to American consumers.  price~  SEC. 3. REIMPORTATION.  Section 801 <21 U.S.C. 381) is amended by  redesignating subsection  (d) as subsection  (e) and by inserting after subsection (c) the  following:  ""(d)( 1) Except as provided  in paragraph  (2), no drug subject to section 503(b) which  is manufactured  in a State and exported  may be  imported  into  the United States  unless the drug is imported by the person  who manufactured the drug.  ""(2) The Secretary may authorize the im portation of  a  drug  the  importation of  which is prohibited by paragraph < 1) if the  drug  is  required  for  emergency medical  care."".  SEC. 4. SALES RESTRICTIONS.  Section 503 <21 U.S.C. 353) is amended by  adding at the end the following:  ""(c)(l) No person may sell, purchase, or  trade or offer to sell, purchase, or trade any  drug sample. For purposes of this paragraph  and subsection (d), the term 'drug sample'  means a unit of a drug, subject to subsection  (b), which is not intended to be sold and is  intended to promote the sale of the drug.  Nothing in this paragraph shall subject an  officer or executive of a drug manufacturer  or distributor to criminal liability solely be cause of a sale, purchase, trade, or offer to  sell, purchase or trade in violation of this  paragraph by other employees of the manu facturer or distributor.  ""(2) No person may  sell,  purchase, or  trade, offer to sell, purchase, or trade, or  counterfeit any coupon. For purposes of  this paragraph, the term 'coupon' means a  form which may be redeemed, at no cost or  at a reduced cost, for a drug which is pre scribed in accordance with section 503(b).

Mr. Chairman, for the past 4 years,  it has been my privilege and opportu nity  to serve on  the Committee on  Armed Services,  and  specifically,  to  serve on  the Subcommittee on Re search  and Development with  the  Honorable MELVIN  PRICE  of  Illinois  and the ranking minority member, the  gentleman from Alabama [Mr. DICK INSON].  This has been a very wonderful ex perience for me to have an opportuni ty to see first hand how our military  procurement is begun at the research  and development level.  At this time, I would like to issue a  report on behalf of our chairman, the  gentleman from  Illinois  [Mr. PRICE],  outlining briefly the activities of this  committee to be found in this bill.  FLOOR STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE MELVIN  PRICE OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  SUBCOMMITTEE  ""Mr. Chairman,  the administration  requested $43.7 billion for the Depart ment of Defense fiscal year 1988 re search, development, test, and evalua tion program. This represents a sizable  increase over the $35.8 billion appro priated by the Congress for the fiscal  year 1987 RDT&E program.  ""In  consideration  of  Gramm Rudman-Hollings and the present situ ation with  the Federal deficit,  the  committee could not endorse the ad ministration's request  for 18-percent  real growth  in  the  fiscal year 1988  RDT&E program.  ""The committee recommends reduc ing  the  administration's request by  $7.9 billion for several significant rea sons.  ""First, in several areas the Depart ment of Defense wanted to pursue re search and development at  the ex pense  of  on-going  production  pro grams. The most notable example was  the decision to begin the phase out of  the Army's AH-64 Apache Helicopter  line. Accordingly,  the committee did  not support the Army's light helicop ter experimental  [LHXJ program  in  consideration of the fact that several  hundred million dollars would be rec ommended for addition to the procure ment account to ensure continuation  of the Army's first line helicopter pro grams.  ""The second reason for the commit tee's mark stems largely from the fact  that the dollars that we approve today  for research and development gener ate a requirement for tens of dollars  within a 5to 10-year period. There is  a perception that in the Department  of Defense research and development  program the services are trying to exe cute  too many  programs-some  of  which are ""nice to have"" rather than  pursuing fewer programs that are ab solutely essential in a more efficient  manner.  ""There has been far too much dupli cation of effort  in  the defense  re search program and  it  is  imperative  that we eliminate needless redundancy  and improve the return on our defense  research investment.  ""The more significant actions taken  by  the  committee  in  reaching  this  level included a reduction of $1.7 bil lion from the administration's request  of $5.2 billion for the strategic defense  initiative [SOil; a reduction of $106.0  million from the request of $356 mil lion for  the Antisatellite Program, a  reduction of $227 million from the re quest of $402 million for the light heli copter experiment [LHX] program; a  reduction of $200 million from the re quest of $1.2 billion for the C-17 air craft; and a reduction of $342 million  from the request of $592 million for  the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile  Alternate Basing Program. The com mittee  recommended deletion of all  funds for the Army's Aquila and Patri ot Antitactical Missile Systems, and  the Navy's Advanced Anti-Aircraft  Missile,  Airship,  Advanced  Light weight Torpedo and Battle Group Pas sive Horizon Extension System Train er. The committee recommended  in creasing authorization for the conven tional defense initiative [COil by $328  million, university research  initiative  [URI] by $107 million, and  the ad vanced attack submarine by $100 mil lion. The committee also recommend ed authorization of $2.9 billion of the  $44.2 billion requested for fiscal year  1989  primarily  for  the  technology  base, 6.1 and 6.2, activities.  ""The committee made a number of  'efficiency' adjustments-most notably  in the areas of tactical fighter aircraft  and electronic warfare.  ""Mr. Chairman, I have highlighted  the more significant actions taken by  the committee.""  However, many changes were made,  and the reason we were able to make  these changes, I think, and stay within  budget, was because of  the  tremen dous amount of cooperation exhibited  by both  the majority and minority  members of this committee.  We work together as a team, and I  think we have an effort of which we  can all be proud.  I ask that my colleagues join us in  passing the recommendations of  the  Subcommittee on Research and Devel opment.  ",1987

What we have here is  justice gone  awry. At the very least, the Justice De partment  should  apologize  to  Jim  Beggs and the codefendants. But, Mr.  Speaker, no apology-no admission of  a mistake-is going to make up for the  19 months of special hell  that Jim  Beggs and his family have had to live  through.

257,House,100,-0.511,90,13,Mr. GRAY of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, the very same people whose  policies brought us  the deficits now  say  that  they cannot participate  in  deficit reduction until somehow there  is reform of the process.  Did we not hear that just a couple of  years ago with Gramm-Rudman, the  same people who said, ""Reform the  process""? Well, we reformed the proc ess-Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.  Now  they are back again saying, ""Reform  the process.""  I  think  that  the American public  knows that it is not the process that is  in need of repair. What is  really  in  need of repair is some leadership on  Capitol Hill and down  in the White  House that will say, ""Let's make the  right decisions and reduce these defi cits.""  Giving a constitutional amendment  to balance the budget to this President  will mean nothing. Why? Because he  has already had seven opportunities to  present a balanced budget, and he has  not presented one yet. But he wants a  constitutional  amendment  for  the  next person who sits  in  the White  House, not for him.  What about a line-item veto, which  would badly bring into imbalance the  constitutional  checks-and-balances  system? Would it mean that he would  strike educational programs, health care programs, as he did in his budget?  No, I do not think that is the solution.  What we really need is some leader ship on all sides of the aisle, and also  down at the White House,  that will  say, ""Let's come up with a deficit-re duction plan.''  Until we have that leadership from  my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle who voted ""present"" as we wrote  the budget  in committee  and who  voted against practically every alterna tive, I say that this is the best vehicle  that says, ""Mr. President,.if you want  I  more defense, pay for it. If you want  lower deficits, here it is, it is up to you.  And if you want lower spending, it is  up to you also.""  I urge Members to vote for the rule  and  also  for  this  deficit-reduction  plan, the comprehensive approach and  a balanced approach for 1988.  ",1987
258,House,100,0.371,90,13,Mr. SUNDQUIST.," Mr. Speaker,  rise  in strong opposition to the rule  and  to  the 1988 budget conference  agreement.  Mr. Speaker,  for  the past several  weeks, we've been watching the clash  of priorities within the leadership con trolling  the budget conference com mittee. The  issue  today  is not  the  President or the Vice President,  the  issue today is the 1988 budget confer ence agreement.  For  the past  several months, we  have witnessed the partisan lambast ing of the President's budget and the  President's priorities. Even the great  economic growth  that the President  created in his administration cannot  outdistance the big spenders  in this  House.  For the past several years now, we've  heard the attacks on deficit spending  from the born-again budget balancers  in the Congress. If only they regained  their chance to fully govern the Con gress, we were  told, deficit spending  would stop dead in its tracks. ""Words  are not enough,"" we were told. ""What  counts is action.""  Well, the time for action arrived on  the day the conference convened. And  after a month of inaction, the moment  of truth arrived last week.  We were promised a budget agree ment which ratchets down the size of  Government.  Instead, we have been  presented with a budget that increases  domestic spending $47 billion above  fiscal year 1987-and $38 billion above  President Reagan's budget.  We were promised an end to ""smoke and-mirrors""  deficit-reduction  tech niques. Instead, we've been presented  with $7.2 billion in accounting changes  that cut the deficit on paper only.  We were promised ""truth in budget ing."" Instead, we've been presented a  budget using clearly outdated econom ic assumptions.  We were promised a document that  makes the tough choices necessary to  hammer away at the deficit. Instead,  we've been presented an agreement  that terminates not a single Federal  program;  that  increases  outlays  at  almost twice the rate of speed as last  year; and that threatens to raise taxes  on lowand middle-income Americans  before  the  ink  even  dries  on  tax  reform.  Finally, we were promised a respon sible defense budget based on the Na tion's national security needs-not pol itics. Instead, Congress will today rubberstamp a document that holds our  national security hostage to a political  blackmail scheme. In return for $7 bil lion  in outlays that would allow no  real growth in defense spending, the  President would have to agree to more  than $64 billion in taxes. Even more  distressing is the prospect that if the  President pays the ransom, theres no  guarantee he'd get the hostage. In the  past 5 years, Congress has shifted $27  billion from defense allocations  into  domestic programs. There is no guar antee that once the $7 billion inflation  increase is allocated, the money would  be spent on defense.  For all of those  in this body who  have expressed condemnation in the  past year for paying ransom for hos tages, I ask: Is this a serious proposal?  Is  this a  realistic negotiating docu ment for the budget summit you want  to force? Is this the way Members of  Congress should set priorities for our  Nation's defense?  Mr. Speaker, this rule and the con ference agreement may make for good  politics, but a conference report on the  budget should reflect much more than  political defiance. We are told today  that we are voting on a budget agree ment that cuts the deficit responsibly,  fairly, and with accuracy. This agree ment does none of the above. As some one once said, Mr. Speaker, words are  not enough. What counts is action.  Taxes are still taxes. Taxes are still  taxes. And to quote my colleague from  Ohio-I  think  that  this  is what he  said-my own party  is playing  flip pantly with a  subject that our sup porters do not understand. Well,  I  assume that that means that our con stituents do not want a  tax increase,  but the majority party in this body is  going to force it down their throats so  that  they can  tax and spend some  more.  ",1987
259,House,100,-0.564,90,13,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  support of this rule and in support of  the conference report on House Con current Resolution 93,  the congres sional budget resolution for fiscal year  1988.  Mr. Speaker, this budget is far from perfect.  In particular, I am greatly concerned by what I  view as excessive  funding  for defense pro grams. However,  I believe  that on balance,  the budget conferees have done an admirable  job of crafting a budget that is far preferable  to  the President's  version.  The  resolution  maintains or  increases  funding  for urgently  needed domestic spending programs,  includ ing a major increase for AIDS research, edu cation and prevention. And it begins the proc ess of identifying the real causes of our Na tion's deficit ills and proposing substantive so lutions.

262,House,100,0.49,116,13,Mr. DORNAN of California.," My col leagues, we are in a very dangerous  area and we are skirting all sorts of  issues here. But I  think that we are  going to need a bipartisan approach to  decide what we are going to do about  wars of liberation, and that is what  the  to  they are described as on both sides,  and whether it is any of our business,  as the gentleman said, whether Ameri cans want to choose up sides, as the  chairman of my Subcommittee on the  Western Hemisphere began to discuss  on the Spanish Civil War.  Americans fought on both sides of  the Spanish Civil War. Only  the  strangely  named Abraham  Lincoln  Brigade gets lionized on national tele vision by Pierre Salinger. The other  side is not too well talked about, the  side that tried to stop the murdering  of the priests and the nuns.  Both sides of the Spanish Civil War,  both sides got into a rather ugly situa tion where both sides slaughtered pris oners wholesale. So there is not too  much pride to be taken on either side  of that.  Then about 2 or 3 years later one  American went over to work for the  Japanese warlords. She eventually did  time. We did not murder her or kill  her as the British killed Lord HaHa,  but we put Tokyo Rose in jail.  On the other side there were Ameri can military pilots deviously secunded,  Army Air Corps, Navy pilots  to  the  Flying Tigers  to get $500  for every  Japanese Zero they shot down. They  were fighting for China against Japan,  and there was no declaration of war.  In this Chamber we have a picture  hanging of a man that Robespierre  called  a mercenary,  Lafayette. He  came as a young man  in his early  twenties  to  fight  in  a  revolution  against a strong country in Europe. He  was a Contra in that sense. Was his  travel restricted by France? No.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from  California  [Mr.  DORNAN] has expired.  ",1987

What this amendment then really is  about is that many of my colleagues  on  the other side of  the aisle are  afraid of the American people,  they  are afraid of people who have gone  down  to Nicaragua, have  talked  to  people, who have engaged in work pro grams and discussed with members of  the government all the different fac tions, and have come home and have  lectured  to  their neighbors  and  to  their congregations about how stupid,  how brutal the American policy is in  Nicaragua. What we now find is in the  most recent polls over 70 percent of  the American people oppose the policy  of this administration, and this  is a  last ditch effort by taking away Ameri cans' freedom to travel, their civil lib erties and the democratic institutions  to try to overcome what the majority  of the American people want us to do,  and that is to end this administration's  policy in Nicaragua.

ADJOURNMENT  ",1987
291,,100,0.203,142,13,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Speaker, over  the  last 2  years we  have  had  several major media  events where the vaults of sunken ships and  hotel basements have been opened before  live nationwide audiences. Some of the excur sions have yielded treasures beyond anyone's  wildest dreams, while others yielded nothing.  In any case, these discoveries have engaged  the public interest.  Today, I am suggesting a media expedition  to open the Democrats budget on live, nation wide  television. For  the good of the country  and for the benefit of the American taxpayer, I  call upon some enterprising  investigative re porter to explore the hidden passageways of  the Democrats budget for the next fiscal year  and  to do so before a  live nationwide audi ence.  Sneak previews provided by  the majority  party in the Congress suggest that such an in vestigation would  find  that  this budget con tains over $19 billion  in a new, unspecified,  additional taxes. Viewers would also find that  a hostage is being held in this budget. Specifi cally, the Nation's defense is being held hos tage by  the  tax  increase. Finally,  there  is a  back door in this budget. This back door will  allow Members of this Congress to  increase  the national debt ceiling  to an alltime high,  without as much as a recorded vote on this  issue.  Even this preview, however, does not reveal  all that is contained within this budget. Much  larger questions remain to be explored-what  kind of taxes will be added to the burden of  the American taxpayer, what impact will these  increased  taxes have on  the vitality of our  economy, what higher costs will  there be for  selected domestic programs, and how much  will our interest payments on the national debt  increase?  While American viewers will be  intrigued  with  this  latest expedition,  they will not find  hidden  treasures. Rather,  they will  find  the  same old tax and spend policies of the Demo crats and a few surprises such as the back door attempt to slip by yet another increase in  the national debt.  Mr. Speaker, clearly our budget process has  become like many of these sealed vaults with  the Republicans shut out of the process and  many  unknowns  lurking  behind  the walls.  June 23, 1987  While this kind of show may receive high rat ings, the real result will be increased cynicism  on the part of the American taxpayer.  The American public deserves an honest  accounting of our budget process and how we  intend to spend their hard earned tax dollars.  If new  taxes are being proposed,  then be  honest and tell the American public how they  are going to be taxed. If you're going to slash  the Nation's defense spending, then say so. If  you're going  to support  increased domestic  spending  through  increased  taxation,  then  admit it. If you're going to try to reach the def icit reduction  target,  than do so  through real  budgeting rather than creative accounting.  I made a commitment several weeks ago to  withhold my support of any  increase  in  the  debt ceiling until substantial reforms are made  in this budget process. Budget process reform  has not been achieved and this budget resolu tion  fails  in every other  respect as well.  I  intend  to keep my promise by voting no on  this budget  resolution and  I urge my  col leagues to do the same.  IMMIGRANTS ARE A SOURCE OF  NEW ENERGY RATHER THAN A  BURDEN TO AMERICA  HON. STEPHEN J. SOLARZ  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 23, 1987  ",1987
292,,100,-0.429,142,13,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, much of  the  media discussion about the impact of immigra tion upon our society would  lead one to be lieve  that most newcomers  to our society  impose  further  burdens  upon  our  already  strapped resources. From my experiences, as  the representative of a multiethnic and multira cial urban New York district, newcomers con tinue to infuse our society with greater vitality,  intellectual vigor, business acumen, and cul tural riches which are a net plus to our Nation.  Even those who come to our shores as refu gees in a few years are contributing more to  our economy than they have received in ben efits.  One of the recognized experts in the field of  immigration in the New York area is Mr. Carl  Zuckerman,  the executive vice president of  the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. HIAS is an  outstanding  private  voluntary  organization  which has provided services to literally tens of  thousands of newcomers to the United States  for many decades and an agency which con tinues to develop innovative and cost effective  training and  resettlement programs  for new comers.  Mr.  Zuckerman,  no  stranger  to  anyone  active in humanitarian and philanthropic work,  now serves as the chairman of the Committee  on Migration and Refugee Affairs of  INTER ACTION,  the American Council for Voluntary  International Action, the U.S. umbrella organi zation of voluntary agencies. Carl was recently  interviewed, in his capacity as INTERACTION  spokesman on these issues, by a United Na tion's publication, Refugee Magazine,  to ex plain their views in support of increased immi gration flows to the United States and a more  generous and humane American asylum and  refugee policy.

293,House,100,0.236,168,13,Mr. MYERS of Indiana.," Mr. Chair man, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan  [Mr. PURSELL],  who  is  a  new  and  very  valuable  member of this subcommittee.  ",1987
294,House,100,0.46,207,13,Mr. BARTLETT.," I thank the gentle man for his comment. The gentleman  said it exactly correct. Members will  find plenty of reasons to vote against  this amendment. A Member can find a  reason that, ""Well, I don't like across the-board cuts."" On the next one, a  Member may say, ""Well, I don't like  cuts that make decisions for the Ap propriations Committee."" Others will  talk about the appropriations process  or  committee  jurisdictions. Others  may have a special project in this ap propriations bill.  There is really only one reason to  vote for this, and that is that it is the  only prospect that this House has this  year, this session, for achieving any where close to the deficit targets that  we  set  for ourselves. It is  the only  prospect,  it  is  the last train  that  is  leaving, and we ought  to pass  this  amendment on this appropriations bill  and each subsequent one.  ",1987
295,House,100,-0.354,207,13,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I hope that having  adopted the budget resolution yester day the House will now support the  various appropriation bills which,  in  their sum, will be within the budget.  With all respect to the distinguished  gentlemen  who  are  offering  the  amendment  it  is  very  easy  to  say,  ""What is wrong with cutting another  1 % percent?""  Is there any level of public under taking,  theoretical or otherwise,  at  which somebody could not stand up  and say, ""Well, can't you cut it an other 1 % percent?""  Whether you cut something 10, 20,  30, 40, or 50 percent, someone else  could always stand up and say, ""It's  just another 1 % percent.""  It is appealing, I know,  to suggest  this as being very reasonable. However, we have an Appropriations Com mittee made up of distinguished Mem bers from both sides of the aisle who  have  already  devoted  extraordinary  amounts of time expertise, and effort,  within in the confines of the budget,  coming up with recommendations  to  bring to this floor.  I believe that it does a serious dis service,  to the chairman of this sub committee,  its  ranking  minority  member, the gentleman from Indiana  [Mr. MYERS] and the members and to  the countless hours of work that have  been done by the Appropriations Com mittee  to  suggest  that we  simply  throw away that work by accepting an  across-the-board cut, however small it  may be.  It is appealing, but it is wrong. As  the gentleman  from Wisconsin  [Mr.  OBEY] said earlier on this floor,  it is  destructive of the process. We cannot  expect the members of the Appropria tions Committee to continue perform ing the careful,  long, deliberate, and  hard work they do if they came to this  floor only to be told that they must  meet  another  1or  2-percent  cut  across the board.  It discourages their effort, does not  pay appropriate credit to their work or  knowledge, and is contrary to the kind  of process this House should encour age. I ask Members on both sides of  the aisle  to  show some  respect  for  their colleagues who, having brought  this bill forward, deserve our support.  ",1987
296,House,100,-0.413,233,13,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  opposition to this appropriations bill. In the guise  of a funding bill for energy and water projects,  this bill comes before us with half of its funding  directed to nuclear defense activities. The larg est single line item in the bill is $3.8 billion for  ""nuclear weapons activities"" -an increase of  $131 million over last year's funding. There is  another $279 million for ""nuclear directed ener gy weapons""  to be used  in  the Star Wars  Program; anotller $4 73 million for nuclear test ing; and another $1.8 billion allocation for nucle ar materials production.  In total, there is over  $7 .8 billion dollars in this bill for military-related  activities. That is more than two-thirds of the  money we appropriate for the Energy Depart ment's entire budget.  The Defense Department gets the lions' share  of the money around here already. I don't see  any reason for us to throw still more money into  nuclear weapons production through the Energy  Department.  I agree that the peaceful use of  nuclear power, however misguided it may be,  should be in the jurisdiction of the Department of  Energy. But that does not mean we should hide  money for more and more nuclear weapons in  the appropriation for energy and water. Are we  trying to fool the American people? Let's at least  fore(.,  the Defense Department to pay its own  bills, so we know how much we are actually  throwing away.  The country should know what we are doing  in  this bill: We are appropriating here  today  the  funds  that will pay  for  the MX missile  system and for the destabilizing D-5 missiles  for the Trident submarines. And those deadly,  destabilizing, and devastating weapons all will  be passed under the benign  title of ""energy  and water  development  appropriations.""  I  think that is a fraud on the American people  and I, for one, will not vote for it.  There are some good things in  this bill as  well. There are a number of useful water  projects and funds for peaceful research in a  number of areas,  particularly projects  that  would enhance energy conservation. But we  should also note, as my colleague from Mas sachusetts tells us, that the committee report  accompanying  this bill endorses  the  recent  proposal by  the Nuclear Regulatory Commis sion to change the regulations on evacuation  plans  for nuclear powerplants. Many of us  are very concerned about what would happen  in the event of a nuclear power accident, and  the evacuation plan requirement is one of the  key safeguards against catastrophe. In practi cal terms, the proposed change would make it  easier to open up the Seabrook nuclear plant  on  the border of Massachusetts, without the  approval or participation of  the Governor of  Massachusetts. I am strongly opposed to such  a change in the regulatory requirements, and I  have  joined my colleagues  from Massachu setts in sponsoring a bill that would codify the  present rule.  Mr. Chairman,  in  the  spirit of open and  honest government,  I urge my colleagues  to  vote against  this bill. The engines of death  that are fueled with this appropriation are bad  enough on their own merits. They are doubly  bad when  they are funded deviously through  the energy and water development appropria tion. There are many worthy energy and water  projects that would be legitimate and valuable  investments in  the  future of our country and  that could be funded if we were to reclaim the  nearly $8 billion squandered in this bill on nu clear weapons and military activities.

I also use my  congressional questionnaire as a ba rometer to measure the views of Sixth  District  residents  on major  issues  facing Congress, and use their sound  advice as a valuable yardstick as I cast  votes and propose  initiatives  to best  serve  the people of my State and  Nation.  Those  responding  to my question naire let me know what their budget  priorities are, and strongly supported  action by Congress to reduce and even tually eliminate Federal red ink spend ing levels. Fifty-nine percent support ed an across-the-board  freeze on all  Federal spending, 61 percent support ed efforts to reduce Federal spending  in all areas except Social Security and  defense, while 67 percent supported a  combination of restraint on all Federal  spending and new tax increases.

301,,100,0.391,389,13,Mr. LIGHTFOOT.," Mr. Speaker,  yesterday  this body passed a budget resolution which  makes a sham of the budget process,  is an  abomination of fiscal  integrity and is in direct  opposition  to  the will of  the people of  this  country,  This trillion-dollar turkey fails miserably in at tempting to reach the deficit-reduction targets  that a majority in this .House approved in the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  law.  It contains do mestic spending increases of $4 7 billion over  last  fiscal year. And, unbelievably,  it  raises  taxes by $64 billion over 3 years-$64 billion.  In anticipation of such a budget resolution, I  conducted a districtwide poll  in  Iowa's Fifth  Congressional District and asked my constitu tents  if  they approved of a  tax  increase  to  reduce the deficit. They reply was a resound ing  three  to one margin against a  tax  in crease. Iowans in my district and Americans in  every  congressional  district  in  this  country  have demanded  time and again we put  the  skids on Government spending and higher  taxes. And what do we give them. A $64 bil lion tax increase.  Not only is this a bad budget, it shows bad  judgment. What it doesn't take into account is  that the people stand between this Congress  and this budget, and I guarantee you that it is  their judgment that will prevail.  A SALUTE TO DWIGHT E.

310,Senate,100,0.135,480,13,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, let  me begin by congratulating Senator  BENTSEN on this, the first major legis lation he has brought to the floor as  chairman. Chairman BENTSEN took the  committee through markup promptly  and efficiently on a highly politically  charged  subject. He  skillfully  engi neered several difficult compromises.  He brought the committee closer  to  consensus than I would have thought  possible a few months ago. The 19 to 1  vote for this bill out of committee was  in large measure a recognition of and  compliment to the chairman's leader ship.  Senator BENTSEN's leadership on the  trade issue is not new to this bill. Both  he and Senator DANFORTH-among sev eral other distinguished experts on  the committee-have long been effec tive advocates in bringing to national  attention some of  the serious chal lenges confronting the United States  in the international economic arena.  The United States today does indeed  face major international trade prob lems. Some of our bedrock industries  have lost their edge in international  competition. At the same time, some  of our finest new industries, truly com petitive  businesses,  find  that  they  can't sell overseas. We are running a  trade deficit with more zeros on  it  than anyone could have imagined 10  years ago-or than most economists  would have considered sustainable for  more than a few months.  That huge trade deficit is being fi nanced by massive  borrowing  from  abroad, causing us to stack up debt to  foreigners at the rate of a few billion  dollars a week. This cannot continue  indefinitely. Leaving the next genera tion with a trillion dollars in external  debt is a cruel legacy.  Acknowledging  the existence of a  problem, however, we must not  let  ourselves be panicked into protection ism by grim statistics. On the con trary, it is precisely at this moment  that we should be working hardest to  open world trade, not close it down.  The fact is that, one way or another,  the United States will ultimately have  to pay off its foreign debt with a trade  surplus.  We are already headed in that direc tion. After months of waiting for a  weaker dollar to reduce imports and  increase exports, we  finally  see  the  trade  data  improving. The  figures  show  that,  in  real  terms,  the U.S.  trade deficit peaked in the third quar ter of 1986. Since then, the real mer chandise trade deficit has declined by  more than 15 percent. Measured on a  volume basis, between the third quar ter of 1986 and the first quarter of  1987, exports increased by roughly $15  billion while imports declined by about  $9 billion.  The figures show something else in teresting.  The United  States  has  during this decade experienced explo sive growth in imports; but it is the  flagging exports statistics that tell a  less well-publicized but equally impor tant story. In 1980, imports were 9.4  percent of GNP; in 1986, imports were  9.2 percent of GNP. During the same  period, exports fell from 7 .9 percent of  GNP  to 5.2 percent of GNP. Thus,  while imports have retained a relative ly stable share of GNP, exports have  dropped off dramatically.  So  the challenge  for  the United  States is not to concoct ever-more in genious ways of keeping imports out  of  our markets. Excluding  imports  would  only  lower  our  standard of  living and make our domestic  indus tries less competitive in world markets.  It would also guarantee that our ex ports would find rapidly shrinking op portunities overseas. The U.S.  trade  deficit cannot rationally be solved by  limiting  imports. Rather,  the  chal lenge  for  the United States  is  to  ensure healthy growth in our export  markets.  Can the trade laws achieve that? If  we are  talking about a  fundamental  correction  in  trade  imbalances,  the  honest answer is: No, they cannot. The  enormous U.S. trade deficit is driven  largely by broader factors: high real  interest  rates and  a  strong dollar,  Third World debt,  increased agricul tural self-sufficiency abroad, and so  on. None of these elements can be af fected  significantly by  any  amend ments to any of our trade laws.  But if we are  talking about incre mental  steps  to  expand markets  abroad, to pressure our trading part ners to eliminate unfair trade barriers  and practices, to promote the protec tion of intellectual property rights then  I  believe  the answer  is: Yes,  amending our  trade  laws can help.  That is why I have supported the en actment of trade legislation this year.  The bill we reported out of the Fi nance Committee does contain several  such  positive, market-opening  ele ments. First and foremost, the bill pro vides the President with a mandate for  the recently launched Uruguay round  of multilateral trade talks. Under the  bill,  legislation  implementing  the  fruits of those talks would be consid ered by Congress on a fast-track basis.  Presidents of both parties have con sidered this fast-track authority essen tial for serious negotiations with our  trading partners, who otherwise justi fiably lack confidence that the Presi dent can deliver on any agreements  made at the negotiating table. At the  same time, Congress has an important  constitutionai  role  in  trade  agree ments; so  the bill provides a  ready  mechanism for removal of  the fast track authority should the President  fail  to consult adequately with  the  Congress.  If there is one important step we can  take in this trade legislation, it is to  give a  strong push  to  the Uruguay  round talks. In a host of areas-disci plining agricultural subsidies, promot ing investment, protecting intellectual  property, expanding services  trade these talks hold the best hope for cre ating the kind of international trading  environment  in which  the United  States can prosper again as a great ex porting nation.  Some will say that there is no point  in entering new agreements if the ex isting ones are ignored or ineffective.  There is merit to that point of view.  The issue of how to respond to unfair  foreign  trade  practices-particularly  barriers to U.S. exports-is one with  which the Finance Committee strug gled over  the  last year or more of  hearings and deliberations. We debat ed repeatedly whether it makes sense  to require the President to retaliate  against unfair foreign trade practices.  I must say  I shared the concerns  raised by the administration and most  of our witnesses about truly mandato ry retaliation. It is possible  to con struct many hypotheticals in which re",1987
311,Senate,100,-0.303,545,13,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of S. 490,  the Omnibus  Trade Act of 1987. This legislation rep resents  the culmination of  literally  hundreds of hours of work on the part  of the Committee on Finance. It repre sents the best possible consensus legis lation between two  legitimate points  of view on trade law: those who believe  in free trade and those who believe  our trade laws should be stricter, to  force our Government to retaliate in  unfair trading situations.  Because of the manner in which he  shepharded  this complex  legislation  through  committee,  our  chairman,  Senator LLOYD BENTSEN, has earned  my utmost respect. He managed the  committee's consideration of this legis lation both with fairness and resolve.  Like many of us  in  this Chamber,  Chairman BENTSEN  feels  the time  is  long overdue for substantive, reasona ble changes in our trade law.  There are those in this country who  look at our existing trade law and say,  ""that is how it should be."" The Presi dent should have total discretion  to  determine when, how,  and perhaps  most  importantly,  if  trade sanctions  will be invoked. Those who believe in  so-called free trade maintain that few  restrictions should be placed on Presi dential authority.  Except during the past 20 months,  that clearly was  the position of the  Reagan administration. It has been  said  that  trade was  the administra tion's policy outcast. It was a policy  area which rarely received attention  and  frequently  seemed  incoherent.  Rarely was  trade mentioned  and  seldom did we see Presidential author ity used to address the trade imbal ance  and  barrier  situations  facing  American exports.  Suddenly, some 20 months ago,  it  was as if the Reagan administration  became born again on trade. the tough  trade rhetoric began to flow. We heard  the President and top administration  policymakers begin to take our trade  situation seriously. Like a  tidal wave,  unfair trade practice complaints came  from the White House. All of these ac tions carried the same message: ""We  can get tough when we want to."" Some  of the cynics looked at this new found  trade religion and decided it had more  to do with eminent congressional pas sage of tough trade legislation than  the realization that the United States  was taking a beating in the interna tional trading arena.  Through the pa.st 6 years of  the  Reagan administration, we have seen  both sides of this trade debate demon strated. In the initial years, the ad.min8  istration took the hands off approach  to trade and our trade laws. In the last  year and a half, by nearly all accounts,  this administration has more aggres sively pursued our  trading  interests  and has exercised much of the Presi dential discretionary authority we will  hear discussed during this debate.  Despite the administration realizing  its new-found trade religion, it should  be in the interest of the Senate to ex amine our trade and financial position  has deteriorated over the past 6 years.  The U.S. trade deficit increased nearly  times, from $20 billion in 1980  to  $160 billion in 1986. During this time  period, exports have  remained  rela tively constant.  Imports, however, have increased by  nearly 40 percent in value. This oc cured during a timeframe when world  growth was at extremely low levels.  Since 1985, the United States has re ceived the dubious distinction of being  a debtor nation for the first time in  history. In 1986, U.S. foreign debt hit  a record $264 billion. This means that  U.S. assets abroad were $264 billion  less  than foreign  investment in U.S.  assets, such as corporate stocks and  bonds and U.S. bonds. United States  foreign debt is  twice the size of the  largest  international  Third World  debtor, Brazil.  With these disasterous statistics in  mind we must consider this trade legis lation. Administration  policymakers  tell us that this tough trade legisla tion, as currently written, stands a 5050 chance of being vetoed. We have  just received 31 pages of administra tion objections. This is the same ad ministration that has taken the posi tion that ""the trade deficit should not  cause undue alarm."" I have the utmost  respect for Ambassador Yeutter, the  President's Special Trade Representa tive and the author of this statement.  However, regardless of whatever silver  lining I  look for in our record trade  deficits of the past 6 years, I come up  empty handed.  I could not disagree  more with my good friend, Ambassa dor Yeutter. There is no silver lining  whatsoever in the trade deficit.  I am alarmed when I hear adminis tration policymakers make such state ments. I am alarmed at the tidal wave  of depressing statistics. I am alarmed  when I read list upon list of foreign  trade barriers which seem to go un checked.  I  am alarmed  that absent  this legislation we are without the as surance we need that the next Presi dent will view trade seriously and con sistently and not in the lackadaisical  manner we have seen during the past  5 years.  That is why we are here today. The  legislation before the Senate seeks to  reach a middle ground between protec tionist  trade  law and  totally discre tionary and potentially useless trade  sanctions. It will establish trade law  which ensures that the next adminsitration takes trade as seriously on in auguration day as it does on its third,  fourth, or fifth year.  This  proposal makes  substantive  changes in section 301, the trade law  section used to fight unfair trade bar riers and practices. Even though elimi nation of these trade barriers does not  represent a total solution to the trade  deficit, they are a serious problem for  American trade. Let me share with my  colleagues just a  few of the barriers  our agricultural products encounter in  the international arena:  The European Community inspects  400 United States meat packing plants  and prohibits any of these plants from  shipping meat and pork products to  Europe. The claim: They do not meet  the European inspection requirements.  The result: One South Dakota packing  plant was cited for having a hand op erated drinking fountain and another  chastised for not having a ""fully paved  parking  lot.""  Both  lose  valuable  export markets when they are prohib ited from exporting to the EEC.  American rice farmers are effective ly barred from shipping United States  rice to Japan. In 1985, Japan allowed  only 20,000 tons of rice to be imported.  This represents  less than two-tenths  of 1 percent of its domestic consump tion. These Japanese restrictions are  estimated to cost United States rice  farmers as much as $1.7 billion per  year.  Massive duties levied on agricultural  commodities entering Japan have re sulted in a price differential which has  forced  our  products  out  of  that  market. A New York prime steak cost ing $5.29 per pound  in Washington  costs $30 per pound in Tokyo after all  governmental duties are assessed.  This bill requires the President to  use all available trade powers against  these unfair foreign  trade practices.  Except in cases where a greater na tional interest overrides, it mandates  the President  take action  to break  down unfair foreign trade barriers.  The  administration must  identify  unfair trade barriers and initiate ac tions which  seek  to  eliminate  all  unfair trade barriers. In some cases,  the President  is  required  to  initiate  trade remedies rather than waiting for  a request from the effected industry.  Strict time limits are placed on Presi dential action.  This legislation also makes substan tive changes in the treatment of exces sive but fairly-traded imports. In cases  where fairly traded imports are flood ing the U.S. market, causing harm to a  domestic industry, the President is re quired to provide import relief in cer tain  circumstances. The  action  re quired in this change is  intended to  position the industry to compete with  imports on an even basis after the  import relief is terminated.  9Hl59 0-89-18 (Pt. 13)  ",1987
312,,100,-0.202,636,13,Mr. HATCHER.," Mr. Speaker,  I have  intro duced H.R. 2569, the Pesticide Price Competi tion Act, which will establish generic pesticide  registration, stimulate increased competition in  the pesticide industry, and tower the price of  pesticides  for  farmers,  ranchers, users, and  consumers across  this country. This  legisla tion is identical to S. 7 46, a companion bill in troduced  in  the Senate by Senators NANCY  KASSEBAUM and AL GORE.  The purpose of this legislation is twofold: to  lower the  farmer's cost of production by re ducing the cost of pesticides, and to reduce  the cost of nonagricultural products that con sumers buy. This measure could save farmers  from $400 million to $500 million per year for  at least the next 5 years on agricultural pesti cides alone. Consumers could save additional  millions on nonagricultural products.  As we look across our land, we discover an  agricultural and rural economy suffering from  problems-increasing  costs  of  production,  growing debts, obtaining adequate credit, de clining prices  for crops-and we  need  to  move forward to address these concerns. One  way  to help  the  farmer meet  the  increasing  costs of production is to amend the pesticide  legislation,  the Federal  Insecticide, Fungicide  and Rodenticide Act [FIFRA]. This would help  the farmer immeasurably, without any cost to  the Government.  According to recent figures in the Economic  Indicators of the Farm Sector, Cost of Produc tion, 1985, prepared by the U.S. Department  of Agriculture [USDA], pesticides average be tween 1 O and 35 percent of  farmers' cash  variable expenses-seed, fertilizer, chemicals,  hired labor, and so forth. Farmers across this  country apply agricultural pesticides  to  their  crops, and these costs clearly comprise a sig nificant percentage of their annual expenses.  In the southeastern United States, farmers  face a tremendous challenge. Cotton farmers  across the Nation spend an average of $45  per acre for chemicals, while these farmers in  the Southeast use $96 of pesticides per acre.  Peanut  farmers average $80 per acre  for  chemicals, but Southeastern peanut  farmers  average close to $95 per acre, and Virginia  and North Carolina farmers average $89 per  acre. Like  the Hawaiian sugarcane growers  and Texan sugar beet producers, Southeast ern  farmers pay a disproportionate share of  their cost of production on agricultural chemi cals.  However, we can  lower the price of pesti cides,  thereby reducing  the  farmer's cost of  production, if we encourage the development  of generic pesticides. In fact, it may be possi ble to reduce the price of pesticides by 1 O to  20 percent or more. One way to reduce these  prices is to eliminate the data compensation  provision of FIFRA. When generic pesticide  producers enter the market following the expi ration of a patent, they generally capture only  1 O to 20 percent of the existing market. Yet,  ",1987

June 25, 1987  The church was organized on May 12, 1918  and one of their early places of worship was  815 North Beaumont. The first congregation  was composed of 30 members.  In 1936,  the church called  the Reverend  E.R. Williams to the pastorate and the mem bership has continuously grown to its present  enrollment of over 1,300.  In  1943, Pilgrim Rest Missionary Baptist  Church moved  to 2900 Gamble and  later  added an educational building  to accommo date their many young people. Now after 19  years  they are  taking another giant step  to  keep their membership and many friends com fortable. The new properties at 1341  to 1359  were purchased for worship and educational  purposes. The new church and educational  buildings are completely air-conditioned and  equipped with modern heating facilities. Two  of  the buildings will be used  for residential  quarters.

INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO  GRANT A FEDERAI., CHARTER  FOR  THE AMERICAN  PHILA TELIC SOCIETY  HON. SID MORRISON  OF WASHINGTON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 25, 1987  ",1987
315,,100,0.153,662,13,Mr. MORRISON of Washington.," Mr. Speak er, today I am introducing, along with nine of  my distinguished colleagues.  legislation  that  would grant a Federal charter to the American  Philatelic Society.  The American Philatelic Society  is a non profit corporation headquartered in State Col lege, PA.  It  is  the  largest organization of  stamp collectors in  the United States, with a  current membership of over 55,000 members.  Most importantly, the society is celebrating its  1 OOth anniversary as a national organization.  This has been  the result of the  long hours  spent by many devoted members dedicated to  making  the American Philatelic Society  the  prestigious organization we know today.  I strongly believe that recognizing the Amer ican Philatelic Society by granting it a Federal  charter would be most appropriate in this year  that we are reflecting on America's great his tory founded in our Constitution. Stamps have  played a role all along by opening a window  on America's natural landscape, her great his torical figures, and on the accomplishments of  her citizens in science, commerce, social serv ice, and  the arts. These efforts by our Na tion's stamp collectors have helped the United  States relive its rapidly changing and eventful  history.  I am pleased  to sponsor  this  legislation  which will help us give the appropriate recog nition  to  the many stamp collectors  in our  communities for their accomplishments. I urge  my colleagues  to  join us  in support of  this  measure by adding  their names as cospon sors.  ",1987

The Dornan amendment to the  District of Columbia appropriations bill would  prevent the District from using  locally raised  funds  to provide abortions  to women who  reside in the District of Columbia without ex ception even in cases of rape or life endan germent.  This amendment would deny the District of  Columbia  that which every other citizen  in  America is guaranteed: The right to determine  their local government and its policies.  Congress must uphold the principle of self  determination for the residents of the District  of Columbia. The Supreme Court recently de fined those areas of government that are re served  for State and  local decisionmaking:  Police and  fire protection, sanitation, parks  and  recreation, and public health. By voting  for this amendment. we are again denying the  people of the District of Columbia their consti tutional right to self-determination.  The District is not in violation of the Hyde  amendment which  prohibits Federal  funds  from being used to perform abortions. In fact,  there is a clause in H.R. 2713 that prohibits  Federal funds from being used for such pur poses. That is not the issue here. The issue is  self determination and equal treatment. I urge  you to vote against this amendment.  ",1987
317,House,100,0.16,688,13,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr.  Chairman, I rise in strong support of  the Doman amendment and commend  my colleague from Calif omia for his  concern and compassion for children  and  their mothers  in offering  this  today.  A  similar amendment was offered  last year and the year before, both  were  adopted  but  regrettably  the  amendment didn't make its way into  law. With the strong backing of the  President this year I hope we will be  more fortunate this time around.  The  issue before  this body  today,  Mr. Chairman, is simply whether or  not abortion on demand will be payed  for with public funds.  Members should know and should be  fully aware that the current language  contained in H.R. 2713 may look good  to some on the surface but has been  totally ineffective and inadequate and  has not stopped public funding for a  single abortion. Not even one!  The so-called antiabortion language  in the bill is so defective that it has  permitted  taxpayer  subsidized  abor tion on demand in the District of Co lumbia. Even D.C. government offi cials admit this point. In an article in  the Philadelphia Inquirer, August 1,  1985, Elizabeth Reveal, the District of  Columbia's budget director at the time  ""confirmed that the District's govern ment has a policy of funding abortion  on demand and does not attempt to  determine  the circumstances of  the  pregnancy.    The Doman  amendment  reforms  that policy Mr. Chairman and brings  the D.C. appropriations bill  in con formance with Federal policy.  I would point out to members of the  committee that in 1985 according to a  D.C. government report, 10,357 abor tions on demand were payed for in the  District  of  Columbia with  public  funds-10,357 children lost their lives  in that year alone and Congress per mitted the taxpayer to foot the bill.  Mr. Chairman. let no one here today  seek  to diminish or gloss over  the  gruesome reality of abortion. Rather  let us allow ourselves to be sensitive to  the excessive and wanton loss of life of  children in the District.

It is time to do what we can, careful ly. thinking about the wording and the  message we send; for what purpose is  there in an amendment or in a resolu tion like this before the Senate in the  first place? What are we  really at tempting to do? Not just to spend a  Friday afternoon enjoying beating up  on a  foreign dictator.

320,,100,-0.304,935,13,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, the more things  seem  to change  in South Korea,  the more  they stay the same.  Earlier  this week,  President Chun  had  agreed to make three important concessions  to the demonstrators in his country calling for  democracy.  He would meet  opposition  leader,  Kim  Young Sam, for the first time ever. He would  release Kim Dae-Jung  from his 53d house  arrest in  the  last 2 years, and he would re lease the hundreds of other protesters impris oned since June 10.  As the clouds of tear gas cleared away from  downtown Seoul, it seemed as if encouraging  signs were  starting  to appear  through  the  haze.  But  today  it  is clear  that President Chun  does not  intend  to move toward democracy  after all.  After only 24 hours of freedom, Kim Dae Jung is under house arrest once more. Two  days after President Chun's meeting with Kim  Young-Sam,  Kim  Young-Sam  himself was  forced  into a police car and placed under  house arrest. And  rather  than  releasing, as  promised,  the  hundreds  of  demonstrators  being held since June 10,  this morning  the  Chun  regime has placed over a  thousand  more people into its jails.  Two days ago, President Chun said that the  future security of South Korea is in a precari ous  situation. President Chun  understands  that much. But President Chun does not seem  to understand  that South Korea will not be  secure  if  its people are not  free. President  Chun does not seem  to understand that de mocracy  is  the best guarantee of security.  President Chun does not seem to understand  how deeply his people want democracy.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is  critical  that President  Chun  allow Democracy  to  grow  in South  Korea.  It is critical that President Chun stop  moving in the opposite direction toward mar tial law.  It is time for some real change after  all in South Korea.  TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM HELLMAN  HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 26, 1987  ",1987

Maryland Transportation Secretary William  Hellman  first distinguished himself during his  years of dedicated service with Mayor William  Donald Schaefer and  the city of Baltimore  from 1979-83.  In 1984, Bill  joined the State  Government as Secretary of Transportation. A  few weeks ago, Bill announced that he would  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  leave public life to return to his former job in  the private sector.  Bill Hellman's insight, leadership, and politi cal savvy,  time and again, came through for  the State. He set a tone and charted a course  for  the State's Transportation Department  that, hopefully, will be a legacy for others to  follow. His wisdom and expertise will be sorely  missed by  the State but  I'm sure  they will  serve him well in his new position.  Maryland's loss is definitely the private sec tor's gain.  I would  like to thank Bill Hellman  for his years of dedicated public service, and  wish him well in his new life.  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. DAVID E.

323,,100,0.103,935,13,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to take this opportunity to call for a renewed  emphasis in Congress for passing  legislation  to end the liability insurance crisis now facing  small businesses and manufacturers across  the country.  The small business sector in our country manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers-are  being crushed under the weight of our current  liability tort system. For too many enterprises  the cost of doing business  in America  is  simply too expensive.  Last year businesses paid out a  total of  $116 billion in liability tort claims. Injured con sumers  received  far  less  than half of  that  amount. Even if you aren't opposed to the ex orbitant amounts being paid out in successful  liability claims, you've got to wonder about the  amounts being paid out for middleman han dling charges.  Very few of us would want to see a system  which made  it difficult for injured consumers  to press their legitimate injury claims against a  liable party. What we should all like to see is a  system which is fair and just without being de bilitating  to our entire nationwide business  community.  17907  We have the framework for such a system  in the form of H.R. 1115, the Uniform Product  Safety Act of 1987. This bill goes right to the  heart of  the  liability crisis  facing America's  businesses while it would actually accelerate  the emphasis on protecting consumers from  dangerous products.  The Uniform Product Safety Act of 1987, as  the title implies, would establish uniform safety  standards for products sold in interstate com merce. By doing so, it would also promote in creased safety in the manufacture and use of  these products.  Also,  insurers would be allowed  to base  their rates for product liability insurance on a  uniform and predictable standard. Rates now  are set against a backdrop of extremely inflat ed tort claim settlements which often collect  from parties  liable only  in  the most remote  sense.  Finally, States would be allowed to develop  alternative methods for settling product liability  disputes  in a way  that will  reduce costs  to  both businesses and consumers. New meth ods could be  instituted without  threatening  consumer power to win just settlements.  Mr. Speaker,  today many businesses face  the worst dilemma; that is the choice between  simply going without any  liability  insurance  coverage at all, or laying off workers, closing  plants, and skimping on efforts toward greater  innovation  just  to afford  insurance-all  the  while hoping that their premiums won't double  or triple again next year.  Of course, we are all very concerned with  finding new ways to help our businesses win  back their competitive edge. Here is a way we  can begin to help; here is a way we can bring  down the cost of doing business in America,  and do so by improving consumer protection  and the consumer's right to seek just compen sation for damages.  Mr. Speaker,  I encourage all of my col leagues to get behind this issue with full force.  Let's give America a tort system that is pro tective for the consumer without bankrupting  our businesses.

324,,100,0.07,935,13,Mr. FISH.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise to announce  to  this chamber  the  175th anniversary of  Putnam County, NY. Originally part of Dut chess County, Putnam was separated by the  New York State Legislature on June 12, 1812.  Putnam County  is small  in  size,  the  third  smallest county in the State, but it is favored  by rolling hills, clear lakes and streams and  lush greenery that exists to this day.  It is only 50 miles north of New York City  and is bounded by the Hudson River on the  west and Connecticut  to  the east. Putnam  County is one of the most beautiful sections  of  the Hudson River, where  the majestic  Hudson Highlands rise from the river's edge.  This section of  the Hudson, dominated by  West point on  the east shore, has  long  in spired painters with its scenic beauty.  ",1987

329,,100,-0.374,987,13,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr.  President,  last  night,  the  3-week  long  conference  committee on the urgent supplemental  appropriation for fiscal year 1987 fi nally concluded.  As a Senator from a State with im portant farm interests, and as chair man of the Agriculture Committee, I  am relieved that at last Congress will  reauthorize Commodity Credit Cor portation payments. I have been re ceiving calls almost daily from Ver mont farmers suffering because of de layed CCC payments. Senators from  all  farm States have been hearing  from home,  too.  It was outrageous  that the conference lasted so long.  Mr. President, the Senate should be  aware that the supplemental confer ence dragged on not because  there  were time consuming compromises to  be worked out on funding levels. The  delay was deliberate and  it was be cause  the  bill  contained  language  which would have required the United  States to comply once again with key  numerical  limits  in  the  SALT  II  treaty. Opponents of this arms control  provision prolonged  the conference,  using  the pain of  farmers  to build  pressure on SALT supporters to agree  to withdraw  the  SALT  provision.  Knowing that we supporters of restor ing U.S. observance of  these SALT  limits are in a majority in the Senate,  determined  SALT  opponents  used  these tactics to prevent a vote. They  know that if we can just get the SALT  issue to a vote on the floor, we will  win. So they filibuster the defense au thorization bill, deliberately delay the  supplemental conference, and threat en  to  filibuster  any bill where we  might offer our SALT amendment.  Apparently, any tactic is fair game to  prevent  the Senate  from  taking  a  stand on this arms control issue.  Well, Mr. President, this Senator is  just as determined  that the Senate  will vote on whether the United States  should scrap the only limits still on  Soviet strategic missiles and bombers  aimed at our cities and towns. Many  bills are coming up besides the defense  authorization bill, which  the other  side of the aisle is blocking with a fili buster. The Senate  is not going  to  duck this critical arms control issue  this year. Senators are going to have  to stand up and be counted on wheth er they agree with President Reagan's  decision to stop abiding by the SALT  numerical controls.  THE SUPREME COURT  NOMINATION  ",1987
330,,100,0.322,987,13,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, on a Sat urday 198 years ago today, during the  first  session of  the  first Congress,  Members of  the Senate and House  were holding  their  first  conference  committee meeting.  Conference committees had not been  needed in the single-body legislature  that had met under the Article of Con federation. But when the Constitution  created two Houses of Congress, con ferences became necessary to resolve  the differences in the bills passed by  each Chamber.  On May 29, 1789,  the Senate re ceived  from  the House  a  ""tonnage  act,""  imposing  duties  on  imported  goods. The Senate then proceeded to  enact  some 40  amendments  to  the  House bill, changing duties on a varie ty of items ranging from tea and play ing cards to shoes and gunpowder. On  June 15, the House responded by ac cepting half of the Senate's amend ments. The Senate debated again, this  time agreeing to drop most of the dis puted items, but insisting that eight of  its  amendments  be  retained.  The  House was willing to accept two more  ",1987
331,House,100,-0.465,1000,13,Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York.," Mr. Speak er, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2616,  the Veterans' Administration Health Care Pro grams Act of 1987. Our veterans have sacri ficed a great deal  for this Nation. We must  now honor the commitment we made to pro vide them with needed health care.  This bill would provide outpatient care  for  veterans disabled in war, former prisoners of  war, and low-income veterans. It would enable  the VA  to provide  incentives to ensure  that  quality nurses, pharmacists, and other needed  professionals are available  to provide  that  care.  Mr. Speaker, while I rise in support of H.R.  2616, it is my strong hope that passage of this  legislation will not be injurious to the Veterans'  Outreach Center, Inc., which is located in my  District in Rochester, NY. The Veterans' Out reach Center  is a not-for-profit, community based organization, which was established in  1973. The center served as a model for the  VA Vet-Center Program which was initiated in  1979. It has helped thousands of Vietnam-era  veterans with readjustment problems, utilizing  contracts with  the Veterans' Administration  and the great State of New York. The Veter ans' Outreach Center receives additional sup port from foundations, businesses, and individ uals in our community.  The Veterans' Outreach Center and the VA  Vet Center have worked cooperatively in our  community  since 1986, when  the VA Vet  Center was first established in our community.  It is my hope that both initiatives can continue  to work together and serve Vietnam-era veter ans under  the  readjustment counseling pro gram.  ",1987

333,House,100,-0.204,1013,13,Mr. GORDON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  thank the chairman of the National Parks and  Public  lands Subcommittee, BRUCE VENTO,  for his guidance and support in bringing H.R.  1994 to the floor today. If it weren't for Chairman VENTO'S recognition of the bill's national  importance, it would never have come to the  floor in such an expeditious manner with such  unanimous support.  Briefly, H.R. 1994 directs the Park Service  to stabilize and historically interpret Fortress  Rosecrans,  the world's  largest earthen  for tress, and construct a trail connecting Stones  River National Battlefield and  the  fortress  while intersecting two outlying parcels of land  already included in the park.  My hometown of Murfreesboro, TN, was the  site of one of the Civil War's major battles.  From December 31, 1862, through January 2,  1863, the Union and Confederate Armies, with  the combined strength of more  than 81,000  men, clashed  in one of  the war's bloodiest  battles. As a result of the Union's victory in  the Battle of Stones River, Union forces were  able to construct Fortress Rosecrans.  The Union Army used the fortress as an ar mament and supply depot  for  their march  south. The  fortress was designed  to house  more than 55,000 troops and maintain a 2to  3-month supply of food and armaments.  Major developments in the battle took place  on the land which lies adjacent to, but is not  currently included, in the national military park.  In order to preserve the historical integrity of  this land and preserve the significance of the  battle which led to the Union's eventual victo ry in the War Between the States, H.R. 1994  expands the boundaries of the existing park  by 53 acres and incorporates Fortress Rose crans into the boundaries of the park.  Mr. Speaker, time is of the essence. Nash ville is one of the fastest growing metropolitan  areas  in  the Southeast. Murfreesboro  is a  suburb of Nashville which is experiencing the  same rate of growth.  Three thousand families move to the Mur freesboro  area  annually. Since  1983,  the  number of  building  permits  for  residential  dwellings has  tripled.  I am  proud of  this  growth. Yet, I am concerned at the same time.  We need controlled growth which preserves  the historical integrity of the Stones River Na tional Battlefield.  Unfortunately, instead of attempting  to ac quire all the land that is necessary to preserve  the historic value of the Stones River Battle, I  am faced with the task of securing land that is  still free from development.  In 1980,  the Park Service's general man agement plan  targeted 284 acres  to be ac quired and  included in  the national park. By  1984 the number of available acres had dimin ished to 84. Last month the Park Service con ducted another  land appraisal and  informed  me that we have lost another 30 acres to de velopment. In all, 231 acres of historically sig nificant  land has been subject  to develop ment.  H.R. 1994  initiates a unique arrangement  between the Park Service and the city of Mur freesboro.  In  return  for  the Park Service's  technical expertise in stabilizing and preserv ing Fortress Rosecrans and constructing the  trail, the city has agreed to take all manage ment, maintenance, and financial responsibil ities after  the Park Service has completed  their work. It is important to point out that the  citizens of Murfreesboro are waking in coordi nation with  the Federal Government to pre serve national history.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1994 is important to pre serving a section of American history. The  more than 200,000 visitors who visit Stones  River annually would not only be exposed to  the historic battlefield, but, additionally, visitors  will be able  to explore one of  the  largest  earthen forts still partially intact in the United  States.

334,House,100,0.348,1078,13,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Chair . man, reclaiming my time, I might say  in response to my colleague's amend ments that I agree with part of his  amendments, but I am not sure I agree  with the entire block, although if I  had the kind of authority I would wish  for  around here,  I  certainly would  move in the direction of much of that  which the gentleman  is  recommend ing.  In part, our problem is frustration  with a process that is well established.  Much of the expenditure the gentle man has mentioned by way of his  amendments comes  to us by way of  the House Administration Committee  for automatic assumptions of appro priation. That would not suggest, how ever, that the committee as well as the  House has not tried to restrain itself.  The gentleman indicated that from  the day he and I arrived on the floor  in 1979 we began holding back on in creases in numbers of personnel, par ticularly in our personal staffs. Indeed  we may note in the report that the  agencies of the legislative branch re quested funding for 216 new positions  for fiscal year 1988. Five have been al lowed. Further, the recommendations  are included in the bill, and the actions of  the agencies will  result  in  some 55 positions under the staffing  level  currently  authorized  in  fiscal  year 1987.  We are attempting to go in the right  direction. But indeed I share with the  gentleman his frustration about this  process. We started from  the wrong  plateau in 1979. For many, many years  particularly our committee staffs were  at levels that should not in my judg ment have been allowed. Nonetheless,  we should deal with the process where  we find ourselves in the beginning. In  this  case  I  feel  the  subcommittee  chairman has been most diligent in at tempting to hold back  those  in the  House  and outside  the House who  would expand our spending, particu larly our personnel spending.

Mr. Chairman, I am not going to say  that I am not going to take the 5 min utes, because the debate has raised a  number of issues.  One of the things that bothers me is  that we  are  reconstructing history.  There  is  the  suggestion  that  the  Speaker did this in order to protect  Members because Members were being  challenged on the floor as if they were  here when  they were not here  to  defend themselves.  In fact, it is a myth that has been  created. There is not one example that  that did occur.  With respect to the words that were  stated at that time, they were quotes  of Members from the RECORD.

337,House,100,0.3,1104,13,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words. I  rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to com pliment the chairman and the ranking  member of the Appropriations Com mittee for cutting the Architect's re quest down substantially.  You know, tonight if we were look ing here for a modest increase to buy  some scrubbing brushes and brooms, I  think all of us who have  to live  in  these filthy buildings would support it.  Even the front of the Capitol does not  get hosed down on weekends, it looks  like. There is always mud on the steps  and the place really looks rotten; but I  would suggest that if you look careful ly at that budget that you are going to  find  that  it  is not more  cleaning  people. It is not more scrubbing brush es and it is not more brooms that is  causing the increase.  I think we need only to look out the  front door, where  I  understand we  spent $400,000 on flower pots. Look at  the west side of the Capitol, if we want  to take the word of the Architect.  Now, it is very nice to find that the  Architect is right now coming in $27  million below the budget on the West  Front reconstruction of the Capitol,  but I would like to remind this com mittee that it was the Architect who  came in with such a bloated figure and  he came  in with only one  thing in  mind, and that is so we could create an  extension on the Capitol, which we  soundly defeated and went ahead with  the reconstruction.  We in the Congress have to depend  upon the people in the administration  and the Architect, as they are in man agement and they are in a better posi tion to make judgments; but we also  must remember  the history. In  this  situation, history tells us that the Ar chitect comes  in with a very  large  budget, which I am not sure he even  believes himself.  While I am on this matter, I would  like to ask either the ranking member  or the chairman of the committee ex actly what will happen to the funds  that are saved on the reconstruction  of the west front of the Capitol. Will  they come back to the Treasury or will  they go to other projects on the Cap itol grounds?  ",1987

339,,100,-0.341,1143,13,Mr. PRICE of North Carolina.," Mr. Speaker, I  will soon introduce legislation which will proEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  vide consumers with better information about  home equity  loans. Home equity loans pose  unique disclosure problems for current truth in-lending  law and my bill will ensure  that  home equity loans are subject to disclosures  similar to those of other mortgage products so  that consumers have the ability to make pru dent credit decisions. It will also include provi sions to stop misleading advertising which has  been used by some  financial  institutions  in  promoting this new type of credit. I am submit ting for the RECORD a recent Newsweek arti cle by Jane Bryant Quinn which documents  the rising popularity of home equity loans, out lines their potential benefits and dangers, and  suggests some guidelines that will help con sumers make more informed decisions.  YOUR GUIDE TO HOME EQUITIES  <By Jane Bryant Quinn>  Should you or shouldn't you open a home equity line of credit? At first glance, it looks  like  the deal of the decade:  low  interest  rates,  low monthly  payments,  flexible  terms,  tax deductions. A lot of borrowers  truly cannot do any better.  Yet,  in one of  those  ironies  typical of  banking, home-equity credit lines are per fect only for people who don't really need  them-and pure poison for people who do.  In a nutshell, this loan is a second mort gage against your house. But you don't  borrow all the money at once. Instead, the  bank gives you a  large line of credit-the  amount depending on your income, the size  of your first mortgage and the value of your  house.  To take out a loan against your credit line,  you merely write a check or put down a spe cial credit card. Repayment schedules are  incredibly loose, often lasting 20 years or  more. Many borrowers will simply carry  their loans until the house is sold and repay  the principal then.  SIZE OF THE PRINT  Much of the advertising for home-equity  lines of credit has also been incredibly loose,  with the relevance of the information in versely proportional to the size of the print.  Here's what a borrower needs to know:  1. The true cost. Most lenders charge clos ing costs just as they would on any other  mortgage, although  that varies by state.  There may be origination fees of 1 to 3 per cent and annual fees of $15  to $100. All  these charges run up the effective interest  rate, says Prof. Richard Morse of Kansas  State University <chart>-so much so that  other types of loans may actually be cheap er. The best home-equity lines carry no, or  low, upfront fees.  2. How much money you need right now.  Most borrowers open the largest credit line  possible, on  the assumption that it can't  hurt. But it can hurt, in two ways:  First, your closing costs depend on the size  of the credit line; the larger the line, the  more you pay. If you then borrow only a  small amount of money, your effective in terest rate snowballs. Take, for example, a  $10,000 loan against a $75,000 credit line at  Chemical Bank. In New York <where fees  are high), the five-year interest rate would  be 19.5 percent, Morse says. Second, on your  credit history,  the  total amount of your  credit line is treated as an outstanding loan,  even  if you haven't borrowed against  it.  That could keep you from getting a lower cost loan somewhere else.  3. Whether you can handle a big variable rate loan. A majority of credit lines float  with the prime lending rate-running from  18115  .5 to 3 percentage points higher. If interest  rates rise, so do your payments.  As a practical matter, the cost of a rate  rise might be small. On a $15,000  loan, a  jump from 10 to 15 percent might add only  $44 to your monthly payments <if you're re paying on a 10-year schedule>. You'll be  squeezed a  little harder, however,  if your  first mortgage also carries a variable rate.  And you'll hate it, if inflation goes to 20 per cent.  To protect you from payment shock, a few  lenders are putting caps on  their  rates.  Some promise that you'll pay no more than  an extra 2 to 5 percentage points over five  years; some rates stop rising at 16 to 20 per cent. And then there's Marine Midland in  New York. Under  its ""cap,"" you can be  charged an extra 4 percentage points a  year-not much inflation protection there.  Here and there, you'll see credit lines with  fixed interest rates. A Wells Fargo Credit  Corp., headquarters in Scottsdale, Ariz., you  might pay 12. 75 percent plus closing costs.  But the guarantee lasts only for five years.  After that, you have to worry about rising  rates all over again.  4. How fast you repay. Lenders love all  borrowers who  repay  slowly-because  it  means you'll pay them more. For the first  five to 10 years, you may have to pony up  only the interest owed. After that, the prin cipal falls due and you'll probably have to  refinance <watch  the bankers  rub  their  hands in glee>. When loans are amortized,  your minimum payments might cover only a  few dollars of principal every month, creat ing a nearly perpetual debt. To avoid these  costs, you must make larger payments than  required.  I love good home-equity lines for borrow ers who: repay quickly; have cash reserves  to eliminate the loan if interest rates get too  high; substitute home-equity borrowing for  more expensive credit cards; have incomes  secure enough  to cover  rising payments.  ""Money is money,"" says David Wyss of Data  Resources, Inc. ""Borrow as cheaply as you  can.""  But I hate them for borrowers who: can  afford only  the minimum payments <be cause  they're living beyond their means>;  are adding to debt rather than substituting  one form of borrowing for another; have un certain earnings; spend more than 35 per cent of their income repaying loans.  The squeezed middle class will be the most  tempted by credit lines, even though the tax  deductions are more limited than the ads  imply <check  this out before borrowing).  What they like most is the idea of stretch ing out consumer debt over 20 years. But  look at it this way: if you can't pay off your  regular credit cards, everyone gets mad. If  you can't repay your credit line, they fore close.  THE REAL COST OF CREDIT  The  true  interest  rate on home-equity  loans  is higher than you  think, counting  fees  and closing costs. Here's what  you  might pay for $10,000 borrowed against a  $25,000  line of  credit,  assuming current  rates. Fees vary, depending on your state.

On Tuesday, July 7, 1987, Jim will step down  from his tour of office.  Jim Santangelo has worked unselfishly  to  help  the community of Downey  through his  profound dedication to local government and  civic activities. A resident of Downey for over  22 years, Jim taught for 13 years at Downey  Adult School. He is a member of Our Lady of  Perpetual Health Catholic Church,  and  his  sense  for civic affairs  led him  to serve as  president of the Rotary Club of Downey,  the  Downey Board of Realtors,  the South Gate  Jaycees, and UNICO, an  Italian American or ganization.  Jim  is  also  a  fourth  degree  member of the Knights of Columbus, and has  served on  the  traffic committee  in Downey,  and  the Downey Health and Environmental  Sanitation Committee.  Currently, Jim  is finishing his third year on  the city council and completing a year term as  mayor. During his term as mayor, Jim initiated  the Keep Downey Beautiful Project. This was  a campaign  to clean-up,  fix-up, and paint-up  Downey during the spring of 1987.  Mr. Speaker,  Jim Santangelo  has  done  much over  the years  in helping make  the  Downey area such a special place to live and  work. His commitment  to his community will  never go unnoticed. My wife, Lee, join8 me in  congratulating Jim on his achievements, and  we wish him, his wife, Rosell, his children,  James, Robert, and Lisa Hanggie, his grand child, Brianne, and his mother, Leona, suc cess and happiness in their future.  COMANDANTE REAGAN  HON. MATTHEW F. McHUGH  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 30, 1987  ",1987
344,,100,-0.306,1416,13,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, a provision of  the  supplemental  appropriations  bill would  prohibit  the Minerals Management Service  from  implementing product valuation guide lines before November 1, 1987. This prohibi tion covers valuation regulations for coal, oil,  and natural gas including NTL-5.  Today,  I wish to address the status of, and  outlook  for,  the MMS Royalty Management  Program.  Within the Department of Interior, MMS has  the fiduciary responsibility of managing reve nues from Federal and Indian mineral leases.  Annual revenues amassed from  this program  approach $6 billion. Of this annual total, on shore Federal mineral  leases account for an  income of $1.1 billion collected  through bo nuses, rents, and  royalties. However, MMS'  handling of  royalty payments  from onshore  leases especially have been beset by prob lems and embroiled  in controversy  involving  the States, Indian tribes, the minerals industry,  and agencies of the Department.  Allegations  run  rampant  that MMS  has  failed to collect the full amount of royalty due  to the Federal Government, and subsequently  to  the States and  tribes. These underpay ments by  lessees, usually  industry, can be  traced to the lack of definitive valuation guide lines. Since the royalty is calculated in part by  the value of  the product,  fair and equitable  guidelines on determining  the value of  the  product are essential for full royalty payments.  After several years, MMS finally issued pro posed valuation regulations for coal and oil on  January 15, 1987, and gas on February 13,  1987. Needless to say, this action has raised  a hue and cry from the States and tribes, who  believe  these  regulations will  result  in  lower  royalty payments, and the industry, which be lieves  these  regulations will  result  in higher  royalty payments.  As if this situation were not enough, there is  another saga paralleling and  intersecting  the  valuation  regulations  issue. This  issue con cerns the proposed retroactive cancellation of  Notice to Lessees-No. 5, commonly known  as NTL-5. NTL-5 is a directive issued to gas  lessees during a period of rising gas prices,  1977-82 and  directed  the gas  industry  to  value gas at either the FERG ceiling price or  the contract price. However, gas prices began  to fall  in 1982, and it soon became apparent  that NTL-5 would  require gas producers  to  pay  royalty  on  a  phantom  value.  NTL-5  should have been canceled  then and  there,  but for some esoteric reason known only to  bureaucrats,  it was not until July 25, 1986,  when MMS  issued a final notice stating  that  NTL-5 would be canceled prospectively. MMS  even  included several  reasons why NTL-5  should not be canceled retroactively. This was  all well and good until January 15, 1987, when  MMS again proposed  to retroactively cancel  NTL-5. The upshot of a retroactive cancella tion of NTL-5 would be that industry overpayJune 30, 1987  ments would potentially have to be recouped  from the States and tribes. Somehow, I find it  difficult to picture a company such as Exxon  demanding repayment from ""Mr. Indian Allot tee"" whose very subsistence  is dependent  upon revenue from his lease.  Because these valuation regulations are so  important for all concerned parties,  the Sub committee on Mining and Natural Resources  held oversight hearings on April 28 and 30,  1987. Representatives of State governments,  Indian tribes, and the coal, oil, and gas indus tries presented their views concerning the pro posed valuation regulations and the proposed  retroactive cancellation of NTL-5.  In dealing with MMS' management style  over the years, I have become aware of many  instances of bureaucratic shenanigans, which  seem to be par for the MMS course. But the  agency double bogeyed when  it became ap parent that  it had actually instructed compa nies to ignore NTL-5 and only pay royalty on  the actual price obtained. This smacks of gov ernment disregard of its own Federal regula tion, and succinctly epitomizes  the  level of  confusion and misunderstanding within  this  monetarily important program.  Pursuant to  these  informative and  respon sive hearings,  Interior Committee Chairman  UDALL, Ranking Minority Member DON YOUNG,  Subcommittee  Ranking  Minority  Member  LARRY CRAIG and I sent a joint letter on May  1, 1987,  to Secretary Hodel  requesting  that  final product valuation regulations not be pro mulgated until Congress had had the time to  review the hearing records and complete our  investigations. We requested that implementa tion of  these  regulations be postponed until  September 30, 1987. We also sent a similar  letter on April 30, 1987' to SIDNEY y ATES, the  distinguished chairman of the Committee on  Appropriations' Subcommittee on  Interior. We  requested  that  the supplemental appropria tions bill  for  Interior  include  language which  would postpone until September 30,  1987,  MMS' proposals to retroactively cancel NTL-5  and to implement the proposed product valu ation guidelines.  As  it stands now,  Interior Committee staff  and the General Accounting Office are work ing  to  review and assess th~ status of  the  MMS Royalty Management Program. Subse quent to  input from GAO  field  investigations  and meetings with MMS as well as with  the  States and industry, the staff expects to make  a  letter  report concerning product valuation  with  recommendations  to Chairman  UDALL  and myself by the end of August 1987. A de tailed committee report is expected to be pub lished by November 1987, a date which coin cides with  the moratorium date contained  in  the supplemental appropriation bill.  INVOKE WAR POWERS  HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO  OF OREGON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 30, 1987  ",1987
345,,100,0.168,1429,13,Mr. MILLER of Washington.," Mr. Speaker, on  August 1, 1987,  the Price-Anderson Act will  expire. Three congressional committees are  now drafting legislation to reauthorize tt;e Na tion's first nuclear regulatory law. This will be  an extraordinarily complex process but  the  key  issue  is  fairly straightforward. The key  issue, Mr. Speaker,  is safety and  it  is ad dressed  in H.R. 2141, a bill  I have cospon sored.  Mr. Speaker, any bill must have at its heart  the goal of making safety the No. 1 priority of  those who operate any nuclear facility. H.R.  2141 does that by removing  the  liability cap  and making the operator responsible for any  damages that might occur in  the event of a  nuclear accident. Under this bill,  if a nuclear  accident were caused by gross neglect or will ful misconduct,  then  those who caused  the  accident would be  fully responsible  for com plete victim compensation.  Those of us from States with Federal nucle ar facilities like those at Hanford want to make  sure that the private contractors who operate  these reactors are held accountable and re sponsible. H.R. 2141 will do that. Any Depart ment of Energy contractor whose negligence  or misconduct causes an accident can't run to  the Federal Government and say,  ""help me  pay for  that accident."" The Federal Govern ment,  like any good  landlord, would pay  for  the damages  to protect  the citizens. After ward, the Federal Government would be enti tled to recover the costs of these losses from  the contractor.  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, current law ex empts Federal  facilities and  the contractors  who run them from any liability, no matter who  is at fault. If we have an accident at a civilian  nuclear power plant, the law says that all elec tric ratepayers who use nuclear power plants  help pay for any accident. Under H.R. 2141,  only the company which caused the accident  because of negligence or willful misconduct is  liable.  Mr. Speaker, the incentive here is to make  safety the number one priority. The vast ma jority of nuclear plant contractors do exactly  that. But nuclear power is an unforgiving tech nology. And it takes only one cut corner, one  dozing operator or one sloppy  logbook  to  jeopardize  the communities and  the  lives of  thousands of citizens. Nuclear accidents can  happen. We have seen that they do happen.  The best safeguards are  caution and  vigi lance. By  removing  the cap on  liability, by  making the contractors responsible for any ac cidents and by removing the deep pocket of  the Federal Treasury as a source for compen sation,  the bill makes safety and  vigilance  something every nuclear plant operator will  have at the top of his agenda.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  I urge my colleagues on the Committees on  Energy and Commerce, Interior and Insular Af fairs, and Science and Technology to support  the concepts in H.R. 2141. They should give  the House a bill which removes the cap on li ability and makes  the operators of nuclear  plants accountable and responsible.  TALKLINE/KIDS LINE OF ELK  GROVE VILLAGE, IL  HON.

This award  is presented annually  to pro grams which have displayed  the American  spirit of volunteering and citizen involvement.  Talkline/Kids Line is the first 24-hour crisis  hotline for children in the United States. It was  designed to assist latchkey children who are  at home while  their parents work. The pro gram provides over 200  trained  volunteers  who receive calls, raise funds, and speak to  various  groups about  the  program. These  dedicated volunteers counsel lonely and trou bled children, as well as reinforce safety and  urge constructive use of independent time.  I would  like to take this opportunity to ap plaud Talkline/Kids Line  for  the wonderful  contribution they make to the community and  the children who benefit  from  the program.  The volunteers are  to be  commended  for  giving their time to care for the welfare of the  people in the Chicago area.  To be  recognized by  the President  is an  outstanding achievement and those associat ed with Talkline/Kids Line should be justifiably  proud of their accomplishments. I extend my  heartiest congratulations on a job well done.  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION RE GARDING  AMERICANS  MISS ING IN ACTION FROM KOREA  HON. BRIAN J.

347,,100,-0.291,1429,13,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  intro ducing today, along with Congressman MONT GOMERY, a concurrent  resolution expressing  the sense of the Congress concerning action  that should be taken to account for Americans  listed as missing  in action  from  the Korean  conflict.  Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago,  I spoke on  the  floor about the fact that 8, 177 Americans are  still  listed  as missing  in  action  from  the  Korean conflict and of that number, 389 were  prisoners of war, known  to have been alive  but in Korean custody before the 1953 cease fire.  I believe  that  the U.S. Government has a  moral obligation to the families of those 8, 177  Americans. We have a moral obligation to the  18401  soldiers themselves, and should receive a full  accounting of their whereabouts,  just as we  are trying to do for those listed as missing in  action from Southeast Asia.  My  resolution expresses  the sense of the  Congress  that  the President should  formally  request the Republic of Korea to undertake a  search for, and provide an accounting of, the  whereabouts or  fate of  those 8, 177 Ameri cans. Join Mr. MONTGOMERY and myself  in  cosponsoring this resolution, and send a mes sage to those soldiers and their families that  they are not forgotten.  TRIBUTE TO JOHN L. MARTIN  HON. ERNEST L. KONNYU  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 30, 1987  ",1987
348,Senate,100,-0.37,84,20,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to support the nomination  of William C. Verity, Jr.,  to become  Secretary of Commerce-and raise, at  the  same  time,  some  reservations  about confirming him.  My concerns relate to Mr. Verity's  assertion  that  noneconomic  factors  such as human rights have no legiti mate place in the discussion of trade matters. In Mr. Verity's own words,  taken from an article in the American  Banker in 1980:  Our dated view of the world leads ... to  what  I  call ""moral  imperialism."" This  is  where we try to dictate to other countries  our ideas of what is right and what is wrong.  We have been mixing this trade policy with  human rights and other social and political  objectives  for  far  too  long. We haven't  recast the world. We have only succeeded in  cutting out many trading partners by creat ing  ill will. Our drive  to  reconstruct  the  world in our image has served only, directly,  to make American business less competitive.  According to Mr. Verity, this ""moral  imperialism"" extends to the Jackson Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of  1974. That amendment, linking most favored-nation  status  to  the Soviet  Union's performance on human rights  issues, was characterized by Mr. Verity  as ""one of the terrible mistakes that  was made by American politicians.""  Based on  that assertion, Mr. Verity  also said that he would do away com pletely  with  the  Jackson-Vanik  amendment.  During his  confirmation hearings,  Mr. Verity changed his position. He  stated then that he will abide by the  law, and not try to do away with this  crucial amendment.  Mr. President, I am willing to take  Mr. Verity at his word.  I  have no  reason to doubt his sincerity. At the  same time, I am putting him on notice  that I am depending on him not to go  back on  that promise. The  issue at  stake here-human rights-is a vital  one.  I, too, favor expanded trade for the  United States, and I want to see in creased  opportunities  for American  business. At the same time, however, I  want to know that these opportunities  are not inconsistent with U.S. policies  overall. Trade does not exist  in  a  vacuum. If it did, we wouldn't have  minimum wage or child labor laws and  we wouldn't have laws that protect the  security of the United States. Every thing would be decided on the basis of  dollars and cents-rubles and kopeks marks and pfennigs. And that is not  the kind of world that I  think most  Americans want to live in.  In conclusion, I want to quote from  an article by one of the former chair man of a major U.S. corporation. In  the article, which talks about the con nection between  the business world  and  the  community  at  large,  the  author says the following:  Businesses can't survive for long without  profits, but neither can  they survive  for  long if all around them is crumbling at their  feet. Ignoring the wider world in which we  do business not only brings us profit with out honor, but will in the fullness of time  bring us no profit at all.  I agree with those words. Whether  we  are  talking about  the  rights of  Christians and Jews to practice reli gion or  free  speech  in  the Soviet  Union, or the right  to demand fair  wages and safe working conditions, we  are  talking  about  questions  that  cannot be answered in terms of profit  alone. They are moral considerations,  and, yes, questions of honor.  I hope very sincerely that Mr. Verity  believes  the words  that I have  just  quoted above. He wrote them in 1982,  and I hope, as Secretary of Commerce,  he will be guided by the same words  and noble principles that he has set  out for others.  Thank you, Mr. President.  ",1987

350,House,100,-0.413,357,20,Mr. COELHO.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding to me.  First, I would like to thank the gen tleman from California [Mr. LAGOMAR SINO],  the ranking minority member,  for the gentleman's help and coopera tion on this bill, and also thank the  gentleman  from  Minnesota  [Mr.  VENTO], the chairman of the subcom mittee, for his help and cooperation,  and  the gentleman's staff member,  Dale Crane,  for  their extensive  in volvement and assistance in helping us  get  through  this  conflict with  the  other body.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer  my support for the compromise bill we  are considering  today.  I believe  this  legislation will achieve our goal of pre serving a large portion of the Merced  River, while also giving some time to  the residents of Mariposa County to  determine how they might meet their  future water needs.  H.R. 317 will place the entire South  Fork and the Merced River within the  Wild and Scenic Rivers System. We  will also give the same designation to  the main stem from its sources in Yo semite National Park to 300 feet above  the confluence of Bear Creek and the  Merced River.  As part of  this  compromise,  the  main stem  from  approximately  the  town of Briceburg to the point of max imum  flood control storage at Lake  McClure will be made a study river.  The study designation will allow us to  get a  formal  recommendation  from  the Interior Department on whether  or not  this  section of  the Merced  should be preserved. The study period  will also provide some  time for  the  Mariposa County Board of Supervisors  to complete their review of the lower  river to determine if it might be used  to provide future water resources  to  the residents of the county.  '  I want to take notice of a couple of  matters for  the record.  I am aware  that there are existing developments  along  the Merced,  including  the  Merced  River  High  Sierra  camp grounds. I want to reiterate that' the  wild and scenic designation will in no  way  interfere with  the operation of  these campgrounds.  Additionally,  the Merced Irrigation  District was concerned about placing  the last half mile of the Merced before  the 867  elevation point within  the  study designation. MID contends that  this half mile of river  is within  its  project boundary for the New Excheq uer Dam.  Since we are only studying the lower  river, I believe it is appropriate to pre serve as much as the river during the  study period so we can explore all pos sible options  for  the  future of  the  lower river.  However,  I want  to make  it clear  that by placing the lower river within  the study category, we have not made  any determination one way or  the  other on the validity of the concerns  expressed by MID nor on how the last  half mile of the river should be han dled in the future.  I appreciate the support I have re ceived from the chairman of the sub committee, Mr. VENTO, on this legisla tion. I also wish to thank Dale Crane  for the assistance he provided in get ting this compromise together.  I am pleased that we have reached  this  agreement  on  preserving  the  Merced for our children and granchil dren. I ask my colleagues to support  the bill before us today.  ",1987

The  ICT A president, Howard Segermark, believes  that the mint and the members of the cartel  are doing a great job in getting the coins to  the public. Perhaps Mr. Segermark should talk  to Bruce Kaplan, the immediate past chairman  of ICTA. Last year, Mr. Kaplan's firm, A-Mark  Precious Metals, sued the mint over the distri bution network, while Mr. Kaplan was chairman of ICT A. The suit was over the very dis tribution system that the ICT A president now  praises so  lavishly,  the only difference being  that A-Mark is now a member of the cartel as  a result of the suit.  It's instructive to examine what A-Mark told  the U.S. District Court for the District of Co lumbia  regarding  the  mint's  distribution  system. In its court filings A-Mark calls the dis tribution plan: a ""plain violation of the [Ameri can Gold Bullion Coin] Act"", an ""unlawful dis tribution scheme,"" an ""unlawful and ultra vires  marketing and pricing scheme,"" a denial of  ""equal protection of the  laws,  in violation of  the fifth amendment of the U.S. Constitution,""  ""arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discre tion not in accordance with law and excess of  the defendant's authority under the act"" and  ""contrary  to  the express  requirement  in  the  act.""  ICT A's president disputes my description of  the primary marketers as a cartel. Yet his past  chairman's firm denounced  the marketers to  the court as  ""an exclusive cartel of wealthy  distributors.""  The revisionist history by ICT A presents the  distribution system as benefiting consumers  and other dealers. That  is not how A-Mark  viewed  it while not a distributor.  It  told  the  court that it would suffer ""gre~t economic det riment,  irreparable  injury and damage  to  its  business,  including  the  loss of customers,  sales, market share, goodwill, prestige, and  reputation.""  Does  the distribution plan assure  that  the  coins are available to the public at the lowest  possible price,  as Mr. Segermark  implies?  Hardly. The founder of A-Mark, in a sworn affi davit stated  that  the  ""mint's plan  forces A Mark to purchase the coins at prices dictated  by the select group of authorized distributors  and to then cut its margin in order to remain  competitive with them."" The distributors were  not reluctant  to benefit  from  their privileged  position.  In a second affidavit  the  founder  pointed out  that A-Mark was offered gold  coins ""at an exorbitant premium over the dis tributor's cost.""  The harm caused by the distribution system  was not only financial. A-Mark's founder cited  the ""irreparable damage through  the  loss of  goodwill"" that A-Mark would suffer by  its ex clusion  from purchasing  from  the mint. He  pointed out that the firm would ""lose custom ers and sales during""  the  initial peak sales  period. He pointed out  that new customers  would go to the authorized distributors at the  outset of the program and be lost to his firm.  How prudent is the distribution system? Ac cording to A-Mark, the ""distributors have been  chosen pursuant to arbitrary and unconstitu tional criteria"".  Is the mint distribution system  necessary for a successful bullion program, as  ICT A claims? Not so, according to A-Mark, de scribing  the marketing plan  to  the court as  having ""no rational  relationship  to any  legiti mate purpose under the act.""  What was A-Mark's views about  the sup posed  ""fierce competition""  that  ICTA Presi dent Segermark claims exists under the distri bution scheme? The ICT A chairman's firm at tacked  the distribution scheme  for creating  ""unduly restricted competition"" in violation of  the Competition in Contracting Act.  Then Mr. Segermark claims that nobody ex pected the high  initial demand for the coins.  On October 18, 1986, 2 days before the gold  coins went on sale, the founder of A-Mark, in  a sworn affidavit, told the district court:  The  period  immediately  following  the  first offering of the American Eagle coins  will provide a unique opportunity  to  the  gold coin distributors. Historically,  [other  gold coins] experiencd very high sales in the  weeks following introduction of those coins.  A-Mark will lose customers and sales during  this peak period. <Emphasis added.]  Perhaps Mr. Segermark needs  to consult  with his membership about  the demand  for  new issues of gold coins.  In case anyone is wondering why A-Mark is  not disputing the descriptions of the gold bul lion coin program by  the president of  ICTA,  the answer is simple. The mint settled the A Mark lawsuit by making the firm an authorized  distributor. Instead of still criticizing the cartel,  A-Mark is now a member of the cartel. Mr. Se germark can sing safely the praises of the dis tribution system, without running the risk of of fending one of  the  ICTA's most prominent  members, and without being  in conflict with  the position of his past chairman's firm.  A-Mark's put  its candid evaluation of  the  distribution system in the public record when it  challenged the system. ICTA's President can  try  to  ignore  that devastating record, but he  can never erase it. His past chairman's firm's  actions  in  fighting  the unlawful distribution  system,  speak  louder and more eloquently  than his own empty words.  IN HONOR OF DR. MARVIN  EPSTEIN  ",1987
353,,100,-0.631,383,20,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, we have all been  appalled by the large, 37 -percent increase in  Medicare's part B physician service premium  scheduled for this coming January.  These increases in health costs are particu larly disturbing when Canada manages to pro vide quality service to all  its people at about  30-percent  less  than our cost of providing  health care to only five-sixths of our popula tion.  Two months ago,  I received a  letter from  one of my constituents  from Oakland, CA,  who described his experience in trying to get  cataract surgery in northern California, versus  the cost  in Mexico City.  It  is an  interesting  letter and raises  lots of questions about the  costs of our health-care system.  I congratulate my  constituent  in  seeing  through the campaign of the eye surgeons in  asking  their patients  to bombard Congress  with postcards against -any cuts in Medicare  reimbursement for cataract surgery. His letter  is a very effective answer.  By the way, the cost of a cataract operation  in Canada is about the same as the price my  constituents  reports  is  the  going  rate  in  Mexico City.  Portions of his letter follow:  Prior to going south, I had an eye exami nation in San Leanaro for cataracts which I  paid for myself. The examination total cost  was $245, $75 for the regular, and $170 for  what is called an ultrasome scan, and was  set up for surgery 3 days later.  You won't remember, but I am still not  the regular run of the mill 78-year-old senile  citizen. I asked for and had a hell of a time  getting the cost of this surgery. Total cost $5,500 for each eye. I had even more diffi cutly finding out who got what, but did,  Doctor-20 minutes-$2,400. Hospital  3%  hrs  outpatient-$2,300.  Incidentally God  knows what-$800. I cancelled the surgery.  This came as a great shock to both the  surgeon and the hospital who both called  me many  times  to  assure me  that  it  wouldn't cost me one cent.  Although I know damn little about Medi care having never had any dealings with any  type of insurance benefits, it was my under standing that Medicare paid only 80 percent  of allowed medical expenses after the first  $15 which should leave me with $1,100 plus  $75 to pay. I have since checked with four  surgeons in the bay area and they all assure  ",1987

356,House,100,-0.278,539,20,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself the remaining time.  Let me very hurriedly make refer ence to some of the amendments that  will be offered or are intended to be  offered  if  an  opportunity  presents  itself.  The bill, H.R. 162,  in  its present  form has been under study by  the  committee and these amendments at  the request and following  the usual  procedure, we have been very sensitive  and responsive to requests and these  amendments have already been ap proved by  the committee chairmen  and we would join with the requested  amendments.  One amendent would be to allow in dividual companies to apply for an ex emption from the high risk notifica tion process.  Another amendment would be  to  have  strengthened  requirements  for  the medical removal provisions of the  bill.  Another amendment would provide  legal protection  against malpractice  for doctors who make a good faith de termination that a worker should be  removed or transferred in his job.  Another  amendment  which  we  would submit would be pointed toward  duplicating medical monitoring pro grams that are in existence in other  agencies.  Another amendment would be  the  Risk Assessment Board which would  have the ability to limit notification to  the period of latency associated with  the disease.  There are several technical amend ments. We have two amendments that  are agreed to and would be sponsored  by  the gentlewoman from Maryland  involving exemptions for small busi. nesses with 15 or fewer full-time em ployees from the medical removal pro visions of the bill, and also an amend ment that will be sponsored by  the  gentleman from North Carolina [Mr.  RosE], where  seasonal  agricultural  workers would be exempt from  the  medical removal provisions of the bill  as long as they have not worked for  the same employer continuously for  six months.  Now,  these  amendments  will  strengthen the bill. We feel they are  amendments that the majority would  support.  Mr. Chairman,  let me say  this  in  closing,  if  I may. Many statements  were made on the floor of the House  in what H.R. 162 does or does not do. I  heard one of our colleagues over there  state that one of his employees got re moved from a particular job because  he was exposed to some substance or  process or chemical or an agent, that  he would be losing $40,000 a year, or  $20,000 a year.  .  The bill is very, very specific. If you  are exposed or transferred and you do  not have a  job, your workman's com pensation  is  reduced  and  deducted  from  anything  that you would be  making or not making or changing to  another  job or being removed from  your particular job.  ",1987
357,House,100,-0.306,539,20,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 162, the High Risk Occupa tional Disease Notification and Prevention Act,  and would  like to commend the chairman of  the Committee on Education and Labor  for  bringing  this much needed  legislation before  us today.  While there is much controversy surround ing H.R. 162, in view of the fact that approxi mately  100,000  workers  die  and  some  340,000 more are disabled each year from oc cupational diseases caused by exposure  to  the toxic substances in commercial and indus trial use, I believe that we would be derelict in  our duty to the working men and women of  this country if we did not pass this legislation.  This is especially true because effective treat ment of diseases resulting  from exposure  to  hazardous materials depends on early detec tion and  treatment and because presently,  Federal regulations do not require employers  to inform workers of their risk of disease from  exposure to specific substances.  H.R. 162 provides for the scientific identifi cation of those workers with a high risk of de veloping  fatal or disabling occupational dis eases,  the notification of these workers and  the subsequent monitoring for such diseases.  These procedures will help to ensure the early  detection of occupational diseases and,  in  turn, will permit  the most effective medical  treatment for those affected. Additionally, they  will encourage changes  in affected workers'  lifestyles that might further reduce  the  likeli hood or severity of disabilities. Provisions of  H.R. 162 will also facilitate the establishment  of advanced warning systems for workers and  will encourage workers to avoid exposure to  dangerous levels of hazardous substances.  Many have expressed concerns in regard to  the costs of this legislation which authorizes a  modest $25 million per year for its program.  However, at this point in time, businesses lose  between $1.7 billion and $4.3 billion because  of occupational disease. The Federal Govern ment now spends approximately $5.4 billion  per  year  for  occupational  diseases  under  Social Security Disability Income, Supplemen tal Security Income, Medicaid and Medicare. If  enactment of the bill results in only a small re duction in disease resulting from occupational  hazards, the bill will more than pay for itself.  In regard  to costs that might be incurred by  employers, many of the costs required under  the bill are already  incurred by employers in  complying with existing OSHA requirements.  Finally, opponents of H.R. 162 argue  that  the bill will  result  in huge  litigation costs for  employers because of emotional stress liability  suits brought as a result of the risk notification  program. That is not the case because the bill  specifically prohibits the use of determinations  or actions under the bill as a basis for com pensation, loss or damage claims.  To reiterate, I strongly support enactment of  H.R. 162 and urge my colleagues to support  this worthwhile and much needed legislation.  ",1987

361,House,100,-0.024,552,20,Mrs. BYRON.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the substitute.  First of all, let me say if the Jeffords  substitute goes down in defeat, I want  to go on record that I plan to offer an  amendment that I have that would  exempt small businesses of up to 15  employees from the medical removal  provision of H.R. 162, if the company  has made a good-faith effort to pre vent occupational exposure.  The bill as it stands would now re quire employer payment of up to 12  months' pay and benefits to employees  who must be removed from a job when  the transfer cannot be arranged, re gardless of the number of jobs that an  employer is able to provide.  When a business has fewer than 15  employees,  the possibility of an em ployee's transfer is significantly limit ed. How can it be expected that a busi ness with so few employees should be  able to create an extra space to accom modate an employee's transfer?  Fifteen is the number that has been  used in the past as a cutoff for small  businesses. I do not think in this day  and age a 15-employee business is a  small business. I think more in the re alistic area is 50, but 15 is the number  that has been used; and I have been  advised that it has been used already  in existing OSHA regulations, in civil  rights legislation.  There  never  can  be  a  magical  number of what a small business can  be to be protected. I feel that 15 is a  number which the majority can live  with.  I feel that businesses should, under  all  possible  circumstances,  afford  proper notification and medical  re moval opportunities to qualifying em ployees. I do not feel, however, that  this should take place when the busi ness is so small in size as to render the  transfer of an employee to another po sition, comparable in pay and benefits,  an impossibility.  Should an employer transfer an em ployee  in order  to met his or her  health needs? Yes, of course. In the  case of an employer with so few em ployees, such a transfer would threat en the operation of the business, as it  would for a company of 15 and fewer  employees, then I feel that an exemp tion is in order.  Somebody asked me what the com mittee feels on this, and it is my un derstanding  that they feel  this  is a  friendly amendment.  0 1515  I want to go on record stating that if  the  Jeffords  substitute  goes  down,  that amendment will be offered by  this Member.

362,House,100,0.496,578,20,Mr. HANSEN.," Mr. Speaker, with the  onset of the 30 degree weather, I am  reminded that the cold and flu season  will soon be upon us. Even though a  cure has not been discovered for the  common cold, we are continually bom barded with advertisements promising  relief. Because we have no other re course, we generally will run to  the  corner drugstore and buy an assort ment of over-the-counter drugs to get  some relief from our aches and pains.  Collectively, we have probably taken  millions of aspirin, swallowed pounds  of throat lozenges, and drunk gallons  of cough syrup.  I would venture to say that most of  us do not have a difficult time follow ing the directive on a bottle of aspirin  or cough syrup that tells us when to  discontinue its use-an indicator that  it is no longer effective or needed.  In this body, we are having a diffi cult time discontinuing the use of the  Davis-Bacon Act, even after 50 years.  Instead of saying enough is enough,  we have increased the dosage.

366,Senate,100,-0.192,799,20,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to honor James Isenogle, an  individual whose outstanding service  and dedication to the U.S. Park Serv ice has earned him the Department of  the  Interior's Distinguished Service  Award. I would like to take this oppor tunity to commend him for his efforts,  especially  in  regard  to  his  distin guished  tenure as Administrator of  the Jean Lafitte National Historical  Park in New Orleans.  Jim  Isenogle  joined  the National  Park Service at Philadelphia in 1957,  having served with the U.S. Navy as a  gunnery officer for the 2 years previ ous. He subsequently served with the  Park Service  in numerous capacities  nationwide,  including assignments at  the Canaveral National Seashore, FL,  and the Lake Clark, Katmai and An iakchak areas in Alaska, all of which  later became units of the Park Service.  He also served with distinction as as sistant to the Regional Director for  Utah from 1974 to 1979.  Shortly before his arrival in New Or leans in 1979, legislation officially cre ating the Jean Lafitte National Histor ical Park and Preserve, which had  been in the works for a decade, was  passed by the Congress. This legisla tion provided for a unique concept,  one which held great promise for an  exciting park based on a new principle.  To be a success, it required an individ ual with  a  creative  foresight  and  strong ability in management. Jim was  possessing of these skills and literally  took  the  ideas on paper, nurtured  them and made them a success.  From ground zero, he oversaw the  acquisition of over 7,000 acres of the  natural  Barataria  Basin  Preserve  which now plays host to over half a  million  visitors  a  year. A  visitor's  center has been constructed and there  are plans for an environmental educa tion center as well. These accomplish ments have come about in no small  part due  to Jim's excellent skills at  gaining community support by forging  a variety of cooperative agreements  throughout  the delta  region. These  agreements were  designed  to  help  meet the mandate in the legislation es tablishing the park that called for an  interpretation of the cultural contri butions of  the delta region's people  and their histories. In the Islenos in terpretation of the Portuguese settle ments, he has been adept in reaching  many other groups  through his ef forts,  including the establishment of  three Acadian cultural centers in the  last 3 years. Jim's contributions are  far too many to list individually. But it  is clear that without his skills at lead ership and his creativity, the Jean La fitte National Historical Park would  not be, in reality, a park.  I commend him for his many efforts  in dealing with very complex and diffi cult, and in some cases, not so pleas ant, problems. Even though Jim is re tiring, the ideas and the projects he  has put  into place will  remain  the  foundation of this park and the base  upon which we can continue to build  far into the future.  Mr. President,  I  ask  that  the at tached article from the New Orleans  Times-Picayune which thoroughly de scribes all that Jim has encountered  and  accomplished  in his  tenure at  Jean Lafitte National Historical Park  be printed in the REcORD.  The article follows:  RETIRING JEAN LAFITTE DIRECTOR LEAVING  IMPROVED PARK BEHIND  <By Cindy Hebert>  When  James  Isenogle became  superin tendent of Jean Lafitte National Historical  Park, dumping trash by the truckload was  almost a community sport, but he put a stop  to that.  He had the staff tack up no dumping signs  and issued warnings and citations to viola tors. It worked, residents told him, because  somebody was finally enforcing the dump ing laws. But not every project Isenogle has  undertaken has been that easy.  lsenogle, 55, will retire Saturday after a  32-year career with the park service. He was  tapped for the superintendent's job at Jean  Lafitte in 1979 and has spent the past eight  years setting up programs and leaving his  mark on the park system.

367,,100,-0.377,825,20,Mr. SAWYER.," Mr. Speaker, St. Vincent de  Paul Church  in Akron, OH will celebrate  its  150th anniversary on Sunday, October 18,  1987. I would like to pay tribute to this church  and its parishoners on this very special occa sion, and I want to share with my colleagues  some of the history of this church which has  played such an important role in the history of  Akron.  St. Vincent began as a mission of St. Fran cis Xavier Church  in Chippewa, OH. For the  more than 20 years before the mission of St.  Vincent was established, Catholics  from  Ire land, Germany, France, and other parts of  Europe  were  without  the  consolation  of  priests. Originally, these immigrants had come  to this country to work on the Ohio Canal. The  church became a community center for immi grants, a school for their children, and helped  provide a  recorded history of  their  lives  in  Akron: the city's  first baptism December 11,  1837,  first marriage January 11, 1838, and  first funeral January 27, 1838, were all record ed by the parish's original pastor, Father Basil  A. Shorb.  As the community of Akron grew, so did St.  Vincent Church. And by the end of 1847, St.  Francis Xavier Church  in Chippewa became  the mission of St. Vincent. This is quite a testi mony to  the growth and spiritual strength of  the Akron community when one considers that  St. Vincent Church was  the mission of St.  Francis Xavier  little more  than  10  years  before. More important, this course of events  shows how people dedicated to their faith can  improve their lives, the lives of their children,  and the spirit of their community.  Back in 1941, St. Vincent's pastor, Father  Conry, helped establish  the St. Vincent High  School. Since  then,  the  high  school  has  always been coeducational because,  in  the  words of father Conry, ""These young people  will marry and they will live together and they  must know how to get along with each other.""  Through the years, St. Vincent Church has  been  renovated many  times.  In a very  real  sense, these renovations have symbolized the  church's ever changing parish. As elder pari sioners send  their children  to  the church's  school, these children return to help the Akron  community  as  teachers,  public  servants,  priests and nuns, social workers, et cetera. By  combining  church  and  school, St. Vincent  Church  has historically committed  itself  to  Akron's youth. It is through its commitment to  youth that the church has laid the groundwork  for both a stronger Akron and a better future.  St. Vincent Church stands now as both an  architectural and spiritual landmark in the his tory of Akron.  Its continued strength, and the  constant dedication of its parishioners, are a  vital part of the city. Whether attending serv ices,  sending  their  children  to  school,  or  cheering at a football game,  the  faith of the  people of St. Vincent Church  is  the  true  strength of this great institution. It will ensure  ",1987
368,,100,0.276,838,20,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  in 1959 a  husky young graduate of the Baltimore County  Police Academy was  issued a badge, a gun,  and assigned  to  the Dundalk Police Station.  This station was responsible at  the time  for  patrolling the whole southeastern area of the  county, yet  it possessed only seven squad  cars  and  one  shotgun.  The$e  certainly  seemed  to put things at a disadvantage for  those who were sworn to uphold the laws of  both a county and a State, yet young Patrol man Frank Messina approached his duties  with a degree of vim and vigor which more  than made up for the limited resources.  Twenty-eight years  later, Col. Frank Mes sina retired from the Baltimore County Police  Force as chief of field operations. That very  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  same station where he started his career now  possesses 18 patrol cars, each carrying  its  own shotgun, and the Baltimore County Police  Force has increased from 400 officers to over  1 ,400 officers supported by nearly 200 civil ians.  It is also recognized as one of the best  police forces in the entire Nation as a result of  Colonel Messina's efforts as the No. 2 man in  the force.  On October 20 Colonel Messina's com rades, colleagues, and  friends will gather to  pay due homage to the man who, for over a  quarter of a century, contributed so much to  the safety and well-being of his community.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize on the  floor of this great body the accomplishments  of this truly special person. His story should  serve as an example to all who wish to make  a mark in the field of public service, whether it  be on the national, State, or local level.  Colonel Messina is the first Italian-American  in his  force  to become a captain and  to  achieve his present rank. His beginnings were  humble, yet he climbed  the  ladder until he  eventually  reached  the pinnacle of success.  These facts, however, do not by  themselves  tell  the  full story of Colonel Messina's suc cess. His sense of vision and his willingness  to innovate were his tickets to fame. It was his  ability to expand  the goals of a police  force  from one which focused on  law enforcement  into one which strived to serve its community  as well which make his so worthy of praise.  Colonel Messina made  a  difference,  and  that's what is of supreme importance.  His experience in all areas of police work al lowed him to develop new ideas, to increase  efficiency and provide more benefits  to  the  community. He entered a police  force which  employed almost no  blacks and  very  few  women.  It now has 92 black officers as well  as over 1 00 women.  Colonel Messina is indeed a very rare breed  of man-a ""man of vision.""  I am proud that  my district contains one of  the most ad vanced, sophisticated, and dedicated police  forces  in  the United States-because  this  man pursued his vision.  Colonel Messina  is  indeed  a doer,  and  America needs more doers like him. All who  salute him on his day of recognition should  strive to meet the level of excellence he has  established. Colonel Messina has  remained  until now largely an unsung hero, one whose  achievements were of course recognized and  appreciated yet never viewed in the total pic ture.  Today I am proud to have the opportunity to  sing his song of praise.  WE NEED A COORDINATED  NATIONAL DRUG POLICY  HON. JOSEPH J.

371,House,100,-0.4,968,20,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, everyone,  certainly  including myself,  is  very  pleased that Nancy Reagan is doing so  well; doctors say that she has a 95to  100-percent  chance  of  survival  and  that the prognosis is excellent. We are  all thrilled about that.  One of the reasons she is doing so  well and her cancer is probably cured  is because she had a mammogram in  her annual checkup.  Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago 1 out of 20  women acquired breast cancer. Today  the figure is 1 out of 9.  In Medicare, it does not include pre vention.  It does not  include a  free  mammogram or screening for women,  but  it will  include  coverage  to  an  extent for the surgery.  We could save an awful lot of lives if  we would only  include a prevention  mammogram  in  the Medicare  Pro gram.  Mr. Speaker, we had  in  the cata strophic bill a minimum program re lated to mammograms. It was  taken  out.  I  really urge  this Congress  to  either put that provision back  in or  pass the bill that I have introduced for  the  last 6  years, H.R.  2935, which  would  include  in Medicare coverage  this type of situation.  Nancy  Reagan  is  not  the  only  woman who should have this kind of  coverage. Every older woman should  have this and certainly older men as  well with  respect  to  screening  and  other kinds of cancer screening; so I  am hoping that this killer of women  will be arrested by an ounce of preven tion and Congress has the opportunity  to do something about this dreadful  disease.

The outstanding contributions she has  made to her community through the Chicago  area public libraries are truly deserving of rec ognition.  Mrs. Smith was  initially employed by  the  Stickney/Forest View Library District in Febru ary of 1961 as a library cataloger. She was  later promoted  to  the assistant  librarianship  under Helena Kysela and became the  library  administrator in 1969, a position she retained  until her retirement on January 4, 1986. As  the  library administrator, she assisted  in  the  development of summer programs  for chil dren, preschool story hours, and the teaching  of  library skills  to public and private school  students  from  kindergarten  through  eighth  grade. For  the adults,  she developed pro grams  in  crafts,  travelogs,  insurance,  and  speed  reading. For  those  interested  in  the  arts, she coordinated  local artists with avail able space  for artistic showings  through  the  Cicero-Berwyn Fine Arts Council.  Perhaps most importantly, Mrs. Smith was  instrumental  in changing  the Stickney/Forest  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  View Library  from  its strict  library  form  to a  media concept library by making audio visual  materials-filmstrips, cassettes, 8 mm films, et  cetera-and all equipment necessary for their  use available  to  the public at  the  library.  In  1980, she expanded this concept by introduc ing video cassettes and recorders into the col lection  for patrons use. This new program  alone has  received a  tremendous  response  from  the community. Mrs. Smith also served  her community in other ways. She helped re catalog  the  library  collection  at Nazareth  Academy and  has  served on  the advisory  boards  for  the Suburban Library System and  on various advisory boards at Morton College  in Chicago.  Consistent with her  interest  in  library sci ences, Vera  is an active member and has  chaired and served committees of the Ameri can Library Association, Illinois Library Associ lion, LACONI-Library Administrators Confer ence of Northern Illinois-South Suburban Li brarians Association, Reading Round Table,  and other  library and media associations. In  her years with  the public library she also as sisted in the development of the Suburban Li brary System and the Suburban Library Trust ee Association, an organization she was  in volved with for many years.  I am sure  that my colleagues  join me  in  congratulating Mrs. Smith upon receiving  this  award and thanking her for her dedication to  the public and to knowledge, the most impor tant object libraries contain.  THE PESTICIDE MONITORING  IMPROVEMENTS ACT  HON. JOHN D. DINGELL  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 19, 1987  ",1987
375,,100,-0.448,1020,20,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, currently there  is a high level of public concern about pesti cide  residues  in  food, and a February 1987  report of the Environmental Protection Agency  entitled  ""Unfinished Business""  ranked pesti cide residues  in  food as one of the Nation's  most serious health and environmental issues.  Over  the past decade, however, various  re ports have  found serious deficiencies  in  the  Federal Government's program for monitoring  pesticide residues in the food supply.  Today, I plan to introduce, with a number of  distinguished colleagues from the Energy and  Commerce, Agriculture, Appropriations, Gov ernment Operations, and Foreign Affairs Com mittees,  the  ""Pesticide Monitoring  Improve ments Act"" -legislation which would signifi cantly strengthen the Food and Drug Adminis tration's  [FDA] ability  to protect  the public  against unsafe pesticide residues. This legisla tion would address several major problems in  the  FDA's  pesticide monitoring  program,  which were highlighted by an April 30, 1987,  hearing of  the Subcommittee on Oversight  and Investigations.  According  to the testimony of the General  Accounting Office, the Food and Drug Admin istration annually tests less than 1 percent of  domestic and imported food for pesticide resi dues. In view of the small percentage of foods  tested  for pesticides,  it  is crucial  that FDA    October 19, 1987  target  its  testing  resources effectively. The  subcommittee's  hearing,  however,  revealed  large gaps  in  the Agency's testing program.  For example,  the  testimony  indicated  that,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that a category of  pesticides called the EBDC's (ethylenebisdith iocarbamates)  constitutes  the most widely  used fungicides in the world and the fact that  the primary breakdown product of the EBDC's  called ETU (ethylene thiourea) is an acknowl edged carcinogen and teratogen, FDA had not  tested a single sample of  imported  food  for  EBDC's or ETU from fiscal year 1979 through  the first 6 months of fiscal year 1987.  The hearing record established  that FDA's  ability to focus its testing resources effectively  has been seriously  impaired by  inadequate  computerization of  the Agency's data man agement systems, by  insufficient data about  pesticides used on  imported  food,  and by  gaps in the coverage of testing methods gen erally applied by FDA  to determine compli ance with pesticide residue limits. The ""Pesti cide Monitoring  Improvements Act""  responds  to  these problems by requiring FDA to auto mate the summarization of results of its pesti cide monitoring and enforcement program, by  requiring  import documents  to  identify  those  pesticides used on  imported  food during  its  production, by requiring FDA to develop long range research plans for the development and  validation of pesticide analytical methods, and  by requiring FDA to review the potential use of  rapid pesticide analytical methods in its moni toring and enforcement program.  In addition,  the legislation requires FDA to issue laboratory audit guidelines to assure the validity and  reliability of pesticide  residue monitoring  re sults submitted by private laboratories, and it  contains provisions designed to facilitate com munication between FDA and other Federal  and  international agencies and  foreign coun tries exporting  food products  to  the United  States.  The proposed  legislation  is  focused exclu sively on  the pesticide monitoring and en forcement activities of the Food and Drug Ad ministration under  the Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act.  It  is  intended  to comple ment parallel efforts, such as proposals  to  amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act, which would strengthen  the  pesticide  registration authorities of  the Envi ronmental Protection Agency.  A section-by-section analysis of the legisla tion follows.   ~:>  SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS ""PESTICIDE  MONITORING IMPROVEMENTS AcT""  SECTION !-SHORT TITLE  This section names the Act the ""Pesticide  Monitoring Improvements Act.""  SEC. 2-PESTICIDE MONITORING AND  ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION  Summary  This section requires the Food and Drug  Administration <FDA) to establish comput erized data management systems  to track  and evaluate the results of its program for  monitoring  imported  and  domestic  food  products for pesticide residues. The infor mation  summarized under  this provision  must be compiled annually and made avail able  to Federal and State  agencies  and  other interested persons.  ",1987
376,Senate,100,-0.123,1085,20,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, I wish  to bring to the attention of the Senate  and to the press an incident that is on going right now, which very severely  threatens the southern coast of North  America,  particularly  the States of  Texas and Louisiana.  The incident I point to is an October  10 blowout of a major oil installation  in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of  Mexico.  That  very  large  blowout,  which is currently spewing forth oil,  does  so  in an uncontrolled  fashion,  throwing into the Gulf of Mexico oil  at the rate of 30,000 barrels per day.  As we do business here on the floor  of the Senate, that blowout is continu ing. It has not been stopped. It rivals a  similar type of accident that occurred  off the Bay of Campeche several years  ago, which was a major environmental  disaster, with certainly the potential  for long-term, lasting, negative effects.  That well took several months to cap,  and this well is blowing out at an even  greater rate than the one off the Bay  of Campeche.  As I have indicated, the well contin ues  to discharge oil at  the  rate of  30,000 barrels per day. It has present ed a situation where the spill can now  be measured by an oil slick in the Gulf  of Mexico that is some 250 yards wide  by 55 miles  long,  stretching  in  the  gulf.  The slick is headed in a westerly di rection; and the spill,  if it continues  with the current in the Gulf of Mexico  the way  it happens  to be  in  this  season,  is  likely  to enter  into U.S.  waters, posing a grave potential  for  damage to natural resources and wild life habitat, in addition to the beaches  along the coast of Texas and Louisi ana. And who knows where it might  end up?  We spent a lot of time discussing the  so-called  famous  Ixtoc spill off  the  coast of Mexico in 1977, which spilled  oil into the gulf at the rate of 28,000  barrels per day.  This  incident, by all estimates,  is  even more severe than the situation  that occurred back in 1977. Members  may  remember  that  that spill cost  over $10 million to clean up, with some  of  the damages being damages  that  could  never  be  assessed  by  dollar  figure; damages that occured that can  never be replaced because of the loss  of natural resources in that area.  It is also important to note that ef forts to cap this well that is spewing  oil daily has repeatedly failed over the  last 9 to 10 days, indicating that this is  a situation that has presented some  very special problems.  It  is  interesting  to note  that  the  Mexican Government has  indicated  that they should have it capped within  3 more weeks, they said at least 3 more  weeks.  It is interesting to note that is what  they said the last time a major blow out occurred and we were still talking  about it 9 months later after they said  that they would have it under control.  The second point that I bring this  up for this afternoon is to point out  the critical need for some type of legis lative approach to these types of spills.  ",1987
377,House,100,-0.35,1111,20,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, yester day's  record  drop  on Wall Street  points up what so many of us have  been  talking about  for months,  the  huge, soft underbelly in our economy,  bloated by borrowed money, much of  it from foreign creditors. That self-in dulgence could not go on without a  drop  in our standard of  living. The  shot across the bow yesterday was fur ther warning.  The President of our country should  not acquiesce to all of this. He should  not  let  the  roulette of  the market  place attack the problem. He should  accept the responsibility for his own  economic program that has produced  the largest Federal deficits in history  by cutting taxes for the wealthy, bor rowing to the hilt to pay for an enor mous defense build up, and importing  vast amounts of foreign-made goods,  displacing U.S. production. There  is  still  time, Mr. President, for you  to  join Congress at the table and put our  financial house in order, both the red  ink of the Federal budget deficit and  the spiraling trade deficit. It is time to  stop the borrowing. It is time to sign a  trade bill.

378,House,100,-0.355,1124,20,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, this debate generates a  lot of controversy.  It has  from  the  time it arose back when we were con sidering  the State Department bill,  back even to the time when in fact the  discoveries were made in Moscow.  There is nobody on this floor that  does not believe that the Russians, the  Soviet Union has taken advantage of  the United States and has done it cold bloodedly, deliberately, and probably  effectively.  The problem is always, for us on this  floor,  framing  an  appropriate  re sponse.  It seems to me that with the work  that has been done over the last 6 or 8  months  since  the  revelations  took  place by  the Committee on Foreign  Affairs, by both the chairman of the  Subcommittee on International Oper ations and  its  ranking member, Mr.  MICA, and Ms. SNOWE,  that we could  probably  frame  an  appropriate  re sponse and in fact have done so. The  State Department authorization bill  contains an appropriate  response,  a  measured,  reflective,  intelligence  re sponse to the Soviet Union's intrusion  into our Embassy in Moscow.  I am not going to yield.  The gentleman  is sitting on a  more time than I have.  Everybody  in  this Chamber voted  for  that measured  appropriate  re sponse.

I  am  afraid it is not even close to happen ing, at least tomorrow. It seems to me  on  this  issue,  as  on other human  rights  issues,  it  is crystal clear and  critical  that we  in  the Government,  executive and legislative, must speak  with one voice,  that we must speak  with a  firm voice,  indeed we must  speak with a  loud voice because it is  absolutely  clear only pressure may  work.  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join with  my colleagues in this one additional  bit of pressure. Hopefully it will work.  ",1987

The Cleveland  City Club was founded on October 28, 1912.  One hundred eleven people attended the first  meeting. The main  speaker was Cleveland  Mayor Newton D. Baker, who went on  to  serve as Secretary of War from 1916 to 1921.  Since that time, the City Club has had an un interrupted schedule of distinguished speakers  from all parts of  the United States and  the  world, offering a  forum  for  their  ideas and  views. This outstanding record has earned the  City Club  the reputation as a citadel of free  speech.  Fittingly, the theme of the City Club's 75th  anniversary dinner will  be  ""The Power of  Ideas."" Eight outstanding and articulate AmerEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  icans will give a  focused,  concentrated 5minute talk during which they will develop and  address themselves to a single idea related to  their  respective  fields. The  speakers come  from  a wide  variety of professions: Mario  Cuomo, Governor of New York; John Kenneth  Galbraith, the economist and Presidential ad visor; Jeanne Kirkpartick, former U.S. Ambas sador  to  the United Nations; Dr. C. Everett  Koop, Surgeon General of the United States;  Eleanor Holmes Norton, lawyer and educator;  T. Boone Pickens, chairman of Mesa Petrole um Co.; Felix G. Rohatyn, Wall Street finan cier; and Gloria Steinem, publisher of Ms.  Magazine.  ""We feel this is a most appropriate way to  observe  75  years  of  'America's soapbox,'  where people  from many walks of  life have  been able to use the City Club as a vehicle to  express a wide variety of views to the public,''  said David T. Sindell, president of  the City  Club.  Cleveland commentator Rena Blumberg  is  chairperson of the banquet advisory commit tee. She expects more  than 1,000 guests to  attend the anniversary dinner.  Over the past 75 years, the City Club has  been host to  literally  thousands of speakers  who presented their ideas and tested them in  the  invariably  lively discussion  that  followed.  The City Club has an admirable record  that  exemplifies  our  country's  tradition  of  free  speech and our national propensity to debate  issues.  I want to add my voice of congratula tions  to the City Club on  its diamond jubilee  and wish  this venerable  institution continued  success in promoting the ""Power of Ideas.""

Their motto ""For the Better ment of  the Community"" only hints at  the  dedication of  this  fine group of citizens who  have freely given their time and effort over 25  years and brought great changes and  im provements to their neighborhood.  Plumb Beach Civic has worked  for better  parks, streets, and other public areas, making  them beautiful and safe. They constantly mon itor the quality of government services, striving  to improve the lives of those in the communi ty. They sponsor public events such as  the  annual Memorial Day parade and ceremonies.  They are involved in  local government, acting  as an important link between the people and  their  elected  officials.  Plumb  Beach Civic  touches every aspect of community  life and  serves as testament to the strength of people  willing  to give of  themselves  to  improve  the  neighborhood they live in.  On Sunday, October 24, the group is hold ing a ceremony marking  this anniversary.  I  October 20, 1987  take this occasion to offer Plumb Beach Civic  Association  and  their  President Margaret  McCord congratulations on 25 successful and  productive years and my best wishes  for 25  more.  A TRIBUTE TO DR. FREDERICK  C. ROBBINS  HON. EDWARD F. FEIGHAN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 20, 1987  ",1987
383,House,100,0.39,1215,20,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. Speaker, I support  the concept of a  summit because  I  think it is time that we do something  about the deficit. But in order for us  to have any chance of success, we  must go into it, as has been suggested  by the Speaker, with no preconditions,  including no preconditions that we ad dress the problem by raising taxes.  There must be spending cuts. We  must agree  that we will  look at  it  across the board. If you are talking  about a summit where the Democrats  walk in and say, Mr. President, you are  going to take taxes and that is how we  are going to address the problem, we,  the Republicans, are not buying it. It  has to be across the board, and that is  the way we should approach it.  But I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that  if this body is serious about really ad dressing the economic problems of the  country and the deficit, the first thing  you should do is to pull the ridiculous  reconciliation, tax increase, and spend ing bill on welfare  that you have  scheduled for next week. Then we will  see if you are serious. Then we can get  on with the serious business of the  country.  THE EFFECTS OF SEQUESTRA TION ON AGRICULTURE  <Mr. THOMAS of Georgia asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1987
384,House,100,-0.14,1215,20,Mr. THOMAS of Georgia.," Mr.  Speaker, in the simplest terms, seques tration will mean the removal of 8.5  percent from each of our farmers' in comes. That  reduction will  literally  come out of the hides of our farmers  at a time when they have shown the  first signs of recovery from a financial  crisis equal to the days of the Great  Depression.  It is unanimously agreed that the  farm bill is bearing the fruits of suc cess planned on by the Congress when  it was drafted in 1985. This is clearly  illustrated by the fact that farm prices  are rising and exports are increasing.  The cost to the taxpayers for the  U.S. farm program is expected to drop  37 percent-to $16.2 billion-in fiscal  year 1988 compared with 1986 levels,  according to the revised budget esti mates of the Office of Management  and Budget. In large part, that reduc tion is due to the fact that the 1988  price support figures, which have al ready been announced, fall significant ly below 1987  levels with an 8.5 per cent cut under Gramm-Rudman-Hol lings,  these  payments  to  farmers  would decline even further.  The  Agriculture  Committee  has  carefully drafted its recommendations  to reach the $1.3 billion cut needed to  meet its budget reconciliation. Those  cuts were designed to provide the most  painless impact possible on our agri cultural  community. Defeat of  the  budget reconciliation and allowing se questration to  take effect will mean  that we are opening a Pandora's box  of across-the-board problems for U.S.  farmers and this could easily mean the  difference between a farmer staying in  business or simply becoming another  statistic as a foreclosure.  Therefore,  I would urge my  col leagues to work in a bipartisan effort  to avoid sequestration.

They have forgotten completely or  refused  to  acknowledge  that  the  lowest unemployment rate in a genera tion is also the President's. The steady  growth for 60 months of the economy  is also  the President's. The keeping  down of  inflation  is also  the Presi dent's. The gross national product up surge of the last 60 months is also the  President's.  The President of the United States  is correct. This economy, so long as we  do not blast it away, is in good shape.  All we need to do as a people and as a  Congress  is  to have confidence  that  the strongest Nation in the world will  remain strong in every arena.

386,House,100,-0.41,1215,20,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  take this time to publicly thank the  President for accepting your invitation  to meet at a bipartisan summit to ad dress the causes of the stock market  crash this week. Most Americans al ready know that one of the reasons for  the crash is that we as a nation are  living  too high,  spending  too much  money, accumulating  too much pri vate and public debt.  Mr. Speaker, I propose for consider ation at the summit the establishment  of a national energy policy, the result  of which would reduce the trade defi cit. We cannot afford to spend $40 bil lion a year for foreign oil. This would  also  reduce  the trade deficit,  reduce  the budget deficit, by cutting the cost  of maintaining the farm programs and  make us energy independent, provide a  clean environment because air would  be cleaner for us.  Mr. Speaker, proposing a national  energy policy at the economic summit  will be an important step toward fiscal  sanity.

There  have been, but not of covered individ uals, not the individuals that this leg islation focuses upon.  The reason that individuals such as  myself are so uncomfortable not only  with the current law, but a new law  that even broadens the scope, has to  do with a very fundamental law in this  country, the supreme law of the land,  the Constitution.  An individual whom I admire great ly, an individual who served very capa bly in the office of Attorney General  under former President Jimmy Carter,  a member of a party different from  my own, Griffin Bell, testified before  our subcommittee and made a number  of points which I would like to share  with this body.  The points that he made with re spect to the unconstitutionality of this  statute was, and I quote:  First, in my view, the statute is unconsti tutional in that it intrudes on the duty and  right of the President to faithfully execute  the law as is provided in our Constitution.  The Independent Counsel, in essence, is an other attorney general-pro tanto-and in  part displaces the Attorney General and the  Department of Justice. The  Independent  Counsel is not an agent of the President but  of the courts and reports to the courts and  the Congress. In no way can an Independent  Counsel be classified as an ""inferior officer""  subject to being appointed under Article II  of the Constitution. This ""inferior officer""  has the unfettered discretion to prosecute  the  President  himself. An  Independent  Counsel is part and parcel of the federal law  enforcement function which is reserved to  the President under our Constitution.  It may be said that the question of consti tutionality  is  something  reserved  to  the  courts, but I am of the President Andrew  Jackson school which is that it is the duty  of every member of the government, wheth er the President or individual members of  Congress or  the courts,  to  interpret and  uphold our Constitution. We should not act  if we have a doubt as to the constitutional ity of a proposed law.  Second,  the  Independent Counsel oper ation seems to me to be contrary to our pre cept of equal protection of the laws. It sets  aside a small group of public officials to be  treated differently  from other American  citizens. They are handled by a special in vestigator. The investigation is announced  under great notoriety, and any conclusion  reached is likewise notorious. Other citizens  are  investigated without announcement indeed usually under great confidentiality  given  the secrecy of the grand  jury rule,  Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 6(e),  and the practice of the Department of Jus tice in not commenting on ongoing investi gations. Usually the fact of an investigation  is never known if there is no indictment.  This is completely contrary to the practice  in the Independent Counsel cases to date.  Third, the Independent Counsel provision  and operation seems to me to be against the  public interest. It is an operation from be ginning to end which is fraught with great  publicity and seems almost to be set up to  create publicity. It indicates to the rest of  the world, when the contrary is true, that  our government is in a state of disarray and  operated by people so unworthy of trust as  to be under investigation in a much publi cized manner.

394,Senate,100,0.346,1423,20,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  rise today to pay tribute to my State's  oldest  statewide  newspaper-the  Tundra Times-on its 25th anniversa ry. This paper truly deserves recogni tion because  it serves an  important  purpose  in my State of Alaska. The  Tundra Times reflects the interests of  a significant population group in my  State-the Alaska Native people. The  paper's news stories, features and edi torials reflect the concerns and ideals  of Alaska Natives who live in approxi mately 200 villages scattered through out some 580,000 square miles.  The birth of the Tundra Times is an  interesting one.  In the early 1960's,  the Alaska Native people in northwest  Alaska were concerned about the ef fects of proposed atomic testing near  their villages, particularly how  that  testing would affect their subsistence  lifestyle. Native leaders met to discuss  how their villages could ban together  to voice their objections. That unified  voice became the voice of the Tundra  Times. The paper started in 1962 and  Howard Rock, one of the Native lead ers, was chosen as its editor and pub lisher.  Over the years,  the Tundra Times  has meant a lot of things to a lot of  people in my State-Native and non Native alike.  In the late 1960's and  1970's, it meant getting detailed cover age of probably  the single greatest  news event  for Alaska Natives-the  debate of the 1971 law which created  the Alaska Native Claims Settlement  Act. Many Alaskans  followed  the  paper to read about what was going on  back in Washington, DC, and what Na tives in the State thought about enact ing this legislation.  The  Settlement  Act  established  Native, regional, and village corpora tions as an alternative to choosing the  traditional method  of  establishing  Indian reservations, as in the lower 48.  The corporations manage Native land  throughout the State of Alaska, and  presently prohibit the sale of Native  stock in those corporations until 1991.  It's interesting to note that as we  pay tribute to this great paper, Con gress is now considering amendments  to  the Settlement Act. The Alaska  Native people feel that as time rolls on  and 1991 fast approaches, the Natives  must be prepared to deal with that  day, under current  law, when  their  stock can be sold. The Tundra Times  has been  consistently  covering  the  progress of amendments  to ANCSA,  and I commend them for  their fair  and thorough reporting.  The Tundra Times has meant educa tion on alcoholism, a disease which is  unfortunately and tragically prevalent  in Alaska and among our Native popu lation. The paper has championed the  cause to combat alcoholism by careful ly reporting on the problem in Alas ka's Native villages, small communities  and cities, and by covering events and  individuals who are seeking a solution  to the problem.  The paper has explored other criti cal social problems for Native people.  It has successfully brought State at tention to the need for quality educa tion for Native youth in the villages.  Education is what the paper has also  meant to non-Natives in my State. The  Tundra Times has been a great re source  for  individuals who want  to  better understand where Alaska Na tives are coming from on many differ ent issues. It gives a perspective that  should not be overlooked.  Since the days of Howard Rock, the  Tundra Times has meant an active  communications  link  for Native vil lages throughout rural Alaska. For 25  years,  it has brought villages  and  small communities together to speak  with one voice.  Alaska  is  currently  experiencing  some rough economic times, and some  small  businesses  have  fared  better  than others. The Tundra Times be cause of its dedication to the Native  people has weathered a bumpy road  for 25 years. That's something worth  recognizing.  I salute the Times and its small staff  and all the individuals who have con tributed stories to the paper over the  years. Although it may not be me, it is  my hope  that another U.S. Senator  from Alaska will be standing here in  the year  2012  to  congratulate  the  paper on  its 50th anniversary. The  paper is that important to our State.e  TRIBUTE TO PAUL GANN  e ",1987
395,,100,-0.308,1436,20,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker,  last week,  the  United States Trade Representative was pre sented with extensive  testimony about  the  widespread use of exploited child  labor  in  Thailand. A petition has been presented as  part of  this  year's GSP annual  review  to  revoke duty-free trade benefits from Thailand  because of the child  labor situation existing  there.  Following is another installment in  the six part series entitled  ""Stolen Childhood""  that  appeared  in  the Cox Newspapers over  the  summer.  It details  the bleak circumstances  confronting many Thai children sent to Bang kok to help support their families.  [From the Atlanta <GA> Constitution, June  23, 1987]  FoR THAI CHILDREN, TRAIN STATION OFFERS  ONE-WAY TRIP TO EXPLOITATION  <My Marcia KunsteD  BANGKOK,  Thailand-For  thousands  of  Thai children, the Hua Lampong train sta tion has been a gateway  to exploitation.  Once a year, it is a gateway out.  The happy time is the Chinese New Year,  when ethnic Chinese Owners of shops and  factories give a holiday  to  their workers,  many of whom are migrants  from debt ridden farms or landless families in the im poverished northeast.  Seven girls clustered on a bench were  going home last January after working at a  tiny Bangkok garment factory.  Not m1ly was it their first trip back, this  was their first full day off in a year.  Ladda Pimwan, 15, leaned against a girl friend. The seven had arrived early and had  yet to endure a nine-hour train ride and an  hour's bus drive to their village of Baan As  Kaew. It would be a wearying trip, but yes,  Ladda nodded shyly before turning her face  into her friend's shoulder, she couldn't wait  to see her family at the end of the line.  The girls came to the city, they said, be cause their families need the money. Their  wages were about $24  a month-a  little  more than 7 cents an hour for working 74hour weeks-but one girl said she managed  to send half of it home.  The outbound  trains were  filled with  youngsters such as Ladda last Chinese New  Year's. The  rest of  the year,  especially  during the dry season, when northeastern  October 21, 1987  families become desperate for even meager  earnings, children  travel  inbound  to  jobs  that sap their strength for pennies an hour.  The Hua Lampong train station often is the  interchange that gets them from the farm  to the factory.  That is when it becomes the gateway to  exploitation. Bangkok's main train station is  haunted  by  ""fisherwomen""  and  ""fisher men,""  the  job brokers who cast about in  streams of migrants for naive children look ing for work in the city. These agents prowl  the platform when the dawn train pulls in  from the northeast.  CHILDREN COMMITTED TO YEAR'S WORK IN  FACTORY  Fisherwomen are kind to the new arrivals,  offering to help them find work. Too often,  they find them jobs with 15-hour workdays.  They and Bangkok employers know these  kids will be cheap hires.  The brokers may be independent agents,  but more likely they represent one of the  dozen job agencies that line nearby streets streets that smell of urine and rotting gar bage.  Newspapers here periodically report sto ries such as the rescue by police last year of  18 girls working in a  textile factory. The  girls, most ages 12 to 14, said they worked 15  hours a day for food scraps and a few cents  pay and were locked in a room to sleep.  The owner, arrested on charges of child  slavery and false imprisonment, told police  that he got most of the children from a job  agency near the Hua Lampong station.  A year earlier, 64 children ages 13  to 15  were rescued from a mosquito-net factory  where they had labored from 6 a.m. to mid night every day. The train station agencies  were reported to have paid the parents $80  to $160 for each child, which committed the  children to a year's work in the factory.  The few job agency bosses who agreed to  talk claimed they place people 16 or older in  factories, in compliance with Thai law.  Thongma Sonboonom, wife of the head of  Swai Job Agency, said her biggest problems  are with the girls she places, not the em ployers. ""A  lot of  times girls don't keep  their contracts,""  she complained,  so. the  agency must replace them at no charge to  the employer.  She said her agents do find young workers  among  the migrants at the  train station,  just around  the corner from her second story office at the top of a filthy, unlighted  stairway.  Her agency was cited in a human rights  newsletter as placing a 10-year-old girl in a  factory where she worked for seven months.  Then she became a domestic servant and  was raped by her boss.  Asked  about  her  age  policies,  Ms.  Thongma said: ""I never place anyone in a  factory who is under 16.""  EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES CHECKED ONLY FOR  PERMITS  She does send younger children to domes tic work, Ms. Thongma said,  then volun teered  that  employers  sometime make  sexual advances toward the girls. She main tained that the bosses never do anything  too serious.  ""Nobody  I've ever sent has  raped,"" she said.  The Center of Concern for Child Labor in  Bangkok has found that independent bro kers make $11 to $15 for every child they  bring from rural villages  to Bangkok  job  placement agency.

402,,100,-0.483,783,26,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor a distinguished and very able  gentleman, Mr. Ray A. Barnhart, who is retir ing from his position as Federal Highway Ad ministrator at  the end of this year. Ray has  headed  the Federal Highway Administration  for the last 7 years.  In my opinion, there has  been no more able or forthright administrator  at the Department of Transportation during his  tenure.  In my capacity as chairman of the Transpor tation Appropriations Subcommittee,  I have  dealt with Ray on many occasions. Some times we have been on the same side, some times not. But no matter what  the circum stances,  the  things  I could always count on  from Ray were professio11alism and straight  talk. Those are valued commodities in Washington.  Mr. Speaker, the Federal Highway Adminis tration  rarely makes  the  front pages. But,  if  you  talk  to  the executives and policymakers  around  town, you will  find  that  the Federal  Highway Administration has a  reputation as  one of the better managed and more effective  Federal agencies anywhere  in Government.  They have built a transportation network that  is by far the best in the world. This is a tribute  to the men and women of the Federal High way  Administration,  and  to Ray  Barnhart  whose stewardship has been exemplary.  I extend my congratulations to Ray for a job  well done. And, as long as he is not running  tor office,  I wish him  the very best  for  the  future.  ~  ",1987

Mr.  Speaker, when  the  football  season  started for district 5-AAAA, no one expected  the Yellowjackets to do more than put up a  good  fight against other high-ranked district  and northeast Texas  teams, such as McKin ney  (State champion, 1979), Denison  (State  champion, 1984), Paris (ranked in the top 10  all year), Ennis, and others. To add to YellowDecember 22, 1987  jacket concerns,  there was a change  in  the  head coaching position just before our season  began-a season that would see us lose two  of the first three games. Then-the cinderella like climb began for Rockwall High School one  that led to  the finals-a battle between  the best team  in north Texas, and  the best  team in south Texas. In this game there could  be no loser and there was none. At the end of  the 48 minute contest at Texas A&M Kyle  Field last Saturday, the defending State AAAA  champion, West Orange-Stark  (ranked ninth  nationally) had outscored our Jackets by a  mere 1 0 points-17 to 7. No one in Rockwall  feels  that we suffered a defeat, but all  feel  that our team, week after week, performed a  miracle-and  I can't start  to  tell  you how  proud we all are of them. Our Yellowjackets  are champions and the only reason Troy Miller  should not be named  ""coach of  the year""  would be that he is named ""coach of the cen tury."" The Yellowjackets, quarterbacked by  Andy Hollon, are as follows:  Kevin Kaufman, Chad Keck, David Piepen burg,  Daron Gillian,  Keith Williams, Chris  Burks, Dallas Eshelman Rodney Glaze, Kelly  Johns, Robbie Birleson, Maika Hayes, Bran don Kennedy, Tony McGuire, Brian Thomas,  Brant Gillen, Wayman Moore, Kris Mason,  Byron Cromer, Brian McCormick, Jim White.

The trainers are: Jim Harris, Mike Thomas,  Gary Godwin, and the Rockwall High School  principal is Ron Eubanks.  No one could be more proud of this team  effort. Fans, parents, relatives, and supporters  are all proud and pleased with our Yellowjack ets. Mr. Speaker, as we adjourn today-and  as we close out  the  first half of  the 1 OOth  Congress-let us adjourn in recognition of the  Rockwall Fighting Yellowjackets of 1987-the  team who never quit-who were winners on  the gridiron and will certainly be winners and  leaders in the years that are ahead of them.
