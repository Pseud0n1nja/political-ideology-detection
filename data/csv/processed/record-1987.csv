2,10,2,Mr. ROEMER.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank, along with my colleague, Mr.  TAUZIN, and I am sure my colleagues  who follow, Mr. LIVINGSTON particular ly,  the leadership of the House and  the committees involved in working on  this problem.  I would  like  to  thank  JIM HOWARD specifically and BOB ROE.  Chairman RoE has worked with the  Louisiana delegation for some time in  trying to do the right thing, trying to  draw  the  line  legally  between our  desire for clean water and our need to  protect the interests of the citizens of  Louisiana, both those who have  jobs  involved  and  those who drink our  water.  The problem with the clean water  bill was not the heart of the bill. It  was good. We supported  it for  that  reason. But section 306 in that bill did  undercut the rights of the State and  concerns of  the citizens over clean  water vis-a-vis the dumping of gypsum  in the Mississippi River.  0 1235  This solution found  in the concur rent resolution, drafted in large part  by  the gentleman  from New Jersey  [Mr. RoE], with some help from the  Louisiana delegation,  is an excellent  solution.  It does not mean that the problem  will go away;  it just means that the  gypsum cannot be dumped arbitrarily  and without some findings as to the  health results. I think it is the higher  ground; I think it is the clean ground,  and if we put these two items togeth er, H.R. 1, the clean water bill, and the  concurrent  resolution <H. Con. Res.  24), I think we have a chance to attest  to  the people of Louisiana  that we  have done the right thing.  So, in closing, I would like to thank  my colleagues in the Louisiana delega tion who have worked most diligently  on  this,  including  the gentlewoman  from Louisiana [Mrs. BoGGs] and the  gentleman from Louisiana  [Mr. Liv INGSTON] and others. I would also like  to thank the leadership of the Com mittee on Public Works and Transpor tation and the leadership of the House  of Representatives.  ",1987
3,10,2,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the able  gentlemen from Louisiana  [Mr. Liv INGSTON],  a  former member of our  Committee  on  Public Works  and  Transportation.  ",1987
4,10,2,Mr. LIVINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  want to join with my colleagues, the  gentlemen from Louisiana, Mr. TAUZIN  and Mr. RoEMER, and with the dean of  our delegation, the gentlewoman from  Louisiana, LINDY BOGGS,  in thanking  the leadership on both sides, the gen tlemen from New Jersey, Mr. HowARD  and Mr. RoE, on the Democratic side,  the gentleman  from Arkansas, Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT,  and  the gentleman  from Minnesota, Mr. STANGELAND, on  the Republican side for their working  with the Louisiana delegation to cure  this problem.  In  fact,  section 306 was defective  when it was first concocted. There is  still  some degree of mystery about  how it was concocted, and I am still  deeply resentful that there was some  representation made by non-Members  of the House to Members of the other  body to the effect that the Louisiana  delegation was all on board on  this  provision as  it  is  currently written.  That simply was not the case, but we  have  to come  together here  in  the  House today in a somewhat convolut ed procedure to remedy what was done  previously.  I  just want to reemphasize how ap preciative I am of the leadership for  their working together with the Lou isiana  delegation  in  rectifying  this  past mistake.  In fact, the provision was vague as it  was originally written. It appeared as  if it might have mandated the dump ing of harmful materials in the river.  The provision that we are about today,  House  Concurrent  Resolution  24,  clearly sets forth the fact that the ma terials,  if,  in fact,  they are harmful,  will not go  into  the  river without  ample opportunity granted  to oppo nents to object.  This provision allows the experts to  weigh in on this most serious problem  and to make their own determination  about its impact. It retains to all par ties  the option of  taking their case  through  the natural processes, as  if  they might  have  done  before  this  problem arose.  We have passed H.R. 1. The other  body will  soon pass  a  like  edition.  House Concurrent Resolution 24,  if  passed here and  in  the Senate, will  amend section 306 to the agreement of  industry,  environmentalists,  the  sewage and water board, and the Lou isiana delegation. Again,  it is  in the  spirit of compromise and cooperation  with all parties that we are able  to  come here today to make this adjust ment and ultimately send on H.R. 1, as  it should have been sent initially, to  the President for his signature.  I want to again thank all the leaders  for working together with us and hope  that this provision will be expeditious ly passed, not only in the House, but  in the other body as well, and that it  will be added to the major bill-H.R.  l-as it currently stands.

Mr. Speaker, I have no further re quests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore <Mr.  MURTHA).  The  question  is  on  the  motion offered by the gentleman from  New  Jersey  [Mr. HowARD]  that  the  House suspend the rules and agree to  the concurrent resolution, House Con current Resolution 24.

8,23,2,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, today,  along with 55 of my colleagues, I am  introducing the Prompt Payment Act  Amendments of 1987. The purpose of  this legislation is simple and direct; To  eliminate  the ambiguities and close  the loopholes in the Prompt Payment  Act of 1982. My colleagues will recall  that the Prompt Payment Act address es problems  in getting  the Federal  Government to pay its bills on time to  those contractors who furnish goods  and services to the Government.  At the outset, let me point out that  the amendments to the Prompt Pay ment Act made by this bill are identi cal to those contained in S. 2479, the  Prompt  Payment  Amendments  of  1986. S. 2479 was unanimously passed  by the Senate in the closing days of  the  99th  Congress.  Unfortunately,  time did not allow for consideration of  this important measure in the House.  The Prompt Payment Act has led to  significant  improvements  in  the bill paying practices of the Federal Gov ernment. Unfortunately, many Feder al agencies exploit ambiguities or loop holes in the act to pay contractors late  while avoiding late payment interest  penalties called for in the act.  ",1987
9,36,2,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, as  chairman of the Committee on Small  Business, I am pleased to join as a co sponsor of the Prompt Payment Act  Amendments of 1987, which is being  introduced by my good  friend  from  Tennessee, Senator SASSER. The small  business community has consistently  sought vigorous enforcement of  the  Prompt Payment Act of 1982,  ever  since they won the hard-fought fight  to see it enacted into law. Having had  4 years of experience under the act,  they now are calling upon Congress to  close loopholes and clarify certain pro visions, which the executive agencies  have skillfully used to deny the act's  protections  to many  small business  government contractors.  The Prompt Payment Act Amend ments of 1987 make the same modifi cations to the Prompt Payment Act as  S. 2479, which passed the Senate in  the closing days of the 99th Congress  but which, unfortunately, was not con sidered by the House. S. 2479, was in troduced by Senator TRIBLE, who was  then a member of the Small Business  Committee, and was  the product of  oversight hearings conducted by our  committee. These were first congres sional oversight hearings  conducted  regarding the implementation of the  Prompt Payment Act. At the time of  its passage, S. 2479 had garnered 44 co sponsors, including a majority of the  members of the Small Business Com mittee. Senator SASSER's bill, which  has Senator TRIBLE as its principal co sponsor, has won even stronger bipar tisan support with 56 cosponsors.  The Small Business Committee has  been in the forefront of the effort to  see that Government contractors, and  especially small business government  contractors, who have performed their  contracts  to  the Government's satis faction are paid in a timely fashion, or  else  awarded  late-payment  interest  penalties as provided  in  the act.  would  like  to  share with my  col leagues, Mr. President, a brief history  of  the Small Business Committee's  long-term dedication  to prompt pay  reform.

12,140,2,Mr.  BYRD.," Mr.  President,  the  Senate will begin at 2 p.m.  today to  resume the debate on the amendment  offered by Mr. DoLE in the nature of a  substitute to House bill H.R. 1,  the  clean water bill. There will be 2 hours  of debate equally divided and, at 4  p.m.,  there will  be  a  rollcall vote,  which has previously been ordered,  not the amendment by Mr. DoLE.  Immediately upon the disposition of  that amendment, the Senate will pro ceed to vote on H.R. 1, the House bill  on clean water, and immediately upon  the disposition of the House bill, the  Senate then will take up the concur rent resolution to make a correction in  the enrollment of H.R. 1. No rollcall  vote on that resolution is anticipated.  Immediately upon the disposition of  that concurrent resolution, the Senate  will vote on the resolution on human  rights in the Soviet Union, and that  will be a  rollcall vote. Three rollcall  votes, therefore, have been previously  ordered and the second and third roll call votes today will be limited to 10  minutes each.  Mr. President, upon the disposition,  then, of the human rights resolution,  barring any further action, and I do  not  foresee  any at  the moment,  I  would propose to go over until tomor row. However-and I have not men tioned  this  to  the distinguished Re publican leader; I had asked my staff  earlier today to begin talking with the  staff of the Republican leader, and we  would have to clear this with Senator  FORD  and Senator  STEVENS-if, per chance, it is the feeling of the chair man and ranking member of the Com mittee on Rules and Administration  that the funding resolutions for com mittees could be brought up on tomor row, even though they will only be re ported from the committee on tomor row, if there are indications that there  will not be any controversy or much  controversy and  they are willing  to  have those resolutions brought up on  tomorrow and disposed of on tomor row, it would be my plan  then  to go  over until Monday. But I will be dis cussing  this with  the  Republican  leader, who has not had a chance to  pursue  it,  and hopefully  it can be  cleared. If it cannot be done, then the  Senate will be in on Friday.  Mr. President, I reserve the balance  of my time.  RECOGNITION OF THE  MINORITY LEADER  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  WIRTH). Under the standing order, the  minority leader is recognized.  COMMITTEE FUNDING  RESOLUTIONS  ",1987
13,140,2,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I  thank  the distinguished majority leader. We  will pursue the possibility of clearing  the committee funding resolutions. I  understand  there could be, possibly,  one  amendment on  staff  allowance  that could be offered. I have asked my  staff to see precisely what the amend ment might be and check with Senator  STEVENS, who is the ranking Republi can on the Rules Committee.  So we would hope  that we  could  work out something to dispose of the  committee  funding  resolutions,  I  would assume, unless  there  is  some  controversy, without votes. Most of  them are rather routine. Perhaps we  could do that tomorrow. As the distin guished minority  leader  indicated,  there is also the arms control resolu tion which,  I understand,  is  in  the  final stages of clearance. Perhaps that  could be ready, as he suggested, by to morrow.  So it would be my hope that we can  accommodate the distinguished major ity leader. As I have said at the outset,  it is good to expedite the business of  the Senate. We want to be a party to  it. That may not always be possible. It  seems to me in these early days there  is no need for much pushing and haul ing. We will have enough of that I  assume later on in the year.  BICENTENNIAL MINUTE  JANUARY 21, 1861: JEFFERSON DAVIS' FAREWELL  ADDRESS  ",1987
14,140,2,Mr.  DOLE.," Mr.  President,  this  Chamber has witnessed many dramat ic events in the 128 years that it has  served as the Senate's meeting place.  The joys and the sorrows that engage  our Nation invariably make their way  to this room. One of the most heart rending moments  in  the  Senate's  entire history occurred here, 126 years  ago today.  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

16,153,2,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, if the  junior Senator from. Hawaii will yield,  I wish to state for the record that I  fully agree with his expressed under standing of  the  legislative  intent of  section 306 of H.R. 1.  ",1987
17,153,2,Mr. MATSUNAGA.," I thank the Sen ator from Rhode Island.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",1987
18,153,2,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President,  I  would like to comment briefly in re sponse to some of the remarks made  by  the distinguished Senator  from  Idaho  in  support of  the substitute  amendment and in opposition to H.R.  1, the legislation that has been over whelmingly approved by the Congress  previously.  Just two points: The Senator argues  that sewage treatment preventing the  pollution of our Nation's waters ought  not to be a responsibility of Govern ment. He said that the answer to this  problem is to turn the private sector  loose on it, and we ought not to have  any kind of Government program. My  response to that is that before 1972 we  did not have any significant Federal  program to deal with the problem of  water pollution in our country. And as  a result, almost every major river in  the United States was a stinking, open  sewer. The American people could not  swim. They could not fish. They could  not boat in their Nation's rivers.  Since 1972, since we passed the Fed eral Clean Water Act, hundreds and  hundreds  of American  rivers  have  been cleaned up. And  the American  people overwhelmingly want this pro gram to continue.  So in response to that point, I say  that we have had a  long experience  with what  the Senator  from  Idaho  suggested is the answer to this prob lem, and it was demonstrably not the  answer  to  the problem. The answer  lies in passing H.R. 1.  Finally, before I yield to the distin guished Senator from Massachusetts,  who I note has come onto the floor, I  would respond to a second point made  by the Senator from  Idaho. He op posed that provision in H.R. 1 which  deals with nonpoint sources of pollu tion by repeating the statement made  by the distinguished minority leader  last week who said it is Federal land  use planning. He said it is a mandatory  program that will force the farmers to  do what they otherwise would not do.  I say that is absolutely false. There  is nothing in this bill which requires  any State in the country to adopt a  program to deal with nonpoint source  pollution. The bill provides that each  State will make an assessment of the  problem. If a State does not make an  assessment of the problem, the EPA  will make one in that State for the  purpose of establishing national data  on  this problem. This  is a problem  which the EPA itself, the Reagan ad ministration EPA,  says causes more  than half of the remaining water pol lution problem. After that, no State is  compelled to adopt a program to con trol nonpoint source pollution.  If the State of Idaho, the State of   Kansas,  the State of Maine or any  other State says, ""We do not want a  program,"" that is it, there will be no  program.  The decision on whether to adopt a  control program with respect to non point source pollution  is  entirely a  State decision. If a State does decide  to go forward, as most sensible States  will, then there is a participating pro gram in which they can request assist ance. So it is absolutely false, untrue,  and misleading for anyone to say that  this is Federal land use planning.  The bill was carefully crafted with  the interests of the States in mind,  and that is what is contained in the  bill.  I urge Members of  the Senate  to  look  at  the  provisions  of  the bill  before making a  judgment with  re spect to this allegation regarding Fed eral land use planning.  Mr. President, I now yield 3 minutes  to the Senator from Massachusetts.  ",1987
19,153,2,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Massachusetts.  ,1987
20,153,2,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  I  think it is only appropriate that the  Senate of the United States face this  extremely compelling issue as one of  the first items on the agenda of this  Congress. I think one of our most im portant  responsibilities  is  to  try  to  ensure that America the Beautiful will  be inherited by the next generation.  One of the key elements in America  the Beautiful  is  having  the  clean  streams, clean rivers, and clean har bors which have been so much a part  of our history and tradition and which  have been despoiled in past years, par ticularly during  the  industrialization  of America.  Now we are at a critical crossroads.  We must face the crossroads by pass ing this measure in a bipartisan way  this afternoon.  I wish to speak about the region and  the State which I represent and about  what  this  is going  to mean  in  the  cleaning up of one of the important  areas of New England-the Boston  Harbor.  The kinds of efforts which are being  undertaken at  the State  level  and  among the communities that border  on the harbor have really been out standing. Many of those people who  live in the area near the harbor have  middle or lower incomes. They are pre pared  to see a dramatic  increase  in  their rates in order to invest in trying  to provide for the cleaning up of one  of the most important waterways  in  our country at this time.  The way  this program has been  fashioned, the way it is supported by  the States and the local communities  is a  tribute  to  the very deliberative  and bipartisan style by the members  of  this  committee. This  legislation  really offers enormous hope and op portunity to those who are committed  to the clean water of this country.  It has important and long-lasting im plications in terms of eliminating from  our streams, rivers, and harbors, the  hazards which can affect the quality  of  health  of  the most  vulnerable  people in our society, the children in  our Nation. This  legislation makes  sense from every point of view. It is a  sound investment in America.  Many people on this floor are debat ing this bill on the budget issue. Cer tainly, that is a consideration. But the  most important consideration is what  we are doing for our country. This is  the bill,  this is  the time,  this is the  issue. I am hopeful that this bill, H.R.  1, will be passed by an overwhelming  majority on both sides of the aisle.  Mr. President, I support H.R. 1 and I  urge my Senate colleagues  to vote once again-to send a  strong Clean  Water Act to the President. This bill  addresses the critical nationwide prob lems of polluted harbors and water ways and provides vitally needed re sources for  the construction of new  sewage treatment facilities  to ensure  clean waters for the future.  Last year,  in an  ill-advised action,  President Reagan chose to pocket veto  the bill after Congress had adjourned,  but now we have a chance to pass it  again and enact it into law.  I am especially pleased that the bill  contains $100 million for the cleanup  and revitalization of one of the Com monwealth's most  important natural  and  economic  resources-Boston  Harbor. Few cities have a resource as  magnificent  as  the harbor.  It  is  a  unique asset that witnessed a signifi cant part of our Nation's history. With  its scenic shoreline, its 30 islands and  thriving port facilities, the harbor is a  priceless economic and environmental  treasure.  It has suffered heavy environmental  damage from the tremendous industri al  and  residential  growth  of  the  Boston area in recent decades. The re sulting pollution and decay has threat ened the natural beauty of the harbor  and  jeopardized  the  prospects  of  ",1987
21,166,2,Mr.  BINGAMAN.," Mr.  President,  today I rise to speak about a matter of  critical importance to the proper man agement of one of this Nation's most  precious resources. Due to the arid cli mate in my own State, the value of  water  is  temendous. Precipitation  is  not plentiful and water is not natually  renewed as fast as it is used. There fore, water treatment facilities carry a  great  burden  in  providing  quality  water for the citizens of New Mexico.  It is for this reason that I urge swift  passage of S. 1, a bill to fund the initi ation  and  continuation  of much  needed  water  treatement  projects  across  this  country.  In addition  to  such projects, water pollution prob lems  requiring  immediate  attention  continue to rise at alarming rates and  cry out for immediate attention.  This bill will renew funding for ex isting water  pollution  control  pro grams, and begin efforts  to control  certain pollution problems  that  the  current law has not given proper at tention to.  The measure also gradually phases  out the Federal Construction Grants  Program. To ease  the  transition  to  State and local responsibility, the bill  provides grants for the establishment  of State  revolving  loan  funds. The  State revolving funds would be used to  make low-interest loans to communi ties in need of sewage treatment sys tems. Loan repayments would later be  used to make new loans, thus provid ing a self-sustaining source of money  for States to finance local construction  after the Federal Construction Grants  Program ends.  A Federal grants program  to help  cities construct sewage treatment sys tems is badly in need of reauthoriza tion.  In addition,  this bill creates a  new State-Federal program to control  polluted  runoff  from  farmland  and  city streets, tightens controls on toxic  pollutants, and authorizes funding for  various other activities to clean up the  Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams. To gether, the State revolving fund pro grams  and  the  construction  grants  would  receive $18 billion over fiscal  years 1986 through 1994.  While this is an enormous figure, I  believe that this is a  reasonable and  responsible figure for several reasons.  Without  this reauthorization, com munities in New Mexico would lose as  much as $11.9 million. Albuquerque,  for example, would  lose $5.2 million  for continuation of waste water  in struction and, as a result, it would put  a halt to the $7 million total project.  While $18 billion may be interpreted  by some to be exorbitant, it is, in fact,  small compared to the total cost of  needed projects, now estimated by the  Environmental Protection Agency  to  be over $75 billion. The fact is that the  longer we wait to fund these needed  projects, the higher the cost will be.  So it is cost efficient to act now.  In  addition,  this  authorization  is  consistent with the commitment, made  by the administration as part of the  1981 amendments to the Clean Water  Act, to support funding at the $2.4 bil lion level through fiscal year 1991. In  return for this long-term funding com mitment, Congress  agreed  to  lower  annual authorizations-authorizations  in fiscal year 1979 and 1980 were $5  billion-a  lower  Federal  share  of  project costs-55 percent rather than  75 percent-and a  reduction  in  the  types of projects eligible for Federal  assistance. As a result, this legislation  is the fulfillment of the commitment  already made by the Federal Govern ment, and without it we are leaving  many local  jurisdictions in my State  and elsewhere high and dry.  Furthermore,  of  the  $18  billion  amount, $8.4 billion will be used to es tablish State  revolving  loan  funds.  These State funds will be paid back by  communities and will provide a  long term investment in water quality fa cilities.  This bill  is a very  responsible ap proach to a critical problem. It repre sents  a  substantial  compromise  be tween the costs of the many necessary  water quality projects and the need to  control Federal spending. Most impor tantly, I feel that this legislation ad dresses the need to properly manage  and improve a resource that is certain ly a vital element in all biological proc esses;  in our water sources  lies  the  very basis for  life  itself. In light of  storm and farm runoff, industrial and  sewage pollution, acid rain and other  water contaminants, I believe that this  bill will have a beneficial effect on this  planet's  future  capacity  to  sustain  animal and plant life.  Again, I urge strong support for the  Clean Water Act of 1987. It is a wise  and  necessary  investment  in  our  future.  ",1987
22,166,2,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President,  4  months  ago,  the Senate  considered  legislation  to  reauthorize  the Clean  Water Act. This reauthorization was  literally years in development. It rep resented a true compromise, with sub stantial cost-sharing provisions, and a  revolving loan program as well as Fed eral grants. The legislation broadened  Federal responsibilities: Nonpoint pol lution and urban runoff, storm water  control,  the  cleanup  of  toxic  ""hot  spots""  for especially degraded water  quality, etc. At the same time, the leg islation retained a solid financial com mitment  in  the part of the Federal  Government to assist regions and lo calities with  the  less glamorous but  ",1987
23,179,2,Mr. MITCHELL.," As  I understand  the time situation, the vote will occur  at 4 p.m. Senator DoLE has reserved to  him the time between 3:45 and 4 p.m.,  the final 15 minutes.  ",1987
24,179,2,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator is correct.  ,1987
25,179,2,Mr. MITCHELL.," Therefore,  that  leaves approximately 2 minutes which  I shall now use to sum up in behalf of  the  opponents  of  the  substitute  amendment.  Mr. President,  this amendment  in  the nature of a substitute proposes to  spend $12 billion over 8 years as op posed to the $18 billion over 9 years in  the House bill now pending before us.  The House bill was unanimously ap proved by the House and Senate last  year prior to its unfortunate veto by  the President.  The $18 billion is a small fraction of  the total needs for sewage treatment  and water pollution cleanup  in  this  country. It is,  itself, a compromise, a  very substantial compromise.  Second, the administration's substi tute would undermine  the nonpoint  pollution provisions of the bill, a sub stantive provision dealing with what  the Reagan administration's own EPA  says  is over half of  the  remaining  problem in terms of water pollution in  this country.  Finally, on  the principal  issue of  cost, the President says, ""We cannot  afford to clean up American waters.""  He says, ""We have to cut the amount  of money  being  spent  here,  even  though it is less than what is needed,  even though it is within the budget  resolution.""  Yet, at the very same time the Presi dent proposes a massive multibillion  dollar  increase  in foreign aid. There  are his priorities.  We cannot afford to clean up Ameri ca's waters, but, he says, we can afford  to increase by billions of dollars the  amount of  foreign  aid  the United  States is doling out all over the world.  Indeed,  the President proposes  to  spend in 1 year on foreign aid almost  as much as the Congress proposes to  spend  in 9 years  to keep American  waters clean.  So, Mr. President, I say the Senate  should reject this substitute and the  Senate should vote overwhelmingly in  favor of H.R. 1. I, along with my dis tinguished colleague, Senator CHAFEE,  urge the President not to again veto  this legislation but to sign it and move  forward and claim victory, which the  President is well entitled to do.  I thank the Chair.  ",1987

29,179,2,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I wish  to make three quick points. First, the  administration bill does not abide by  the commitment  that was made  in  1981 that $2.4 billion be allocated for  waste  treatment  facilities  for  clean  water each year for 10 years.  Second, the administration bill does  not provide for coverage for the non point source pollution, as was men tioned by  the distinguished Senator  from Maine.  Finally, the administration bill does  not provide for putting money in the  revolving fund, which is so essential to  getting this program on a sound foot ing.  I hope that the administration pro posal will be rejected, that H.R. 1 will  be approved unanimously, and  that  the President will sign it.  ",1987

31,179,2,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, we are  going to have a vote here in about 12  minutes. I know this matter has been  before the Senate. I know there is a  great deal of interest in not doing any thing other  than what we did  last  year.  I  supported the bill  last year.  The record is clear. Everybody that I  know of is for clean water. Some are in  this Chamber and some are not in the  Chamber.  So that is really not the argument. I  guess it is a question of fiscally respon sible.  I would like to think that we could  pass the substitute, that it would be  signed by  the President, and  there  would be another $12 billion, which  would be an increase of $6 billion over  the effort last year by the administra tion. It would send a  rather strong  signal.  I know there is not much time left,  but I would hope that my colleagues  have at least had the time to take a  look at the two proposals, H.R. 1 and  the so-called Dole substitute, and un derstand  the  reason  for  a Federal  ",1987

40,192,2,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, on behalf  of the esteemed Senator from Ohio  [Mr. GLENN] and. more than 72 of our  colleagues, I am today introducing a  joint resolution, and have asked for its  immediate  consideration  by  the  Senate. My reason for requesting ex peditious passage of this joint resolu tion is so that, assuming a companion  resolution  being  introduced  in  the  other body  is passed,  the President  will be able  to  issue  the  requested  proclamation on a timely basis.  Mr. President, we will, during  the  next several weeks, hear a great deal  about  that  tragic accident nearly 1  year ago, and the loss of seven brave  and wonderful people when the space  shuttle  was  destroyed  shortly after launch. We will, as we  should, be asked to think again about  the  sacrifice made by  those  coura geous Americans, and to reflect on the  meaning of the mission on which they  had embarked, and to which they had  dedicated themselves.  Those of us who were privileged to  know members of the Challenger crew  will recall the deep personal feelings  of grief and loss we felt on that tragic  day;  that sense of helplessness  that  comes to us all in the face of an irrevo cable loss; the futile hope that some how we will wake up to find it was just  a  terrible nightmare.  I know  that I  will never forget the inadequacy I felt  that afternoon as our colleague, Sena tor JoHN GLENN and I went down to  Kennedy Space Center, at the invita tion of Vice President Bush, to  join  him in conveying the President's and,  indeed,  the Nation's condolences  to  the family members of the crew, and  to try to be of some comfort to those  who had  lost  their  loved ones  that  day.  I must tell my colleagues, however,  of what is the most vivid memory of  that visit  to the crew quarters  that  evening. As we  stood  there,  in  that  room filled with so much sorrow and  pain, and in the rather awkward quiet ness that followed our brief comments  to the family members, June Scobee,  wife of Challenger's commander, Dick  Scobee,  responded. She stood  there,  with her crew family around her-and  shuttle crews develop  that kind of  bond, and it extends to their families and she said, ""Mr. Vice President; Sen ators,  I know  I  speak for all of us  when I  tell you that what we want,  and what we  know our  loved ones  would want, is for the space program  to continue.""  Rarely, Mr. President, have I seen  such indomitable spirit, or such cour age and bearing in the face of such an  overwhelming personal  tragedy. The  sun had barely set on the day that vis ited that tragedy on those wonderful,  devoted people gathered  together in  that room, and yet they thought, not  of themselves first, but of the dream  and the vision to which they and their  departed loved ones had been commit ted. That was  the message  June  Scobee wanted  to convey, above all  else that day. In her soft-spoken, yet  powerful  and determined way,  she  conveyed that message  to us clearly  and unmistakably. We were  deeply  moved by that experience, Mr. Presi dent, and came away from that visit  humbled to have been in the presence  of a group of people with that kind of  character.  Those words spoken to us that night  were only the beginning. The dedica tion they expressed did not end there.  During the weeks and months follow ing the accident, the immediate family  members of the crew stayed closed to  one another, sharing the burdens of  their loss, and sustaining one another  through the difficult times of the acci dent  investigation,  the salvage oper ations, and the many memorial serv ices  for  the  crew members  held  throughout the country. They talked  often of their hopes and dreams, and  of the mission for which the Challeng er crew members gave their lives. They  felt  the need  to do something even  beyond expressing continued support  for the space program, as June had  done on their behalf that night, and as  they had all done when they met later  with President and Mrs. Reagan  in  Houston, at the memorial service held  there  for  the crew. Their conversa tions led, ultimately, to the develop ment of a concept now embodied in an  organization formed by the immediate  family members, and  in an exciting  project called the Challenger Center.  The Challenger Center is, in effect,  the continuation of the final mission  of Challenger, and of what that mis sion could have begun had  it been  completed. As we all know, one of the  unique  things about that flight was  the inclusion in its crew of a teacher Christa McAuliffe, who was going to  conduct classes from orbit, and devel op an ongoing  series of  lessons  in  space sciences. But Christa's mission  was shared by all the crew members.  Many are not aware, Mr. President,  but student and teacher involvement  in experiments and studies on board  the shuttle has been a part of many of  the shuttle flights, and has already  contributed much to the enrichment  of education. Christa's orbiting class room would have been the most visible  demonstration of the enormous educa tional benefits of the space program,  and would have been an  incredible  stimulus to young people and teachers  to expand their academic interest into  the sciences. I am sure my colle&.gues  don't need to be reminded of the very  great need we have in this Nation to  expand the opportunities for science  ",1987
41,205,2,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent,  the Tax Reform Act of 1986  made several changes that will signifi cantly affect the tax liability of all of  the Nation's taxpayers. One of  the  provisions of the act raises the amount  that  taxpayers must have withheld  from wages from 80 percent to 90 per cent of tax liability. Individuals who  fail to meet the new withholding re quirement are subject to both penal ties and interest under section 6654 of  the Internal Revenue Code.  Today I am introducing legislation  along  with  Senators  DANFORTH,  .WALLOP, ARMSTRONG,  and BOSCHWITZ  that would waive the penalty and in terest provisions of section 6654  for  those individual taxpayers whose esti mated tax and withholding payments  satisfy at least the 80 percent test of  prior law. This waiver is temporary; it  will only apply until April 15, 1988.  And it only applies to individuals, not  to corporations.  Mr. President, anyone who has had  the opportunity to review  the latest  IRS W-4 withholding allowance form  will understand why it is  imperative  that this legislation be adopted. The  new withholding  form  is  incredibly  complex. At four pages in length, it is  twice as long as the form it replaced  and more complex than many actual  1040 income tax returns.  In order for many taxpayers to com pute  their withholding  allowances,  they will have to do a variety of com plex calculations and fill in as many as  46  separate  lines  of  information.  Indeed the form  is so complex that  IRS suggests that taxpayers consult  four  separate  IRS  publications  to  make sure that their withholding  is  correct.  One of the reasons we adopted the  Tax Reform Act of 1986 was to dimin ish some of the complexity that has  befuddled taxpayers  in recent years.  Unfortunately, the new W-4 does just  the opposite. I strongly urge that IRS  give serious consideration to replacing  the new W-4 with a shorter and sim pler form that is intelligible to those  of us who do not have graduate ac counting degrees.  Mr. President, I would note that last  week,  the distinguished chairman of  the Senate Finance Committee, Sena tor LLOYD BENTSEN, wrote to the IRS  asking the Service to  issue a similar  W-4  form. Although  I  applaud  the  chairman's action, I believe more must  be done to ensure that taxpayers are  not penalized for the bureaucratic in difference of the IRS.  The  failure of  IRS  to develop  a  simple and straightforward W-4 form  makes  it difficult,  if not  impossible,  for  most  individual  taxpayers  to  comply with the 90-percent withhold ing requirement that we adopted  in  the Tax Reform Act. I can assure you  that millions of taxpayers will make a  good faith effort to fill out the W -4  only to find out that when their tax  returns are due, they have not met the  90 percent test.  To subject  these  taxpayers  to  the  penalty and interest charges of section  6654 would  just not be fair. That is  why I have introduced this legislation.  It recognizes that taxpayers will inevi tably make errors in calculating their  withholding only because the IRS has  not provided a suitable form for calcu lating withholding. The  90-percent  withholding  requirement allows  tax payers little margin for error. This leg islation  allows  taxpayers  greater  leeway in 1987 to assess the appropriate amount to withhold without being  subjected to statutory penalties.  Once taxpayers have had a chance  to compare their 1987 withholding cal culations with their final 1987 tax li ability, they will be able to recompute  their withholding in 1988 to meet the  90-percent test. In the meantime, IRS  should make every effort to redesign  the current W -4.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the bill be included in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 350  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION I. YEAR EXTENSION OF WAIVER OF ESTI MATED PENALTIES FOR UNDERPAY MENTS BY  INDIVIDUALS ATTRIBUTA BLE TO TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986.

DRUG TESTING FOR TRANSPORTATION  EMPLOYEES  ",1987
42,205,2,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr.  President,  Senator DOLE,  Senator  GRAMM  of  Texas, and I are introducing today a  bill which would  require mandatory  random drug testing of safety-sensitive  personnel related to the railroad  in dustry  and  the  aviation  industry.  These would  include,  in  the case of  aviation, employees not only of air lines, but of the FAA as well.  Under present  law, Mr. President,  there are no  requirements for drug  testing for airline personnel. There are  no  requirements  for  drug  testing  under present law for the FAA.  With respect to railroads, there is a  requirement for testing in the case of  initial employment, in the case of an  accident or for probable cause. Other wise, there is no requirement for rail road personnel.  The tragedy of the accident of an  Amtrak train and Conrail train several  weeks ago brought home to all of us  ",1987
43,270,2,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Speaker, we do  not have unlimited funds to fund all  the things that the Government would  like to do. In the field of national de fense, we particularly have needs that  need to be met and must be expedi tiously and fully met.  In view of that, we should not rush  into  spending  a  large  amount  of  money, a crash program for SDI.  I have asked the staff of the Com mittee on Armed Services to come up  with a  figure, an appropriate figure,  for this year. The figure they have so  far given me is $3.1 billion, not the $6  billion that the President is asking for.  He is asking for $5.8 billion plus $500  million,  and  that  is  an  excessive  amount of money, a crash program  that  is bound  to  lead  to waste and  bound  to keep us from having ade quate funds for our conventional war fare.  to  GIVE US A CHANCE TO DEBATE  55  <Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend her remarks.)  ",1987
44,270,2,Mrs.  SMITH  of  Nebraska.," Mr.  Speaker, when we debate the rule on  the highway bill today, we will have  an opportunity to defeat the previous  question.  I urge my colleagues to vote no on  the previous question.  Voting down the previous question  will not delay further consideration of  the bill.  And  that's important. We need  enact a highway bill.  But voting down the previous ques tion will give us another chance  to  debate whether turning the business  of making  traffic  laws back  to  the  States is a good idea.  We want to have the opportunity to  debate  an  amendment  that would  allow-not require-the States to  in crease the speed limit to 65 miles per  hour on  interstate  routes  in  rural  areas  for  a  5-year  demonstration  period.  I think this amendment is fair and  extremely reasonable. So reasonable,  in  fact,  that  if  the House were  to  debate  it  today,  it would probably  pass.  Let's do  ourselves  a  favor.  Let's  debate this, vote on it, and return the  business of setting speed limits to the  States-where it belongs.  CONGRATULATIONS TO THE  DENVER BRONCOS  <Mrs. SCHROEDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",1987
45,270,2,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, I  would like to join the many football  fans throughout the country in con gratulating  the Denver Broncos on  winning  the American  Conference  championship and earning a  trip  to  Pasadena to play the New York Giants  in the Super Bowl.  I would  also  like  to congratulate  those devoted Bronco fans in Colorado  who have supported the team through  good times and bad times, in the best  of weather and in the worst of weath er, in normal costumes and in not so  normal costumes. They have packed  the stadium since 1970,  leading  the  AFC in most consecutive sellouts and  have consistently applauded the Bron cos since their first game in Denver in  1960. It is  fitting  that the Broncos,  who began their AFC career with a  record of 4 wins, 9  losses, and 1 tie  would end  their  last regular season  with a record of 11 wins and 5 losses.  I  realize that the odds makers are  predicting the Giants to win the Super  Bowl by 9 points, but I am confident  the Broncos will pull an upset and  leave such a strong taste of ""Orange  Crush"" in the mouths of the Giants  that it will take more than a barrel of  Gatorade to wash it away.

50,270,2,Mr. RAVENEL.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing a bill which would pro vide for the continuation of the sus pension of any duty on certain men thol feedstocks that are utilized by do mestic manufacturers to produce syn thetic menthol. There being no domes tic menthol  feedstocks  capacity, we  must import these raw materials from  abroad, primarily from West Germa ny. If the suspension of this duty were  permitted to expire it would impose an  unnecessary economic burden on the  American manufacturer by increasing  production costs.  To relieve this unnecessary burden  Congressman Hartnett, my predeces sor, introduced a bill in 1984 to tempo rarily suspend the duty on menthol  feedstocks. That bill was ultimately in corporated  into  the Miscellaneous  Tariff Act of 1984, Public Law 98-573.  Under Public Law 98-573 the suspen sion of this duty will expire December  31, 1987.  Unfortunately,  the situation facing  our domestic menthol industry has not  changed since 1984: There are still no  American producers of menthol feed stocks, so  the American menthol  in dustry must still import raw materials  and compete with highly subsidized,  cheaply produced menthol products in  foreign markets. In 1984, the market  price for the finished menthol product  was $10.70 per pound.  In 1986,  the  market price steadily declined due to  foreign subsidization and protection of  their menthol producers. This price  decline has had a severe impact on our  domestic industry. The United States  has only one manufacturer of men thol, whose plant is located in my dis trict. This company has maintained its  market share over the past few years,  however this situation will not contin ue if the suspension of this duty is not  extended.  My bill would simply provide for the  continuation of  the duty suspension  for 5 more years, until December 31,  1992. I understand that Senator THUR MOND will be introducing a companion  measure in the other body.  Mr. Speaker, I  realize this bill will  not solve all our country's trade prob lems, but it will allow one domestic in dustry  to  compete  against  foreign  manufacturers and help many Ameri can workers to keep their jobs. I trust  the House will help me in the early  passage of this legislation.  0 1435  A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE  MINIMUM WAGE  <Mr. KLECZKA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1987
51,270,2,Mr. KLECZKA.," Mr. Speaker,  the  time has arrived for Congress to raise  the minimum wage. Since it was last  increased in 1980, inflation has eroded  the value of the wage by over 25 per cent.  In some areas of  the country an  adult with two children can actually  receive more from basic welfare bene fits than from a job that pays the min imum wage. Raising the wage provides  individuals with a strong incentive to  find work, and would help to break the  cycle of dependency on public assist ance.  ",1987

61,296,2,Mr.  PANETTA.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to engage  the gentleman  from California [Mr. ANDERSON]  in a  colloquy to address the need for con struction of two highway projects in  my district.  The  surface  transportation  bill  which  is now being considered has  been crafted  to address  the serious  problems faced by States and localities  across the Nation charged with main taining and  improving  the Nation's  transportation infrastructure. It is my  hope that the passage of this legisla tion will help alleviate these problems  and will help expedite the construc tion of much needed highway  im provements in rural areas which have  not benefited from the construction of  the  Interstate System.  I  represent  such an area, and two much needed  projects in my district, the Highway  156 Hollister bypass and the Highway  101 Prunedale bypass, have been de layed  for  years  largely  because  of  problems with  the Federal highway  program in California.  Fortunately, as we've discussed, the  surface transportation bill now under  consideration  includes  a  provisiOn  which  should  help  alleviate  these  delays. As  I  understand  it,  section  117(a) would allow States to transfer  up to 20 percent of their Interstate 4R  funds to the Federal-aid Primary Pro gram. This would allow States greater  flexibility  in allocating funds  to the  areas with the greatest need. In Cali fornia, I believe, the greatest need in volves primary route projects in dis tricts such as mine which have no  interstate routes. It is my understand ing  that  this  provision will  allow  States to expedite the construction of  projects  such  as  the Hollister  156  bypass and the Prunedale 101 bypass.  ",1987
62,296,2,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1987
63,296,2,Mr. PANETTA., I yield to the gentle man from California.  ,1987
64,296,2,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, the  gentleman is correct, and I share his  hope that section 117(A) will enable  CalTrans to expedite the construction  of projects such as the Hollister and  Prunedale bypasses.  ",1987
65,296,2,Mr. PANETTA.,"  It is my hope  to  send a message to CalTrans that these  projects are a priority of the Congress  and that every effort should be made  to  expedite  their  completion. Mr.  Chairman, I am hopeful that you will  reserve  the option of  taking further  action in support of these projects.  ",1987
66,296,2,Mr. ANDERSON.," I certainly under stand the frustration of the gentleman  from California  [Mr. PANETTA] with  regard to theae projects, and share his  hope that construction of the bypasses  will be expedited. Clearly, the designa tion of Highway 101 bypass as a ""high priority""  in the Surface Transporta tion Act of 1982, and the high percent age of Federal funds which the desig nation signifies, should be utilized as  intended and as expeditiously as possi ble. The gentleman may rest assured  that the Public Works Subcommittee  on Surface Transportation will keep  these projects under consideration and  will seriously examine  the need for  further congressional action.

68,296,2,Mr. GRANDY.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to take this, my first opportunity to  address my colleagues of  this 100th  Congress, to rise in support of H.R. 2,  The Surface Transportation and Uni form Relocation Assistance Act  of  1987.  There are many provisions of this  bill that are of great concern to the  people of Iowa and rural America; spe cifically  the elimination of  the one half-percent minimum guarantee for  interstate construction, and the pro posed change in the Interstate 4R for mula. However, these provisions shold  not jeopardize the timely passage of  the entire package. This may not en tirely be the bill we want. It is the bill  we need, and we need it by March of  this year at the latest.  I know that many of the Members  from States in the Northeast, North west,  and  upper-Midwest  share my  fears  that, should Congress prolong  its' deliberation of this bill, the 1987  construction season may be lost, which  could mean a loss of almost 10,000 jobs  in Iowa alone, jobs that are directly re lated to the estimated $164 million al located for the State in 1987.  For  Iowa and  the people of  the  Sixth District, this would be a serious  blow to an already faltering economy  suffering from a lack of jobs, a need  for economic diversity, and a farm-to market infrastructure heavily depend ent on its' highways and bridges.  I hope the House passes this legisla tion quickly,  I hope the other body  passes their legislation quickly. And I  hope the conference committee swiftly  returns a bill that is equally favorable  to both urban and rural America.  ",1987

I want to compliment the gentleman  from New Jersey and the gentleman  from California for moving this high way bill, because, in all seriousness, it  is terribly important to people in Colo rado and to people everywhere else.  I also want to say that I am pleased  that we are going to at least get hear ings to try to correct the 55-mile-per hour speed limit.

72,348,2,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, on January 7,  1987,  I  introduced  legislation  to  create  a  Center on Biotechnology  Information within  the National Library of Medicine of the Nation al  Institutes of Health-essentially a manhat tan  project-to  formulate an  understanding  about the most debilitating and common dis eases, such as heart disease, arthritis, and  cancer.  Scientists now generally agree  that killing  and crippling diseases such as cancer which  claims the lives of 420,000 each year, arthritis,  which  afflicts  16  to  20 million Americans  today, and heart disease, which claims about  800,000 lives annually are influenced in com plex ways by the functions of one's genes. My  belief is that one of the best investments this  country can make will be  in supporting  re search  to help understand some of  these  complex relationships.  Five  decades ago,  I came  to  the U.S.  Senate and chaired the Subcommittee on War  Time Health and Employment. This subcom mittee was created subsequent to the finding  that nearly 4 million young men were rejected  from  the draft because they were not phys ically or mentally equipped. We recommended  the first major increases in Federal financing  for health  research-the outcome of which  reaped enumerable benefits for the health and  well-being of millions of Americans.  By 1950, 6 of the existing 12 National Insti tutes of Health were enacted into law. By the  early 1970's,  five more  Institutes were cre ated, leaving the last-the National Institute of  Arthritis-which I sponsored, to be signed into  law this last Congress.  These  last four decades of growth  in  the  Federal Government's  commitment  to  re search has vastly improved the American way  of life. The miracles of our efforts are every where to be seen.  We have vaccines that have virtually elimi nated most  childhood  diseases;  sanitation  systems and pasteurization  that have  taken  the clout out of infectious diseases; the high  technology of microsurgery, kidney dialysis,  vital-organ  transplants,  coronary  bypasses,  plastic surgery, machines that scan the body  and the brain and do the work of the heart.  We have conquered diseases  that have  killed millions over the centuries and have ex tended  life expectancy beyond  the wildest  predictions of just a generation ago.  Yet,  in spite of our immense progress, the  mysteries of many debilitating and deadly dis eases,  like cancer and Alzheimer's disease,  cystic  fibrosis, Parkinson's, arthritis and  the  like, still remain to be solved.  Today, we are confronted with a similar  challenge-the need to enhance our research  commitment  for  the betterment of mankind.  That is why I am today introducing legislation  which would create a Center on Biotechnol ogy Information within the National Library of  Medicine of the National  Institutes of Health.  This Center would serve as a repository and  as a national base for distribution of molecular  information.  How will  the creation of a National Center  on Biotechnology  Information help  in our ef forts to conquer many diseases against which  we are now relatively helpless? Quite simply.  The world's top scientists now agree  that  biotechnology holds great promise for unlock ing  the mysteries of many debilitating dis eases.  Because of biotechnology, we already can  prenatally detect some 15 genetic diseases,  including cystic fibrosis, Duchenne's muscular  dystrophy, sickle cell disease, and hemophilia.  Work is also progressing on other diseases  that are {suspected of having a genetic basis,  including heart diseases and cancer. New nat ural drugs and vaccines. Life saving therapies.  Pain-saving interventions.  All  these are the result of biotechnology research and development  involving  the all  important molecules that control our life proc esses-how our bodies grow, how we age,  whether we suffer a host of mental and physi cal diseases.  The  central  focus  of  biotechnology  is  DNA-deoxyribonucleic acid-the long,  twist ed threads in the nucleus of each of our 1 0  trillion cells.  Like the rapid escalation of aerospace tech nology which led from Kitty Hawk to the Moon  in less than 70 years, the pace of acquisition  of vital information about inner space is accel erating dramatically.  Unfortunately,  information systems now  in  use  to gather and analyze  this data cannot  keep pace with this surge of new information.  In order  for society  to benefit  from  the  in creasing rate and volume of new knowledge  in this field of biotechnology, great advances  will also be required in the science of comput er storage,  retrieval, and comprehension of  the detailed records of the new discoveries.  If we are to prevent our scientific progress  from grinding to a halt, we need a central re pository for storing and sharing  the  informa tion  resulting  from current genetic research.  The National Center on Biotechnology  Infor mation, which my bill would establish, would  accomplish that objective.  Working with the laboratories from which in formation comes, experts at this center would  seek to coordinate data as it is accumulated to store, process and make it available to the  research community, nationwide.  At such a center, computer scientists-with  the help of some of the world's outstanding  molecular  researchers working next door at  the  National  Institutes  of  Health-would  create new computer information systems so  that investigators throughout the country could  ask questions and get answers quickly.  They would encourage consistent terminolo gy for researchers and data bases so that re search results entered into computer systems  could be shared and be made widely avail able.  We need such a center to prevent duplica tion of research and to get more out of our re search dollar. We need  it to fit together the  pieces of the genetic puzzle and acquire the  knowledge  that would benefit humankind  in  many ways.  With  such knowledge, we  could develop  deeper understanding of the root causes of  diseases  that still plague us. This  is  true of  diseases we know are  inherited, of course,  like sickle cell anemia or thalassemia.  Scientists feel  that our  likelihood of falling  victim  to the common and serious diseases,  like heart disease, cancer and arthritis, may  well be influenced in complicated ways by the  workings of our genes.  Researchers aim now to learn more about  these genes, and their relation to each other.  From  this deeper understanding would come  exciting new cures and interventions.  It  is estimated  that $10 million per annum  will be required to carry forth the provisions of  my bill and make the center a functional reali ty.  Under no circumstances should the financ ing of the new Center for Biotechnology Infor mation utilize funds diverted from those to be  made available  for other research. This  is a  new effort-an ambitious venture-an invest ment  for our  lifetimes and  for  the  lives of  unborn generatior .s.  It is a well calculated attempt to meet the  most  important medical  challenges of our  time. The basic knowledge  learned from se quences  the human genome  is predicted  to  unlock secrets which help  in our efforts  to  fight many diseases against which we are now  relatively defenseless.  The genetic code contained  in our cells is  nature's language of life. Hopefully in under standing  the gene,  the health status of all  future Americans will be vastly improved.  I urge my colleagues to support this mean ingful bill.  CURBING  DRUG  ABUSE-THE  NEED  FOR A  SUSTAINED BI PARTISAN EFFORT  ",1987

76,387,2,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  acknowledge before Congress  the  fine and  always  entertaining  work  of Mr.  Richard  Simon,  the Sacramento Union's first full-time  arts critic. During his 21 years with the Union,  Mr. Simon has both enlightened and amused  us with his humorously avant-garde reviews of  Sacramento's varied cultural offerings, and  I  am sad to note his retirement in early Decem ber of this year.  Originally from Cleveland, OH, Mr. Simon at tended the University of Chicago, majoring in  French and graduating in 1949. After several  years of traveling and teaching in England and  France, he worked as a publicist in New York  before moving  to  the west coast, where he  began his journalistic career in the 1950's.  Mr. Simon's  first  position was with  the  Solano Republican in Fairfield. Later he acted  as  the news editor for  the daily Democrat's  Davis bureau. On September 10, 1965, Mr.  Simon began his long and fruitful association  with the Sacramento Union.  1805  Over the last 21 years, Mr. Simon has es tablished himself as an  institution, a  touch stone  in Sacramento's art world. Yet  it was  not  longevity, nor even his  trademark pun filled prose which did  this;  rather,  it was his  sense of honesty and  integrity when dealing  with artistic concerns. Mr. Simon was not a re viewer to constantly praise or belittle perform ances.  Instead, he brought vitality and genu ine critique to the field. His unique and often  thought-provoking observations sprang  from  an unusually perceptive and educated mind.  Mr. Simon has deemed it time to move on,  and his contributions to Sacramento's artistic  community will be greatly missed. Mr. Speak er, on behalf of the people of Sacramento,  I  would  like to congratulate Richard Simon on  his extended achievement and service to our  city, and offer my sincere best wishes to him  in all of his future endeavors.  THE SPACE PROGRAM: AN  INSIDE VIEW  HON. ROBERT J. LAGOMARSINO  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 21, 1987  ",1987
77,387,2,Mr.  LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  there  has been a lot of discussion during the past  11 months about what went wrong with our  space program. I would like to share with my  colleagues some  thoughts from someone di rectly involved in the program, and therefore,  imbued with a certain sense of realism and  perspective. I include the remarks of my con stituent, Mr. Donald Sharp, at this point in the  RECORD:  I have worked in aerospace project man agement/planning for over 26 years. I have  experienced successful and failed launches,  the Apollo fire tragedy, reductions in force  brilliant and inept/biased management, and  numerous  other  high  and  low  points.  Throughout, I have been proud of our space  program and my association  in unmanned  launches and manned missions in Mercury,  Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle.  Subsequent to the Challenger disaster, I  am appalled  that our program has now  become subject to  the emotions of politi cians and a  few prima donna astronauts  that have brought our program to a stand still. This is of particular importance when  we  should  be  establishing  and working  toward new firm goals to again become the  world leader in space exploration and devel opment. Yet since the Challenger disaster  we have dithered like children. It is obvious  to me they do not understand the inherent  nature of aerospace. Further, they appar ently have little concern for the thousands  of people who have been affected by their  emotional overreaction.  On  the  first manned  launch we knew  there was an extreme risk to the astronaut  on board. As a test pilot, he was also well  aware of the risk. As we successfully proc essed flight after flight we knew the proba bility of a disaster was greatly increasing.  Thru a malfunction we almost lost a lunar  mission. But, we were heroes, no lives were  lost as a realtime resolution safely brought  the  crew  home. Although  emphasis has  always been to launch as safe a vehicle as  possible we always knew there could never  be a 100% safety factor when considering  ",1987
78,400,2,Mr.  COELHO.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  early  this  month,  the Edison Electric  Institute held  its  governmental affairs conference  in Phoenix,  AZ. Among those who addressed the confer ence was the chairman of the House Subcom mittee on Water and Power Resources, Con gressman GEORGE MILLER.  In  his  speech,  Chairman MILLER outlined several  important  priorities  for  the  subcommittee. Of  special  note is his concern with public power prefer ence and  the Bonneville Power Administra tion's intertie access policy. I thought my col leagues would be interested in reading his re marks:  INTRODUCTION  Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate this  opportunity to address EEl's annual govern mental affairs conference. EEl has a  long  and distinguished reputation of service  to  the electric utility industry. I'm pleased to  have this opportunity to address those who  represent the industry so ably on Capitol  Hill and in State capitols.  As Chairman of the Interior Water and  Power Subcommittee,  I'll be directly  in volved in a number of issues affecting you  and your companies. In addition, as ranking  Democrat on the Full Interior Committee,  January 21, 1987  I'm sure our paths will  cross on other  energy or nuclear safety matters.  Since I haven't had  the opportunity  to  work with most of you, I thought I'd take  this chance to let you know more about me.  My preferences and prejudices; what I'm for  and against; the approach I'll take on issues  affecting your industry.  YOUR PRINCIPLES  Environmental laws  During my  twelve years  in Congress,  I  have developed a strong voting record on  environmental  issues.  I'm proud of  that  record and I don't intend to change. I be lieve  strong and  effective  environmental  laws are essential and should not be ignored  or  abused. However,  environmental  laws  must be flexible and allow for reasonable  economic development, including energy de velopment.  It is inevitable that conflicts will arise be tween development and preservation. The  Interior Committee will face a classic case  when we consider  legislation  to open  the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and  gas leasing. I believe we must address each  of these conflicts openly. I can assure you  that I will be open, accessible and willing to  listen to both sides.  Subsidies  Throughout my career,  I  have worked  hard  to  reduce or eliminate subsidies  to  those who  develop  resources  on  public  lands. These resources shouldn't be  indis criminately ""locked up,"" but on the other  hand, they shouldn't be given away at ""rock  bottom prices.""  A fair and competitive price for public re sources  is often  the best mechanism  for  judging whether such resources should be  developed, when and where. Too often in  the past, we  have made  these  resources  available  at  ridiculously  low  prices  and  under lax development standards. The re sults are predictable.  The Federal treasury has been denied bil lions of dollars in revenue and environmen tal conflicts have needlessly developed. Our  present need for  revenues  to balance the  budget demands that we receive top dollar  for Federal resources.  Nuclear power  Concerning nuclear power, I recognize it is  an  important element  in our energy mix.  However, safety is a major concern wth the  public and that concern can't be ignored.  I don't believe nuclear power will assume  increased importance as ari energy option  until it regains the public's confidence. This  won't be done with slick advertising cam paigns. Plants will have  to be operated  safely and efficiently. Waste will have to be  transported and stored safely.  The best test of nuclear power's viability  remains the private market place. If nuclear  power is  to gain a  larger share of energy  production,  several  things will  have  to  happen. The industry will have to recognize  the concerns regarding safety and their re sponsibilities under Price-Anderson to share  the  costs  of  accidents. They  shouldn't  expect a free ride.  The Federal government, on  the other  hand, has a responsibility to address such  problems  as nuclear waste and  licensing  reform. The Government must do so in a  manner which develops public confidence  and trust, rather than suspicion about using  these programs as a political football.  ",1987
79,413,2,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker, in the 4  years  I  have been  in  the Congress  there  is one  impression  that stands  out and that is the quality of our col leagues. The dedication  to our  jobs,  the hard work and the long hours is  proof of our commitment to service but that is not the issue.  The issue is the integrity of the in stitution. A democracy works because  of a bond that exists between its lead ers and its people. That bond is based  on faith and credibility.  How do we  ask  the people back  home to have faith in our leadership  when we will not do what we  are  asking them to do; that is, to ask less  of Government or pay higher taxes to  solve the deficit problem.

ANNIVERSARY OF UKRAINIAN  INDEPENDENCE  ",1987
81,439,2,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, today we  observe  the 69th anniversary of  the  Proclamation of Independence of the  Ukrainian Republic. The fact that the  independent Ukrainian Republic was  in existence for only 3 years, between  the period during which it was part of  the Czarist Russian Empire and 1921  when  the  country was overrun by  Communist troops, does not diminish  the importance of this remembrance.  The Ukrainian people have a  long  and distinguished heritage as an inde pendent Slavic nation. Although the  Ukraine is now a part of the Soviet  Union and Ukrainians are, unfortu nately, often not distinguished from  the Russian people, Ukrainians have a  distinct Slavic language, and a distinct  culture encompassing literature, archi tecture, folklore and customs. In fact,  scholars write that Kiev was once the  cultural center of Eastern Europe.  In this country we worry about the  loss of regional folk traditions due to  the  impact of  television and other  mass media.

83,478,2,Mr. CHENEY.," Mr. Speaker, I have today in troduced  legislation  to preserve  the Aban doned Mine Lands Reclamation Program by  making it clear that program expenditures and  the  Internal  taxed by  benefits are not to be  Revenue Service.  This  legislation became necessary after a  recent district  IRS  ruling  in Ohio which has  cast a pall over mine reclamation programs of  the  Federal Government  and  the  several  States.  The  IRS  case  concerned  a  reclamation  project sponsored by the State of Ohio under  its Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program.  The State paid part of the cost of cleaning up  an area seriously damaged by past mining.  The district office of  the  IRS subsequently  ruled  that  the entire amount of  the State's  payment  had  to  be  considered  as  gross  income by  the  taxpayer participating  in  the  project, even  though part of the project was  located on a neighbor's property, and even  though a significant portion of  the project's  benefits accrued to the public at large, rather  than the taxpayer.  Although  this  ruling applied only to a par ticular case  in Ohio,  it has already had  the  effect of seriously disrupting  reclamation ef forts throughout the country. Citizens involved  in  reclamation activities are  reluctant  to pro ceed for fear of the tax consequences raised  by this action.  For example, the program manager of Wyo ming's Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program  indicated in a recent letter that[TJhe current undefined nature of  the  problem places the AML Program in a posi tion where it cannot accurately inform land owners of  the potential  tax consequences  when they consent to have their land re claimed or the hazards on their property  abated. Unable  to obtain  landowner con sent, some $20 million worth of construction  work shall be delayed by late spring, 1987.  Officials at the U.S. Department of the Inte rior who administer  the Federal Abandoned  Mine Land Reclamation Program have ex pressed  a  similar  concern.  In  September  1985, Assistant Secretary Steven Griles wrote  a letter to IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs  seeking the withdrawal of the Ohio opinion on  the grounds  that  it contained  ""both  factual  and legal errors * * *."" Mr. Griles noted, ""We  are particularly concerned about the possibility  that this opinion may be considered for appli cation on a national basis.""  Mr. Speaker,  it would be a shame  if  the  considerable  worthwhile  activity  going  on  throughout the country to heal the scars and  clean up  the messes caused by past mining  were to be hindered because of this obscure  action by the IRS.  To keep that from happening, the legislation  I have introduced would change current law to  specify  that gross  income does not  include  payments or economic benefits resulting from  payments under the Federal Abandoned Mine  Reclamation Program enacted by Congress in  1977.  For the benefit of those who are not familiar  with the problems caused by the Ohio ruling,  following  is  the  test of  the  Interior Depart ment's letter to IRS.  It makes clear the need  for legislation.  I invite my colleagues from States with Mine  Reclamation Programs to join in cosponsoring  this bill, Mr. Speaker.  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,  OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY,  Washington, DC, September 25, 1986.  Hon. LAWRENCE B. GIBBS,  Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service,  Washington, DC.  DEAR COMMISSIONER: We are enclosing a  District Internal Revenue Service Opinion  concerning  the  tax  consequences  for  an  Ohio  family  that participated  in a State  sponsored mine land reclamation program.  We believe the opinion includes both factu al and legal errors and respectfully request  that the opinion be withdrawn. We are par ticularly  concerned  about  the  possibility  that this opinion may be considered for ap plication on a national basis.  The case  in question concerns  two cost sharing grants  from  the State of Ohio  under its Abandoned Mine Land Cost-Share  Program, Ohio revised Code 1513.28. This  program funded solely from State revenues  provided grants  to  landowners  to reclaim  lands that have been adversely affected by  past mining practices. These mining activi ties have imposed social and environmental  costs in the form of unusable unreclaimed  lands, water pollution, erosion, loss of fish  and wildlife resources and a decline in the  natural environment.  In many  instances,  the condition of these lands creates serious  health and safety  threats  to  the general  public through uncontrolled refuse and un derground  fires, unstable spoil and waste  piles and unsafe impoundments. Indeed, the  lands are  truly ""abandoned"" in the sense  that neither current nor prior landowners  have a legal responsibility to reclaim them.  The Ohio reclamation program, much like  other reclamation programs, seeks  to cor rect this past legacy by providing landown ers funds necessary to restore the land to its  original productivity. It is the general public  that gains from this program and not specif ic individuals.  The case in point involved the restoration  of 132 acres of strip-mined land owned by  the taxpayer and 68 acres owned by a neigh bor. There was no agreement between the  taxpayer and this adjoining landowner for  reimbursement, and the State required the  reclamation of the entire 200 acres in order  for the taxpayer to participate. Pre-apprais als of the taxpayer's land placed the value  of approximately $15,200 or at about $100  an acre. The land in question contained old  refuse piles and sediment filled streams that  caused the flooding of nearby agricultural  lands which were not owned or controlled  by the taxpayer. To correct this continuing  threat to the public at large and to prevent  further economic decline of local agricultur al production,  the State provided the tax payer $930,000 in two grants to remove the  sediment from the streams and reclaim the  old gob piles. The post-appraisal of the 200  acres placed its new market value at $35,000  with its highest and best use still being wild life habitat or pasture land. The benefits de rived from  this project clearly accrued  to  the community at large and not to the tax payer.  The  local  Internal  Revenue  opmwn  found, based on these facts, that the total  cost-share payments <$930,000) for the rec lamation of the taxpayers' 132 acres and the  68 acres of his neighbor were includable in  the gross  income of  the  taxpayer  in  the  years received.  In our opinion,  this  is an  absurd result, one that would have dire con sequences for many Government sponsored  reclamation programs.  Our specific concerns with  Opinion are:  the District  ",1987
84,491,2,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. Speaker,  in July, 1986, a  group  of  surviving  ""Crossroads""  veterans,  children of veterans, and  representatives of  the Bikini people gathered on Marshall Island  in the South Pacific. They met in commemora tion of  the 40th anniversary of  the atomic  bomb tests.  Among those at the meeting was Gordon P.  Erspamer,  the son of an  ""atomic veteran""  who serves as  the counsel  for  the National  Association of Radiation Survivors and has  dedicated his working  life  to helping  those  who have been exposed to radiation. Mr. Er spamer recently won a landmark decision  in  the Federal courts of California which resulted  in a $115,000 penalty against the Veterans'  Administration. The suit dealt with VA's pur poseful destruction of documents pertinent to  the  lawsuit brought by the veterans exposed  to radiation during their tours of duty.  At the ""Crossroads"" reunion, Mr. Erspamer  read two poems which he wrote upon the oc casion of his  father's death  in  1980. The  poems Mr. Erspamer  read on  that summer  day on Marshall  Island have been published  by one of the veterans present that day. As  the son of an ""atomic veteran"" and a member  of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee,  I  would like to share with my colleagues these  poignant expressions:  ATOMIC VETERANS  <By Gordon P. Erspamer)  There are war babies and heroes  And war brides and buddies and even war  novels  Who are visible  In the popular culture  And romanticize the experience.  Yet seldom  is heard the murmurings and  wails  Of the war victims alive  Who fester and suffer  In interstices and dropped-thru-holes  And I speak of those,  Those who inhaled the ambience of Enola  Gay,  Absorbed or were absorbed into the Smoky  valence  Or rode the waves of Bikini in '46  When life and death were at the Crossroads,  And the Wigwam boys  Who didn't construct their own teepees  When we tested our toys,  And  exhilarated  about mushrooms  clouds,  When we placed sacrifices  Before our searing God-furnace  Then discharged them in the wild  And spanked their behinds.  And when they nipped at the gate  Displaying their sores arisen  We excluded them from the corral,  Tossed them an antiseptic lozenge,  And they tasted our gratitude.  There were no scabs to lick,  and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  And the pain inside ran rampant  Amidst the army of whites who rode trium phant.-BIKINI  <By Gordon P. Erspamer)  Cloudy thoughts and aching joints abound  And the question is  Will they now accept the blame  And deign to recognize  As flush and forcefully  As Baker pierced the Marshall tides  The it  The acceptance of which  Is theirs alone  The it  That might ease the pain  Of those who grew and glow caustic  Having inhaled plumes fired for naught  But the sight of illumination  Or whether they will continue  To put prime over wallpaper  And paint over that  And claim not to perceive  The original pigments of the scene  And scratch marks on ship hulls and gun  barrels  Left by white rats feiled indelibly  By the blasts of forty-six,  Aimed only at ourselves.  THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT  HON. LEE H. HAMILTON  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 21, 1987  ",1987
85,491,2,Mr. HAMIL TON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  insert my Washington Report for Wednesday,  January 21, 1987,  into  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD:  The role of Government is the grand issue  of American politics. Should the Federal Gov ernment manage,  guide,  and  regulate  the  economy? Should it set up broad social pro grams  to help  the disadvantaged? Should  it  endorse or mandate  certain  social  values,  such as racial equality, sexual mores, or reli gious  rights?  This  issue  of Government's  proper role has been  fought over since  the  earliest days of the Nation;  in  the politics of  recent years there is little sign that it has been  resolved.  In  the 19th century, conservatives wanted  to use the Federal Government to reform and  control the economy and society; the liberals  supported States  rights,  religious  freedom,  and non-interference in  the affairs of others.  But as  the country grew,  the role of govern ment changed, and the positions of the liber als and conservatives changed  too. For  the  liberals, Government became the best means  to promote economic justice and to reform so ciety, while conservatives began to see Gov ernment as  intrusive. Today  the situation  is  strangely mixed. Conservatives tend  to  favor  weak Government  for economic  regulation  and social programs, but strong Government  for national defense and enforcement of reli gious and moral values. Liberals, on the other  hand, tend to favor the use of Government to  promote broad social and economic  justice,  but not to dictate personal values. These shift ing positions only emphasize that the role of  Government has been  the pivotal  issue  in  American politics throughout the Nation's his tory.  1909  America has just come through a period of  widespread disillusionment with Government.  Over  the past 20 years, people  increasingly  questioned both what Government should be  doing and how it should be doing it. They did  not want to eliminate the legitimate and nec essary functions of Government, such as na tional defense or helping  the Nation's  truly  needy. Yet  they  felt  that  too often Govern ment was excessively wasteful and ineffective  in carrying out  its  responsibilities. Now,  the  polls tell us, the anti-Government mood is re ceding, and confidence  in Government has  begun  to  increase. People apparently  favor  more Government efforts, for example, to deal  with pressing social problems like hunger and  homelessness. This shift may be occurring  partly because people sense that some of the  past  excesses  of Government have  been  tamed.  The question  today  remains: What should  the role of Government be in this country? In  answering that question, one new and overrid ing fact looms: there is much  less money to  spend because of  the huge Federal budget  deficits.  For  the Democrats,  the current  situation  presents very special problems. Most people  like the fact that the Democratic Party stands  more for the average person and the ordinary  worker, and  less  for  the elite,  the powerful,  and the rich. What they do not like about the  party is  its past record of too much Govern ment spending. They doubt  that  the Demo crats are competent to run Government pro grams once they set them up. So the problem  for the Democrats becomes how to maintain  their commitment to fairness and equity for all  people, without talking about more spending  and bigger Government programs. The Re publicans have problems  too. They want  to  protect  the Reagan  revolution, but  they are  often unsure about just what it is they are pro tecting or how to enhance it. They are proud  of their efforts to curb Government, but recog nize  that some of  the cutbacks have done  more than just nibble away at ""waste, fraud,  and abuse"". Some Americans have been hurt  by the cutbacks, such as elderly paying larger  health-care  bills  or middle-income  families  shouldering enormous college loans. Republi cans are  faced with  the problem of either  glossing over the difficulties or calling for an  expansion in the role of Government.  How do these problems for the political par ties affect the voter? The answer is,  I think,  not much. I am continually impressed with the  lack of ideology among ordinary voters. They  do not pay much attention to the finely spun  arguments made by politicians and pundits  about what is the proper role of Government.  Although ideological purists tend to dominate  both parties, the ordinary voter just is not ide ological. The test that matters for him is:  Is it  a reasonable policy and will it work?  The debate over the role of Government will  be at the heart of the 1988 election campaign,  already getting underway. At  this early date,  my guess is that the race for President will be  fascinating and very close. More than 20 can didates are in the field, and the nomination of  the two major political parties is open for the  first  time  in  two decades. Both parties are  keenly aware of the emergence of a new gen",1987
86,504,2,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, the  Senate Banking Committee has  just  completed 3 days of intensive hearings  on urgently needed banking  legisla tion. As chairman of the Senate Bank ing Committee, I expect the commit tee to report legislation to the floor of  the Senate next month  for  action.  Some of this legislation has virtually  unanimous support from our commit tee. Some of it is controversial. There  is no question we need action on this  legislation. We  need  it now. Why?  Why do we need this action so urgent ly?  First, if Congress fails to pass legisla tion to strengthen the Federal Savings  and  Loan  Insurance Corporation known as FSLIC-a number of savings  and loan institutions located primarily  in the Southwest and West will  fail  under circumstances that will serious ly threaten the savings and loan insur ance fund. In fact, it could mandate a  multibillion dollar appropriation from  the Federal Government to make good  the  implicit  ""full  faith and credit""  commitment that lies behind Federal  insurance of the Nation's savings and  loans.  Meanwhile what happens with every  month  that passes without congres sional action? Consider: FSLIC is the  federally backed S&L insurance fund.  That fund has been depleted because  of a sharply  increased series of fail ures of insured S&L's. More such fail ures  are  expected  later  this  year.  Faced with  this outlook,  the Home  Loan Bank Board is kept from moving  promptly to remedy the situation be cause it has insufficient resources to  do so. The consequences: The eventual  losses of the system sharply increase.  The likelihood that FSLIC funds will  become  inadequate greatly  increases  because the need for funds will be so  much greater because FSLIC did not  act in a timely way.  So what are  the  long-term actions  the industry must take to prevent the  situation  from getting worse? What  must the industry do to move onto a  sound basis in the future?  Certainly Congress should promptly  pass legislation to meet the imperative  borrowing needs of FSLIC. This will  not effect the budget. It will not come  from appropriated funds. It will come  from borrowing from  funds supplied  by  the  regular  insurance  premium  charge on the country's S&L's.  Aside  from  this,  should Congress  mandate a substantial increase in the  notoriously  low  capital  ratios with  which so many S&L's now operate?  How can Congress require savings and  loans  throughout the country  to  in crease their capital ratio within a rea sonable period? Can this be done with out closing many more S&L's that  cannot reach a  reasonable standard?  Why is it that this industry was able  to  function  for so many years with  little  difficulty  and  few  failures  through a number of recessions? Why  has there been such a series of failures  in the recent past? Is it related to the  end of the S&L's advantage that was  enjoyed with  their  favorable  regula tion Q differential? Has it been caused  by  the movement of S&L's out of  home financing and into much riskier  and more speculative areas? These dis asters have not occurred in a deep de pression. They have occurred in the  middle of one of the longest uninter rupted economic recoveries in the past  50  years.  Imagine  the problem we  could face when the country has  its  next recession, which is overdue right  now.  One action the Senate could take to  help the savings and loan industry is  to end the potential big-scale invasion  of  their  deposit  base  by  nonbank  banks. Nonbank banks  also pose  a  threat to S&L's because they dramati cally diminish  the market for failed  S&L's.

Included are three bills dealing with  dairy policy, a bill to ensure that agricultural in terests are properly  represented at  the up coming General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade [GATT] talks and a bill which would es tablish a blue  ribbon  commission  to  study  ways  to  improve  the quality of  life  in  rural  America.  The dairy termination program which was in cluded in the Farm Security Act of 1985 has  been highly successful  in  reducing  the dairy  surplus. The slaughter of nearly 1 million head  of dairy animals already has significantly de creased  total milk production,  reduced Gov ernment purchases of cheese,  butter, and  nonfat dry milk and increased milk prices.  The  Minnesota-Wisconsin  price  series,  which  is  the base price  in determining what  dairy producers around the country receive for  their milk,  increased a total of 93 cents and  reached a high of $11.91  in November 1986.  In general, dairy economists from around the  country are predicting higher prices for farm ers in 1987 than they received in 1986.  So, why am I introducing legislation that will  change our current dairy policy when every thing seems to be going quite well?  Considerable study of the current dairy pro gram and the future course it should take will  be considered both inside and outside of Gov ernment over  the next several months. The  National Milk Producers Federation, which  represents about 70 percent of the milk mar keted  in  the United States, has created a  study committee to consider the future of the  current dairy price support purchase program  and whether it should be replaced by an alter nate program.  In addition,  the National Dairy  Policy Commission, which was  established  through the Food Security Act of 1985, is also  evaluating our current dairy policy and will be  making recommendations to Congress.  DAIRY TARGET PRICE ACT  Believing it is the proper time to provide in centives to the dairy industry to better market  and distribute our dairy products while still  supporting the dairy producer, I am reintroduc ing my Dairy Target Price Act which will direct  limited  Federal  dollars  to  our  smalland  medium-sized  family  farms, create additional  sales of dairy products, promote orderly mar keting of those products and eliminate Com modity Credit Corporation purchases.  Specifically, a target price would be estab lished at $12.1 0 per hundredweight of 3.67  percent butterfat milk. A dairy producer will re ceive a direct deficiency payment equal to the  amount by which the target price exceeds the  greater of the M-W series price for a particu lar month and  the  recourse  loan  rate  of  $10.10 per hundredweight which would be  available to plants and processors.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Payments would be made directly  to pro ducers on a quarterly basis and would be lim ited to $20,000 per producer.  Due to the fact that the Dairy Target Price  Act would replace  the current purchase pro gram, a recourse loan program is created for  plants and processors to provide  for  the or derly marketing of dairy products.  If a plant or processor cannot sell a product  due  to poor market conditions, a  loan  from  the Federal Government in amount of $10.10  per hundredweight of 3.67 -percent butterfat  milk equivalent to  facilitate  in  the storage of  dairy products until market conditions improve.  The loans would be made on a recourse basis  and bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per  annum. Loans would have to be repaid within  9 months-products could not be forfeited to  the CCC.  FREEZING THE PRICE SUPPORT LEVEL  The dairy price support  level was reduced  to $11.35 per hundredweight from $11.60 per  hundredweight on Jaunary 1, 1987. Another  25-cent reduction is scheduled for October 1 ,  1987. Since the dairy termination program has  brought supply and demand  into better bal ance,  the authority for the Secretary of Agri culture to reduce the price support level is no  longer necessary. Being able to assure farm ers of a stable minimum price over the next 4  years and knowing  the possibility  that major  dairy legislation will not be considered by Con gress, prompted me  to  introduce this bill.  In  the short term, this legislation may be the one  vehicle in which we can gain consensus in the  dairy industry.  Specifically, the bill eliminates the authority  for the Secretary of Agriculture  to  impose a  25-cent cut in the support price this October  and the additional 50-ce_nt cuts slated for Jan uary 1, 1988, January 1, 1989, and January 1,  1990 if dairy products exceed 5 billion pounds  on those dates. The bill gives dairy producers  an  incentive to cut back by keeping  the au thority to raise the support price by 50 cents  annually if CCC purchases are projected to be  below 2.5 billion pounds annually.  CONSOLIDATION OF MARKET ORDERS  The present system of marketing fluid milk,  with  the 44 separate Federal milk marketing  orders, has restricted  the marketing of fresh  fluid milk to areas which experience shortages  of milk at certain times of the year from those  areas which can supply fluid milk needs year  around.  The bill would remove the artificial barriers  to the transportation of milk which are now in  place and thus provide greater market flexibil ity. By regionalizing the transportation of milk  we would permit more equitable sharing of  proceeds  from  the  sale of  fluid milk and  reduce the consumer cost of fluid milk through  smaller transportation differentials.  Specifically,  the bill would consolidate  the  44 Federal milk market orders  into a single  national order with between  three and  six  basing points. A basing point is the place from  which transportation differentials-the cost of  moving fluid milk-are calculated.  AGRICULTURAL ADVISERS FOR THE GATT  For the first time ever, agricultural trade will  be a focal point in the GA TI talks. The Food  Security Act of 1985 has brought the major  1935  agricultural  trading  countries  to  the GA TI  table because of their concern over the grain  and export provisions  in  it. Perhaps, at no  other  time  in history has  the United States  had so much to gain and so much to lose with  regard to agriculture trade.  The upcoming GA TI talks are providing us  with a forum  in which we can strengthen our  export share and regain lost markets. Due to  the vital importance of agricultural trade to our  economy it is  imperative that our negotiators  receive  the  proper  advice  on  agriculture  issues  from Members of Congress who are  experienced and knowledgeable in the area of  agriculture.  My bill would allow  the Speaker of  the  House to select members of the House Agri culture Committee and the President pro tem pore of  the other body  to select members  from their Agriculture Committee to advise our  negotiators at  the GA TI talks  in Geneva,  Switzerland. These advisers would be in addi tion to the advisers appointed from the House  Ways and Means Committee and  the other  body's Finance Committee.  NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF RURAL  AMERICA  rural ~merica.  The  problems  in  rural  Ame~ica ar~ not  uniquely farm problems. The ent1re soclo.eco nomic  fiber and  the  traditional  institutional  base of  rural America are  threatened. Our  transition in agriculture is forcing a transition in  rural communities. It is time we call upon our  best experts  in America  to guide us  in  the  necessary steps  to maintain or u.pgrade  th.e  quality of life and delivery of serv1ces to th1s  changing rural landscape.  Farmers and members of their communities  have made progress  in developing solutions  to the problems they face. The bill would es tablish a blue ribbon Presidential commission  which would make recommendations  to pro mote and develop  the agricultural and non agricultural economic base  in  The commission would study ways to Improve  the  integrity and delivery of quality  care, education, housing, and  transportation  service to our rural areas.  The President would appoint a bipartisan  group of 28 commissioners, who would be pri vate citizens or representatives of State and  local government.  Certainly, we have seen positive results and  made significant strides in reducing our dairy  surplus. The dairy related bills I am intro~uc­ ing today are viable and passable alternatives  to our current dairy policy and give us a posi tive, long-term approach to dairy policy.  Likewise, the bills to appoint agriculture ad viser to the GA n  talks and the establishment  of a commission to study ways to improve the  agricultural and nonagricultural base  in  rural  America will give farmers a voice in the trade  talks and the opportunity to come to Congress  with a unified position on what needs to be  done  to ensure  the  future economic vitality  and quality of life of our rural community.  he~lth  ",1987
88,556,2,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, when I  was watching  the Super Bowl  on  Sunday,  I was watching with very  mixed emotions. I had hoped that the  Washington Redskins would be in that  preeminent affair but, of course, the  New York Giants were.  So I was somewhat saddened but my  heart was  lifted when  the perform ance of the little native, Phil Simms,  quarterback for the New York Giants,  actually not only won the bowl game  but earned him most valuable player  honors.  As  the Chamber knows,  it  is my  honor to represent the community of  Louisville  and  Jefferson County  in  which Phil grew up and played high  school football.  Of course, he played his college foot ball  in  the Commonwealth of Ken tucky at Morehead State.  Let me  just say that it was with  mixed emotions, but the general emo tion and the one that won out at the  end was to salute Phil Simms and of  course Tom Jackson, who played with  Denver and played his collegiate ball  at the University of Louisville, on a  job well done for America and since  that game was beamed around  the  world to sort of introduce football at  that level to the entire globe.  I wish you well, and good luck to you  in the coming year.  WELCOME BACK, MR.  PRESIDENT  <Mr.  SOLOMON  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",1987
89,556,2,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker,  the  American people are somewhat con fused when  they pick up  a  paper  which  has  nationwide  distribution,  and  they  read a  poll watch which  comes out with some negatives about  President Reagan.  WE  SHOULD NOT RAISE OUR  SALARIES WITHOUT A RECORD  VOTE  <Mr. MACK asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1987
90,556,2,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker, in the 4  years  I  have been  in  the Congress  there  is one  impression  that stands  out and that is the quality of our col leagues. The dedication  to our  jobs,  the hard work and the long hours is  proof of our commitment to service but that is not the issue.  The issue is the integrity of the in stitution. A democracy works because  . of a bond that exists between its leaders and its people. That bond is based  on faith and credibility.  How do we  ask  the people back  home to have faith in our leadership  when we will not do what we  are  asking them to do-that is, to ask less  of government or pay higher taxes to  solve the deficit problem.  It just doesn't fit-that we should  ask others to do with less and then  raise our salaries without a vote.  Join me in signing this letter asking  the Speaker for a vote before Febru ary 5.  PRESIDENT  REAGAN  SHOULD  ANNOUNCE  OPPOSITION  TO  THE  CONTINUING  RESOLU TION  <Mr.  HUBBARD  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1987
91,556,2,Mr. HUBBARD.," Mr. Speaker,  to night President Reagan will deliver his  seventh annual State of the Union Ad dress to the 100th Congress at the be ginning of the 200th anniversary of  the Federal Constitution.  When future historians  reflect on  the events of recent years, they will no  doubt hold us all accountable for the  continued record Federal budget defi cits and accompanying collapse of the  congressional budget process that has  characterized the past several years.  We are currently leaving a legacy of  debt for our children and grandchil dren vividly symbolized by  the now  routine use of the continuing resolu tion.  The  continuing  resolution  has  become an annual escape mechanism  which confounds a  rational Federal  fiscal policy.  I urge President Reagan in his State  of the Union Address tonight to issue  the 100th Congress a warning-that he  will not tolerate another bloated con tinuing resolution. He should say to night that he will veto any continuing  resolution that reaches his desk and  thereby  force  the Congress  to pass  each of the 13 appropriations bills separately and on time before October  1.

93,569,2,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  express my strong support  for House Joint  Resolution 1 02 which would make available  emergency additional funds for the homeless  in our Nation. All of us have seen  firsthand  the  tragedy of  increased homeless persons  that now occurs in our streets. Not only are  the numbers increasing, a staggering 25 per cent increase in recent months, but the type  of homeless as well. Now  included  in  these  sobering homelessness statistics are entire  families, once a rarity, .who have no place to  turn  for shelter. These are families who had  jobs and homes and, because of layoffs,  ill ness, and other unforeseen circumstances,  have lost everything. And to add to the crisis,  they are being turned away from shelters be cause of the lack of resources. These shelters  are already filled beyond capacity and simply  cannot take on more homeless without these  additional funds.  The winter months are of course the most  dangerous  for  these Americans. The  recent  snows and freezing temperatures make it life  threatening for the homeless to be out on the  streets without adequate shelter. Passage of  this emergency  resolution will greatly assist  existing programs and facilities in helping the  homeless survive this critical winter season.  Congress has,  in  the  last  few years, en acted  legislation  to address  the problem of  homelessness. Although  the programs have  provided assistance, the constant increase in  this segment of the population continues  to  provide a challenge  to  fully address chronic  homelessness. Among the top priorities of the  1 OOth Congress will be the national homeless  crisis. However,  this measure  is desperately  needed now to protect  those  in need while  such  congressional  deliberation  is  taking  place.  Mr. Speaker,  I urge my colleagues to  with me in swift approval of this resolution.  ",1987
94,569,2,Mr. MANTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of House Joint Resolution 1 02 to pro vide an urgent supplemental appropriation of  $50 million  to aid  the homeless. This much  needed legislation would  transfer $50 million  from the Disaster Relief Program operated by  join  the Federal Emergency Management Agency  to FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Pro gram.  Mr. Speaker, there are an estimated 2 to 3  million homeless people in the United States.  Furthermore, a rising number of families who  have lost their homes and cannot find afford able housing are  joining  the  ranks of  the  homeless. In New York City and in many cities  across the Nation, the problem of homeless ness has reached crisis proportions. Local au thorities and nonprofit groups are unable  to  handle the rising number of persons seeking  shelter from the elements.  House Joint Resolution 1 09 will provide the  funds  necesssary  to meet  the  immediate  needs of the homeless by providing emergen cy shelter while  the Congress develops a  long-term plan to address this national trage dy.  I have joined a number of my colleagues  in cosponsoring  legislation, H.R. 558,  to es tablish a comprehensive homeless relief plan.  This bipartisan legislation would provide $500  million for emergency shelter, food and health  care programs to assist the homeless. In addi tion  to  funding FEMA's Emergency Shelter  Programs,  funding would be provided  for a  newly authorized transitional housing program  that would move the homeless out of shelters  and  into group homes with support services.  In addition,  the measure would establish a  new program to convert underutilized Govern ment buildings to shelters for the homeless.  While  this comprehensive  legislation envi sions a long-term solution to the problem of  homelessness, there is an  immmediate prob lem which we must address. Congress must  enact House Joint Resolution 1 02 to provide  emergency assistance to those less fortunate  Americans who are without shelter.  Mr. Speaker,  I want to commend you and  the distinguished chairman of the Appropria tions Committee for bringing  this emergency  legislation to the floor. I urge my colleagues to  vote for House Joint Resolution 1 02.  ",1987
95,569,2,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of House Joint Resolution 1 02,  the  emergency  supplemental  appropriations bill  that had been approved last week by the Ap propriations Committee,  transferring $50 mil lion from the Federal Emergency Management  Agency's [FEMA] Disaster Relief Program  to  its Emergency Food and Shelter Program  to  aid  the homeless in our society. The Appro priations  Committee's  actions  follow  the  House Democratic Steering and Policy Com mittee's resolution on January 21st, urging this  Congress  to  take a  leadership  role  in  the  effort to provide the food, shelter, and critical  medical  assistance  needed  by  homeless  people throughout America.  Mr. Speaker, homelessness  is an urgent  and growing problem. It is a problem that we  would be inhumane to ignore. Although exact  statistics have been subject to debate,  it is,  nevertheless, clear that more Americans are  homeless  today  than at any  time since  the  Great Depression, and the number is growing.  This  reality becomes even more disturbing  when we  consider  that  the needs of  the  homeless extend  far beyond  the need  for  simple protection from the elements.  According  to a recent study conducted by  th'9 U.S. Conference of Mayors,  in 1986, our  Nation experienced a 20-percent increase in  the demand  for emergency shelter. Further more, it is anticipated that homelessness will  increase by 87 percent in the 25 largest U.S.  cities in 1987.  According  to  the U.S.  Task  Force  on  Hunger and Homelessness, an average of 24  percent of the demand by American cities for  funding support for homelessness is currently  unmet, causing cities to turn away an average  of 32 percent of individuals seeking food and  shelter. The Task Force's findings also con clude that among the current homeless popu lation  in  the United States, 56 percent are  single men, 28 percent are families with chil dren, 15 percent are single women, 29 per cent are chronically mentally ill, and only 20  percent are employed in full or part-time jobs.  Many homeless persons are disabled and  will never be able  to adequately care  for  themselves. Others suffer from serious mental  health disorders and require appropriate psy chiatric care.  It  is also estimated  that  the  homeless suffer the more common  illnesses  and diseases in greater proportions than the  average person. Due to their exposure to ex tremes of heat and cold, stress, hunger, and  street violence, homeless people have seven  times more  limb disorders, six  times more  nerve problems,  four  times more colds, and  three  times more skin  troubles  than other  Americans.  Who are  the homeless? They are black,  white, Asian, and Hispanic. They are the very  old and the very young. They are to be found  in every  region and every State. Both  their  needs and their numbers are too great to be  ignored.  Mr. Speaker, as we begin the historic 1 OOth  Congress,  I urge my colleagues to follow the  lead of  the Democratic Steering and Policy  Committee, and support legislation and fund ing levels that adequately address the needs  of the homeless.

97,569,2,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Speaker, may I  say that this situation was called to  the attention of the Committee on Ap propriations  something over  a  year  ago. That is the need to deal with, to  meet the problems of the people who  are homeless in our cities as well as in  rural areas. That report was filed last  year.  Let me point out again, this is not a  program of major outlays for homeless  families. As I said earlier, it will not  fund any $2,000 or $3,000 per month  apartment. But it will provide emer gency shelter and emergency meals.  This does not foreclose future action.  Mr. Speaker, this money is used for  the purposes for which it was first ap propriated-for disasters, but disasters  involving the homeless. It makes use  of  the United Way of America,  the  Salvation Army, the National Council  of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A.,  the National Conference of Catholic  Charities, the Council of Jewish Fed",1987
98,582,2,The PRESIDENT.," Mr. Speaker, Mr.  President, distinguished Members of  Congress, honored guests, and fellow  citizens.  May I congratulate all of you who  are Members of  this historic 100th  Congress  of  the United States  of  America.  In  this 200th  anniversary  year of our Constitution, you and I  stand on the shoulders of giants-men  whose words and deeds put wind in  the sails of freedom.  However, we must always remember  that our Constitution is to be celebrat ed not for being old, but for being  young-young with the same energy,  spirit, and promise  that filled each  eventful day  in Philadelphia's State  House. We will be guided tonight by  their acts; we will be guided forever by  their words.  Now,  forgive me, but I can't resist  sharing a  story from  those historic  days. Philadelphia was bursting with  civic pride in the spring of 1787, and  its newspapers began embellishing the  arrival of  the Convention delegates  with elaborate social classifications.  Governors of States were called ""Ex cellency.""  Justices  and Chancellors  had reserved  for  them ""Honorable""  with a capital ""H."" For Congressmen,  it was ""honorable"" with a small ""h.""  All others were referred to as ""the fol lowing respectable characters.''  Well,  for  this  100th Congress,  I  invoke special Executive powers to de clare that each of you must never be  titled less than Honorable with a cap ital ""H.""  Incidentally, I am delighted we are  celebrating the 100th birthday of the  Congress. It is always a pleasure  to  congratulate  someone  with  more  birthdays than I have had.  Now, there's a new face at this place  to honor  tonight. Please  join me  in  warm congratulations  to Speaker of  the House JIM WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker,  you might recall a similar situation in  your very first session of Congress, 32  years ago. Then, as now, the Speaker ship had changed hands, and another  great son of Texas, Sam Rayburn ""Mr. Sam""-sat in your chair. I cannot  find better words than those used by  President Eisenhower  that  evening:  ""We still have much to do together; I  am sure that we will get it done-and,  that we shall do it in harmony and  good will.""  Tonight,  I  renew  that pledge. To  you, Mr. Speaker, and to Senate Ma jority Leader ROBERT BYRD who brings  34 years of distinguished service to the  Congress, may I say: Though there are  changes in this Congress, America's in terest remain the same. I am confident  that, along with Republican  leaders  BOB MICHEL and BOB DoLE, this Con gress can make history.  Six years ago, I was here to ask the  Congress to join me in America's New  Beginning.  The results are something of which  we can all be proud. Our inflation rate  is now the lowest in a quarter of a cen tury. The prime  interest  rate has  fallen  from  the  21%  percent  the  month before we  took office  to 7%  percent today, and those rates have  triggered the most housing starts in 8  years.  The unemployment  rate-still  too  high-is the lowest in nearly 7 years,  and our people have created nearly 13  million new jobs. Over 61 percent of  everyone over the age of 16, male and  female, is employed-the highest per centage on record.  Let's roll up our sleeves, go to work,  and put America's economic engine at  full throttle.  We can also be heartened by our  progress across the world. Most impor tant, America is at peace tonight, and  freedom  is on  the march. We have  done much these past years to restore  our defenses, our alliances, and our  leadership in the world. Our sons and  daughters in the services once again  wear their uniforms with pride.  But  though we have made much  progress, I have one major regret. I  took a risk with regard to our action in  Iran. It did not work, and for that I  assume full responsibility.  The goals were worthy. I do not be lieve it was wrong to try to establish  contacts with a country of strategic  importance or to try to save lives. And  certainly it was not wrong to try to  secure freedom for our citizens held in  barbaric  captivity. But we  did not  achieve what we wished, and serious  mistakes were made in trying to do so.  We will get to the bottom of this, and  I will  take whatever action  is called  for.  But in debating the past, we must  not deny ourselves the successes of the  future. Let it never be said of this gen eration of Americans that we became  so obsessed with failure  that we  re fused to take risks that could further  the cause of peace and freedom in the  world.  Much  is  at  stake here,  and  the  Nation and the world are watching-to  see if we go forward together in the  national interest, or if we let partisan ship weaken us.  And let there be no mistake about  American policy: We will not sit idly  by if our interests or our friends in the  Middle East are threatened, nor will  we yield to terrorist blackmail.  Now,  ladies and gentlemen of the  Congress, why don't we get to work?  is safer, it is not  I am pleased to report that, because  of our efforts to rebuild the strength  of America, the world is a safer place.  Earlier  this month,  I  submitted  a  budget to defend America and main tain our momentum to make up for  neglect in the last decade. I ask you to  vote out a defense and foreign affairs  budget that says ""yes"" to protecting  our country.  While the world  safe.  Since 1970, the Soviets have invested  $500 billion more on  their military  forces  than we  have. Even  today,  though nearly one  in  three Soviet  families is without running hot water,  and the average family spends 2 hours  a day shopping for the basic necessi ties  of  life,  their government  still  found the resources to transfer $75 bil lion in weapons to client states in the  past 5 years-clients like Syria, Viet nam, Cuba, Libya, Angola, Ethiopia,  Afghanistan, and Nicaragua.  With  120,000  Soviet  combat  and  military personnel and 15,000 military  advisers  in Asia, and Latin America,  can anyone still doubt  their single minded determination to expand their  power? Despite this, the Congress cut  my request for critical U.S. security as sistance to free nations by 21 percent  this year, and cut defense requests by  $85 billion in the last 3 years. These  assistance programs serve our national  interest as well as mutual  interests,  and when the programs are devastat ed, American interests are harmed. My  friends, it is my duty as President to  say to you again tonight that there is  no surer way to lose freedom than to  lose our resolve.  Today, the brave people of Afghani stan are showing  that  resolve. The  Soviet Union says it wants a peaceful  settlement in Afghanistan, yet it con tinues a brutal war and props up a  regime whose days are clearly num bered. We are ready to support a polit ical solution that guarantees the rapid  withdrawal of all Soviet  troops and  genuine  self-determination  for  the  Afghan people.  In Central America, too, the cause of  freedom  is being tested. And our re solve  is being  tested  there as well.  Here, especially, the world is watching  to see how this Nation responds.  Today, over 90 percent of the people  of Latin America  live  in democracy.  Democracy is on the march in Central  and South America. Communist Nica ragua is the odd man out-suppressing  the Church, the press, and democratic  dissent and promoting subversion  in  the region. We support diplomatic ef forts, but these efforts can never suc ceed if the Sandinistas win their war  against the Nicaraguan people.  Our  commitment  to  a Western  Hemisphere safe from aggression did  not occur by spontaneous generation  on the day we  took office. It began  ",1987
99,595,2,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker,  last year  I had  the privilege of knowing a little 18-month-old  girl named Julianne Mclaughlin. Julianne was  a patient at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.  She was a little girl who would die unless she  received a liver transplant.  As it turned out Julianne did not receive a  new liver and her passing added to the thou sands of Americans who have died for want  of transplanted organs since the 1984 Nation al Organ Transplant Act was enacted.  Last year  I  introduced H.R. 5587, a bill  which would  have  established  a  national  organ donor  registry with available organs  being allocated strictly on a basis of medical  need. The bill also called for required request  provisions to be utilized in any hospital receiv ing Medicare or Medicaid  funding. Patients  would at least be informed about the possibili ty of potential organ donation when hospital ized.  Each aspect of H.R. 5587 was made  law  with the enactment of the 1987 Budget Rec onciliation Act. Now, finally, a workable organ  donor system is in place.  The following column written by Ellen Good man, however, points to new and disturbing  signs that the administration intends to thwart  the will of the Congress-and what is now the  law. I urge my colleagues to read this column  and to keep it in mind when meeting with con stituents. The 99th Congress accomplished  much in the field of organ transplants. Mem bers can be proud of their record and should  be aware of the intentions of the administra tion.  The article follows:  HANGING UP ON DESPERATE FAMILIES  <By Ellen Goodman>  BosTON.-Get out your note pads, your  television cameras and your hankies. Here  come the anecdotes:  It is July 1983, and President Reagan is  talking on  the  radio about  little Ashley  Bailey  from Texas, who needs an organ  transplant. ""Time is running out,"" he says.  ""I'm issuing a plea to the nation to find  Ashley a donor.""  It is May 1986, and the first lady is on the  telephone calling the family of Alex Girard,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  a 9-month-old waiting in Massachusetts for  a liver transplant. She offers sympathy and  an Air Force jet to rush a donor organ to  their baby.  Now put away the note pads, cameras and  hankies. Here comes the public policy.  It is January 1987, and the budget submit ted by the president is missing something.  It's missing the $500,000 for the Office of  Organ Transplantation. It's missing the $1.2  million for the national computer network  to match donors with the people who are  waiting.  In Year Seven of the Reagan administra tion, we have grown used to these gaps be tween Reagan sentiments and actions. We  have grown used to presidential sympathy  for  the victims of his own decisions. We  have grown used to the fact that some inter nal connection is broken, a synapse unmade,  between the man and the policy maker. But  for the hundreds of Americans waiting for  livers,  hearts, pancreases,  this particular  patch of  ground  between  publicity  and  policy seems especially barren.  In  recent years,  the waiting  room  for  those who need organ transplants has often  looked like a wrestling ring where families  compete for a scarce resource. We have seen  people who use money and the media  to  jump to the top of the list. There have been  organs wasted in one state while patients  waited in another.  This is why Congress passed the National  Organ Transplant Act in 1984, and passed it  almost unanimously. The cornerstone of the  bill was the network to match donors with  recipients and to make sure organs were dis tributed on medical grounds and priorities.  The administration opposed this bill when  it was in Congress, insisting that these pro grams should be privately financed. When  the bill-finally signed by the president became law, the administration went on re sisting it. The money for the network was  withheld  until  the  last  possible  legal  moment, Sept. 30, 1986. Now, a mere four  months later, it has axed the fledgling pro gram out of the new budget.  As Sen. Albert Gore, Jr. of Tennessee,  who has watchdogged this program, notes in  frustration,  this  is not an administration  bothered much by  the  laws of Congress:  ""They think they're above the law. It makes  very little difference if the Congress passes  a  law, even if the margin is 366-6 in the  House, and 100-0  in the Senate. If some  willful, ideological bureaucrat thinks it's in consistent  with  his  philosophy,  that's  enough to countermand the whole system.""  What  is  true in foreign policy  is  true at  home.  This transplant bill is a small ticket item.  It adds up to less than $4 million in a $1 tril lion budget. If the president refuses to put  it back in, Congress can. But it is a revealing  miniature of an administration that com forts with one hand the people it strikes  with the other.  Gore sent the president a polite and per sonal  plea  reminding  him-in  case  he  forgot-""both you and Mrs. Reagan have  shown a great deal of personal interest on  behalf of so many of these families. Your  pledges to help have been a source of com fort for many of them."" He has yet to hear  back.  Without this national system for gather ing and  fairly distributing such a  scarce  human resource, we are back in the game of  wait  and waste. Desperate  families will  again compete for publicity. Their best hope  will be to become the anecdote of the week.  Remember that when you read about the  next sympathy call from the White House.  2013  A TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN R.  OLENICK  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 27, 1987  ",1987
100,595,2,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like  to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Ste phen R. Olenick, a constituent from my district  who will be honored at a public dinner on  March 1 for a long and distinguished career.  Mr. Olenick will be retiring in March as Me honing County auditor, a position he has held  for the past 24 years. Unopposed in his last  three elections, and having held this position  longer than any before him, he has been a  public official who has truly endeared himself  to the respect and gratitude of the people of  Mahoning County.  Mr. Olenick will be ending his public service  career after nearly 40 years. After serving as  county councilman  for  the seventh ward  in  Youngstown for 8 years, he then went on to  serve as State senator for three terms. This  long career also  included having served as  deputy sheriff and deputy of courts, as well as  having served as Mahoning County Democrat ic Party chairman and a three-time delegate to  the national convention.  In addition, he  is past president of County  Officials of Ohio, Northeastern Ohio County  Auditors Association and the County Auditors  Association of Ohio.  Mr. Olenick has been more than a dedicat ed public servant of his many supporters in  Mahoning County. He has been, and contin ues to be, an active supporter of his commu nity and church. He has been a member or  chairman of several groups,  including having  been a member of the local bicentennial com mittee.  He was a great baseball player in his youth  and has managed seven  local championship  teams over the years. In 1933 he pitched for  the St. Stanislaus baseball team when it won  the first national amateur championship. More  recently, he was  just inducted by  the Curb stone Coaches Hall of Fame and was elected  to his 11th term as president of the Baseball  Oldtimers Association.  Mr. Olenick has also given of himself to his  local  church, St. Mathias,  not only as a  member, but as a church councilman and na tional chairman of Slovak Catholic Sokols.  Stephen Olenick has contributed much  to  Mahoning County, by way not only of his long  and distinguished public career, but by his  commitment to caring for and contributing to  his community and society in private  life as  well. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I  pay tribute  to Stephen and also  to his wife  Ann who has supported his successes for 48  years.  I wish  them both  the best of luck  in  Stephen's retirement, much deserved after a  lifetime of distinguished community service.  ",1987
101,608,2,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  share with my fellow Members of Congress a  special event occurring in February in western  New York.  As part of its yearly fundraiser for the Arthri tis Foundation, the Newfane Health Facility, a  nursing home in Newfane, NY, is sponsoring a  ""visitathon."" Local clubs and organizations will  be coming into the facility  to participate with  the residents in a wide variety of events. Also,  individuals from  the community will be paired  up with residents and encouraged to visit as  frequently as possible during  the month of  February.  I bring this event to the attention of my col leagues because it  is such an ingenious way  of achieving  two noble and  important goals:  Raising money for the cure of arthritis and in creasing the interaction between the nursing  facility and the community.  Once thought of as an ""old woman's dis ease,"" arthritis can affect either sex at any  time-250,000 American children, as well as  97 percent of  those over 60, suffer from  it.  The No. 1 crippler in the Nation, arthritis costs  us approximately $6 billion annually  in  lost  wages. This is a serious and widespread dis ease;  the Newfane Health Facility  is  to be  commended for  its efforts to raise money to  stop it.  The visitathon is also intended to contribute  to a greater understanding and appreciation of  both nursing homes and the men and women  who reside in them. Too often we assume that  once one enters a nursing home, one is no  longer a part of  the  larger community. By  bringing people  into  the facility,  it  is hoped  that the fear and apprehension which many of  us feel toward nursing homes will be reduced.  At  the same time,  it  is hoped that the resi dents' feelings of  isolation  from  the  larger  community will also be lessened.  Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for all my col leagues in expressing admiration for the good  work taking place at the Newfane Health Fa cility. The 32d Congressional District of New  York  is deeply proud of the Newfane Health  Facility.  KODAK ANNOUNCES WITH DRAWAL FROM SOUTH AFRICA  HON. RONALD V. DELLUMS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 27, 1987  ",1987
102,608,2,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, the situation in  South Africa continues to deteriorate. The op pressive regime has arrested close to 9,000  children  in  the  last 6 months. Some have  been  subjected  to  torture. Black  relocation  continues. Press censorship has increased.  Significant  pressure must  be  applied  to  South Africa to bring the South African Gov ernment to a change of policy. To this end, I  will  soon  reintroduce  the  full  sanctions bill  which passed the House in the last session of  Congress.  Many United States companies are now  withdrawing from South Africa. The Eastman  Kodak Co. has announced a plan which  is  consistent with the intent of my sanctions leg islation. It is a model to be followed.  I would  like  to share with  the House  the  Kodak  announcement of withdrawal  issued  last November.  The Kodak announcement follows:  KODAK ANNOUNCES WITHDRAWAL FROM  SOUTH AFRICA  RocHESTER, NY, Nov. 19.-Eastman Kodak  Company today announced plans to with draw from South Africa.  Under terms of the withdrawal, no Kodak  unit anywhere in the world will be permit ted to supply products to South Africa, and  the assests of Kodak South Africa will be  sold. Employees will be terminated with a  generous separation package.  Kodak chairman and chief executive offi cer Colby H. Chandler said the decision to  withdraw came only after long and careful  consideration.  ""The economics of  the situation are a  major factor in our decision to withdraw,""  ",1987
103,621,2,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of House Resolution 55, a resolution  in  remembrance of  the crew of  the space  shuttle Challenger. I commend the gentleman  from New Jersey [Mr. ROE] for introducing this  resolution which sheds light upon the tragedy  which  took  the  lives of seven brave Ameri cans.  A year ago  today millions of Americans  watched  in disbelief at  the explosion which  destroyed the space shuttle Challenger and its  crew of seven. It was a moment that very few  of us will ever forget and that we never should  forget. We must  remember  those  seven  heroes who lost their lives for this great coun try of ours and use this tragedy as an inspira tion  to  return  to  safe space  flight and  to  secure our position of  leadership  in space.  The families of those seven courageous astro nauts have continued to move ahead and so  must we.  These  seven Americans  should  be  en shrined forever in history so our children and  grandchildren  can  learn  of  their  unselfish  deeds for years to come.  The  mission  commander,  Francis  R.  Scobee, who flew on the space shuttle as the  pilot of mission 41-C in April 1984;  The mission pilot, Capt. Michael J. Smith,  was on his  first shuttle flight after being se lected an astronaut in 1980;  Mission specialist Lt. Col. Ellison Onizuka,  who flew on the first military mission in Janu ary 1985, aboard the space shuttle Discovery  and  was  the  first  Japanese-American  in  space;  Mission specialist Judith A. Resnick,  the  first Jewish astronaut as well as one of the  first women on board;  E.  Mission  specialist  Ronald  McNair  became one of the  first black astronauts  in  1978;  Payload  specialist  Christa McAuliffe,  a  school teacher, who was to conduct a series  of classroom  lessons from orbit and conduct  several basic classroom experiments; and  Payload specialist Gregory Jarvis, a Hughes  Aircraft  specialist, who was  to  perform  a  series  of  fluid  dynamics  experiments  that  would support satellite redesign.  This week, many Americans will remember  those heroes  in ceremonies and memorials  throughout  the country.  In my own congres sional district  in Monticello, NY, citizens and  clergy will  join  together  in a  remembrance  ceremony for the severn Challenger 1 o astro nauts.  I know that we all will be joining them  in spirit for that event.  It  is hoped  that this  tragedy will not deter  our space program but rather that the pioneer ing spirit of the dedicated crew of the Chal lenger will inspire us and motivate us to con tinue to pursue /our explorations of space.  In  closing, I am reminded of a quote by an anon ymous author:  ""Looking back  is sometimes  painful. But,  if we don't,  their sacrifices will  have been in vain.""  ",1987
104,621,2,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, 1 year has  passed since  the  tragic  loss of  the space  shuttle Challenger and her crew. As we  re member  that disaster and  its aftermath, we  mourn not just for a symbol of our country's  1  progress,  but  for  individuals-Capt.  Dick  Scobee, Michael Smith, Judith Resnik, Ellison  Onizuka, Ronald McNair, Gregory Jarvis, and  Christa McAuliffe.  This  loss  saddened  all  Americans,  but  touched painfully close to home in my district  in Houston. Several of the crewmembers were  my constituents, and  their deaths cast a pall  over  the neighborhoods near  the Johnson  Space Center.  During  the past year, we have gradually  come to terms with our sorrow, and resolved  as a nation  to pursue  the goals  that  these  men and women gave their lives for. We have  come  to realize  that  the commitment of the  crew is best honored by our own rededication  to their dream.  Each of us can help keep the dream alive.  First, we can support the Challenger families  in their effort to build children's space life cen ters-designed to give hands-on  learning ex periences to the next generation. Their plan is  to establish centers in Washington and Hous ton  first, and  then assist  in developing addi tional ones around the country. The nonprofit  National Challenger Center Foundation estab lished  to  fund  the centers, with an office  in  Houston and Washington, can use any and all  help.  The second avenue is continued funding for  NASA's exploration and  research programs,  despite our current budget problems. Federal  spending for NASA has always been cost-ef fective, providing secondary benefits and ad vances  in  technological development, private  sector  job creation, and scientific education  and  training.  It is  important that we continue  our Nation's commitment and  leadership  in  space.  Finally, we must all  join  the employees at  NASA  in  rededicating ourselves  to  the ulti mate goal of safety in the space program. We  in  the Congress,  like many Americans, had  begun  to expect  flawless performance  from  the space shuttle, becoming  irritated or sur prised by malfunctions and delays.  If there is  one  lesson of  the Challenger disaster,  it  is  that the safety of human lives must be our No.  1 priority. Nothing  is more sacred, or more  worthy of remembrance.  ",1987
105,621,2,Mr. DREIER  of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  none of us will ever forget the shock and an guish we felt on this day last year upon learn ing that the space shuttle Challenger and  its  crew had been  lost only 73  seconds after  launch. Along with all Americans, we not only  shared  the grief of  the crew members' fami lies, but also concern over the general safety  and future of the space program following the  Challenger mishap.  One year later, we are still saddened by the  tragic loss of seven brave Americans. Howev er, the direction of the space program is once  again clear:  full speed ahead. The challenge  NASA has  faced-restoring  the  confidence  necessary  to maintain  public  support-has  been as great as  the challenge it faced get ting the first space shuttle off the ground. The  shuttle, and  indeed  the entire manned  flight  program, could have been  jeopardized had  the American people not been willing to thor oughly and honestly examine  the mistakes  that had been made and correct them.  It has  indeed been a struggle  to  turn  the  Challenger tragedy  into a positive  reassessment of NASA's  technical  and managerial  processes. However, with  the next shuttle  launch scheduled  for  just over 1 year  from  now, a majority of Americans not only support  continuing  the program,  but are willing  to  accept  the painstaking delay necessary  to  ensure the safety of the launch.  Those who would scale back  the shuttle  program  because of  the  dangers  involved  might be  interested  in  the open  letter com memorating  the  tragedy which was  released  today by the families of the seven crew mem bers. The letter tells us that, if the Challenger  crew were alive today, they would encourage  us to ""not fear risk. All exploration, all growth  is calculated  risk. Without  frontiers, civiliza tions stagnate."" Our greatest memorial to the  crew would be to follow that advice, to contin ue  learning all  that our space programs can  teach about our universe.  ",1987
106,621,2,Mr. BUECHNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup port of House Resolution 55, a commemora tive resolution in memory of the seven brave  astronauts who  lost  their  lives 1 year ago  today  in  the  tragic Challenger accident. The  seven: Michael Smith, Ellison Onizuka, Francis  ""Dick"" Scobee, Judy Resnik, Ronald McNair,  Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe will for ever live in our memories.  After 1 year of mourning our great loss, and  learning from that loss, let us take this occa sion to recommit ourselves to our fine space  program. We  can  look  forward  to a bright  future  in  space exploration, but only  if we  have the courage to make it happen.  The  families of the Challenger crew wrote  an open letter to the Nation in which they im plored us to ""carry on Challengers mission.""  They write:  Since their loss, we have been troubled by  the incompleteness of their mission * * *. If  they were alive and could speak to all Amer icans, we believe the Challenger crew would  say this: Do not fear risk. All exploration,  all growth is a calculated risk. Without frontiers, civilizations stagnate.    That  is  the challenge before us  today. To  carry on  that same spirit of exploration. To  push onward to greater frontiers. To complete  the Challenger mission.  ",1987
107,621,2,Mr. BONER of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am proud to join my colleagues in saluting the  seven Challenger astronauts and  the spirit of  adventure which they embodied.  As we remember Commander Dick Scobee,  Pilot Michael Smith, Astronauts Judy Resnik,  Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, and Gregory  Jarvis,  and  civilian  school  teacher Christa  McAuliffe, we recall their bravery and commit ment. Like the many explorers who preceded  them, the seven Challenger astronauts exhibit ed a selfless devotion to bettering our under standing of the universe and our place in it.  It is our curiousity about the unknown, our  amazement at the wonders of nature, and the  excitement of discovery which characterizes  our Nation's explorers and, most particularly,  the members of our astronaut corps.  Many of these traits are  found  in our chil dren and, perhaps most appropriately, one of  the consequences of  the Challenger tragedy  has been our Nation's efforts to improve edu cation and further foster the childhood excite ment and curiousity about the stars.  ",1987
108,634,2,Mr. KYL.," Mr. Speaker, will the gen tleman yield?  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes,  I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.  ",1987
109,634,2,Mr. KYL.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to point out that in the State of Arizo na in my hometown of Phoenix, ap parently our constituents were as con cerned as  the constituents  that  the  gentleman has  just described. As  a  matter of fact, we have a  radio talk  show host whose name is Tom Leykis  on radio station KFYI who became so  exercised as a result of the many hun dreds of  telephone calls  that he re ceived on this proposal that he began  a letter-writing campaign in our com munity and tomorrow he is going to be  delivering to our district offices bun dles of mail. Listening to him on the  radio, I can assure the gentleman that  the mail is running about 100 to 0 op posed  to  this proposition. We await  the letters that will be delivered to us.  When I left Phoenix on Monday, by  lastest count they had received some  3,000 letters in opposition to the pay  raise.  I might also point out to the gentle man that prior to the time the Presi dent submitted his budget, my col league,  the gentleman from Arizona,  and I  joined in a letter to the Presi dent requesting on behalf of our con stituents who did not believe that Con gress deserved a big pay increase, that  he not submit that pay increase to the  Congress in his budget message, and as  the gentleman points out, to his credit  it was reduced substantially; but the  significant constitutional question re mains as to whether that is his obliga tion or the responsibility of the Con gress.  For that reason, I support much of  what the gentleman has said, as well  as the proposal discussed earlier pro posed  by  the Representative  from  Iowa, which would forbid a pay raise  taking effect during the Congress in  which it is voted and would, of course,  require a roll call vote by the body as sembled at that point.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the oppor tunity to speak on the matter.  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr.  Speaker, I would just like to conclude  and reiterate again, the process is such  now that I believe unconstitutionally  on February 5  the Members of  the  U.S. House of Representatives will re ceive a $12,000 annual raise with no  vote. Even though we vote on every thing else in this place from Social Se curity to defense, to the environment,  to education, et cetera, et cetera, we  will have no vote and the raise will  take effect automatically unless legislation to block it is allowed to come to  the floor or unless the Speaker him self calls  for a  rollcall vote on  this  issue.  0 1620  I will repeat it again. I will challenge  the Speaker, ""Mr. Speaker, please, in  the interest of the Constitution and in  the interest of the honor and integrity  of the House of Representatives, and  in the interest of the American people,  call for a vote on this pay raise issue.""  GENERAL LEAVE  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr.  Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5  legislative  days within which  to  revise  and  extend their remarks and include ex traneous material on  the subject of  my special order today.

Obviously, I  take even more pleasure at this time,  because I am commending the  team  not  only  for winning  the National  Football Conference Championship,  but for becoming the world champions  of professional football. I am pleased  to be joined in introducing this resolu tion by my colleague, Senator BRAD LEY.  I would first like to extend my con dolences  to my colleagues  from  the  State of Colorado. Their Broncos are a  fine team. They put up a valiant strug gle. As a matter of fact,  in the first  half, they might have even had a few  of the Giants faithful on the edge of  their seats. But the second half proved  that the Giants are truly the top team  in professional football,  just as they  have shown us all season long.  I now look forward  to dining with  the distinguished Senator from Colo rado, Mr. WIRTH, as we feast on Colo rado's finest  foods-to be presented  here at the Nation's Capitol.  Mr. President, January 25 was a par ticularly proud day  for  those of us  living in New Jersey. By winning the  21st  Superfund-Super  Bowl,  the  Giants brought New Jersey  its first  football world championship.  They won this game, as they have  done all season, in a very convincing  fashion. New  Jerseyan Phil Simms  passed his way into the record books,  earning himself  the Most Valuable  Player Award. The vaunted Giants de fense  shut down quarterback  John  Elway's offense  in  the second half,  again  showing  themselves  to be  as  good as any defense has ever been.  We in New Jersey are very proud of  our Giants. And, Mr. President, this is  a  team we can all be proud of. They  have displayed a spirit that is conta gious. They have demonstrated a sense  of sportsmanship that can serve as an  example to the many youngsters who  look up to them. And the way they  have  shared  their  championship  season with their loyal fans has been a  pleasure to watch.  In 1976, New Jersey welcomed the  Giants with open  arms. Yesterday,  New Jersey welcomed them home to a  celebration in Giants Stadium, Mead owlands  in East Rutherford, NJ. To  us, they are, and always will be, the  New  Jersey Giants. Next year, we  hope to celebrate another champion   ship. But come what may, we will be  rooting for our Giants.  ",1987
131,751,2,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to bring the following commentary to the  attention  of my  colleagues. Mr.  Fein,  its  author, adroitly analyzes  the new Sandinista  constitution pointing out how  really undemo cratic  and authoritarian  it  is. Using Hitler's  Mein Kampf as an analogy, Mr. Fein shows  how Sandinista President Ortega is using his  constitution to advertise his dangerous politi cal designs. Unfortunately,  the world  ignored  Mein Kampf. The price of  this  inaction was  World War II. We should learn a lesson from  history and support those forces in Nicaragua,  like the democratic resistance (Contras), who  are fighting for freedom and democracy. The  alternative is clearly spelled out by Ortega in  his ""Mein Kampf,"" the new constitution. That  alternative  is  institutionalized  tyranny.  I urge  my colleagues to carefully review Mr. Fein's  insightful remarks.  NICARAGUA'S OWN ""MEIN KAMPF""?  The Nicaraguan constitution approved by  Sandinista President Daniel Ortega on Jan.  14, evokes the haunting memory of Adolf  Hitler's Mein Kampf.  Just as Hitler's book advertised  to  the  Germans and to the international communi ty his nefarious political designs, so the San dinista Constitution transparently aims at  the perpetual enslavement of  the Nicara guan people and  their Central American  neighbors.  The world community was unmoved by  Mein Kampf and paid a sanguinary political  price. A comparable price will be paid if the  Nicaraguan constitution fails to elicit inter national gambits  to oust  the Sandinistas  from power. If the Democrats in Congress  are sincerely dedicated to promoting human  rights they, should hold hearings to exam ine the Sandinista constitution.  Generally speaking, the new constitution  is a charter of rights for the government to  suppress individual citizens and to trample  on the interests of minorities, such as the  Miskito  Indians  inhabiting  the Atlantic  coastline. Article 4 anoints the state as ""the  fundamental  instrument of  the people  to  eliminate all forms of exploitation and sub mission of human beings,"" and ""to ensure  that the interests and rights of the popular  majority prevail.""  Accordingly, political rights are denied to  ""those who seek a return to the past or ad vocate the establishment of a similar politi cal system."" All individual rights are subor dinate to ""the reasonable requirements of  the common good."" Private homes may be  searched, and individuals detained without  cause to suspect criminal activity, on  the  written authorization of any official speci fied in law, including police officers or pros ecutors. There is no right to bail, no grand  jury indictment, nor jury trial in criminal  cases.  Freedom of religion, speech, press, and as sociation are explicitly denied. Article 69 re quires compliance with any law, irrespective  of religious belief, including laws requiring  homage to secular officials  in violation of  religious creeds.  Article 52 grants citizens the right to ""de nounce irregularities"" or to ""make construc tive criticisms"" of the government. A right  to assail government officials for ineptitude,  corruption, or a disagreement over policy is  withheld.  Article 68 enjoins the print media, broad casting, and other means of mass communi cations  to serve only ""national  interests.""  Thus,  the state  is empowered  to regulate  access to the means of communication, and  to prohibit  the expression of viewpoints  that respond to foreign interests or econom ic monopolies.  The constitution virtually eliminates pri vate property and economic liberties. Article  86  requires  that any profession or  trade  ""serve a social purpose."" Article 81 compels  worker participation in management. Arti cle 82 requires all employers to guarantee  employees work  compatible with  ""well  being"" and ""human dignity,"" vacations, paid  holidays, bonuses, and a minimization of  work  hazards.  There  is  no  protection  against expropriation of private property  without compensation.    Power over all health care is entrusted to  the state by Article 59. Articles 98-105 em power  the  state  to  redistribute wealth  earned by private activity,  to operate all  banking and insurance, to plan for all sec tors of  the economy,  to make all private  property subservient to ""the human inter ests of the nation"" and social functions, and  to control the production and distribution  of basic consumer goods.  Article 107 authorizes the state to expro priate land without compensation for trans fer to peasants to further the economic and  social objectives of the nation.  The omnipresence of state power over pri vate arrangements is exemplified by Chap ter IV, misnamed ""Family Rights."" There  the constitution ordains that parents must  share equally in the upbringing of children,  that children must respect and assist par ents, and that the state shall establish spe cial centers for the care of minors.  All authority over education is assigned to  the state by Article 119. Education  is  to  serve the development and transformation  of the country, and to combine manual and  intellectual labor. The state is  to promote  research and dissemination of the sciences,  arts. and letters. The earmarks of a Nicara guan-style  ""Chinese Cultural Revolution""  are manifest.  Article 89 grants the Miskitos a right to  preserve cultural identity, but only within  the  framework of national unity."" Thus,  any genuine autonomy or protection for the  Miskitos is denied.  The constitution  lacks checks and  that  might safeguard tyranny and centralization  of power. A unicameral legislature is created  with members serving six-year terms. The  legislature. however, performs judicial and  executive functions. It interprets the  law,  appoints judges, decrees pardons and com mutes sentences. Its legislative powers are  unrestricted, and reach such questions as  regulating ""all matters relating to symbols  of the nation."" Vetoes of legislation by the  president can be overridden by majority  vote.  The president  is  elected  for a  six-year  term, with potent legislative powers. He can  make law by decree regarding any fiscal or  administrative matter,  and  assumes  all  powers of the legislature during its recess  period. The president further administers  the economy. and determines the socio-eco nomic policy and program. Moreover,  the  president may suspend a broad array of con stitutional rights ""in case of war or when  demanded by  the security of  the nation,  economic conditions, or a national catastro phe."" President Ortega has  already  em ployed this open-sided emergency powers ar ticle,  as Hitler  used Article  48  in  the  Weimar constitution, to curb constitutional  guarantees.  The judiciary is impotent to protect indi vidual rights or respect for ostensible consti tutional safeguards. Judges of the Supreme  Court are elected by the legislature for six year  terms and may be  removed  for any  cause specified in law, and may have their  salaries reduced or eliminated for unpopular  rulings. The  jurisdiction of  the Supreme  Court  is  limited by  the  legislature which  may also assign it non-judicial functions.  The constitution rejects municipal auton omy as a means of diffusing government  power. Article 175 creates municipalities for  administrative purposes only.  That the Sandinista constitution is an in strument to oppress the Nicaraguan people  is underscored by the absence of its ratifica tion by  the electorate, and  the denial of  power to the people to initiate constitution al amendments.  In addition to the legions of domestic evils  perpetrated by the constitution, it also in corporates a truculent foreign policy.  Non-alignment is proclaimed, but not non interference in other countries. Indeed, Ar ticle 3 commits the nation to struggle for ""a  just world order,"" and against ""imperialist  domination and exploitation,"" and against  ""oppression and discrimination.""  As  experience  teaches,  these  flowery  phrases are Communist code-words for mili tary  intervention  in other countries,  illus trated by Cuban intervention in Venezuela,  Colombia, Angola, and Ethiopia. Indeed, Ar ticles 8 and 9 herald Nicaraguan military  intervention into the affairs of its Central  American neighbors by declaring that the  Nicaraguan people are an ""'integral part of  the Central American nation,"" and  that  Nicaragua will spare no efforts to achieve  ""political and economic integration"" in the  region.  Since Nicaragua  is surrounded by more  democratic regimes friendly  to the United  States, only belligerence can achieve Nicara gua's declared quest for Central American  unity.  In sum, the Nicaraguan constitution un wittingly unbosoms  the Sandinista's devo tion to the absolute supremacy of the state,  contempt for individual or minority rights,  civil liberties, and private property, and mil itant designs on neighboring countries.  Led by the United States, the free coun tries of the world should be galvanized by    This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

132,764,2,Mr.  LEHMAN  of California.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I am  introducing  legislation which will  address a serious flaw in  the Aid  to Families  With Dependent Children Unemployed Parent  Program  [AFDC-UP]. The  flaw  is commonly  known as the 1 00-hour work rule.  The AFDC-UP Program, which currently op erates in 23 States, the District of Columbia,  and Guam, provides benefits  to needy  two parent  families where  the  principal wage  earner is unemployed.  In this program unem ployment is currently defined as, ""not working,  or working  less  that 1 00 hours per month.""  Consequently, when the principal wage earner  works 1 00 hours or more,  regardless of  the  amount of income he receives, he becomes  ineligible for all aid.  In 1984,  the average AFDC-UP payment  per family was $479 per month. Simple math  tells us  that the primary wage earner would  have to work 140 hours at minimum wages in  order  to match  this average grant payment.  The  Federal Government,  however,  takes  away all his benefits  if he works  just 1 00  hours.  It  is my view  that this 1 00-hour work  rule results in a clear disincentive to find em ployment.  It discourages  the wage earner in  an AFDC-UP family from accepting job offers,  or results in the principal wage earner limiting  his or her hours of work  to  less than 1 00  in  order to protect vital benefits for the family.  It is time to address this shortcoming in the  AFDC Program and to eliminate the work dis incentive that has evolved. The bill I am intro ducing will do precisely  that.  It encourages  participation in the job market by establishing  demonstration projects nationwide where  the  1 00-hour rule would be waived. Wage earners  would be allowed  to work  in excess of 1 00  hours a month without the threat of losing all  AFDC and  other  related  benefits  such  as  medicaid. Families, instead of becoming ineli gible  for assistance would see  their AFDC  grants reduced. As a result there would be a  reduced expenditure of AFDC Program funds   for each family receiving earned income.  The  potential  significance  of maintaining  policies  that  discourage  employment  are  great. We need to implement policies that enJanuary 28, 1987  courage, not discourage AFDC  recipients  to  enter  the  job market. Penalizing  recipients  who work over a 1 00 hours a month does not  make prudent policy and will ultimately result  in a longterm dependency on  the AFDC-UP  Program.  The time has come to allow more flexibility  in our welfare programs so that we can  test  the waters on new approaches  to  reducing  welfare dependency. We need  to break  the  cycle of welfare dependency passed on from  generation  to generation of welfare  families.  Working parents set role models, restore dig nity and provide hope in families caught in the  welfare trap.  Waiving  this 1 00-hour  rule will allow able  bodied citizens  to work without placing  their  family's health and welfare in  jeopardy.  I en courage my colleagues to join me in efforts to  enact this important legislation.  TRIBUTE TO LEE LIBERMAN  HON. JACK BUECHNER  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 28, 1987  ",1987
133,764,2,Mr. BUECHNER.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to take this opportunity to express congratula tions and pay tribute to a diligent, civic-minded  St. Louis business leader, Mr. Lee Liberman,  chairman and chief executive officer of La clede Gas Co., who today will be honored as  the ""1986 St. Louis Man of the Year.""  Lee Liberman  is a selfless  individual who  feels a sense of duty to his fellow men and  women. He indeed has the heart of a servant.  Currently chairman of  the United Way cam paign, Mr. Liberman has an impressive record  of community service: past chairman of  the  Salvation Army Tree of Lights campaign, past  president of the Family and Personal Support  Center, and past president of  the St. Louis  Symphony Society.  Mr. Liberman  remains active with  the St.  Louis Symphony Society, serving as its chair man. He is also the newly-elected chairman of  the St. Louis Regional Commerce and Growth  Assoc1at1on, vice-chairman of Civic Progress,  and president of the Executive Service Corps  of St. Louis.  His  compassion  and  concern  for  those  needing health care  is well-established. Lee  Liberman  is a  trustee of Jewish Hospital,  Washington University Medical Center, Associ ated Hospitals, Cardinal Glennon Hospital,  and  is cochairman of the St. Louis Regional  Medical Center project.  As a  teenager, Lee Liberman earned  the  high honor of Eagle Scout.  Into his adult  years, he stayed active  in Scouting-serving  on the local council, executive board, and ad visory council.  Lee Liberman has been described as a  ""corporate executive with a Boy Scout heart,  a big city leader with the civic pride of a small  town mayor.""

134,777,2,Mr. JACOBS.," Mr. Speaker, well, I think I've  finally figured it out.  A Conservative  in Russia  is one who ac cuses a Liberal of being soft on capitalism.  A Conservative in America is one who ac cuses a Liberal of being soft on communism.  A Conservative on  the House Education  and Labor Committee is one who spends con servatively. A Liberal on the House Education  and Labor Committee is one who spends lib erally.  A Conservative on  the House Armed Serv ices Committee is one who spends liberally. A  Liberal on the House Armed Services Commit tee is one who spends conservatively.  A Conservative in  the White House is one  who borrows to pay current expenses. A Con servative  in business  is one who does not  borrow to pay current expenses.  So, which you are obviously depends on  where you are.  TRIBUTE TO OUR LADY QUEEN  OF MARTYRS SCHOOL  HON. JOSEPH J. DioGUARDI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 28, 1987  ",1987
135,777,2,Mr. DIOGUARDI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to provide well deserved recognition to one of  Florida's  premier  elementary  schools-Our  Lady Queen of Martyrs School of Ft. Lauder dale. As a small parochial school with 300  students of varying backgrounds, Our Lady  Queen of Martyrs is a prime example of the  not  often  enough  heralded  excellence  in  America's  elementary  school  system.  The  school  is  deeply  indebted  to  its  devoted  teachers who dedicate more than their time to  making  it one of Florida's  finest elementary  schools. Ninety percent of Our Lady Queen of  Martyrs' students go on to St. Thomas Aqui nas High School in Ft. Lauderdale, which re ceived the Excellence in Education Award by  the Secretary of Education.  It is important to  underscore  that St.  Thomas High School  would not be the school that it is today with out the quality students that graduated  from  Our Lady Queen of Martyrs School next door.  On Thursday, January 29, 1987, a dinner auction will be held at the Bonaventure Coun try Club at 7 p.m. On the following day, ace lebrity golf tournament will be held. The pro ceeds from these events will be used to raise  teachers'  salaries,  and  provide Our  Lady  Queen of Martyrs with air-conditioning and a  computer workroom so  that  these students  can continue to excel. While I believe that it is  important  to  recognize all  those  individuals  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  who are giving so unselfishly,  I would like to  single-out six donor-participants who will be  helping  to make this event a wonderful suc cess. They are singer Don Cornell, Buffalo  Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, New York Jets  great Joe Namath, singer and beauty pageant  host Burt Parks, singer Bobby Rydell, and Bob  Roscioli who has been organizing  the  fund raising efforts on behalf of Our Lady Queen of  Martyrs School.  Mr. Speaker,  allow me  to  conclude  by  saying hats off to Our Lady Queen of Martyrs  School  and  those  individuals dedicated  to  making  that  institution  the  finest elementary  school in Florida.  EDUCATION AND HOUSING  SAVINGS ACCOUNTS  HON. DAN COATS  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 28, 1987  Mr. COATS, Mr. Speaker, on the first day of  the  session,  I  introduced  legislation which  would create an education savings account H.R. 93-and a housing savings account H.R. 94-based on  the  individual  retirement  account [IRA]. Under these bills,  tax deducti ble contributions to a trust account will accu mulate interest tax  free  for a period of  time  and then must be used  to finance education  or the purchase of a first home.  The  education  savings  account  would  permit potential  college  students and  their  families to deposit up to $1,000 per year in a  trust account  to cover  the educational ex penses of higher education. Funds in the ac count would have  to be spent on education  before  the  student's 27th birthday, or  the  money would be returned to the contributors,  placed  in another education account, or do nated to an educational institution.  The housing savings account would allow a  prospective first-time home buyer, or parents  and  friends,  to contribute up  to $1,500 per  year of $3,000 per year in the case of a mar ried couple, over a 1 0-year period  toward a  tax-free account. Funds would be used as a  down payment on a  first home by  the 1Oth  year. One-tenth  of  the  amount would  be  added to the user's gross income for each of  the  following 1 0 years after purchase,  thus  providing tax repayment to the Treasury.  I urge my colleagues to assist prospective  college students and  first-time home buyers  by cosponsoring my  legislation. Help restore  the American dream of a college education  and homeownership.

150,816,2,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, last No vember,  in the midst of  the uproar  over the revelation that our Govern ment has been trading arms for Amer ican hostages with the terrorist nation  of Iran, President Reagan made a deci sion which in my estimation received  far too little attention. He allowed the  Department of Defense to exceed for  the first time a key numerical subceil ing of the SALT II Treaty. I think this  could well be the most important deci sion of Mr. Reagan's Presidency, but it  is also his worst mistake.  It came a full 6 years after President  Reagan  entered  the White House  vowing to scrap the ""fatally flawed""  SALT II Treaty which has been signed  in Vienna in June of 1979.  ",1987

152,829,2,Mr. REID.," I thank the Chair.  TAXPAYER'S BILL OF RIGHTS  Mr. President, I want to speak briefly again today on the need for enact ing a strong taxpayer's bill of rights.  Last year the Congress enacted the  most sweeping tax reform legislation  in a generation. I supported this legis lation because I think that it is impor tant to lower tax rates and make the  Tax Code fairer and more simple for  the average taxpayer. One of the pro visions of last year's Tax Code revision  that hasn't gotten the attention given  to the new lower rate structure and  the elimination of tax loopholes is the  provision which awards court costs to  taxpayers who prevail in proceedings  before the Tax Court.  Title XV of  the Tax Reform Act  calls for awarding of attorney's fees to  the prevailing party in tax cases. For  years, taxpayers have had to bear the  cost of any action before  the Tax  Court even when  they won. Maybe  this change will make the IRS think  twice before dragging a taxpayer into  Tax Court on a flimsy case-if so, this  is an important improvement in the  law. I am very pleased that this provi sion was made part of the Tax Reform  Act, because it was included in my tax payer's bill of rights, which had 50 co sponsors in the House of Representa tives last Congress.  The awarding of attorney fees  to  taxpayers who win their case was a  good first step. However, more needs  to be done to protect taxpayer's rights  in order to complete the job of tax  reform we started last year. There can  be no more appropriate  time  than  during the 200th anniversary of the  adoption of our Constitution to finish  the job of tax reform by enacting a  taxpayer's bill of rights to insure that  taxpayers are protected from abuses  of Government power by the Internal  Revenue Service, just as our constitu tional bill of rights protects citizens  from other types of abuses of Govern ment power.  We can soon start down the road to  complete the job of tax reform. Next  week I will  introduce my  taxpayer's  bill of rights which will:  Require the IRS to prepare a decla ration of taxpayer's rights and obliga tions;  Enable  a  taxpayer  to  take  legal  action against an IRS employee who  violates a taxpayer's rights;  Establish an Office of Ombudsman;  ",1987
153,842,2,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, my  recollection  is  that in 1920  the U.S.  Congress, when our budget was about  $4 billion and had about 800,000 Fed eral workers, got on the track of ap propriating every year and we created  the  appropriations  process.  The  budget is now a  trillion dollars. The  appropriated portion I  think exceeds  $500 billion, that which goes through  this process. Back yonder when we  started  there were  just a  few pro grams. There are  literally hundreds  start  now.  Somehow  or  other we  things and we never change.  What we are saying today  is  that  reform is necessary. And let us be real istic. We can talk about restructuring  committees. We can talk about having  less to do, doing more oversight, but  the plain truth is there is very little  chance any of those will pass.  Senator Bellmon, now the Governor  of Oklahoma, in leaving this institu tion made a  very  interesting state ment. I think he really was the states man of that time and we did not know  it. He said, ""In a 2-year congressional  period, why do we have a budget every  year? Why not take a year of the two  and do all the fiscal matters and leave  the other year for the other work.""  In essence, Mr. President and Mem bers of the Senate, the Roth-Domenici  proposal builds on  that. We  feel  it  really is an overly time consuming ac tivity to appropriate every year. Why  not appropriate for 2 years, and pro vide a mechanism for emergencies and  the supplementals, and why not pro vide a budget resolution that covers 2  years, with some process to update it  in  terms of economics. That means  Congress would have, out of each Con gress, 1 year to do fiscal things and 1  year to do other things, including au thorizations.  It is imperative that we strengthen  the  authorizing  process,  that we  strengthen the appropriating process,  so that it can get its work done, and  tied into all of that is doing our budget  work and being able to do all of it on  time and with thought. It is simplicity  that makes this approach have a real  chance of getting  through and suc ceeding-! year  to do your budget,  fiscal and appropriating work, 1 year  to do oversight and authorizations.  That is  its simplest form. There are  other things that have to be done, but  basically that is what we are asking  the appropriate committees of Con gress  to do  for us,  for our people.  Sooner or later we have to do it.  This bill will not cure everything.  Let me say to those listening, it will  not cure willpower  shortcomings,  it  will not cure our  inability  to make  tough decisions, it might not even cure  confrontations between Congress and  the President, and it may not cure our  current deficit, but it clearly gives us a  better chance of doing our job right  and it is reasonable and simple. Sena tor ROTH has sent the bill to the desk  along with the attachment which goes  through the bill section by section. I  am delighted to be a cosponsor. I hope  we get it done. I yield the floor.

158,842,2,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, on Tues day of this week, the United States for  the first  time established diplomatic  relations with the Communist regime  in Outer Mongolia. At the same time,  the Deputy Secretary of State, John  C. Whitehead, has begun a tour of sev eral Soviet bloc countries behind the  Iron  Curtain,  including  Poland,  Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria. These  two events are coupled together in a  strange irony.  I recently had a note informing me  of the establishment of relations with  Mongolia from Dr. Gaston Sigur, the  Assistant Secretary for East Asian and  Pacific Affairs. Now Dr. Sigur is one of  our most respected experts on Asia,  and I have a high regard for him. But  I wonder if he really thought about  the letter he signed. He stated:  As you may have known, the Mongolian  People's Republic was  admitted  to  the  United Nations in 1961 and has been a fully  functioning member of  the  international  community for several decades. Since last  December,  the Department of State has  been engaged  in negotiations with repre sentatives of the Mongolian People's Repub lic with a view to establishing diplomatic re lations between our  two countries which  will enable us  to expand educational and  cultural contacts, develop trade, and provide  better protection for American travelers in  Mongolia.  The irony is that you can only con sider Mongolia to be a fully function ing member of the international com munity if you think that a Communist  country can be considered a fully func tioning country. In my book, any Com munist regime ought to be considered,  by definition, a violation of the most  fundamental human rights. By lend ing the prestige of our diplomatic rela tionship  to  such  a  regime, we  are  taking a step backward in the protec tion and development of human rights  everywhere. What possible good can  be gained by establishing normal rela tions with a nation that is dominated  by external forces and that crushes  the political, religious, and cultural as pirations of its people? The diplomatic  triumph, but for the American people,  this is a day of shame.  What this means, Mr. President, is  that Mongolia will be regarded by the  United States as  a normal country  when  everything  about  the  regime  that controls it is abnormal. Is this to  be the fate of Afghanistan in a  few  years? Do we no longer seek to liberate  a nation once a Communist revolution  has been stabilized by crushing the  people? Is that what we mean by a  ",1987

Today, the charge  that ""he voted to raise his own pay""  still makes for good copy in election  campaigns.

The Constitution reads  that, ""The  Senators and Representatives shall re ceive a Compensation for their Serv ices, to be ascertained by Law       ."" I  am a big believer, of course, as we all  are, in the Cpnstitution, and I do not  know how etse our Nation's Founding  Fathers might have written this provi sion. However, this process has never  worked smoothly. In fact, the history  of the compensation issue is valuable  in understanding where we are today  in  the  lOOth Congress  in grappling  with this issue, this unpleasant issue.

184,868,2,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President, the  vote we are about to take will be one  of the most important deficit reduc tion votes  in  this Congress-not be cause of the dollar amount, but be cause of the principle that is involved.  This vote gets to the crux of the prob lem of this institution and the House  as well, and that is that we have not  really addressed  the deficit of  this  country. President Reagan's proposal  to raise  the salaries of Members of  Congress, Federal judges, and top ad ministration officials would cost ap proximately  $21 million  a  year.  I  cannot understand the President of fering this at this time when we have  the largest deficit we have ever had.  He is increasing it over $120 billion a  year, some say upward of $200 billion  a year, and we have not had a bal anced budget presented to us in the 10  years that I have been here, nor has  Congress responded in bringing about  a balanced budget.  In the context of a $1 trillion budget  and a $2  trillion deficit, $21 million  may not sound like so much money to  some Senators. To me it is a  lot of  money. The psychological significance  of these proposed raises to the Ameri can people should not be underestimated.  .  The median  family  income  for  a  family of four was $27,735  in 1985.  How do any of us tell these constitu ents we cannot manage on a salary of  $77,400 and that we deserve a 15.6 per cent raise, a  raise of $12,100 a year.  With this raise, pay for Senators and  Members  of Congress would  reach  $89,500.  I  am  like  anybody  else;  I  would love to have more money, but I  think we have to earn it. I do not be lieve we have earned it when you con sider the deficits that we have in this  country.  Perhaps if the budget was balanced  an argument could be made,  ""You  have done a good job, ladies and gen tlemen of  the Congress,  so  reward  yourselves."" But when the President  sends us a budget that includes deep  cuts  in funding  for education, child  nutrition, and energy conservation, I  cannot support any pay raise at this  time. When there are no funds to ad dress the problems of the homeless, I  cannot agree to higher cost of Govern ment in the form of more pay to Mem bers of Congress. When  the budget  proposes deep cuts in the farm pro grams, cuts that most certainly will  result in more foreclosures and more  broken dreams,  I cannot see  raising  the amount of money that many of us  will spend in restaurants in our Na tion's Capital. When the budget pro poses big increases in fees for the aver age American to visit our parks, such  as the Grand Canyon in my State, I  cannot and will not join in raising the  cost of Government and the salaries of  Members of this body.  Mr. President,  this vote will be a  very difficult vote for some of my col leagues, but at least we in the Senate  are willing to take a stand and to vote  on  this particular  issue. No matter  which side of this issue my colleagues  are on, we have all made a commit ment to publicly state our position. It  appears that the other body may avoid  doing the same thing we are in the  process of doing today. I hope that is  not the case and the Members there  will  demand  that  their  leadership  bring it to a vote.  I  think the American people know  what is right. I think we in Congress,  I  both Houses, know what is right and  what is wrong.  What is right is to vote against any  pay raise at this time.  I will vote with  the distinguished  Senator from South Carolina who has  offered  this  joint  resolution,  and  against the pay raise, not because Sen ators and Members of the House do  not work hard-we work hard; we put  in  lots  of  hours-but  because we  cannot afford it and we have not done  our job in bringing about a balanced  budget.

I  wish to compliment the Presiding Of ficer,  the Senator from Arizona, for  his statement on this issue. I think he  is  exactly correct. How can we be  asking other people in this country to  share in deficit reduction if we are not  willing to share in it ourselves?  I think it is a very serious question. I  think we have some very serious prob lems  in  this country, probably  the  largest of which is our Federal deficit.  The Federal deficit,  as everyone  in  this Chamber is well aware, is right at  $200 billion. This year it is projet.!ted  to be $175 billion. We need to bring it  down. We need to bring it down for a  lot of reasons. We are saddling future  generations with enormous debt and it  also fuels a negative trade balance.  It is a very, very serious problem,  probably,  in  this Senator's opinion,  the biggest problem; certainly the big gest  challenge  confronting  us. We  need  to get the deficit down and I  think everyone  is  in agreement on  that issue, from conservative to liber al.  It is very, very difficult, in this Sena tor's opinion, to ask other people to  share in deficit reduction-! am talk ing about farmers, I am talking about  people on Main Street, I am talking  about the cities, communities-to ask  other people, ""Are you willing to take  your fair share of the pain or the cuts  or the shared sacrifice necessary  to  reduce the Federal deficit?"", if, at the  same time, we are giving ourselves an  ",1987

191,881,2,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, first,  let me  commend  the  distinguished  chairman of  the Budget Committee,  the Senator from Florida, for making  the point that I think is obvious to ev erybody; that is, we all know there is  not  enough money  in  the disaster  relief fund  to pay for  the disasters  that are likely to occur this year. Even  if we did nothing, even if we did not  take the money out, the chances are  that we are going to be back before  the fiscal year is over voting to put  money into this account.  The problem is you can vote to take  money out of the disaster account, you  can make  the whole process deficit  neutral, and meet the point of order  requirement as the distinguished Sen ator from New Mexico said, but unless  you can get the Lord to sign onto the  bill  to reduce  the disasters, you are  just perpetrating a fraud on the Amer ican people and our commitment  to  balance the budget.  So I want to commend the distin guished Senator from Florida for pro posing the legitimate way to do this if  you want to do it, which is simply to  say that now we are going to come  along and waive the Budget Act, claim  that because this is such a high priori ty item it is more important than our  commitment  to balance  the budget.  That is what the waiver says.  I agree with the distinguished Sena tor from New Mexico to a point. But  that point ends pretty quickly. This is  not an irrelevant vote. This is the first  in a long line of votes we are going to  have  in  this Congress which  tests  whether or not we were shooting with  real  bullets when we  adopted  the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  law. What  we are voting on here is whether we  are going  to perpetrate a  fraud by  taking money out of an account set up  for disasters-which in all probability  is deficient already-knowing  it will  have  to  be  replenished,  or  simply  waive the act itself by saying that this  is of such high priority that it is more  important than balancing the budget.  The point I would like to make, Mr.  President, is there is another alterna tive. There is a better alternative if  you really believe that this $50 million  is so vitally important. The newest fig ures that we have show that we have  already provided $70 million of funds  for emergency food and shelter pro grams, and only $3 million have been  spent. Perhaps we ought to have a res olution demanding that the other $67  million be spent. We could do  that  within the requirements of Gramm Rudman. Why do we not do that?  Or you know we are actually spend ing a total of 1 trillion and 16 billion  dollars this year. Surely somewhere in  that $1.016 trillion there is $50 million  that is not as  important as helping  people out on the streets.  So I submit to my colleagues that  while I seldom differ from the distin guished Senator from New Mexico I  strongly differ with him on this sub ject. As he pointed out, even as we  speak, another $100 million bill for the  same purpose is on its way. Did we say  when we adopted Gramm-Rudman we  wanted to balance the budget except  for the homeless? Will it be next week  that we want to balance the budget  except for national defense? Do we  want to balance the budget except for  the Contras? Do we want to balance  the budget  except  for  the  farmer,  except  for  the veteran,  except  for  every  special  interest group  in  the  country that has some claim on the  Federal Treasury, and that appeals to  us in the name of compassion?  Quite frankly,  I  think the budget  ought to be compassionate, but I never  get confused about one thing. Compas sion is what I do with my money. It is  not what  I  do with  the  taxpayers'  money. That says nothing about how  compassionate I am. What I am will ing to vote somebody else's money for  .says nothing about my compassion.  What I do with my own money says  something about my compassion, not  what I would like to do with yours.  We may be talking about the com passion of the Government here. But  we are not talking about the compas sion  of  100 Members  of  the U.S.  Senate. Our compassion is measured  by what we do with our own money.  I submit, Mr. President, that while  the hour is late and we all want to go  home, what is $50 million, or 50 cents  a taxpayer? I will tell you what it is. In  this 100th Congress it is the first test  of whether or not we are going to live  up to a commitment we made which in  large part said we were going to set  out a budget, and we were going to try  to live by it. We have not quite made  it, but we set out a procedure, in which  we make the commitment that if we  had breached the budget and some body came along with a great idea to  spend money that we would have to  take the money away from other other  purpose.  We do have the procedure of a 60vote margin to waive a point of order.  But I submit  to my colleagues that  while this cause that we are debating  here may be important, does anybody  here really believe that in a $1.016 tril lion budget that we cannot find a real  $50 million to take away from some  lower priority item to spend for this? I  submit we can. In fact, we can take $50  million  right out of  the emergency  food-shelter program because we have  $67 million sitting there we already  appropriated for exactly this purpose  that has not been spent.  Does  anybody here  really believe  that the winter is not going to be over  ",1987

This  resolution  includes a provision  disapproving  the  proposed  deferral  <D87-33) in the amount of $28,559,000  relating to the Temporary Emergency  Food Assistance Program CTEF APl.  Funds for TEFAP are administered  by the Food and Nutrition Service of  the  Department  of  Agriculture  through  grants  to  State  agencies  which operate commodity distribution  programs. Allocation of the funds to  States is based on a  formula which  considers  the States' unemployment  rates and the number of persons with  incomes below the poverty level.  In fiscal year 1985, almost a billion  dollars' worth of surplus commodities  were distributed to assist needy indi viduals. Donations continued in fiscal  1986. Precise  levels  of  commodities  made available for distribution depend  upon the availability of surplus com modities and requirements regarding  displacement. Over  $56,800,000 was  used in fiscal year 1985 to help State  and local authorities with the storage  and distribution costs of providing sur plus commodities to needy individuals;  $50,000,000 was appropriated for fiscal  year 1986 and was allocated  to  the  States for their use.  For fiscal year 1987, $50,000,000, the  full authorized level, was again appro priated and included in the continuing  resolution. However, just yesterday a  message was sent to Congress propos ing deferral of all unobligated TEF AP  funds as of January 5, 1987. Mr. Presi dent, deferral of these funds will cause  widespread disruption in the Tempo rary Emergency Food Assistance Pro gram, and most States will be forced  to curtail or discontinue the distribu tion of the much needed surplus agri cultural commodities  to  the hungry  and homeless. By  taking action  to  overturn this deferral now, States will  be able to proceed with their programs  without disruption.  In view of the need to provide emer gency food, clothing and shelter assist ance, I urge my colleagues to support  this supplemental resolution and the  disapproval of this proposed deferral.  ",1987
193,894,2,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, we are  considering  a  very  important  and  timely amendment, S. 341,  reported  out  of  the Agriculture Committee  today. I commend Senator BoREN for  his efforts intended to make technical  changes to the Mattingly disaster pay ment  legislation enacted during  the  99th session.  This  legislation  is  of  interest  to  many farmers  in Kansas, as well as  Oklahoma and other States. It would  ensure that producers of the 1987 crop  of winter wheat would be eligible to  apply for disaster payments and would  extend the signup deadline from Janu ary 31 to February 28, 1987.  Last year, farmers across the Nation  experienced some of the worst natural  disasters in years. In some cases the  floods and droughts were the worst in  centuries.  In one area of southwest  Kansas,  farmers  received up  to  35  inches of rain within a 2-week period.  Many have still not been able to plant  their wheat crop, normally done in the  fall, and are desperately seeking a way  to participate in the 1987 wheat pro gram. Without some  type of assist ance, thousands of farmers in Kansas  alone, could be forced out of farming.  ",1987
194,894,2,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President,  I  rise to support House Joint Resolution  102,  a  resolution  authorizing  the  transfer of $50 million to the Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency's  [FEMAl Emergency Food and Shelter  Program.  The transfer is of money already ap propriated to FEMA for disaster relief.  According  to  the House Appropria tions Committee report, the transfer  will not disrupt the disaster relief pro gram, as sufficient unobligated bal ances are already on hand.  The transfer will, though, address a  serious problem  facing our  society.  The number of homeless  is growing  and the need for additional assistance  in the winter months is obvious. Con gress appropriated $70 million for the  Emergency Food and Shelter Program  for fiscal year 1987. This amount has  not been enough, which  is why we  seek this transfer for an additional $50  million. This past week's snow storm  has certainly reminded us of the con ditions that mother nature can bring  in the winter. But we have been fortu nate; we have a home to sleep in at  night. The individuals that this money  will help  sleep on  the  streets. We  cannot allow this to continue.  Mr. President, my State especially  has been hard hit by an increasing  number of homeless New Mexicans. A  declining State economy has contrib uted to this. According to State fig ures, collective employment in copper,  potash, coal, molybdenum, and urani um production in New Mexico dropped  60 percent between 1980 and 1985. Em ployment in oil and gas extraction has  declined nearly 40 percent since 1981,  and in 1986 fell over 25 percent. Unem ployment continues to rise;  it is ex pected to climb  to 10.6 percent this  year.  Continuing to grow is New Mexico's  poor which has increased 30 percent  since 1980. According to a report com missioned by the New Mexico State  Legislature and completed in Decem ber 1986, one in every seven New Mexi can families  lives below  the poverty  level. In fact, it documented that the  overwhelming majority of New Mexi cans are unserved by New Mexico's  welfare programs. For example only  one-fifth of the poor in New Mexico  are receiving AFDC benefits of those  that are eligible.  Perhaps even more critical  is  the  lack of low-income housing. In Albu querque, the public housing authority  reports that as many as 2,000 people  are on its waiting list for public-subsi dized housing, yet a 15-percent vacan cy rate exists for private housing in  the city. The major obstacle to becom ing a homeowner remains an inability  to afford adequate housing.  Mr. President, we do our part to help  address the homeless problem by re directing  these much needed  funds.  New Mexico  now  receives  $540,975  from the Emergency Food and Shelter  Program. The New Mexico State Leg islature's report on the homeless pro vides recommendations that I believe  deserve serious study.  I will vote  in  favor of this resolution because its a  positive step forward. I urge my col leagues to also join me.  Thank you, Mr. President.  ",1987

197,946,2,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Speaker, whether we rec ognize it or not, our economy is becoming an  increasingly global one. It's not enough to be  competitive at home, economic survival today  is measured by a  firm's ability  to compete  against domestic and  foreign manufacturers  and service providers.  Who benefits from this global competition?  We all do, though at times we have to wade  through some persuasive and pervasive myths  to get the whole picture. For instance, you'll  rarely  find an advocate of  restrictive  trade  policies argue  that  international  trade hurts  consumers. Adopt  that approach and you'll  find yourself arguing that American consumers  don't know how to spend  their own money.  More often than not, though, you'll hear that  America's manufacturing base is eroding and  that American  jobs are threatened by global  competition.  The  facts  just don't support  the charge.  Manufacturing as a percentage of GNP has  remained  relatively constant at 20 percent  over the last 25 years. And while manufactur ing employment has dropped  from approxi mately 25 percent of the workforce to 18 per cent,  it's pretty clear that the productivity of  manufacturing employees has increased and it  now takes less people to make more goods.  That's responding to international challenges,  not putting up barriers to inhibit global com petitiveness.  And what about the charge that American  jobs are being  lost. Today, we have more  people working  than ever before.  In  relative  terms-comparing America with other econo mies-the  results are even more  startling.  Since 1975, the American economy has cre ated 25 million net new  jobs.  In  the same  period, all of Europe combined created zero.  Unfortunately, there are some who are ar guing  that  protectionist  trade  policies  are  needed to protect jobs and American consum ers  from  foreign competition. But as Arshad  M. Khan points out  in  ""Import Restrictions  Just Intensify Trade War,"" it's American busi ness and consumers who'll pay the bill for the  folly of protectionism.  America has nothing  to gain  from beggar  thy neighbor trade policies and a lot to lose.  Trade restrictions deny consumers the oppor tunity and the freedom to buy the best goods  or service available at the  lowest price. Just  as importantly, they artificially relieve the com petitive pressures which force firms to adapt  and change and respond to the discipline of  the marketplace.  As a professional economist, I, too, am con cerned with  the subject of competitiveness.  Yet, before we embark on some willy nilly  Government policy designed  to address and  correct every economic malady we  faceJanuary 29, 1987  something which  the  Federal Government  can't and shouldn't do-we need  to define  competitiveness, or why America isn't as com petitive as it once was.  To my understanding, competitiveness  in  economic terms means declining productivity  growth,  rising  labor costs, a deplorably  low  savings  rate, stagnant or declining R&D ex penditures and, most visibly, a large trade im balance. To say  the  least,  these are symp toms of an economy in adjustment. A more  alarming  indictment, but perhaps more de served, these economic ills are characteristics  of an overregulated economy or a product of  incoherent and  irrational Government  fiscal  and monetary policies.  We all want increased productivity, a strong  industrial  base,  growing  employment,  in creased exports  (as opposed  to  limited  im ports) or, more simply, a higher standard of  living which presents Americans with more op portunity, and more choices. But the answer  does not  lie  in protectionist  trade policies.  These are counterproductive and can only ex acerbate our current problems.  But  before  embarking  on  trade  policies  which penalize consumers and actually hurt  the very firms they seek to protect, I'd would  commend  to my colleagues Arshad Kahn's  thoughts on shortsighted and counterproduc tive protectionist trade barriers.  We can't ignore the fact that to be competi tive today means responding  to international  economic challenges. But protectionist trade  policies are not  the answer. With sensible  Government policies-designed  to create a  fertile field for economic growth and not build  a fence around fortress America-1 have no  doubt that American firms are more than ca pable of meeting international challenges and  prospering in a global economy.  IMPORT RESTRICTIONS JUST INTENSIFY TRADE  WAR  <By Arshad M. Khan)  The U.S. trade deficit is likely to be $170  billion this year. And both the new speaker  of  the House, Jim Wright, and  the new  chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,  Lloyd Bentsen, have given high priority to a  trade bill. Just in case there is any doubt, a  trade bill means less, not more,  trade;  it  means import restrictions; and it means that  trading partners will retaliate with counter  restrictions.  Trade restrictions cost you and me, the  general consumer, and benefit just the few  they are designed to protect. It is variously  estimated,  for example,  that the ""volun tary"" quotas forced on the Japanese five  years ago cost the consumer about $400 per  car.  The argument for the quotas-that they  would provide time for our auto industry to  shape up-has not been sustained. Yes, the  industry has been profitable-domestic car  prices rose soon after the quotas were an nounced-but, according to industry analyst  J.D. Power Associates, the quality of most  of our cars has not improved. As for oper ations, one need go no further than indus try leader GM, which has announced 9,000  planned layoffs and 11 plant closings in four  states. As in autos, so in steel, so in textiles,  so in ...  Import restrictions are much like squeez ing a balloon-the bulge appears elsewhere.  We restrict Korean steel, and it starts to  come in as Korean toasters, irons and cars,  ",1987
198,959,2,Mr. TALLON.," Mr. Speaker, since my elec tion to Congress, one of the most heartbreak ing problems I have had is trying to help con stituents and  their families who are facing a  catastrophic  illness-illness requiring prohibi tively expensive or long-term treatment. I have  seen  the spirit of many  families broken not  only by the anguish of a disease, but also by  its overwhelming financial burden.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The  threat of catastrophic  illness  is very  real to all of us. Skyrocketing health care ex penses in addition to nursing home and home  care costs are draining the life savings of both  young and old. The President has recognized  the severity of the catastrophic health  insur ance gap and has issued a report on it.  What is clear is that no one is immune from  the devastating effects of catastrophic illness  because almost no one  is protected from  it.  Contrary to popular belief, Medicare does not  cover the extensive costs of catastrophic care  and  insurance  from  catastrophic  illness  is  simply beyond the financial means of individ uals and families.  Take  the case of a retired schoolteacher  whose 70-year-old husband became  ill with  cancer. They had Medicare coverage. They  had also bought supplemental coverage which  they assumed would pay any expenses not  covered by Medicare. His illness necessitated  three operations,  long-hospital stays, numer ous doctors' visit, and, finally, a nursing home  stay that  lasted until his death. The school teacher discovered that Medicare left substan tial costs uncovered. She also discovered that  their  supplementary  policy  covered  little  except  the Medicare deductible and copay ment charges  for  the hospital stays. They  were finally forced to sell their home and turn,  practically penniless, to the Medicaid Program  for assistance.  Or take the case of a divorced mother of  two who was self-supporting until she became  chronically ill at 33 years of age. She is now  39, exists on  intranvenous  feeding, and  is  hospitalized most of every  year. Her only  source of  income  is a disability check. For  reasons she does not understand she is not  eligible for her State's Medicaid Program, and  her health care bills far exceed her Medicare  coverage and private insurance benefits. The  pays what she can and is steadily increasing  her debt with hospitals and physicians. Her re curring nightmare is that she will die and leave  her children with her mountain of unpaid medi cal bills.  America has  the  finest medical system  in  the world. However, when  it comes to cata strophic care it is clear that we face a huge  health  insurance coverage gap. Catastrophic  costs will wipe a family out. Yet, today 30 mil lion Americans  lack health insurance and 1 0  million more lack adequate insurance to pro tect them from the risk of catastrophic illness.  More difficult, however, than the question of  whether the problem of catastrophic and long term health care should be addressed, is the  question of how. A number of options are cur rently  under  consideration  by  Congress.  These  recommendations differ according  to  the degree of Government  involvement and  cost.  One proposal,  titled  ""U.S. Health,"" would  provide comprehensive Federal public health  insurance for all Americans. This Federal pro gram would cover all patients and services, in cluding  basic  health,  long-term  and  cata strophic care.  A second option recommended by the Sec retary of Health and Human Services would  expand Medicare  to cover all health  care  costs for the elderly beyond $2,000 a year, in cluding catastrophic care. This proposal would  2377  require a $4.92 a month increase in Medicare  premiums.  A frequent argument against both of these  proposals is the substantial increase in public  spending they would require. A third alterna tive, however, would reduce excessive Feder al expenses by providing expanded Medicare  coverage while maintaining compulsory cost sharing for those who can afford it. The elder ly would still be protected  from catastrophic  costs although the upper limit for cost sharing  would vary with the income of the patient.  A  final  ""private sector"" plan calls  for  tax  and other incentives to induce health insurers  and businesses to cover nursing home care.  Savings would be put aside in tax-exempt indi vidual medical accounts, similar in principle to  an IRA.  These and other ways of coping with  the  catastrophic health care crisis will be a priority  for the 1 OOth session of Congress. Any ap proach must address the preservation of indi vidual choice and responsibility while also pro viding for the affordable financing of needed  health services.  Catastrophic health care  is not a problem  that will go away. Until we decide how cata strophic and  long-term care can best be  fi nanced-through public programs,  insurance  and other private means, or a combination an increasing number of young and older per sons in need of such care will expend all of  their  financial  resources and eventually be  forced to rely on Medicaid.  Private  sector  initiatives and  responsible  Government action can  lead  to a strength ened health care system and the ultimate res olution of this  important problem. Failure  to  act now will not make the problem disappear.  Indeed, delay may make it harder to solve as  the population ages.  MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.  NATIONAL HOLIDAY  HON.ROMANOL.~OU  OF KENTUCKY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 21, 1987  ",1987
199,959,2,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, I am particularly  proud, once again,  to  join all Americans  in  honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the oc casion of the second national holiday, com memorating his birthdate.  Dr. King's life and work  inspire and uplift.  His commitment to equality and justice is an  example  each  of us-whatever our back ground or state in life-should emulate.  As recent incidents in areas as far apart as  New York City and Forsyth County, GA have  shown, we as a nation still have not entirely  erased bigotry, hatred, and distrust. And eco nomic analyses show sharp differentials in the  earnings and employment outlook between  the races. Yet, as Dr. King once said:  ""We  must learn to live together as brothers or we  shall all perish together as fools.""  It behooves Americans to pull together, and  one mechanism toward that laudable goal  is  the national holiday we celebrate in Dr. King's  honor. We are afforded on  this holiday a  chance collectively to  look back  in  time  for  advice and counsel on how to look forward to",1987
200,972,2,Mr. MINETA.," I thank our very fine  chair of the California delegation, Mr.  EDWARDS, for having taken the leader ship to get the time for all of us to  speak.  I  also wish  to  join all  the other  Members who have been touched in  many ways by both Phillip and SALA  over the years.  So as with the others, I extend our  deep  sympathy  to  the  immediate  family, Joy and her husband, to the  in-laws, John Burton, Bob Burton, and  all the others.  Frankly, I think all of us are part of  that family because I think SALA and  Phil thought of it in that way.  There is no question that she in her  own right was a strong person, consid ered a helpmate and partner to Phil lip.  In my thinking, her seniority began  when Phillip was sworn in here in the  House, but she really blossomed here  in her own right and continued in her  service as a Member of the House as a  loving, caring, strong person.  In 1983, I went through a cancer op eration but I was fortunate enough to  have, through surgical skills, have the  cancer  removed. Unfortunately,  the  ravages of cancer have taken a very  fine colleague from us. But we can all .  look back to various ways in which we  worked with her, whether it was the  redress issue impacting on Americans  of  Japanese ancestry,  to  something  that we will be doing tomorrow which  is overriding  the veto of  the Clean  Water Act by the President.  There is a provision in that Clean  Water Act tomorrow in which there is  a call for a study of the toxics and pol lutants in the San Francisco Bay that  SALA BURTON  loved SO much. I knOW  she is working with all of us in trying  to make sure that we get the necessary  votes on the override of that veto. But  everything she has been involved  in  has, as everyone has indicated here,  been laced with  love. Her caring of  things, her caring for people,  things  that were inanimate or animate, she  considered the same and she treated  respectfully in that same manner.  So she leaves a  legacy not only in  terms of public service, but a legacy of  legislation to whom all of us are very  much indebted.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to our colleague,  the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr.  SIKORSKI].  ",1987
201,972,2,Mr. SIKORSKI.," I thank the gentle man from California.  SALA BuRTON was a very real gentle woman and a  true representative of  the United States. She was  fiercely  proud of her Polish origin, her Jewish  religion, her husband and partner, her  family, her city, her State, and her  country.  She cared deeply and worked hard  on her convictions. She hated intoler ance, but never displayed intolerance.  I think that is best exemplified in an  old prayer: Where there is hatred she  sowed  love, where  there was  injury,  pardon; where there was doubt, faith;  despair,  hope;  darkness,  light;  and  where there is sadness she sowed joy.  She sought not so much to be con soled as to console, not so much to be  understood as to understand, and most  importantly she sought not so much  to be loved as to love.  ",1987
202,972,2,Mr. SUNIA.," Mr. Speaker, I was exceedingly  sorry to learn today of the death yesterday of  our distinguished  colleague,  the  gentlelady  from the Fifth Congressional District of Califor nia, the honorable SALA GALANT BURTON. Al though Mrs. BURTON had been  ill  for some  time,  I was both saddened and shocked  to  hear of her passing.  My colleagues in this House remember well  the valiant champion the territories had in Mrs.  BuRTON's  late husband. Phil Burton strove  long and hard to secure a place in this distin guished body for a representative from my is lands. I have had the honor these last 6 years  to serve  in  that capacity. Each day  that  I  spend  in  this honorable body  I realize that I  owe my place here to Mr. Burton's able advo cacy of the rights of Americans in this country's  insular possessions.  After her husband's untimely death in 1983,  SALA continued  the Burton  tradition  in  this  House. I had the distinct pleasure of working  with her on many  issues affecting our con stituencies, each so concerned with Pacific af fairs.  I will never  forget Mrs. BURTON's  fine  help in  the 99th Congress in  leading the co sponsors for House Joint Resolution 23, legis lation that would have begun  the process of  securing votes  in  the electoral college  for  Americans living in American, Samoa, Guam,  the Northern Marianas, and the Virgin Islands.  it is nearly impossible for me to think of bring ing territorial bills to this floor without a Burton  being present. Outside of California, there can  be no area under the American flag  that will  mourn more deeply Mrs. BURTON's death than  the U.S.  territories, and American Samoa  in  particular.  Mrs. Sunia and my children join me  in ex pressing our sincerest condolences  to Mrs.  BURTON's family and especially to her daugh ter, Joy Ternes, and to Mrs. BURTON'S grand son and granddaughter.  ",1987
203,972,2,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I want to take a  couple of moments to comment on  the very  sad passing of my friend and colleague, SALA  BURTON.  In her all  too brief career in  the House of  Representatives, she established herself as  someone who could be  trusted and as a  power for the people she represented. SALA  saw the national problems and tried to shape  solutions that would help the people.  I well remember talking with her about the  Synthetic Fuels Program,  the national impor tance I saw to it, and how dramatically a prob lem could potentially affect the economic and  jobs picture in  the area I represent. She  lis tened. She evaluated. She disagreed with the  overall program, but  recognized  the  impor tance  it could have  in  the  lives of so many  people in Pennsylvania. And  in the end, she  voted with us. She voted for people. That was  the kind of commitment SALA brought to Con gress-to make  the  institution work  to help  people throughout America.  Some of that can probably be traced to her  own childhood  in Poland. She fled ahead of  the Nazis. She later remarked it started her in terest  in politics because  ""when  the Nazis  were moving, you learn that politics is every body's business.""  SALA BURTON  left her mark on Congress  and the Nation. And she will long be remem bered by  those of us who were her friends  and colleagues. We are all better for knowing  her, and the institution and America suffer for  her death.  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker, I heard the news  this morning  that SALA BURTON had passed  away, and, like a loss of any close relative or  friend, it is hard for me to accept the reality of  this loss.  The papers  talk about  the  ""public"" SALA:  The Congresswoman who worked  for  those  whose voices are often ignored-the poor and  minorities; who believed that our responsibility  as lawmakers was to help those less fortunate  in this Nation and who believed that it was our  responsibility to assure future generations that  they would live in a safe world.  But what about the woman who we knew as  a colleague and a  friend-the woman who  shared our frustrations and our victories? The  SALA  I knew believed that politics was not a  business or power trip. SALA believed that pol itics is everybody's business and that to earn  your place  in  these halls you have to go to  every constituent and ask for that right.  It  is hard  for me  to believe  that SALA  is  gone now, but when I'm on the floor or when  we're debating the issues that she fought so  hard  for-arms control, education,  the envi ronment-the loss will be all too real and all  too apparent.  I would also like to extend my condolences  to my  friend  and  former  colleague,  John  Burton. He should know that we all share in  this human  loss. The grief and void  that we  feel now, will be soothed by the memories of  how  full a  life SALA  lived,  the victories she  achieved, and  the  joy  that she brought  to  others, simply  through her words,  thoughts,  and actions.  ",1987
204,972,2,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, words cannot  express the ache in my heart and soul today.  On Sunday, February 1, our colleague and my  dear friend, SALA BURTON, was taken from us  at the young age of 61 by that hideous enemy  of life, cancer.  Less  than 4 years ago,  in April 1983, her  husband, my congressional mentor, and fierce  friend, Phil Burton, was struck down by an an eurysm. To those who knew and loved them,  SALA and Phil were  true partners  in every  aspect of  life-in marriage and  in politics.  They were dual inspirations and loyal friends,  ",1987
205,998,2,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, I  thank the distinguished Senator from  Louisiana for his very clear explication  of the matter before us. He is indeed  correct.  The Committee on Environment and  Public Works has kept precisely to the  provisions of  the budget  resolution  adopted in the 99th Congress. This is  the unfinished business of the 99th  Congress that we are about.  He is particularly apt in pointing out  that we have to get this legislation en acted by  the first of March at the  latest.  I do not know why we cannot have it  the end of  this week, perhaps we  cannot,  but  immediately  after  the  recess surely we can.  In absence of  that, we are going to disrupt the or derly business of the Nation in main taining and  in building  its highway  system.  I would like to record that I have  noted the statement of  the Senator  from Louisiana,  that  if  there  are  amendments  to  this  legislation  that  raise the authorizations involved they  are subject to the budget provisions  and should we come back from confer ence with a measure that exceeds our  limits it too will be subject to a point  of order and there will be a general  pileup all around.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The  absence of a quorum is suggested.  The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk pro ceeded to call the roll.  ",1987

207,998,2,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I have  cleared this request with the distin guished Republican leader and it has  been cleared on both sides of the aisle  through our cloakrooms, and Mr. DoLE  has no objection to my proceeding at  this  time  to put  the  request. As a  matter of fact, it was his feeling that  he would  like  to have  the  request  gotten before the rollcall begins. I feel  the same way about it.  I  ask unanimous consent  that on  Tuesday, February 17, at 2 p.m., Cal endar Order No. 14, S. Res. 94, a reso lution concerning arms control negoti ations with the Soviet Union, be made  the order of business at that  time,  that there be no amendments in order  thereto, that no motions to commit or  recommit with or without instructions  be in order, and that there be 40 min utes of debate to be equally divided be tween Mr. PELL and Mr. HELMs on the  amendment.  The  PRESIDENT  pro  tempore.  Without objection, it is so ordered.  ",1987

212,998,2,Mr. BURDICK., I move to lay that  motion on the table.  ,1987
213,1011,2,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of passage of the Federal-Aid  Highway Act of 1987. I want to con gratulate the distinguished chairman  of the Committee on Environment and  Public Works  for his  leadership  in  moving  this  legislation  quickly  through his committee. Also to be con gratulated is the distinguished ranking  minority member of  the committee,  the Senator from Vermont, both for  his efforts this year and for his work  on this bill in the last Congress. I also  want to thank the Senator from New  York and the Senator from Idaho for  their work in assuring quick consider ation of this much-needed legislation.  Mr. President, failure to act on high way authorization  legislation  in  the  last Congress threatens highway work  in all States. All States have been  forced to finance Federal-aid highway  projects with Federal apportionments  carried over  from  last year. These  funds are running out.  In Florida, approximatley $500 mil lion  in annual Federal-aid highway  funds cannot be apportioned until this  legislation  is approved. The Florida  State Department of Transportation  reports that some funding categories  will be exhausted in March. Almost all  carryover funds will be used up by  summer.  In is clear that we need to act quick ly, but also wisely, if disruption of our  highway program, at considerable ex pense to the taxpayers, is to be avoid ed.  It is also clear, in looking at the his tory of our commitment to highways,  that Federal  funds  alone  are  not  enough to finance needed capacity in  many States. More and more dollars  are being spent on maintenance, and  that work is clearly needed. But this  shift has come at the expense of new  construction.  Many of you know all too well the  result of dollars not spent on needed  new  capacity.  Urbanizing  areas  become congested. Traffic snarls, time  is wasted, and economic productivity  declines. States facing the problems of  rapid growth cannot build new arteries  fast enough.  Mr. President, the need exists now  for  added  capacity. The  problems  must be dealt with now. Delay will  only compound the problems, increase  the congestion, hurt the quality of life  and decrease economic growth and ef ficiency in many areas of the country.  We must face the reality that Feder al dollars alone will not meet  this  need. I am pleased that the committee  recognized  that States must be al lowed more  flexibility  in  financing  new capacity, and included a provision  for limited, noninterstate construction  utilizing Federal-aid and toll financ ing.  I am especially grateful to my new  colleague,  the distinguished Senator  from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, for his  outstanding leadership on this issue in  the  committee.  Senator  GRAHAM  joined with me and Senators NUNN,  'rHuR.MOND, HUMPHREY, and SPECTER in  introducing the Toll Facilities Devel opment and Improvement Act of 1987  earlier this year.  The  action of  the  committee  in  adopting  the  toll  provision  speaks  clearly on the need for this approach.  The provision is the same one adopted  by the Senate last September with the  support of numerous groups, including  the American Association of State,  Highway,  and Transportation Offi cials, the National Governors' Associa tion, the National Conference of State  Legislatures, the National Association  of Regional Councils,  the American  Consulting  Engineers  Council,  the  American  Transportation  Advisory  Council,  the  International Bridge,  ",1987

216,1024,2,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Nebraska.  ,1987
217,1024,2,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, the more  I listen to this debate the more confus ing  it becomes. When I hear stateyield  I  the  ments by my good  friend and col league from New Jersey  that would  lead the Senate to believe that those  of us who want to give the States the  option to go up to 65 miles per hour  are  inviting  wholesale  additional  deaths on the highways, I wonder if  my friend from New Jersey knows the  percentage of deaths on the highways  of the United States for the year 1985.  I wonder if he would state if he knows  what  those percentages are of  the  total percentage of deaths on the rural  Interstate System as opposed to the  broad category of highway deaths that  I believe the Senator from New Jersey  would concede were the thrust of his  remarks,  therefore not pertinent  to  the argument and  the discussion of  giving the States the option to raise  the speed limit.  Does the Senator from New Jersey  have  the  percentage  of  highway  deaths on the Interstate System na tionwide  as  compared  to  the  total  highway deaths?  ",1987
218,1024,2,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Does  the Senator yield for an answer?  ,1987
219,1024,2,Mr. EXON., I yield for an answer to  my question.  ,1987
220,1024,2,Mr. LAUTENBERG.,"  I would  say  that, no, I do not have the precise per centages, but I do have some informa tion in front of me that I think is rele vant. I see that the 10 States with the  highest fatality rates on rural inter states in 1984 were some of the impor tant States in our country with sub stantial mileage  classified  as  rural  interstate. Arizona, which had a very  poor rating of compliance, evidenced  by the fact that it received $510,000  worth of fines for noncompliance,  is  fourth in death rates on rural inter state highways. That suggests some  kind of a correlation that persuades  me that, though I do not have the pre cise numbers that the Senator asked  for, that as we increase speed, we do  several  things. We  inadvertently en courage more deaths per miles  trav eled and we encourage more injuries  per miles  traveled and,  furthermore,  we encourage consumption of energy  that we have seen costing our country  enormous sums of money  in  recent  months. We have seen $1 billion a  month added to the cost of imported  oil when we have an incredible trade  deficit.  To concede  to my colleagues from  the West, I am willing to engage in the  debate just as they are, but let us do it  in an environment that does not cloud  things or suggest that the highway bill  is all important but we are willing to  play with it, to delay it and take the  risk that it will not sail through as we  would like it to.  I would encourage us  to have the  debate independent of this issue.  Mr. President, I think we ought to  fess up here and decide whether or not  we want a highway bill to go through  ",1987
221,1076,2,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  take  this  occasion to rise in honor of Don R. Gosney, a  constituent and personal friend for whom the  Columbiana County Democrat Committee will  hold a recognition dinner on February 7, 1987.  Mr. Gosney will be completing 38 years of  political service. He began his commitment to  serving the people of Ohio at the young age  of 21 and has continued with dedication ever  since. At  the same  time, his background of  contributions to the Democratic party at local,  State, and national  levels  is  impressive, and  the party  is honored  to have such a  leader  among its ranks.  Mr. Gosney has served as a committeeman  for his precinct and the State, as county chair man, and as a delegate to the Democratic Na tional Convention. He has also served as  treasurer to the State Democratic Committee,  president of the Ohio County Chairman's As sociation, member of the Board of Elections,  and chairman of the 11th Highway Division. In  addition, he was an assistant to Congressman  Wayne Hays and, to add to this distinguished  career, Mr. Gosney had  the honor of being  the State  campaign manager  to President  Lyndon Johnson and the first Ohio campaign  manager for Senator JOHN GLENN.  But, Mr. Speaker,  I would also like to pay  tribute  to Don Gosney as not only a distin guished politician, but as a  friend and un swerving supporter. As he is honored on the  night of February 7  for his contributions of  leadership and commitment to Ohio and  the  Democratic Party, he will also be honored by  his colleagues and constituents as a  friend  and a fine member of his community.  TRIBUTE TO MARCOS MEDINA  HON. ESTEBAN EDWARD TORRES  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 2, 1987  ",1987
222,1076,2,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  bring to the attention of my colleagues an in dividual that has worked tirelessly on behalf of  bilingual education for the children of Califor nia, Mr. Marcos Medina of Los Angeles, CA.  He has served as chairman of  the Early  Education  Program  at  Albion  Elementary  School and the Lincoln High School Advisory  Council. He has also served as vice chairman  of Committee D, Title I Citizens Compensatory  Education Advisory Committee and of the Los  Angeles Unified School District's Bilingual Ad visory Committee. Since 1980 he has served  on the California Advisory Committee on Mexi can American Education appointed by  the  State superintendent of public instruction.  Marcos and his wife, Consuela, have six  children and  three grandchildren. The  family  resides in the Lincoln Heights area of Los An geles. As a parent and concerned citizen, Mr.  Medina has provided many hours of volunteer  time to help improve public education for chilEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dren in California. Mr. Medina is often found at  school board or community meetings to em phasize  the  importance of quality education  and the need for parental support and assist ance for our public schools.  Last year Mr. Medina was honored by reso lution of the California State Legislature and  by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervi sors  for his exemplary display of community  leadership and support for education.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask that my colleagues join  me in commending Marcos Medina on his out standing  contributions  to  advancing  public  education and extend him best wishes  for  continued success in future endeavors.  GROUNDHOG DAY  HON. WILLIAM F. CLINGER, JR.  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 2, 1987  ",1987
223,1076,2,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Speaker, today is one of  the most important and most celebrated days  of the entire year. Today is Groundhog's Day.  And it just so happens that the most famous  groundhog in the world, Punxsutawney Phil, is  a constituent of mine. He  lives a  relatively  quiet  life  for most of  the year  in his  little  borrow in Punxsutawney, PA, coming out once  a year on this date to tell us what the rest of  the winter will be like. He is the most accurate  weather-forecasting groundhog that ever lived  because he's never been wrong. And  this  morning,  just  like clockwork, he crawled out  from his burrow on Gobbler's Knob, and at  7:29 a.m., Punxsutawney Phil saw his consid erable shadow and proclaimed that there will  in  fact be 6 more weeks of winter.  I would  now  like  to  include  the official proclamation  that was made  this morning on  the chilly  slopes  of Gobbler's Knob  by  James  H.  Means,  the president of  the Punxsutawney  Groundhog, on this,  the 1 OOth anniversary of  Punxsutawney Phil's  famous weather  fore casts:  Here ye, here ye. On this the lOOth anni versary of Groundhog Day,  true believers  here on Gobbler's Knob and around  the  world have just seen history in the making.  As president of the Punxsutawney Ground hog Club, I, James H. Means, proclaim that  the only reliable weather forecaster, Punx sutawney Phil, has come out from his offi cial home to celebrate a century of accurate  predictions. He stood proud for a moment,  then he saw his shadow at precisely 7:29  a.m. Even though it is his anniversary, the  kind of all grounghogs has gone back into  his borrow. Like him, we will now have to  wait 6 more weeks for the arrival of spring.  That is the lOOth anniversary forecast from  the weather capital of the world, Punxsu tawney, PA.  BIRTHDAY CONGRATULATIONS  TO GERTRUDE M. WATSON  HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 2, 1987  ",1987
224,1076,2,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  pay tribute to Gertrude M. Watson of Reading,  February 2, 1987  MA, a truly outstanding  resident of my con gressional district on the occasion of her 90th  birthday on February 4, 1987.  Living  for 90 years certainly is remarkable,  but  it  is  the quality of Gertrude's life  that  I  commend. As  the years pass, we  inevitably  notice the process of our own aging. Probably  at age 50 we first see evidence of our own  physical limitations. A little later in life, maybe  at age 70, we  sometimes notice  that our  memories are no  longer perfect. We must  concede  that our younger colleagues and  family members are more capable than we of  meeting many of life's demands. Though age  may impose limits on our physical strength, it  never imposes  limits on  the development of  the human spirit. We always have the ability to  continue to grow in wisdom.  We live this life in order to learn certain les sons. Early in life we learn to test our physical  strength and our intellectual prowess. We are  here to learn to accept life on its own terms,  to be  tolerant of  the weaknesses of others  and ourselves, and  to continue  to place our  faith  in God  that this world  is  fundamentally  very good.  It takes love and patience to raise a family  and Gertrude has raised 5 sons, all veterans  of World War  II, and 2 daughters, who have  given her 25 grandchildren, and 35  great grandchildren. By the courageous, loving, and  generous way  in which she has  lived, Ger trude has set a wonderful example  for her  family and friends.  Congratulations, again, and I send my best  wishes on this happy day.  WESLEY HOMES, INC.  HON.GEORGE(BUDDY)DARDEN  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 2, 1987  ",1987
225,1076,2,Mr. DARDEN.," Mr. Speaker, this week in At lanta, the Nation's first geriatric teaching and  research hospital is being dedicated.  I would  like to call  the attention of my colleagues to  this latest project of Wesley Homes. Inc., the  largest agency providing care for the elderly in  the United Methodist Church.  The $20 million hospital to be dedicated this  week will operate  in collaboration with  the  Robert W. Woodruff Health Sciences Center  at Emory University.  Its medical staff will be  comprised of community physicians and facul ty from the Emory University School of Medi cine.  The  two-story, 1 00,000-square-foot  facility  will provide comprehensive evaluation, diagno sis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, as  well as psychiatric care  for  the elderly and  acute medical care for the aging.  In addition  to studies of Alzheimer's research will  focus  on depression, sleep disorders, Parkinson's  disease and other problems of  the central  nervous system.  It is a tribute ot the enterprise of those in volved in the Wesley Homes ministries that no  Federal funds are involved in the construction  of this facility.  I know  that my colleague, Mr. PEPPER of  Florida, this body's renowned spokesman for  the needs of the elderly, will be among those  ",1987
226,1089,2,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, although  I  voted  for  the clean water bill,  I  would like to urge my colleagues today  to  join me  in sustaining  the Presi dent's veto of it.  My position is not as contradictory  as it may first seem. My vote for the  bill was my way of saying, ""Yes, I am  for clean water too-who isn't?"" I rec ognize and strongly support the need  for national commitment in this area.  It was my way, I guess, of telling the  administration that they were a day  late and a dollar short on helping to  craft a compromise. But the President  made his decision  to veto, and  that  changes the complexion of the situa tion, at least for this Member.  We can ask again: How much should  we spend, and how should we spend it?  The clean water bill, like everything  else that comes before us these days,  must be  judged not only in terms of  what  it seeks  to do, but  in what  it  costs taxpayers to do it.  There is an environmental consensus  in this country. It embraces conserv atives and liberals, Democrats and Re publicans. It seeks to preserve and ra tionally use our environmental herit age.  But there is also an equally strong  budget consensus to see to it that the  policy goals that we seek are reached  by wise and prudent use of tax dollars.  That is the issue before us today not whether we will spend tax dollars  for clean water, but, rather, what  is  the prudent balance to be struck be tween  tax-dollar  expenditure  and  policy goals.  The President says that we can do  better. I suspect we can. If we can do  better, then we ought to.  By way of a brief review, the Clean  Water Act Construction Grant Pro gram, which this legislation funds, is a  classic example of how a well-inten tioned, short-term program ballooned  into  open-ended,  long-term  commit ments costing billions of dollars more  than anticipated or needed. Since 1972  the Federal Government has helped  fund the construction of local sewage  treatment facilities, and I might add  that I recall that debate very vividly  where there were marked differences  on both sides as to what our obligation  was  at  the Federal  level  and  the  amounts and all  the  rest.  It was a  matter that historically and properly  was  the  responsibility of State and  local governments up  to  that  time.  The Federal Government's first spend ing in this area was intended to be a  short-term effort to assist in financing  the backlog of facilities needed at the  time to meet the original Clean Water  Act requirements.  When the program started, the cost  of the commitment to the Federal tax payers was estimated at $18 billion. To  day we have put $47 billion appropri ated  funds  into  the program. Now  H.R. 1 proposes  to put still another  $18 billion of  taxpayers' money  into  the program.  0 1305  Despite all this, only 67 percent of  all municipalities have actually com pleted  the  construction  needed  to  comply with the Clean Water Act pol lution limits. On the other hand, non municipal  treatment  systems, which  have  received  no  Federal  funding,  have completed 94 percent of the con struction needed for compliance with  Federal pollution standards.  The President, in his veto message,  predicted that he would be overridden  today, but he also said ""It is time we  did the right thing-all of us-regard less of the political fallout.""  He went on to remind us that when  he delivered his State of  the Union  Message right here in this Chamber,  the Congress all rose up in unanimous  applause when he declared from  the  Speaker's  podium  that  the  ""U.S.  budget deficit was unacceptable and  outrageous."" And  everyone  rose on  their feet and applauded and applaud ed.  91-059 0-89-35 (Pt. 2)  ",1987

280,1141,2,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I do  not believe anyone can be against the  regulation  of  billboards  along  our  Interstate System. This amendment  would  require  the  removal of bill boards, and I support that goal. But I  cannot support what amounts to con fiscation or condemnation without fair  compensation.  If a building is taken down because a  new roadway is built, just compensa tion is mandated. The same thing, it  seems to me, should apply in the case  of billboards.  Mr. President, a compromise on this  issue is needed, and I believe we can  reach a fair compromise on this diffi cult issue if we work with the billboard  language that has been added in the  House. Therefore,  I will be voting  against this amendment today, and I  will support the efforts of the confer ees to reach the goal of highway beau tification  in  a  fair  and  equitable  manner.  ",1987
281,1141,2,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I would  like  to point out that the Highway  Beautification Act is not an environ mental issue, but it is one  involving  property rights.  Clean air and clean water are not in volved, nor are our national parks, na tional  forests,  or  scenic  highways.  What is involved is the ability of a le gitimate  industry  to do business  in  commercial  and  industrial  areas,  where  service  stations,  fast-food  chains, retail stores, and the like are  allowed to thrive.  Just as important as the right to do  business is the right to possess private  property, without fear that the State  or  its subdivisions can confiscate  it  without payment of cash compensa tion.  Police  power  removal  of  signs  through amortization has not reared  its ugly head in Alabama until the last  few years, when it appeared in a Tus caloosa ordinance. Birmingham now  has such an ordinance under consider ation. I do not want to see this perfect ly  legitimate  industry decimated by  amortization.  Mr.  President,  this  amendment  would jeopardize that right to private  property and  I hope my colleagues  would reject this amendment.  ",1987
282,1141,2,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. President, I intend  to vote against  this amendment not  because I object to its goals but rather  because I object to the way in which it  seeks to realize them.

Does the Senator agree with that?  ",1987
286,1167,2,Mr. BUMPERS., The Senator is cor rect.  ,1987
287,1167,2,Mr. SYMMS., I agree and I support  the amendment.  ,1987
288,1167,2,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to support the inclusion of im portant language in the 1987 Highway  Authorization bill which  is critically  important to the State of Arkansas.  Senator BUMPERS has introduced-and  I have cosponsored-5 pieces of legisla tion to accomplish our goals. In addi tion, we have written the chairman of  the Environment and Public Works  Committee-Senator  BURDICK-and  the ranking minority member-Sena tor STAFFORD-urging them to include  this  language  in  the  committee  amendment to  the bill. As  I under stand it, the committee has agreed to  our request, with the exception of the  amendment to section 144 for bridge  replacement.  The Senate and/or the House have  approved these provisions previously,  but last year due to other controver sial issues, the Highway bill conferees  were unable to produce a compromise  bill which could be sent to the Presi dent for his signature. We are very  hopeful the conferees will be able to  quickly resolve their differences this  year, due to the pressing need for re lease of Highway Trust Funds dollars  to the States, so they can be prepared  for the coming construction season.  Mr. President, the need for reloca tion of Highway 71  in northwest Ar kansas  is  apparent  to anyone who  travels  this winding and dangerous  thoroughfare in the Ozark Mountains.  Although State efforts are underway  to improve what is now a frightening  situation, Federal support is essential.  The precious lives of the State's youth  depend on this project, since 71 is the  highway which  leads  to  the main  campus of the University of Arkansas  at Fayetteville.  The Waldron Road project  is an other  important  transportation need  ",1987
289,1180,2,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I am pleased that the Senate today is  acting  on  the  critically  important  highway  legislation. We must make  every effort to enact this bill into law  as soon as possible. Therefore, I do not  intend to speak at length on the sub ject.  The need for quick action is obvious.  According to the American Association  of State Highway and Transportation  Officials, many States will  face  the  loss of their entire 1987 construction  seasons  if a bill  is not passed and  signed  into  law  by  the  President  before spring.  My own State of Ohio has a limited  construction season. There is simply  no way  the State can compress  a  year's construction program  into  6  months. The bid and contract process  alone usually takes 2 to 3 months.  Each additional day of delay results  in more job loss and more dangerous  roads. At  this  very moment  141  projects, costing $323 million, and di rectly affecting some 7,655 jobs, are on  indefinite hold-in Ohio alone.  I am concerned about the fact that  there are major differences between  this bill and the highway bill passed  by the other body on January 21.  I  hope the Senate will see fit to pass  this bill  today. Furthermore, I hope  the conferees will see fit to set aside  their differences and  to produce a  final measure as expeditiously as pos sible.  ",1987
290,1180,2,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I join  my distinguished colleagues who have  gone before me in supporting prompt  enactment of S. 387, the Federal-Aid  Highway Act of 1987. My colleagues  on the committee have already testi fied to the dire need for this legisla tion in eloquent  terms. Therefore, I  will speak only to what this legislation  means to the Commonwealth of Vir ginia.  Because of congressional failure to  enact a bill last year, the Virginia De partment of Transportation has al ready been forced to delay advertising  some $70 million in needed highway  projects across the State. These delays  only  add  significant  costs  to  the  projects the State is ready  to begin  construction  on.  In  addition,  the  delays mean that the entire construc tion program must be pushed back.  Last September, the Virginia Gener al Assembly completed an historic spe cial session which was devoted entirely  to the transportation needs of Virgin ia's citizens. The  general  assembly  worked from a package of recommen dations submitted by a specially ap pointed commission on transportation  in the 21st century. Acting upon those  recommendations, the general assem bly enacted some of the most sweeping  changes  in Virginia's  transportation  history.  Foremost among these changes was  the passage of a $422 million revenue  package. Therefore, the delays caused  by Congress  in getting  the Federal  highway moneys to Virginia have an  exacerbated  effect,  because  of  the  State's newly approved and highly am bitious program. Projects across  the  transportation realm will suffer. All  systems-interstate, primary,  second ary, and urban-that receive matching  Federal funds will be affected.  Mr. President, I would like to con gratulate the members of the Environ ment and Public Works Committee,  upon which  I now serve as a new  member this year-for their speed in  bringing this legislation to the Senate  floor. I must say that it is a testament  to the importance of this legislation  that the committee markup took but a  couple of hours. I would like to thank  especially  the  new  chairman,  the  senior Senator from North Dakota,  Senator BURDICK, as well as the com mittee's last chairman, our colleague  Senator STAFFORD. I would also like to  thank the new chairman of the Public  Works  and Transportation Subcom mittee, the Senator from New York,  Senator MOYNIHAN, and the Senator  from Idaho, Senator SYMMS. I find the  leadership of Senator SYMMS on this  issue to be worthy of special note.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to act expeditiously on passage of this  bill so that the conferees can begin the  difficult task which no doubt awaits  them.  PRIORITY PROJECTS  ",1987
291,1180,2,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I wish  to speak in support of projects of great  importance to my State of Pennsylva nia. These projects will benefit from  the  improved  flexibility  given  the  States in financing them through any  Federal-aid funding category.  EBENSBURG BYPASS  Construction  of  the  Ebensburg  bypass in Cambria County will require  $28 million between 1987 and 1991.  Currently,  traffic on Route 219  is  abruptly forced off the multilane, lim ited-access  highway  and onto  local  streets, where it is consequently im mersed  in local  traffic where Route  422 crosses it at Ebensburg. Construetion, for which the Pennsylvania De partment of Transportation has al ready begun engineering, would divert  traffic to a relocated 5.1-mile segment.  ROUTE 220  Construction of Route 220  in Blair  County will require $90 million over  the life of the Federal-Aid Highway  Act of 1986. The project will demon strate the cutting edge of techniques  to guide drivers,  such as pavement  markings and vegetation, which great ly enhance highway safety. An antici pated 10,000  ears daily will benefit  from improvements on this new seg ment, which will close the only gap11.9 miles-in the multilane  limited access road connecting the Pennsylva nia Turnpike and the Tyrone bypass.  BASIN STREET RAIL CROSSING  Traffic tieups where Basin Street in  Allentown intersects a Conrail grade  crossing  have  plagued  the Lehigh  Valley for more than a decade. This  crossing has restricted the traffic flow  in East Allentown significantly and  has hampered economic development  in  the  area  for many  years. The  project would require $6 million over 3  years, and is no less deserving of con sideration today than when I original ly requested its inclusion 2 years ago.  SOUTHERN EXPRESSWAY  A project deserving of priority desig nation  is  the Southern Expressway,  which will serv1e  the most important  economic development project in west ern Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh Air port Midfield Terminal. The Southern  Expressway, which will  require $5.5  million in 1987 for preliminary engi neering and desi.gn, is an essential ele ment of the airport improvements, as  it will enable traffic to bypass airport  and local roads that hamper access to  the Pittsburgh Airport.  NEW SEWICKLEY TO CONWAY  A project very worthy of mention is  construction of a two-lane highway be tween the township of New Sewickley  and  the borough of Conway. This  project will demonstrate methods of  accommodating increasing truck traf fie and improving highway safety, and  will require $13.4 million in 1990.  JOHNSTOWN ACCESS ROAD  A sum of $720,000 authorized to be  spent in 1987 will enable the State to  upgrade a 1.3-mile access road to the  Johnstown Flood National Memorial  in  the vicinity of Croyle Township,  PA.  KITTANING TO BROOKVILLE  We have reQ.uested that $2 million  be spent over the life of this bill tore construct approximately 30 miles of a  two-lane road on the Federal aid pri mary system between Kittaning and  Brookville,  PA.  The  cost-effective  method proposed will improve a rural  highway so that it will be better able  to  accommodate wider  and  longer  trucks.  ",1987
292,1206,2,Mr.  DECONCINI.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing a bill titled the  Clayton Act Amendments of 1987. In  principle, it is very similar to the Rail road Antimonopoly Act that I spon sored in the last Congress.  This bill is short, simple, and direct.  It consists of only two sentences. The  first sentence permits private damage  suits against railroads under section 4  of the Clayton Act. This part of the  bill repeals the Keogh doctrine, which  for many years has prohibited such  suits. The second sentence amends sec tion 16 of the Clayton Act to permit  private  suits  for  injunctive  relief  against railroads.  I want to make clear at the outset  that this bill is not designed to punish  railroads, or  to single them out for  special treatment. Its sole purpose is  to make  sure  that  the  same  rules  which apply to other industries apply  to railroads as well. By putting rail roads on the same footing as other in dustries,  this  legislation will ensure  that freight rates are set through fair  competition, and not by unilateral de mands.  Right now,  the  railroad  industry  enjoys a unique position. As a result of  the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, the per vasive regulation that marked the de velopment of  rail  transportation  in  this country is no longer present. Yet  the railroads still benefit from the spe cial antitrust exemptions  that were  part and parcel of the old regulatory  framework.  This situation has resulted in abu sive and monopolistic practices on the  part of the railroads that were well  documented  during  the  extensive  hearings we held in the last Congress.  Shippers who are  largely dependent  on a  single  rail carrier are at  the  mercy of that carrier. Railroads are  free  to demand unreasonable  rates,  and to threaten to cut off service to  those shippers who  refuse  to acqui esce. Captive shippers have no choice  but  to accede  to  the  railroad's de mands or face  financial  ruin. Many  shippers,  particularly where perish able commodities are involved, can ill  afford to have their rail service cut off  for even a single day.  This state of affairs must not be al lowed to continue. In a largely deregu lated setting, there are no fair argu ments against requiring adherence to  the antitrust laws. But after years of  operating under tight regulation, rail roads and shippers do not know the  ground rules for operating in a deregu lated environment. The time has come  to make clear that the railroads are  subject to the antitrust laws, and will  be made to answer for any unlawful  abuses of their market power.  When similar versions of  this bill  were introduced in the past, the rail roads claimed that we were trying to  reregulate them. Undoubtedly, we will  hear these charges again, but in reali ty, this legislation does no such thing.  What this bill will do is permit captive  shippers to go to court and hold the  same  railroads  accountable  to  the  standards as other industries.  The broad support that this legisla tion is receiving indicates the magni tude of the problem that it addresses.

REINSTITUTION OF THE MILITARY DRAFT  e ",1987
293,1206,2,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to introduce legislation rein stituting  the military  draft.  I  am  pleased that my colleague from Idaho,  Senator SYMMS, joins me in this effort.  We need the draft for many reasons most importantly, we need it in order  to  remain  true  to  the  ideals which  built this country.  I  believe  the need  for a military  draft has been and continues to be the  most  compelling,  but unrecognized,  priority facing us. The ability and will ingness of our Nation  to meet  its  future security needs and those of our  allies hang in the balance. Unfortu nately, like in other urgencies, such as  with the massive deficits, the Congress  reaches a gridlock when action on the  draft is warranted and has failed in its  responsibility  to  solve  the problem  before time runs out.  The All-Volunteer Force is a product  of the Vietnam mindset. Early in the  1970's, with America's morale sapped  by our involvement in Vietnam, every one wanted the easy way for America  to defend itself without personal sacri",1987

308,1232,2,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, on tomor row the Senate will convene at 10 a.m.  After the two leaders have been recog nized under  the standing order, six  Senators will be recognized each for  not to exceed 5 minutes after which  there will be morning business not to  extend beyond  the hour of 11  a.m.  with  Senators  being  permitted  to  speak therein for not to exceed 2 min utes each.  At the hour of 11 a.m., the Senate  will proceed  to  the consideration of  the waiver resolution for mass transit.  Under  the order previously entered,  there will be a time limitation on that  waiver of not to exceed 30 minutes. A  rollcall vote has been ordered thereon.  Ergo, there will be a rollcall vote on  the waiver resolution at 11:30 a.m. to morrow.  Upon the disposition of the waiver  resolution, then the Senate will pro ceed with debate on mass transit and  with amendments possibly thereto.  Rollcall  votes may  be  expected  throughout the day.  I hope it will be possible to complete  action on the highway bill tomorrow.  We could be in to a  reasonably late  hour  tomorrow night.  I would not  expect it to be late late.  I would also hope that the Senate  could complete action  tomorrow on  the bill, S. 83, the energy conservation  standards for appliances bill.  I should state that there will be a  vote on the override of the President's  veto of the clean water bill. That vote  will occur at 3 p.m.  tomorrow after noon with 1 hour  for debate prior  thereto beginning at 2 p.m.  I urge that all Senators be present.  Following the vote tomorrow on the  override of the veto of the bill,  the  Senate will  resume consideration of  the highway bill and  if  the Senate  does not complete action on the high way bill and on the energy appliance  standard bill, the Senate will be in on  Thursday  to  continue  debate  and  action thereon.

312,1232,2,Mr. BYRD.," It would be my expecta tion that if the Senate were to com plete action on all these matters to morrow, and I forgot to mention the  possibi.lity  that the House may take  some action on the homeless resolu tion that would require further action  on the part of the Senate, I do not  know what the House will do, but we  will  know  that  tomorrow. But  in  answer to the able Senator's question,  if all action is completed on the high way bill and  the energy appliances  standards  bill  on  tomorrow,  the  Senate would  be  in Thursday but  without any rollcall votes, and only for  the transaction of morning business,  and making of speeches, the offering  of resolutions and bills, and so on. I  would hope that the committees would  meet on Thursday, and on Friday as  well.  In answer to the able Senator's ques tion if we finish work on these other  items on tomorrow-and we will not  stay in until a late, late hour, which I  do not want to do tomorrow night for  the sake of all Senators-there will be  no  rollcall votes on Thursday, even  though the Senate would be in session  on Thursday.

Farmers  in my district are  suffering  from  low-cash  prices. The elderly are surviving on generally  fixed incomes. It's the wrong time.  The President has asked us to increase our  own salaries. I cannot accept the President's  premise that we have the ethical right to raise  our salaries at a time when so many  in  the  low and middle classes of this country have  been asked to make sacrifices.  It is time to change the way Congress con siders pay raises. No pay raise should  take  effect until  after  the  next election.  I will  oppose this pay raise.  THE  NEED  TO  CREATE  AN  OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENER AL IN THE POSTAL SERVICE  HON. MICKEY LELAND  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 3, 1987  ",1987
317,1245,2,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  today my col league, the Honorable FRANK HORTON, and I  are introducing legislation to create an Office  of Inspector General in the U.S. Postal Serv ice.  The Postal inspector general would function  in the same manner as the inspectors general  in the executive agencies, operating as an in dependent unit conducting audits and investi gations relating to fraud, mismanagement and  abuse, and promoting economy and efficiency  in the Postal Service. The independent Postal  inspector general would be appointed by the  President, confirmed by the Senate and would  report directly to the Congress, as do other in spectors general.  Currently, responsibility for investigating  in ternal  fraud and abuse rests with  the Postal  Inspection Service which  is also responsible  for enforcing criminal laws involving the Postal  Service. The Chief Postal Inspector is appoint ed by, and reports to, the Postmaster General.  In hearings held by  the Postal Operations  Subcommittee  in  the  last Congress, several  key witnesses,  including a current  inspector  general, the head of GAO's Fraud Prevention  and Audit Oversight Group, and  the Deputy  Director of OMB, all stated that of crucial im portance  to  the effectiveness of the  inspec tors general was their independence from the  head of the agency to which  they were as signed.  The need for an  independent fraud detec tion and prevention unit at the Postal Service  has never been more evident than  in recent  months with  the uncovering of scandals  in volving Postal management. As a  result of  criminal action  involving  the STARS  [source  time and attendance  recording system] proEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  curement, two postal managers are now serv ing prison terms. Last May, a member of the  Postal Service Board of Governors resigned  and is also now incarcerated for using his po sition on the Board to influence the awarding  of a multimillion dollar Postal Service contract.  Finally, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics  was sharply critical of actions taken by the im mediate past chairman of  the Postal Board  after it was revealed that he had a ""financial  interest"" in a law firm hired by the Board.  During Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee hearings on mail fraud legislation in the  97th Congress, it was determined that in order  to better protect the public, the Postal Serv ice's investigatory process must be acceler ated and its enforcement tools made more ef fective. The legislation that we introduce today  would give the Postal Service's law enforce ment efforts  the needed  independence and  authority to carry out internal ""watch dog"" ac tivities. Additionally, the Inspection Service will  still be  responsible  for  the  investigation and  prosecution of  fraudulent and abusive mail  schemes, and providing for the safety and se curity of the mail, postal personnel and postal  property. With  the additional powers of  the  inspector general, the Postal Service must also  become more accountable to the public. Ac cordingly,  the Postal Service's inspector gen eral will be required to make annual reports to  Congress, as do other inspectors general.  I urge my colleagues to support us  in  legislative effort.  this  MAKING THE TAX CODE FAIRER  TO THE AMERICAN WORKER  AND AMERICAN BUSINESS  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 3, 198 7  ",1987
318,1245,2,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, since  I first  came to Congress I have been speaking out  in support of legislation to help the American  worker and American business. We all  talk  about how we want to be fair to the average  American. But there's too much talk and not  enough action.  I think  it's time  to act, and  that's why I'm here today.  The investment tax credit and the acceler ated cost recovery system are two examples  of measures which have helped American in dustries recover from the recession. Last year  as part of the Tax Reform Act,  these provi sions were eliminated.  Granted,  there were problems with  the in vestment tax credit and the accelerated cost  recovery system. For example, one problem I  had was that special tax incentives were ex tended  to  foreign made products.  I am op posed  to this as being counterproductive  to  our U.S. economy.  Therefore, I am introducing today legislation  to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  to reinstate the investment tax credit and fur ther, to deny an investment tax credit and ac celerated cost recovery for propertY made out side  the United States having  less  than 65  percent domestic content and for which there  is a substitute having 65 percent or domestic  content.  I know there are some in this body who will  say  that  this  is  just another protectionist  2663  measure and that protectionist measures are  not  the am;wer  to our economic problems.  This is wrong for two reasons. First, I have put  into this bill a provision that for cases where  the  item does not have a domestically pro duced substitute the purchaser could still re ceive the investment tax credit or accelerated  depreciation. Second, this bill would not deny  the regular depreciation deductions for busi nesses which buy foreign made goods. It only  sets forth the principle that if you want to take  advantage of  the  investment  tax credit and  the accelerated cost  recovery,  it must be  American made.  The inve!~tment tax credit and accelerated  depreciation are important tools to help Ameri can businesses. It deserves to be reinstated.  To ensure  that  it helps American workers  also, it is netcessary to include the refinements  as detailed  in  this  legislation.  I urge my col leagues to review and cosponsor this meas ure that assures fairer treatment of American  businesses and American workers.  DISAPPFl~OVE OF  THE  PRESI DENT'S  DEFERRAL  OF  THE  TEMPORARY  EMERGENCY  FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM  HON. ED JONES  OF TENNESSEE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 3, 1987  ",1987
319,1245,2,Mr.  JONES of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  I have introduced legislation to disap prove the President's deferral of $28,559,000  from the TE!mporary Emergency Food Assist ance Program. This program provides  funds  for the distribution of surplus commodities to  the poor and was funded at a modest level of  $50 million f'or this year.  The Temporary Emergency Food Assist ance Program has been a successful one for  6 years. In Tennessee alone, it provides more  than 700,000  individuals with  supplemental  food. Over one-half of the 125,000 homes uti lizing the program depend on the program as  a major food supply. The $50 million funding  level appears very modest in comparison  to  those served by this important program. A de ferral of ovor $28 million will effectively elimi nate  the distribution of surplus commodities.  The State and local agencies will be forced to  halt their distribution services almost immedi ately,  thus.  leaving  surplus  commodities  unused and families hungry. There is no need  for  the disruption of  this most helpful and  modest program. We should not  let surplus  food go to waste while people go hungry in  our Nation.  On January 29, 1987, the Senate passed an  amendment  disapproving  of  this  deferral  action by the administration. I hope the House  will follow the lead of the Senate and disap prove of the President's action. We should be  helping the hungry people in our country and  this program of surplus commodity distribution  is an effective means of accomplishing  this  goal.  I urge thet support of my colleagues in this  effort to disapprove of the deferral of funds  for  the Temporary Emergency Food Assist ance Program.  ",1987
320,1258,2,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker, many  of us in this body have heard from un happy constituents about provisions of  the Tax Reform Act of 1986. It has  been hard to tell taxpayers that when  we voted, none of us, outside a select  few in the inner circle, had even seen  the bill, let alone been given the time  to analyze it.  I voted against the bill for reasons  which I have stated many times. That  is in the past. The Reform Act now is  law and our job is to make it work. By  the lastest count, there are at least 50  bills filed in this House to correct in equities in the law. That alone should  tell us something.  Without reference to the law itself,  the reform activity has provided the  IRS with the opportunity to demand a  new W-4 form. That form is so oner ous that it is longer than the simpler  tax forms used to be. Even the Secretary  of  the Treasury, Mr. Baker,  admits that the form is a disaster and  must be revised. Of course a revision  will now compound the problem for  employers and employees.  Before anyone pats himself on the  back for the so-called tax reform, we  must clean up the law. Problems rang ing from tax year to deductibility of  student loan interest won't go away  until we make them go away. I urge  Members  to make  reforming  the  reform a  first priority of  the 100th  Congress.  RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE  <Mr. FORD of Tennessee asked and  was given permission  to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1987
321,1258,2,Mr. FORD of Tennessee.," Mr. Speak er, it is time for us to act as a body to  raise the minimum wage for the nUl lions of working poor in this Nation.  The number of family breadwinners  working year round and earning $7,000  per year-the minimum wage-is  in creasing at an alarming rate.  A minimum wage worker, with two  children,  has  a  standard  of  living  which is 24 percent below the poverty  line.  The low minimum wage undermines  the work ethic. In many areas of the  country an adult with  two children  can actually receive more income from  basic welfare benefits  than  from  a  minimum wage  job. This makes wel fare dependency a sound economic de cision for many families who must put  food on the table: Wages such as these  provide no incentive to work.  An increased minimum wage would  provide many unemployed, especially  welfare  recipients,  the necessary  in centive to become self-sufficient. A job  with sufficient income to provide an  improved standard of living for those  trapped  in poverty will  reduce  the  public assistance costs to our Nation.  Self -sufficiency based on earning an  adequate minimum wage which will  support basic needs is a fundamental  right we all should desire.  I urge my colleagues to support leg islation  to  increase  the minimum  wage.  CLEAN WATER VOTE  <Mr. UPTON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1987
322,1258,2,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker,  it was  with a heavy heart that I cast yester day's vote to override the President's  veto of H.R. 1, the clean water bill. As  a  fiscal  conservative  and  former  Reagan administration official, I can  understand many of  the President's  objections to some of the expenditures  in this legislation. However, I believe it  is  important for us all  to remember  that this is only an authorization, not  an appropriations bill. Therefore, the  actual dollar figures provided for  in  this legislation are by no means final.  When the appropriations bill is consid ered on the House floor, then we can  debate spending limits.  As  things now stand, the cost-shar ing provisions of this bill, as well as its  overall goal of providing for an effec tive system of clean wa~ter manage ment, merit enactment of H.R. 1. I am  confident  that my constituents who  live on the shore of Lake Michigan, a  body of water that I hope will remain  forever clean, and those who live on  lakes  and  rivers  throughout  my  Fourth District, will support my deci sion on this legislation.  RELEASE OF FUNDS FOR EL  SALVADOR  <Mr. McCOLLUM  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, on  June 19, 1985,  four young American  men and nine Salvadoran women and  children were brutally sladn by a  ter rorist bomb set off in a crowed cafe in  San Salvador. Since that time, terror ists acts committed by guerrillas in El  Salvador have claimed many civilian  lives. In 1985, though San Salvador is  a city of over 1 million people,  the  police had very  few cars, no radios,  and no antiterrorist training.  This body has twice approved funds  for antiterrorist training :for the civil ian police forces of El Salvador. The  funding for this program also provides  for  such necessary  items  as  police  radios, and the purchase of police cars.  It has come to my attention that the  chairman of the Appropriations' For eign Operations Subcommittee,  the  gentleman  from  Wiseonsin  [Mr.  OBEY], has unilaterally defied the will  of this body and placed a hold at the  State Department and blocked the use  of these funds in this fiscal year. This  is not the first time th:at the gentle man has acted on his own in defiance  of this body: Last year h.e delayed this  program by nearly 5 months; 5 months  of no training, no purchase of radios.  All the while terrorists were killing in nocent civilians in El Salvador. Most  surprising  is  that one of the young  boys killed in June 198S, while peace fully sitting in a cafe, w:as Robert Pat rick Kwiatkowski,  a  native  of Mr.  OBEY's hometown of Vlfausau. What  do we say to the family of Mr. Kwiat kowski: That we have  the means to  train and equip San Salvador's police  to prevent more senseless deaths at  the hands of terrorists, but one man,  Mr. OBEY, for some unknown reason,  does not want this to happen? How  many more young Amer:icans or Salva dorans will die because they didn't re",1987

324,1271,2,Mr. GRAY of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  first of all, I want to thank my distin guished  friend,  the gentleman  from  Mississippi  [Mr. WHITTEN]  chairman  of the Appropriations Committee for  yielding me this time.  I have good news for the previous  speakers on the pay raise. At the last  count I had, the gentleman from Flori da  [Mr. MACK]  and  the gentleman  from New Hampshire  [Mr.  SMITH]  have taken the well 12 times, repudiat ing the pay raise that went into effect  at midnight last night.  I hope the gentlemen are listening  because  I have some good news for  them.  Mr. Speaker, yesterday  I  received  this letter from the Sergeant at Arms,  Jack Russ, and I would like to read it  verbatim.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN GRAY: This is in reply  to your letter of January 28, 1987, concern ing congressional pay.  You used in your letter the term ""turn  back."" This  term  is quite accurate. Any  MemberAnd I repeat, Mr. SpeakerAny Member so inclined could ""turn back""  or return any portion of his or her salary.  What this really amounts to is a tax de ductible gift to the Government.  The Clerk of the HouseAnd it is Donnald Anderson, in case  you do not know his namehas established an account for the purpose  of receiving such gifts.  If I can be of further assistance to you,  please contact me.  JACK Russ.  So I hope there is not one Member  on either side of the political aisle who  goes home and squeals like a pig and  says, ""They forced me to take that pay  raise. What could I do but take it?""  That is the argument we have heard  over and over again.  I say to my friends that you are only  50 feet from a vote if you want one.  Walk out that door, go downstairs and  tell the Sergeant at Arms and Clerk of  the House to turn it back to the Treas ury. That is all you have to do. Let's  see  how many  of  our Republican  friends who are making all this noise,  turn the raise back. Thank you.  ",1987
325,1271,2,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  just  want to say that first of all, for the  RECORD, the administration has stated  no official or unofficial position on the  Senate-passed version of the joint res olution.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote  for House Joint Resolution 102.  ",1987
326,1271,2,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  2 minutes to the gentleman from Dela ware [Mr. CARPER].  ",1987
327,1271,2,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. Speaker, I appre ciate very much the opportunity af forded us yesterday by the gentleman  from Michigan [Mr. FoRD]  to say our  piece on the proposed pay increases.  I have cosponsored House Joint Res olution 123, offered by the gentleman  from New Hampshire  [Mr. SMITH],  which does not provide for the pay in crease to us as Members of Congress.  We talked yesterday about the issue  of whether or not this kind of increase  was constitutional. I do not want to  talk about that today.  We talked about whether or not in creases should go  into effect at mid term. I frankly do not wish to address  that, either.  Let me just say that I think that we  have to pay Members of Congress a  reasonable  level of compensation  in  order to attract good people. Our fail ure  to do  that  really  invites  three  things: One of  those  is a House of  Lords,  club of millionnaires,  if you  wish; another is people who are going  to serve here but really only serve part  time and be out making speeches and  writing books and doing other things  in order to supplement their pay hon estly; or maybe, worse yet, the third  alternative would be that we would go  out and do something dishonest or un scrupulous to supplement our income.  I do not think we want any of those  things, and I  think it is appropriate  that we  raise our pay from  time  to  time.  Having  said  that,  the question  is  what is a reasonable level of compen sation? I would simply contend that  the level at which we are now paid,  $77,000,  is a reasonable level of com pensation.  A couple of questions came  to my  mind during yesterday's hearing. One  of those questions was how long has it  been  since  you  or  I  have  seen  a  Member of the Congress, the House or  the Senate, step down during midterm  because we were insufficiently paid? I  might also add, how long has it been  since we have had an open seat, a  vacant seat, either midterm or at the  end of a term, that went unfilled be cause  Democrats  and  Republicans  were unwilling to run for the position  because we  thought the pay was  too  low?  I cannot recall that; nor can I think  any of you recall instances where that  actually did occur.  Let me just say that what I think we  should do is vote to raise our pay commensurate with the increases we pro vide  to all Federal employees. Last  year, we froze their pay. Similarly, we  froze our pay.  This year, we provided a 3 percent  pay  increase  for Federal employees;  this year, we provided the same for  ourselves. I think that is a good model  for us  to  follow and would suggest  that we do that.  We have a long way to go to reach  our deficit reduction target for next  year.  0 1540  Mr. Speaker, we are clearly going to  be above our target for this year. I do  not  see  a  ground  swell of support  coming up on either side of the aisle  here to raise taxes. As a result, we are  going to have  to focus on spending,  and to the extent we are willing to  tighten our belts just a little bit, it is a  lot easier for me and, I suspect, for all  of us to go to the rest of the people in  this country and ask them to tighten  their belts so  that we might bring  down these budget deficits.

373,1362,2,Mr. DIXON.," I wonder if I could ask  my friend from South Carolina, his de votion to this cause and issue being ob viously known to all of us and I appre ciate  his  conscientious  interest  in  bringing this issue before the Senate  as often as possible,  if  the Senator  might consider the possibility of with drawing this amendment to this criti cal legislation.  This  legislation, of course,  is  the  highway bill and the mass transit fea tures that will go with it. I am sure  that the Senator understands that ev eryone of the 50 States of the country  are anxiously awaiting this funding so  they can begin to build highways and  improve their roads and bridges effec tive March 1.  I wonder whether the Senator might  consider, there being so many oppor tunities to bring this very contentious  question before us,  the possibility of  not imposing upon the work of this  body  in  connection with  this  bill  which we are trying to pass very expe ditiously.  ",1987
374,1362,2,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President,  this is a very important bill. But any  bill that is going to take effect and get  results will be in the same situation.  In other words, we  have  already  passed this amendment and sent it to  the House. The House has not seen fit  to act. We just want to put it on this  bill, too. If it is attached to some im portant piece of  legislation  like  this  before it gets to the House, whether  the House will strip it off or do some thing else is a matter for them, but I  feel like it ought to be put up to the  House again.  ",1987
375,1362,2,Mr. DIXON.,"  I  thank the Senator  from South Carolina and fully under stand his motive. But I would remind  him that there is a new vehicle around  here every day. This is a very critical  bill. I cannot think of anything that is  more important for the creation of job  opportunities in the State of the dis tinguished Senator from South Caroli na and my State and every State in  the country. They have not built any  roads for a long time now because we  did not act expeditiously last year.  I cannot speak for the House, but  the Senator  knows  very well  that  many of us  joined him here  in  the  Senate.  I would hope that we would not have  to entertain this matter now.  Could the Senator possibly give us  an opportunity  to discuss  this with  him? Perhaps  the  leadership would  want to get involved in the discussion.  This bill is so critical. The Senator, of  course, is highly respected by all of us.  ",1987
376,1362,2,Mr. THURMOND.," If the majority  leader has another piece of legislation  that we can act on promptly and send  over, it would be all right.  ",1987
377,1362,2,Mr. DIXON., Would the Senator ac commodate the majority and minority  leaders in a discussion on this? I know  the majority leader and the minority  leader are profoundly interested in the  expeditious passage of this bill. The  Senator knows everyone in the coun try is.  ,1987
378,1375,2,Mr. DIXON.," I say to my colleague,  that would work all right, because we  could not possibly dispose of it by 2  o'clock anyway. If the Senator from  Nevada and the Senator from Tennes see are around, and  I know one  is  around, we could possibly dispose of  that by the 2 o'clock cutoff time.  Mr. D'AMATO.  I  hope we  could  work on that and one other outstand ing amendment.  I  understand  our  colleague  from  Idaho [Mr. SYMMS] would like to take  the floor for 5 minutes.  Mr. SYMMS addressed the Chair.  ",1987
379,1375,2,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Chair  recognizes  the Senator  from  Idaho.  ,1987
380,1375,2,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, the bill  reported by the Banking Committee  authorizes a Federal aid mass transit  program of more than $3 billion annu ally. Of that $3 billion plus, $2 billion  is distributed from the general fund,  while approximately $1.02 billion  is  distributed from the mass transit ac count of the highway trust fund.  As others have already stated, these  authorization levels would freeze fund ing for the mass  transit program at  current levels. However, they are well  above the $1.37 billion authorization  which was requested by the adminis tration.  Mr. President, for the last 6 years,  the  administration  has  sought  to  reduce the Federal Aid Mass Transit  Program  and, more  recently,  has  sought to eliminate general fund con tributions to the program. In addition,  the  administration  consistently  has  proposed  a  formula  distribution  of  mass  transit account  funds.  I  have  supported and will continue to sur port  these proposals, because in my judg ment,  they  incorporate sound  fiscal  and public policy. I believe it is unlike ly, however, that Congress will elimi nate the general fund financing or sig nificantly reduce the funding for the  Mass Transit Program this year.  I am disappointed that the transit  title reported by the Banking Commit tee does not include a formula for the  distribution of  the mass  transit ac count funds  that would guarantee a  minimum return based on fees paid by  highway users in each State. In years  past, I have proposed such an amend ment called  the ""fair share amend ment"" to guarantee just such a mini mum return of mass  transit account  funds.  Mr. President, I think in all fairness,  Senators realize that we are trying to  accommodate  the Senate but, more  importantly,  to  accommodate  the  American people  in  the country by  moving this highway bill forward. So,  I  have  decided  not  to  offer  that  amendment this year because of the  pressing need to move this legislation  into conference with the House. I ap preciate  the willingness of Senator  PRESSLER and others, who are trying to  bring this point before the Senate-!  agree with what  the Senator  from  South Dakota said. I also thank him  for his willingness to try to work this  out.  I  hope  our  colleagues  from  the  urban areas recognize that during the  past 6 years, coming forth with this  bill, we worked and cooperated with  the  donor States on  the  highway  funds to establish some sort of floor or  minimum so there is a little more fair ness in the Federal Aid Highway Pro gram so that some States do not end  up paying in all the money and getting  back very little return.  Some of our smaller or rural States  do very well on the highway funding  formula. We appreciate that. We think  it  is necessary  in  terms of national  strategic defenses. We think it is fair  in terms of the national amounts of  donorship patterns and big majorities  in some of the Western States with  small populations, where we are tran sit States  and  people  have  to  go  through those States to get from coast  to coast. So I think it is a fair formula.  But I think there has to be recogni tion that at some point in  time, we  have to do something to get more fair ness in this 1-cent-per-gallon payment.  Historically,  I  remind my colleagues,  when the 1-cent-per-gallon was going  into the mass transit fund and Presi dent Reagan was agreeing to do it, he  was agreeing also that there would be  a formula that would see that the min imum amount of funds went to each of  the States-that some of those funds  might be more  flexible, where  they  could  transfer  it possibly  to urban  streets and roads, but so that people in  the country would have a  program  that  they could continue  to sustain  and support.  At this point, I only note that Jim  Miller of the OMB sent a letter to the  chairman of the committee stating his  opposition to the transit title reported  by  the Banking Committee. One of  the six issues specifically addressed in  Mr. Miller's letter is the continuation  of the discretionary grant program by  which mass transit account funds are  distributed. He notes:  Yet, under the Committee's bill, over 80  percent of the penny fuel tax receipts would  continue  to fund discretionary grants for  projects in only 20 cities. Not only is this ap proach inequitable, but it discourages cost effective use of Federal funds.  He concludes the letter by warning  that:  If highway /transit reauthorization legisla tion were enacted without addressing our  concerns,  the President's senior  advisors  would recommend that the President veto  the bill.  Sincerely yours,  I urge my colleagues who will be  serving as conferees on this title of the  bill to take that warning to heart. It is  time for Congress to work on correct ing those inequities in the current pro gram for distribution of the mass tran sit account funds. This multiyear reau thorization legislation should provide  for  the distribution of  those  funds  based on a formula which guarantees  each State a minimum return on the  fees paid into the transit fund by the  highway users-! repeat, that portion  of this bill is what I am talking about,  Mr. President, not the general fund  part.  If the  transit formula adopted by  the conferees does not contain this eq uitable formula and is vetoed by the  President for that reason, I will en courage members of the Banking Com mittee  to report a new  transit  title  that addresses this important concern.  I have been trying to cooperate with  my colleagues, but I think they should  be notified that there are many of us  in this Chamber who might be willing,  even at the risk of slowing down high way  legislation for a week or so,  to  uphold a veto if the President chooses  to do so on that issue until we can re solve it.

387,1414,2,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, yester day I  included in the REcORD a table  prepared by the North Carolina De partment of Transportation showing  which States will gain and which will  lose under the House version of the  highway bill when compared  to  the  Senate version. I now find that clarifi cation is needed inasmuch as the table  I  inserted into the RECORD yesterday  compared  the  apportionments  con tained in H.R. 3129 and S. 2405, legis lation  that died  in  conference  last  Congress.  I ask unanimous consent that an up dated table be included in the RECORD  at the conclusion of my remarks. This  table is based on H.R. 2, the bill passed  by the House, and S. 185, the original  Senate bill that was rolled into S. 387  in committee. The  final column on  this table shows which States would  be losers under the House version of  the bill, compared to the Senate bill,  taking into consideration the demon stration projects in the House bill over  a 5-year period.  Mr. President, while  some of  the  numbers  in  this  table  differ  from  those in the table inserted yesterday,  the bottom line remains unchanged:  37 States would lose funds under the  House version of the bill.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues,  especially those who will be conferees,  to note how their States will fare  if  the House bill should prevail in con ference  between  the  House  and  Senate.  I ask unanimous consent that the  table to which I referred be printed in  the RECORD.

388,1414,2,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President,  I  rise today in support of an issue that  is of critical importance to my State  and all States. Like many Federal pro grams, the urgency of the Federal Aid  Highway Act has increased significant ly in light of the failure of Congress to  pass new authorizing  legislation last  year. This  failure  to  complete our  work in a  timely and orderly fashion  has left many highway programs with out adequate funding and, with  the  coming of optimal construction season,  it  is  a  situation  that must  receive  prompt and proper attention.  New Mexico  is  larger  than most  States.  is  also  among  the  least  populated States in the Nation, com prised of small cities and many more  smaller  towns  and  villages. Conse quently, New Mexicans,  like many  other westerners, must travel medium  to long distances quite often in order  to acquire many of their most funda mental material necessities. While we  have accepted this way of life and rely  heavily on  secondary highways, we  should not be forced to drive on poorly  maintained roads. Snow and ice during  the winter, as well as flash flooding  and intense heat in the summertime  It  make constant attention to road condi tions  imperative.  I know that many  other States have these transportation  concerns.  As with other  large States, New  Mexico has vast  interstate highway  mileage crossing  the State. And, al though interstates do not serve a ma jority of New Mexican  towns,  inter state mileage in the State is extensive.  As a vital part of the national system,  it is of great interest to this country to  keep New Mexican  interstate high ways in good condition. Unfortunately,  due  to  funding  delay  and neglect,  these roads are presently in quite bad  repair.  This legislation will provide a badly  needed $85,321,000 for the upkeep of  New Mexico's interstate highways and  an additional $9,489,000 for the main tenance of secondary roadways. While  urban centers are not the norm in New  Mexico, Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and  Las Cruces will  receive $3,827,000  in  funding  for  necessary  projects. All  told,  this  legislation  will  allow  $105,974,000  to be spent on highway  projects in New Mexico.  These funds are part of a $52.4 bil lion authorization for national high way programs. In order to ensure that  New Mexico and other sparcely popu lated States get  their fair share of  these resources, I urge that we keep  the current 4R funding formula for  the distribution of these funds to the  States. Modifications to this formula  would  significantly delay  the  inter state  substitute  funds,  jeopardizing  completion of the Interstate System in  this country.  I  believe  it would be  tragic if we allow this to happen.  I would  also  like  to  express my  strong support for an increase in the  speed limit on rural interstate high ways from 55 to 65 miles per hour. I  believe that gas mileage is not affected  as much by rates of travel as it is by  fluctuations in those speeds. Also, as  rural interstates do not carry the traf fic  load  that urban areas do, safety  risks are, I believe, not a real factor.  Since most of these highways are ex tremely flat, straight, and uncongest ed, a 65-mile-per-hour speed limit  is  just as safe and more prudent than  the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit that  should be initiated near urban areas.  In closing, I would like to reiterate  the urgency we are faced with in pass ing this bill. It is time to get highway  construction projects off the drawing  boards and put them in motion.  ",1987

393,1492,2,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, yes terday the United States conducted its  first nuclear warhead  test  of  1987.  This test was significant not only be cause it was our first of the year, but  also  because,  unfortunately,  it will  probably mean the end of the unilat eral testing moratorium that the Sovi ets have been observing for over 18  months now.  The Soviets have challenged us by  observing  this moratorium. But  the  Reagan administration has failed  to  seize this challenge as an opportunity  to take a bold step toward ending the  nuclear arms race.  The Foreign Relations Committee,  of which I am a member, has recently  been examining  two nuclear  testing  treaties,  the  Threshold  Test Ban  Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear Ex plosions Treaty. I, for one, am disap pointed that these two dated nuclear  testing  treaties address only a very  small aspect of  the nuclear  testing  issue. The benefits  that  these  two  treaties offer for nuclear limitations  are very modest, and they threaten to  obfuscate a more important issue-the  United States should press now for ne gotiation of  a Comprehensive Test  Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union. Re gretably,  the Reagan administration  has radically departed from the posi tion of all previous Democratic and  Republican administrations since the  1950's-which have supported a CTB.  And  the Reagan administration has  broken its promise of last fall to sup port prompt ratification of the TTBT I  PNE Treaties this year.  It is therefore incumbent upon Con gress to address the issue with binding  legislation. We can no longer tolerate  administration  foot-dragging.  Each  day our citizens wake up knowing that  our  society  and millions  of  our  peopleand  the Soviet  society  and  millions of their people-could be de stroyed before the Sun sets, if nuclear  war erupted. It is our obligation as  public officials  to work each day to  reduce the enormous risks inherent in  an unrestrained arms race.  I am therefore introducing today a  bill to cut off funding for a period of  12 months for all United States nucle ar warhead tests for weapons with a  yield in excess of 1 kiloton-provided  the Soviets refrain from testing during  that time. A similar measure was in troduced  by  Representative  PAT  ScHROEDER  in the House last month.  Our bill calls upon the President to de clare a complete halt to all nuclear  warhead testing as soon as in-country  reciprocal monitoring  arrangements  are  implemented.  It also urges  the  President  to enter  into negotiations  with the Soviet Union for the conclu sion, at the earliest possible date, of a  Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  A mutual, simultaneous, and verifi cable moratorium on the testing of nu clear warheads would be a crucial first  step toward mutual nuclear arms re ductions. With such a moratorium, we  can slow the unrelenting development  of new weapons and give our arms ne gotiators in Geneva a fighting chance  to  reduce  those weapons  already  hoarded in the superpowers' arsenals.  There can be no more  important  issue facing the Congress than that of  ",1987
394,1518,2,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President.  I  ask  that today's Washington Post editorial  entitled  ""Battle  of  the Banks""  be  printed in the RECORD.  The editorial follows.  BATTLE OF THE BANKS  The battle of the banks is gathering force.  At one level  it's merely a  test of political  power between the banks and the securities  industry over who can do what kinds of  business. But beyond  this struggle  looms  the increasingly urgent need for fundamen tal  reorganization of  the whole  financial  sector-banking,  securities,  insurance,  the  works.  Three of  the big New York banks ap peared before  the Federal Reserve Board  yesterday to press their applications for the  power  to  engage  in  several  activities at  present forbidden  to  them. They want  to  underwrite and trade in municipal revenue  bonds,  commercial  paper  and mortgage backed securities-all of which,  they con vincingly argue, would be  less  risky  than  conventional bank lending. But the current  rules leave those activities to the securities  industry, which naturally enough is vigor ously protecting the status quo.  The hearing itself was a sharp and clear  example of the way not to proceed with this  basic  financial  reorganization-piecemeal,  quarreling over one subcategory of securi ties  at a  time, with much  attention  to  narrow legalities and little thought to the  broad architecture on  the evolving result.  The Federal Reserve Board has already said  that the expanded powers at issue here are  appropriate for banks. As its chairman, Paul  Volcker, said the question isn't what's right  but what's legal under the controlling law,  written in 1933 in the depths of the Depres sion. Answers that make sense will require  revision of the law, he observed-and that  requires action by Congress. The Senate  Banking Committee under  its new chair man, William Proxmire, has been holding  interesting hearings, and it looks as though  substantial legislation may at least be intro duced this year.  The sense of urgency is rising. The rapid  development of  the securities markets  is  making it possible for many big businesses  to go directly  there for  financing  rather  than depending on the bank loans that were  traditionally central to most banks' profits.  That's why the banks are  trying  to fight  their way into the securities business. The  1933 law was supposed to keep them sepa rate, but people on both sides have been  chipping away at  the wall and  reaching  through  the chinks. The radical deregula tion of the London financial markets last  year has raised the bankers' level of anxiety  here. American banks, through their British  subsidaries,  can  now  carry on  securities  transactions prohibited to them here-and  they fear that their business will increasing ly drift abroad if the American law is not  changed.  Congress usually prefers to move one step  at a time in a subject as complex as this one,  and that's often the wiser choice. But the  restructuring of financial services is an ex ception. Here  the  circumstances  require  change that is profound rapid and sweeping.  ",1987
395,1518,2,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President,  in  the  99th Congress alone the Senate Bank ing Committee held over 18 days of  hearings with a  record of over 4,500  pages on the need for comprehensive  reform of the laws governing the fi nancial  services  industry. Without  question, we need  to modernize  the  legal framework. If one of the central  purposes for regulation of the finan cial industry is the maintenance of a  safe and sound system, we must regulate reality, not the ghosts of yester year. As all members of the financial  community know, I am concerned that  our current outdated legal framework  may cause more instability than it pre vents simply because  it  is outdated.  Additionally, we must recognize that  our financial institutions are compet ing  in an international arena. If we  want U.S.-based companies to be able  to play  in the World Cup, we must  permit our institutions to play home  games rather than just away games.  We need comprehensive legislation.  The Washington Post editorial of  today recognizes the need to address  this global  trend. In February 1986,  the Banking Committee heard  testi mony from English regulators and fi nancial  institutions which  outlined  how and why financial markets and  competition was changing globally. We  heard chief financial officers of major  United States  corporations  explain  why their companies increasingly went  to London to raise money. Our own  domestically  based  institutions  con firmed these trends and recommended  legislation.  However,  these  Senate  hearings  were 8 months before  the effective  date of the new English system, the  so-called big bang. Consequently  the  press  and  those Members  of  the  Senate who are not on the Banking  Committee  gave  scant  attention  to  those hearings. Since then ""big bang,""  like  the  first shot  that started  the  American Revolution,  is being heard  around the world.  The Washington Post also points out  that Chairman PROXMIRE has begun  hearings on issues left over from the  last Congress. I  too applaud him but  would  like  to  remind everyone  that  FSLIC recapitalization  is by far  the  most pressing issue on the agenda. In  my opinion, we  should  resolve  that  issue and  then produce  the compre hensive  legislation which more and  more are beginning to realize is so nec essary. Since many Members not on  the Banking Committee  are  asking  about  these  issues,  I  ask  that  the  opening statement I made at the first  Banking Committee hearings of  the  100th Congress  be  printed  in  the  RECORD.  The statement follows:  STATEMENT OF SENATOR GARN  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I am sorry I  was unable to be here yesterday. It was nec essary for me to be present at a meeting in  Provo, Utah the night before and I was not  able to leave for Washington until early yes terday morning.  However  I did have an opportunity  to  review the testimony and discuss the hear ing with my staff-and I must say that the  reports I received were excellent.  In reviewing the statements for today and  those of yesterday, I am struck that perhaps  the 99th Congress wasn't a waste of time. As  frustrating as it was that we couldn't even  recapitalize FSLIC, not to mention or inabil ity to address the need for comprehensive  ",1987
396,1531,2,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing  the Tank Farm Safety Act,  legislation  which would prevent the recurrence of a po tentially catastrophic situation. On January 7,  1983, a Texaco storage tank in Port Newark,  NJ, exploded, burned 3.3 million gallons of  gasoline, caused the death of one person, in jured 23 persons, and  resulted  in over $15  million worth of property damage. One of the  principal causes of  the explosion was over filled fuel storage tanks.  The fire burned for several days creating an  inferno equal  in area  to  two  football  fields.  The  tremendous  force of  the blast knocked  out windows in Jersey City and Bayonne, and  was even  felt by  some  residents  in  Long  Island 70 miles distant.  Its magnitude might  not have been limited to the series of storage  tanks set afire  in chain  reaction. Within  the  shadow of the smoke and  fumes  lay a large  propane company which, if involved in the fire,  would have caused untold  loss of  life and  property damage.  Tank  farms such as  these are distributed  throughout the Nation. Nearly 3,000 of these  facilities are located in New Jersey. A matter  as crucial as  the safety of these containers,  which are often concentrated  in or around  heavily populated urban areas, warrants  the  passage  of  this  legislation. My  bill would  ensure the safe and efficient operation of tank  farms  by  requiring  alarm  systems  at  all  manned  fuel storage  facilities. This  type of  alarm would activate  in  case of container  overfill or if the standard signaling device itself  is not working, and would sound  in  time  for  monitoring personnel  to shut off the  flow of  liquids into the tank. Only alarm devices ap proved by the National Fire Protection Agency  could be used at these terminals.  This legislation also mandates that an alarm  system with  automatic  shutoff devices be  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  used at unmanned terminals. This would notify  anyone  in  the area  that there  is a problem,  even as the flow of fuel is being automatically  stopped.  Plans and specifications for any new, high level alarm system to be  installed under this  act would be submitted to the Assistant Sec retary of Labor  for Occupational Safety and  Health  for approval prior  to  its  installation.  OSHA would be responsible for checking the  system once  it  is  in place, and  the terminal  owner would be required to inspect the facility  every 3 months. The results of the tests would  be filed with OSHA.  Proper  standards  of  plant management  would be maintained  in addition to an effec tive automatic alarm system. Terminal proce dures to verify property lineup and receipt of  fuel would be established  in order to ensure  that the right amount of fuel goes to the right  tank.  In addition,  the bill would  require  that  plant personnel are  adequately  supervised  and monitored.  Automation in the tank farm industry is long  overdue, and invaluable in ensuring the future  safety of our citizens. The protection of our in dustrial areas, and the well-being of residential  communities which  lie  close  to  industrial  zones depend upon prompt consideration of  this bill. An explosion  in a container storage  area can result in untold deaths and injuries to  both workers and residents alike. It can leave  a prosperous  industrial zone devastated; se verely damaged nearby residential neighbor hoods; waste billions of gallons of precious  fuel; and add  to  the environmental decay of  the surrounding area.  I respectfully urge my  colleagues to support this important bill.  THE BOMBER DEBATE  HON. BYRON L. DORGAN  OF NORTH DAKOTA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 4, 1987  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. Mr. Speaker,  in the weeks ahead, Congress will face some  tough choices about needed improvements to  our strategic deterrent. As we  in Congress  continue to insist on genuine, verifiable weap ons  test bans and arms  reduction, we also  have a responsibility  to make sound choices  about our own defense forces and  the mod ernization of our aging bomber fleet.  After frequent visits tq the two Strategic Air  Command bases in North Dakota, Minot AFB  and Grand Forks AFB,  I became convinced  that our B-52 bomber force had become so  old as to create a future threat to the safety of  our air crews and the credibility of our deter rent. Accordingly,  I determined  that  it made  sense to invest in a limited buy of B-1 bomb ers as a hedge against the anticipated devel opment of the advanced technology or Stealth  bomber.  A recent feature in the Baltimore Sun aired  the debate of how to modernize our bomber  force. My own view is that we should wind up  the B-1 purchase and move toward the pro curement of  the  truly modern  technologies  embodied  in  the Stealth bomber. But  these  are tough and expensive choices and I would  invite my colleagues  to  review carefully  the  2949  debate engendered in the Sun articles by Jef frey Record and Joseph Zentner which were  carried in the February 2, 1987 edition.  The articles follow:  [From the Baltimore Sun, Feb. 2, 19871  BOMBERS: THE B1 ...  <By Jeffrey ReLvrd)  WASHINGTON.-Once  again,  the  B-1  bomber is back in the news. Canceled by the  Carter administration but revived in an ad vanced version by the Reagan administra tion, the B-1 is the first strategic bomber to  appear in the United States since the last B52, a 40-year-old design, left the factory in  1962.  The B-1 is moreover a rarity among major  U.S. weapon systems today. It is being pro duced on the basis of a fixed-price contract,  and delivered to the military months ahead  of schedule and hundreds of millions of dol lars below its congressionally-imposed pro gram cost ceiling of $20.5 billion  in fiscal  year 1981 dollars for 100 planes.  The Air Force's recent request for $600  million to make last-minute improvements  in the B-1 does not, contrary to some opin ions, constitute a cost-overrun: the original  fixed-price contract anticipated the need for  ""fixes"" derived from actual flight tests and  the $600 million will come out of the over  $700 million the Congress earlier took back  from the program precisely because it was  ahead of schedule and under cost. Com pared to most Defense Department procure ment programs these days, the B-1 program  is a model of good management and cost dis cipline.  These are not, however, the aspects of the  B-1 program that have elicited the recent  critical comment, which has virtually  ig nored the program's managerial and budget ary successes. Rather, the focus has been on  alleged  deficiencies  of  the  plane  itself,  which has been dubbed a ""lemon"" and a  ""flying Edsel.""  What is remarkable about the criticisms is  the underlying  ignorance  they  reflect of  modern bomber  tactics,  the great differ ences between the old Carter B-lA and the  new B-1B, and the even greater differences  between warplanes and commercial aircraft.  Consider,  for example,  the charge  that  the B-1 cannot fly as high as most commer cial airliners in service. The charge is true.  It is also irrelevant. Ever since Francis Gary  Powers and his high-flying U-2 spy plane  were shot down over the Soviet Union  in  1960 by a Soviet surface-to-air <SAM> mis sile, it has been recognized by real experts  that tv fly high over the Soviet Union in a  hostile aircraft  is almost certainly  to die  high. The modern SAM and missile-firing  supersonic  interceptor have made World  War 11-style high-altitude bombing attacks  suicidal. It was for this reason that the B70,  the first intended replacement for the  B-52, was canceled  in  favor of  the B-1,  which  is designed  to fly at altitudes-200  feet or  lower-where enemy SAM  radars  cannot  distinguish  them  from what  is  known as ""ground clutter."" The B-1 has  been built to survive in hostile air space, not  to  ferry  vacationing  civilians  through  friendly skies.  Another charge is that the B-1B is at least  41  tons heavier than the old B-lA, which  presumably compromises the B-IB's range  and maneuverability. This is also true, and  it's also highly misleading. The B-1B actual ly weights only 3.5 tons more than the B1A. The significant difference in weight lies  not in the planes themselves but their pay",1987
397,40,8,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President,  last December the brutal Soviet occu pation  of Afghanistan  entered  its  eighth year. The horrible condition of  human rights in Afghanistan was re cently described in a United Nations  report as:  ""A Situation Approaching  Genocide.""  As chairman of  the Congressional  Task Force on Afghanistan, I have re ceived thousands of letters from Amer icans across the Nation who are out raged at the senseless atrocities being  committed  today  in  Afghanistan.  Many of these letters are from Ameri cans who are shocked at this Nation's  relative  silence  about  the  genocide  taking place in Afghanistan.  In the weeks and months ahead, I  plan  to share some of  these  letters  with my colleagues. I will insert into  the RECORD two letters each day from  various States in the Nation. Today, I  submit two letters from the State of  Vermont and ask that they be printed  in the RECORD.  The letters follow:  DEAR MR. HuMPHREY: We are very con cerned about the people of Afghanistan and  wish you people  in Washington could do  something about it. It looks to us like an other Nazi Germany and we said we would  not let that happen again but it is happen ing and people are being wiped off the map.  We hope everyone who reads the Reader's  Digest will write to you and let you know of  our concern.  Sincerely,  LEONA CHAMBERLAND.  CHESTER, VT.  I  I  DEAR SENATOR HUMPHREY: I have just fin ished  reading an article  in  this month's  Reader's Digest entitled ""Agony in Afghani stan"". Once again I find myself sitting here  in my  nice  comfortable  home  thinking  about how awful this situation is half-way  around the globe in Afghanistan. Other ar ticles I have read on the same subject have  left me feeling  the same way, but please  bear with me as I share some of my feelings  with you.  During the time we had forces fighting in  Vietnam this country became a house divid ed. There was hardly a day that went by  without mention of  the war  in the news  media. The coverage it received, to a great  extent,  shaped our policy  regarding our  military objectives in that entire region.  believe  that the results of that war have  been  felt  in almost every major  foreign  policy decision we have made since  then,  causing us to be more timid than bold when  formulating our position.  say  this even  though I feel that our President, along with  some members of Congress, has tried hard  to get this country to understand that the  only thing the Soviets fear is a force greater  than theirs. Senator, we are the only nation  with enough resolve to be that force. The  President, and Congress, have done much to  make our Armed Forces just that, an armed  force. However, a  strong military  is only  part of the anwser to a world at ""peace"".  There must be a citizenry that is supportive  of the role of our military in keeping that  peace throughout the world.  I believe this  to be  true even  if  the peace  speak of  means some action must be taken to keep it.  We  in America have  long suffered  from  what I call the ""Ostrich Syndrome"" when  dealing with affairs outside our boundaries.  As we both know there are many instances  of  this approach in our history. Unfortu nately, for those that may think this way,  the world has become far too small to afford  us the luxury of not becoming involved in  it's affairs. Especially  if  they  involve  the  slaughtering of innocent civilians from the  unborn to the aged.  I am most disturbed over the total lack of  concern on the part of most Americans with  regards to the atrocities being committed on  the Afghan people. One has to wonder as to  where the protesters of the sixties and sev enties have disappeared to. Certainly they  all aren't marketing their latest home video  on aerobics! As you know, a group of people  have protested recently in Senator Leahy's  I  I  Vermont office over the Contra Freedom  Fighters  in Central America. This action  made me sick. While I certainly cannot con done any atrocity, by either friend or foe, I  certainly do wonder why these same people  have not said word one about what is taking  place every day  in Afghanistan. Where is  the public outcry when it is the Soviets who  are engaged in a war that can only be la beled ""Holocaust II""? Why do we not take  action today? Are we still trying to forget  what happened in South East Asia, to the  extent that we turn our backs on the inno cent Afghan people? Perhaps we  should  consider adopting the Ostrich as our new  national symbol! Think about it, have you  ever seen a bumper sticker protesting the  Soviet's war effort in Afghanistan? It's in teresting to note, however, the number that  exists protesting our involvement in Central  America. I also cannot accept the position  that tries to draw a parallel between our ac tions in South East Asia and what is hap pening in Afghanistan. There is little com fort to me in knowing that the Soviets are  faced with a very difficult military situation  that is also a diplomatic embarrassment to  them. You and I both know that without  support that it  is only a matter of  time  before  the  resistance  there cannot  resist  any  longer.  believe we have  turned our  backs long enough on those freedom fight ers who are valiantly giving up everything  to save their families, their homeland and  what is left of their future.  If we take a look at another part of the  globe today receiving a great deal of atten tion one must wonder as to why there is so  much concern over some while there is so  little concern for others. The area of which  I speak is, of course, South Africa. I assure  you that I bring this issue up out of interest  for human rights and not for any racially  motivated reason. The situation  in South  Africa is, to me, another travesty of justice  simply on a smaller scale. I am pleased to  see that the world attention that the gov ernment  there has  received  seems  to be  having a positive effect. However, consider ing man's inhumanity  to man  in South  Africa, it is still a paradise compared to the  hellish reign of terror that is now known  even  to  the children  in Afghanistan. The  fact  still  remains  that nearly all of  the  media coverage  is devoted  to  the events  there with hardly a whimper over the other.  I realize that there isn't much available for  us  in  terms of ""good  footage""  from  the  Afghan front, but that cannot be used as  our  excuse. Please understand  that  this  letter is not intended to be an indictment of  the  news media  in  general. They must  report on those things that will make for in teresting reporting, This is a  reflection of  what we  indicate to them we want to see,  hear and read. At this time the American  people simply don't want  to be bothered  with news of what seems to be a problem be longing  to someone else. The  image  that  comes to mind is one of the three famous  monkeys. ""See, Hear, and Speak No Evil"".  I'm afraid that this phrase must be amended  to now read; ""See, Hear, and Speak About No  Soviet Evil""!  Senator, I don't believe that I am alone in  my sentiments about  this  topic.  believe  that there are many in our country who feel  the same way. My hope, and prayer, is that  we wake up today to what is happening in  Afghanistan before we wake up to the same  thing in America?  Sincerely yours,  I  DANA J. TUSCHER.  MILTON, VT .   ",1987
398,248,8,Mr. BONKER.," The gentleman had a  worthwhile proposal and the commit tee was only too pleased to incorporate  it in the export promotion section of  the bill.  The gentleman makes reference  to  the Foreign Commercial Service, and  this is one Federal agency that is in a  position to help promote U.S. exports,  to help facilitate export opportunities  for U.S. businesses, and yet as impor tant as that program is,  it pales by  comparison  to what  other  govern ments are doing to aid their exporters.  In one recent study we found that  Japan,  for  instance, has over 7,000  Government employees  in  their em bassies throughout the country, their  foreign commercial service throughout  the world helping their exporters. At  last count, the United States had 733  U.S. nationals assigned to the foreign  embassies,  helping  U.S.  exporters.  Indeed, when one looks at how many  are stationed here versus Japan and  other countries, we also pale by com parison. Japan has some 5,000 of their  foreign  commercial  service  people  inside Japan helping their exporters  get a competitive edge. In the United  States we have fewer than 500.  When one goes through the list it is  not only Japan, but it is West Germa ny, England, Italy, France, Canada, all  the other major industrialized coun tries have devoted far more of their re sources  to  helping  their  exporters  than has the U.S. Government.  The Foreign Commercial Service has  only been around for a few years, but  in the past our philosophy has been  the Government really should not be  involved  in  the private  sector. We  should not be putting taxpayer dollars  at the disposal of U.S. businesses to  help  them compete abroad. But the  real question is if other countries per sist in doing this, if they have govern ment programs that substantially help  their exporters and we do not, then  eventually we are going to lose these  markets, and the trade deficit is going  to go up, and it will be more difficult  to restore our competitive position.  So we do this reluctantly because it  is necessary if we are going to main tain any kind of competitive position  in this very difficult global economy.  ",1987
399,248,8,Mr.  PEASE., Will  the  gentleman  yield further?  ,1987
400,248,8,Mr. BONKER., I am glad to yield to  the gentleman from Ohio.  ,1987
401,248,8,Mr.  PEASE.," The  gentleman  has  made a very important point. I think  he has rendered a real service to the  House and  to  the  trade bill of  the  House and to the Nation by his persistent emphasis on  the comparison  between what puny things the United  States does and what extensive things  are done by other nations in terms of  export promotion. From a philosophi cal point of view,  one could argue  either side as to whether it is wise to  have  the Government spending  tax payer dollars encouraging exports in a  free enterprise economy like ours, and  might argue philosophically that that  is not a role for the Federal Govern ment. But we do not have the luxury  of dealing with philosophy. We are  working in the real world where our  trading partners have already settled  the question. Their answer is yes, it is  a legitimate function for their govern ment, and they are putting a lot of re sources into that effort.  We have no choice, it seems to me,  but to try to match their effort. It is  like a retailer, if the gentleman and I  were in business on Main Street in any  town in his district or my district and  we both had similar businesses, and I  start offering trading stamps and the  gentleman does not, he does not have  a whole  lot of choice, whether he  thinks it is a smart idea or not, he  would have to match my effort. There  are a  lot of other marketing  tech niques which one of us could use, and  history is replete in our country of in stances of businesses watching what  the competition is and trying to match  that effort.  We are in a position now as a nation  in international trade, and as I say, it  is very much to the credit of the gen tleman from Washington that he con tinues to call that to our attention. I  appreciate the gentleman yielding.  ",1987
402,248,8,Mr. BONKER.," I  thank the gentle man.  There are other examples of how  foreign governments are helping their  exporters. One involves  this problem  of mixed credits or  tied aid credits  whenever governments weigh in with  concessionary  loans and government  grants  to enable  their exporters  to  swing a contract in their favor.  I  recently  took  a  trade mission  through several countries in the Pacif ic Basin, through India and Indonesia,  the Philippines and other countries,  and we were told by the finance minis ters and the trade ministers that they  no longer are making decisions on the  big  ticket  items  like  hydroelectric  projects, or aircraft, or telecommuni cations, they are not making their de cisions based on  the quality of  the  product or even the price of the prod ucts, but the financing  terms. They  are talking about a 25-year financing  arrangement.  a  Japanese  firm  weighs in with a 3 %-percent blended  rate, and the United States can do no  better  than 7 or 8 percent, we  are  going to lose the contract even though  the United States firm may provide a  better service, may have  the better  products, may even have a more favorIf  able price. But because we did not  have  favorable  financing  terms we  would lose the product.  These countries, notably Japan, that  now are accumulating sizable capital  surpluses,  now  have  the  resources  which they do not hesitate to apply in  ways that give them an unfair advan tage in many of these markets. So our  position is to exercise restraint, is to  plead with  these other countries  to  put an end to the practice. But if we  do not, then we end up  losing vital  contracts  and our  trade deficit,  of  course, will go up.  Another  thing  that we  have  at tempted to do in this trade bill is to re organize the State Department so that  there would be a new dynamic, a new  emphasis, if you will, on export pro motion. The  State Department  is  always preoccupied with security mat ters and geopolitical affairs, and it has  been very difficult to get them orient ed toward economic policy and trade.  I know the gentleman has been on  several trips  to other countries, and  now the talk is more on trade and eco nomics and financial problems than it  is on security and geopolitical matters.  Yet the State Department seems pre occupied with some of these global po litical matters. So we have attempted  to reorganize the State Department by  taking the trade and development pro gram, which is a small agency, out of  AID, which has an orientation toward  development assistance, and give them  a new standing within the State De partment, a larger budget and a new  congressional mandate to conduct fea sibility studies and export promotion  projects that would help U.S. business es compete more effectively in these  markets.  Mr. Speaker,  I will  insert  in  the  RECORD at this time the Export Task  Force summary of H.R. 3.  The summary referred to follows:  EXPORT TASK FORCE BILL SUMMARY-H.R. 3  TRADE  AND  INTERNATIONAL  ECONOMIC  POLICY REFORM ACT  In January, the House Democratic Leader ship reintroduced H.R. 4800 <of  the 99th  Congress), as H.R. 3, the broadest piece of  trade legislation to come to the House floor  in over a decade. It represents the culmina tion of several years' efforts at trade law  reform, and also contains provisions dealing  with export promotion, agricultural  trade,  international finance, and competitiveness.  The Rules Committee print distributed to  Members on April 24 now consists of legisla tion reported out of ten standing commit tees, which was knit together with the coop eration of the committee chairmen. Those  Committees  contributing  legislation  are:  Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce,  Foreign Affairs, Banking, Education and  Labor, Agriculture, Small Business, Mer chant Marine, Government Operations and  Public Works.  This summary, while far from exhaustive,  is  intended to give a comprehensive over view of the bill as reported by these commit tees. Any views expressed are, of course,  those solely of the Export Task Force staff.  ",1987
403,261,8,Mr. DELAY., I agree.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. He  has not done a  thing  for years on  trade. He did it because there is a real  danger that somebody else is going to  step in and do something on trade be cause he has not been doing what he  should do.  ,1987
404,261,8,Mr. DELAY.,"  gentleman.  Mr. DORGAN  of North Dakota.  Whether you see the light or feel the  heat, whatever the motive is, I think it  is  fine  that  the President  is doing  what he is doing. But the fact is that  we have a problem that the President  is not going  to solve unless we put  pressure on him. We have markets  overseas  that are not going  to be  opened with incentives; they are to be  opened if we put pressure on to say  that we are not going to put up with it  anymore.  Our response  is not to shrink our  markets because we do not want  to  shrink our markets. Our response is to  expand markets. The difference we  have, I think is that I do not believe  the barriers  that exist around  the  world  exist  because we  negotiated  something that allows them to exist. I  think in fact these barriers exist be cause some of our major tough trading  partners these days still walk around  acting like they are war-torn Europe  or war-torn Japan.  They  are  in  fact  shrewd,  tough,  smart competitors of ours, and they  understand that if they just keep proI will agree with the  posing 5-year solutions to us, that is  all they need to do. They say, ""Yes,  you're right, we have a problem, but  we have a new 5-year plan to eliminate  these barriers,"" and then at the end of  5 years they say, ""Yes, you're right, we  are very sorry, we have done nothing,  but we have a new 5-year plan.""  0 1640  Now we are up to our neck in red  ink, and some people are saying, ""Wait  a second, we have got to do something  about this."" Now, let us do the right  thing. Let us not do just anything be cause we do not want a trade war.  ",1987
405,261,8,Mr. DELAY.," I agree with the gentle man in some of his premises, but it  does not change the fact that our re sponse to our Government and our ad ministration  not  doing what  they  should have been doing in the past.  Our response to other countries call ing our bluffs. The bottom  line of  what you were saying  is  that  they  know  that we would not  retaliate  against them over the past. Our re sponse should be based upon true eco nomic  facts,  true  economic  figures,  and should be based upon economic  history. This bill throws all that right  out  the window and  it  is based on  nothing.  I would like to ask the gentleman, if  the gentleman is for this bill, and the  gentleman is right and it opens mar kets, are we going to lift our unfair  trade practices in response?  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.  I  think the gentleman in the well will  understand that when you talk about  who has been demonstrating the prac tice of free trade around the world, it  has been us. Oh, there are some isolat ed  instances, perhaps,  in which we  stray off the course on that.  ",1987
406,261,8,Mr. DELAY.," More  than  isolated.  I  have got  to challenge you on  that.  There is more than isolated instances.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. But  you  cannot make  a  case  that  this  country has not been the beacon of  free trade around the world. We have  been. We have been the leaders of free  trade.  What we discover  is our producers  do not find reciprocal treatment when  we expect to be able to be treated well  when we go  into a  foreign market.  That is not true in all cases, but the  USTR put out a book with 300 pages  listing the barriers in tariffs, and that  is the problem.  ",1987
407,261,8,Mr. DELAY., I thank the gentleman  for participating. My time is over. We  could carry this on forever.  ,1987
408,261,8,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker,  I applaud Con gressman DELAY  for his exceptional  leader ship on the issue of American trade, which  is  one of  the most  important concerns facing  this Congress.  The United States is at an economic cross roads. By the choices we make, America can  either  continue  and  expand  the  domestic  growth and advancement begun under President Reagan or return to the spirit of malaise  and conditions of economic decline that exist ed under President Carter.  By many measures, the United States now  is doing very well. The country  is  in  its fifth  year of economic expansion, one of the long est periods of continuous economic growth in  the  last 40 years. Since 1982,  the average  annual inflation rate has been almost one-third  of what it was in the preceding 9 years and is  lower than in most European countries; manu facturing productivity has been high; and per  capita  income has outpaced  the consumer  price  index  raising  the purchasing power of  the average American.  In  this country, 12 million new  jobs have  been created since late 1982. By comparison,  the 12 countries of  the European Economic  Community created a net total of only 500,000  jobs. Even Japan which  is acclaimed for  its  rapid growth created only 1.6 million  jobs in  this period. America has  truly become  the  ""great employment machine."" But we can do  better.  Although  the United States  is one of  the  world's largest exporters, the value of our ex ports has remained  relatively constant since  1980. It has not kept pace with the 35-percent  increase  in our gross national product since  that date. As  a  result,  in  terms  of value  shipped, exports as a share of GNP have de creased from 12.8 percent in 1980 to 8.9 per cent in 1986. In contrast, the value of our im ports has remained at about 11.5 percent of  GNP, thus causing our large trade imbalance.  America must commit itself to having strong  and active foreign trade. U.S.  industries have  relied  too exclusively on our  large domestic  market, and have not concentrated enough on  foreign trade. Only 12 percent of the estimat ed 225,000 U.S. manufacturers export. Today,  250 firms account for 85 percent of all U.S.  exports. Yet, a study by the General Account ing Office estimates that there are an addi tional 11 ,000 firms capable of exporting goods  and services. With one-fifth of  the  industrial  production of the U.S. exported and 70 per cent of the goods we produce facing foreign  competition, Americans must  recognize  that  the future well-being of the Nation is linked to  our performance  in  the  international market place.  Expanding America's share of world mar kets, which I will call competitiveness, requires  three major  conditions  operating  together.  First, American goods and services must be  price attractive  in world markets. A 3-, 4or  even 5-percent  increase  in  productivity will  have  little effect on  the price of American  goods in another country, if there are 40 to 50  percent swings in exchange rates. Widely fluc tuating exchange rates cause uncertainty for  those  making  investments  for  producing  goods and services for export, disrupt trade,  cause unemployment, and often lead to calls  for protectionism.  Since  the United States has  the world's  strongest and safest economy,  the dollar  is  used as money by other countries. Foreign  demand for the dollar creates an upward pres sure on the exchange rate and causes a pre mium on American  farm  and manufacturing  exports.

417,287,8,Mr. HOCHBRUECKNER.," Mr. Speaker, today  I would like to call to the attention of my col leagues here in the House of Representatives  the life of an artist whose work many people  have seen but whose name is hardly known.  Alonzo Chappel was born  in 1828 in New  York City. By the age of 12 he was earning   $1 0 painting portraits. At 17 he studied at  the National Academy of Design and his work  was exhibited at the American Institute.  Alonzo Chappel's  passion was  painting  scenes from the history of our Nation, espe cially scenes of the American Revolution and  the Civil War. Thomas Bayles, who studied  and wrote about  the history of Long  Island  wrote  that  ""Mr. Chappel seemed  to under stand a subject completely and  to be pos sessed of the ability to portray the subjects of  his imagination with striking effect. No written  labels were necessary to explain the charac ter of individual figures."" His work is so effec tive in evoking the spirit and character of the  subjects he portrayed  that his paintings of  Washington's  inauguration and  the Battle of  Long Island are still used in history text books  today.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In 1869, Alonzo Chappel moved to the vil lage of Middle Island and bought a farm near  Corwin's Pond. Here he lived and worked on  paintings until  his death  on December 4,  1887. As a result of his residence, Corwin's  Pond has since become known as Artist Lake.  This year marks  the 1 OOth anniversary of  the death of Alonzo Chappel. The  life and  work of Alonzo Chappel was brought to my at tention by Robert Hoffman,  the historian of  the Artist Lake Condominiums Golden Age  Club. Robert Hoffman shares the artists' dedi cation  to bringing our Nation's history to  life  for the people of today. He has donated much  of his time speaking at elementary schools in  my district teaching students about the history  of central Brookhaven. Robert Hoffman is the  leader of efforts to commemorate the location  of Alonzo Chappel's house and the 1 OOth an niversary of his death. I appreciate his efforts  to recognize  the accomplishments of Alonzo  Chappel and am proud  to participate  in  this  endeavor.  DONALD STOLTZ, ALWAYS A  LEADER-ALWAYS A DOER  HON. GUY VANDER JAGT  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 27, 1987  ",1987
418,287,8,Mr. VANDER JAGT.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  pay this special tribute to a very good friend  and a very special  individual as well, Donald  Stoltz of Holland, MI. In the many years that I  have known him, Don has exhibited  the ex traordinary energy, dedication and community  spirit that have made him a leader in the Hol land, as well as  the western Michigan area.  He has always been guided by the values of  friendship,  family, church and community. He  has given a great deal to all who have been  privileged to know him and to work with him. I  take great pride  in sharing his accomplish ments with my colleagues today.  A  resident of Holland  throughout his  life,  with the exception of his military service in the  U.S. Army as an officer personnel section  chief (S-1), Don graduated from Holland High  School and Hope College. His major field of  study was economics, with an additional con centration  in  educational  administration  at  Michigan State University.  Don Stoltz personifies commitment to hard  work,  intense preparation,  leading  to excel lence. The citizens of Holland owe a great  debt to Don for his dedication and concern for  their well-being. He has helped  to promote  Holland  in  the best  tradition of community  spirit. His effectiveness, influence and abilities  rank him among  the best leaders in Holland  and Ottawa County and his quiet effective ness behind the scenes has contributed to in numerable achievements.  While operating his own piano and organ  business for over 30 years, Don still finds time  to be a  leader  in every major program and  project  in Holland and Ottawa County. A  member of the county board of commission ers-four times, past president of the Holland  Area Chamber of Commerce, past president  10037  of the Holland Rotary ~lub, past chairman of  the Tulip Time 50th Anniversary Committee  and member of the Maple Avenue Foundation  are but a few of Don Stoltz's important roles.  He is also a past president of Tulip Time, Inc.,  a past executive committee member of  the  Ottawa County chapter of the American Red  Cross, an active member of the Maple Avenue  Christian Reformed Church and a member of  the  campaign  committee  for  the Christian  School  International.  Additionally,  he  has  served the Republican Party in Ottawa County  with great distinction  in every capacity and  has assisted in various fundraising drives for  Hope College over the years.  In further detailing his remarkable work with  the Republican Party, Don has been a block worker,  precinct  chairman, ward  chairman,  delegate  to State and  county conventions,  served on many convention committees, a di rector of political education, a member of the  executive committee and a county  finance  chairman. He also serves as vice chairman of  the Ottawa County Finance Committee.  On a personal note, Don has been excep tionally close and good to me in our efforts to  serve  the Ninth Congressional District  of  Michigan.  I shall always be grateful  for his  support and trust. Back in the earlier days of  my  congressional  tenure, Members of  the  House of Representatives were restricted  to  one trip back to the district per month at Gov ernment expense. Don  knew  I wanted  to  come back more often and so he founded the  Flying Vander Jagt Club whereby  individuals  could contribute to a fund to pay for any nec essary additional trips.  Further, in order to promote the best possi ble working  relationship between  the people  of Ottawa County and  their  representative,  Don  founded an annual ""Breakfast for Guy""  which has continued for nearly 20 years. He  was also instrumental in securing the Holland  Christian High School's participation  in  the  1969 Presidential  Inaugural Parade  and  in  convincing the Ninth District Republican lead ership to support me for election to the House  leadership as chairman of  the National Re publican Congressional Committee.  I appreci ate this opportunity to publicly thank him  for  his loyal support for all these years and to let  him know how much his loyalty and friendship  has meant to my wife, Carol, daughter Ginny  and me.  Donald Stoltz has worked  tirelessly to  im prove his community,  to help his neighbors,  and  to support the values he holds so dear.  His invaluable contributions of time and talent  in promoting the growth of his community is a  fine example to us all. He has a strong per sonal  influence for good-a unique individual  who combines a strong determination with a  genuine sense of caring for people. ""A good  friend, a generous and unselfish leader and a  truly outstanding American"" all describe Don  Stoltz.  I know my colleagues will  join me  in  wishing him continued success and fulfillment  in all his endeavors.  What  this country needs are a  few more  Don Stoltz's in each and every community. He  is that kind of guy-just super.  ",1987

421,300,8,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, the Presi dent of  the United States made  a  speech before the Chamber of Com merce on yesterday and it was filled  with good one-liners. The President is  good on one-liners. He said:  Congress has a budget process that's out  of  control-missed  deadlines,  Gramm Rudman-Hollings targets that get ignored.  Now, they want a budget summit with the  White House. Well, we've sent  them  a  budget. And if Congress doesn't like it, they  should first produce one of their own as a  basis  for  talking. But even  then, under  today's rules,  if we  sit down  to  talk, no  agreement they make would be binding on  them.  Congress needs to change the way it does  business on the budget. They need ways of  insuring that they will stick to budget deci sions  once  they're made-no back  door  spending, no missed targets, no swearing off  the bottle of spending only to take a nip the  next morning. Lock away  the bottle, and  then we can talk. Maybe with the budget  summit, they hope I'll bail them out.  Mr. President, we do not hope the  President will bail us out. We hope the  President will help us to help him and  the country in dealing with the prob lems that are before us.  We hope that he will help us to help  him to bail himself out and the coun try out of the thorny problems that  confront the country with triple-digit  deficits in trade and triple-digit, Feder al deficits. These are legacies that this  President will leave to the next Presi dent whether that next President be a  Republican or a Democrat unless this  President helps  the Congress,  stops  bashing the Congress, and works with  the Congress in resolving the problems  that he and his administration have  helped to create.  He  talks  about  ignoring Gramm Rudman-Hollings  targets. His  own  budget ignores the targets. It does not  meet the targets this year and it would  not balance the budget by fiscal year  1991-which  is  a  Gramm-Rudman  target.  Yes, he sent a budget. He says, ""We  have sent them a budget."" Yes,  the  President has  sent  the Congress  a  budget, but a point of order could be  made  against  the  President's own  budget because it does not meet the  Gramm-Rudman targets. He said he  would veto any bill that raises taxes.  His own budget calls  for  taxes,  in creased taxes, new taxes.  Mr. President, the Senate is now en tering a period of intense legislative  activity. The budget is before us. A sig nificant and far-reaching trade bill is  now beginning to be marked up. A sup plemental appropriations bill must be  passed and the debt limit ceiling must  be addressed.  Senator NUNN is moving the defense  authorization bill forward in an expe ditious manner. Senator PELL has indi cated that a foreign aid bill will soon  be ready for floor action. The Senate  select  committee  investigating  the  Iran-Contra controversy will begin its  public proceedings in the first week of  May.  Looming over  this busy  legislative  process is the question of what type of  relationship the Congress and the Ex ecutive will have. Will it be one of con frontation or one of cooperation? The  Congress showed in its first 100 days  that it can help lead the Nation for ward.  But now, spring training is over. The  regular season is underway. The Presi dent can bat cleanup or the President  cannot bat at all but the Congress is  going to have to play all nine innings.  How the game is played depends large ly on the President.  If the President chooses a strategy  of cooperation, then we may have a  government  that  is  active,  positive,  and forward looking.  I hope that the legislative strategy  adopted by the administration is not  one of confrontation one-liners, point ing fingers, Congress bashing simply  to  divert  attention  away  from  the  select committee hearings  that will  soon begin. The Congress must investi gate. The people must make their own  final judgment on the competency and  leadership of  the President on  this  matter. The Iran-Contra hearings are  on one track. The legislative agenda of  the Congress  is  on  another  track.  Those tracks should and will be kept  distinct and separate.  Mr. President, what does the Con gress seek as a sign of ""good faith""  that the President is willing to cooper ate with the Congress? Three areas of  legislative concern immediately come  to mind.  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.  ",1987

440,339,8,Mr. GRAMM.,"  thank  the distin guished Senator from New Mexico.  Mr. President,  I  think  the distin guished Senator from New Mexico has  said it well. Rather than simply re peating what he has said, I would like  to  take my colleagues back  to  the  adoption of the Gramm-Rudman-Hol lings law, what we all said and what  we all meant when we said it and then  look at how it relates to the vote we  are about to take, which I believe is a  vote on nothing less than the life or  death of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  law, period.  If this ruling is sustained, we will ba sically be  saying,  ""No matter what  Congress says its intent is, Congress  can circumvent that stated intent by  simply having a little clause in the bill  that says, 'For the purpose of getting  around the intent we stated 2 years  ago: let's assert that we still mean it,  even though we do not mean it now.'""  ""Let us assume a fiction now for the  purpose of circumventing what we said  then,"" that is the message here.  I remind my colleagues of the frus tration that we faced in the summer of  1985 at having made no progress in  controlling the Federal deficit, when  we  faced  a  $2  trillion debt ceiling.  There was a strong opinion on both  sides of the aisle  in both Houses of  Congress  that something had  to be  done.  What we decided to do was to write  into law an emergency measure that  said because we faced a crisis, and be cause Congress had not acted, for this  5-year  emergency  period we  were  going to set out a set of principles and  we were going to live with those prin ciples.  Among the most fundamental princi ples of Gramm-Rudman was the 60vote point of order that required that  no budget could come to the floor of  the Senate which did not meet the tar gets  of  the Gramm-Rudman  law.  There is no provision of the Gramm Rudman-Hollings law that is more im portant than that.  In addition,  it provided  that any  amendment to that budget had to be  zero sum in the deficit and that any  bills appropriating money which vio lated  the overall budget or violated  the subcommittee levels as set out in  the budget were subject to a 60-vote  point of order.  Everybody  knew, when we wrote  that into law, that there would be dis putes about budget assumptions. From  the very beginning, we have had de bates about what we  assume about  economic growth, and we  all know  that the level of economic growth has  a big  impact on the budget. We all  knew, when we passed  the Gramm Rudman-Hollings  law,  that  there  would be disputes about gross national  product, that there would be disputes  about inflation, that there would be  disputes  about unemployment,  that  there would be disputes about  the  overall baseline. We all knew that, and  we all knew that from time to  time  people would mix wishes and wants  and desires with reality. We all knew  that.  However,  nobody  contemplated  when we passed the Gramm-Rudman Hollings law that somebody was going  to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate  and say  that while we  say  in  this  budget that the deficit is $133.7 bil lion, while we all say that is the case,  while the whole budget is written on  those  economic  assumptions, while  nobody claims otherwise, and while  nobody is proposing to go back and re write the budget in light of new as sumptions, the distinguished chairman  of  the Budget Committee  is  saying  that solely for the purposes of meeting  the  targets of  the Gramm-Rudman  law-for no other purposes-we are  going to recognize an entirely differ ent set of assumptions, and those al ternate assumptions produce a deficit  of $107.9 billion.  In fact, had the distinguished chair man of the Budget Committee simply  gone back and changed the baseline  and rewritten  the budget and given  the  baseline  to  the Congressional  Budget Office, and had they scored it  at $108 billion based on that baseline,  this would be an entirely different  debate  today, and the ruling of the  Chair would be right. We migrt not  have liked it; we might have thought  it was bad policy; but it would have  been a correct ruling.  However, what has happened here is  that  the distinguished chairman of  the Budget Committee is not saying,  ""I am going to adopt a new set of as sumptions."" He is not suddenly saying,  ""The Office  of Management  and  Budget projections about GNP and  about unemployment are right."" He is  saying let's momentarily use these as sumptions for no other purpose than  to satisfy the requirements of Gramm Rudman-Hollings-and  then  let's set  them aside and not use them again.  The point is that after having com mitted, with  70 Members  of  the  Senate voting, that we were not going  to bring a budget to the floor of the  U.S. Senate  that did not meet  the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets, pe riod, now do we want  to sustain a  ruling of the Chair that says on page 1  that for the purposes of determining  the deficit under the Balanced Budget  Emergency Deficit Control Act, we are  now going  to assume one set of as sumptions to meet that target, to ful fill that requirement of law, and then  on page 2 have the provision again of  $133.7 billion? On page 1, the assump tions are one thing; on page 2,  they  are another-one budget with two dif ferent deficit levels.  If this ruling of the Chair is sus tained, what this means is that every  time a spending bill comes to the floor,  we can have a little provision attached  to it that says that for the purposes of  the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings commit ment that we made 2 years ago, which  many Members of this body who were  elected in 1986 campaigned in support  of, we are going to have this little fic tion  in paragraph 1, but everything  else is going to be reality from then  on.  If the Budget Committee chairman  says  that  is all  right, what we are  hearing from the Chair is that that is  going to be ruled to be in order. If we  do that, we have taken the guts out of  the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  law;  and, what is more important, not only  have we taken the guts out of the law,  but also, we are going to have a hard  time putting them back in.  It was pointed out that the Ameri can people could rise up through the  State legislatures and mandate a bal anced budget to the Constitution. It  could be adopted by 38 States. Then,  by this logic, with a little fiction that  said that for the purpose of meeting  the balanced budget amendment  to  the Constitution-the document that  we are celebrating the 200th anniver sary of-we are going to have a little  fiction and we are going to say that we  assume merely that it is met, but then  the rest of the bill violates it.  I know that my colleagues are going  to be under a lot of pressure to vote to  sustain the ruling of the Chair on a  partisan basis. I hope they will not do  it.  If you  voted  for  the Gramm Rudman-Hollings  law, you said that  no budget should come to the floor of  ",1987
441,378,8,Mr.  CRANSTON.," Mr.  President,  today I rise to introduce a Senate reso lution  expressing  the  sense of  the  Senate regarding the air traffic con trol system.  Mr. President, I am concerned about  the slow progress being made in the  area of  the air  traffic control work  force.  In  1981,  just  prior  to  the  P A TCO strike, there-were more than  16,200 controllers, 80 percent of whom  were  qualified at  full performance.  Presently there are only 14,700 con trollers of which only 62 percent are  at the full performance level. The De partment of Transportation plans to  build the air traffic control work force  to only 15,225 by fiscal year 1988.  The massive firing of the PA TCO  controllers  in 1981  closely coincided  with deregulation of the airline indus try. As a result, we have seen an in crease in the number of aircraft in the  sky at a time when there has been a  drastic reduction in the ranks of the  professionals who direct that traffic.  Overtime hours are rising. In 1981,  the controllers  logged  in a  total of  732,026 hours  in overtime.  In 1986,  overtime hours  totaled 870,000  and  projected overtime hours for 1987 will  be even higher. Much of this will be a  result of the expected rise in air travel  this summer.  ",1987
442,417,8,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President,  numbers don't lie-but they sure can  mislead you if you don't look at them  long and hard enough. Never has that  been  truer than  in  the case of  the  higher tax rate on capital gains  im posed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Although income tax rates are lowered  substantially under the new law,  tax  rates on long-term capital gains rise  enormously. Despite  that  increase,  economists  tell us  that neither  the  Federal Treasury nor those seeking or  investing capital will benefit.  The new tax law repealed the 60-per cent capital gains exclusion of prior  law. Under the new law, every dime of  a capital gain will be taxable. There  will be no exclusion. As a result, the  new law raises the top marginal tax  rate on long-term capital gains from  20 percent to as high as 33 percent.  But, unfortunately, that is only half  the story. When you combine the new  law with the State income taxes, the  results are so much higher they are  breathtaking.  For  instance,  in my own State of  Minnesota, a $1,000 gain from the sale  of  a  business or  investment would  have cost $215  in Federal and State  taxes in 1986. Under the new law, the  tax bite on that same gain could jump  to $396. Nationally, the top State/Fed eral combined rate goes from $235 per  $1,000 of gain-Arkansas and North  Carolina-under the old  law  to $422  per $1,000 of gain-New York-under  the new law. In fact, there will be four  States-and the District of Columbia where  the  top combined  rate could  now exceed 40 percent. In no State  will  the maximum  combined  rate  under the new law be less than $330  per $1,000 of gain.  Such a massive increase is unwise in  many ways. It will reduce investment  and venture capital. It hits especially  hard at middle-income earners, whose  largest capital gain is often the result  of the sale of a single, large asset, like  a farm or business. Much of that gain  may be inflationary gain as opposed to  real economic gain, and repealing the  exclusion leaves them with no cushion  against inflation.  Also, while our new Tax Code gener ally is very competitive internationally  for the individual, not so in the case of  long-term capital gains. According to a  recent study by the Arthur Andersen  accounting  firm,  11  industrialized  countries,  including  Japan, Taiwan,  West Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, and  South Korea, impose no taxes on long term capital gains, and most others  have rates lower than ours.  There is a better way to deal with  capital gains, a way  that recognizes  the difference between assets that are  held only a short time and a long-term  asset. Earlier  this year I  introduced  legislation to provide a two-tiered cap ital gains exclusion for individuals. In  the case of assets held at least 1 year  but less than 3 years, 40 percent of the  gain would be excluded from  taxes.  For assets held 3 years or more, the  exclusion would be returned to 60 per cent. Under this proposal, the sale of a  91-059 0-89-14 (Pt. 8)  $1,000 asset in Minnesota would result  in $238 of State and Federal tax if it  was held between 1 and 3 years and  only $158 of tax if it was held 3 years  or  longer. Still high  internationally,  but certainly more attractive to inves tors-particularly  longer  term  inves tors.  While this proposal lowers the tax  hit on long-term gains,  the available  evidence  suggests  that  it will  not  result in any  loss of revenue  to  the  Federal Government. History  shows  that lowering capital gains tax rates  generally  increases  revenues  to  the  Federal Government-because  there  are more  transactions-while  raising  rates  normally  decreases  revenues.  People won't sell if they get killed by  taxes. Recent work on the issue by Dr.  Martin Feldstein and by Prof. Law rence Lindsey of Harvard University  also suggests that a proposal like mine  would not result in a loss of revenue,  and that the optimal rate to maximize  capital gains collections is 16 percent.  Mr. President, I will be speaking out  on the importance of a capital gains  rate differential again.  I understand  that neither  the President nor  the  Congress is anxious to reopen the Tax  Reform Act. Neither am I. But this  issue is so important to our economy  and our international competitiveness,  so  important  to all Americans who  hold property, that we must make an  exception. It took my friend, the late  Congressman Bill Steiger, years to get  the  rate down. The mood  is better  now. The proof is clearer. Let us hope  we can get it done quickly. In this case  the numbers speak for themselves.e  BUDGET SCOREKEEPING  REPORT  ",1987

444,430,8,Mr. BRYANT.," Mr. Speaker, as we  begin to debate H.R. 3,  the omnibus  trade bill, I urge Members to keep in  mind that what we are debating is our  national security, every bit as much as  when we debate  the defense appro priations bill.  Our independence and our ability to  determine  our  future  course  as  a  leader among nations is very much at  stake, and until we have a policy that  demands  fairness and  reciprocity  in  trade, one that demands that foreign  nations either let our American prod ucts  into  their markets or get their  products out of our market, we are in viting other nations to continue taking  advantage of us.  We need  strong  sanctions against  trading partners who refuse to play by  the rules. I strongly urge the adoption  of the Gephardt amendment because  it demands results and gives us  the  means to enforce them.  Our choice is clear; to step aside as  we lose control over our economic des tiny, or to take the steps necessary to  put us back in charge.  OUR STANDARD OF LIVING IS  ALSO AT STAKE  <Mr. WATKINS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1987
445,430,8,Mr. WATKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of the trade bill and specifi cally  in  support  of  the Gephardt  amendment.  A  lot of people are criticizing  the  Gephardt amendment, but let me say  this. In my opinion, it does not go far  enough.  Today we find that in that particu lar amendment, it allows the President  to waiver it, if it is in law, and there  has to be a strong pattern of unfair  trade practices by any country before  it is actually implemented.  Let us look at what is stake. What is  at stake today is our national security  and the standard of living for our chil dren and our grandchildren.  Today we are importing as much oil  as we did back in 1973 before the oil  embargo  took place. This past year,  for several months, we imported more  agricultural products than we export ed, even  though we are  the garden  spot of the world.  We are  importing more computer  chips and robots. Even though we in vented robots, 60 percent of them that  are being utilized today in our country  are made by the Japanese.  Eighty  percent  of  the  computer  chips are furnished by the Japanese.  The Japanese have seven of the larg est banks in the world. Nine out of ten  of the American people say that they  feel we  are  losing our  competitive  edge, and they have a reason to feel  that we  are  losing our competitive  edge because  the  trade performing  index in just 6 years has dropped 48  percent.  We are exporting a third less today  than we were just 4 years ago. So the  people are justified in their concern.  As I have said before, the people are  way out in front of the Congress. They  want something done about the trade  imbalances and unfair trade barriers  that are put up against the products  of  the United States' hard-working  men and women and our farmers of  this country.

455,443,8,Mr. DAUB.," Mr. Chairman, the chair man has done an incredible job on this  bill. If it becomes the law, he will have  overhauled both the tax and the trade  codes in just 2 years. He is proving to  be  the most  productive ways  and  means chairman of modern times.  I was one of the first Republicans to  support the chairman on tax reform. I  do not take  lightly my vote against  this trade reform proposal in the com mittee.  My primary concern is H.R. 3 leaves  no discretion to forego retaliation even  if there are clear indications of signifi cant  disruptions  in  agricultural  or  other major exports.  The bill could poison an already sick  farm export patient. After 40 percent  drop in farm exports, we don't need  laws mandating retaliation that will  slash them further.  Unfair  trade practices account  for  only about 15 percent of our trade def icit. That's Mr. GEPHARDT's statistic.  The Federal budget deficit is said to  account  for about 70 percent. This  doesn't mean we should turn the other  cheek on trade cheats. We need tough  trade laws with focused sanctions that  bite.  However, we don't need trade laws  that mandate GATT illegal or unjusti fied retaliation making farm sales an  easy  target. They  tend  to  take  the  first hit in wars of retaliation.  I worked with a number of  farm  groups and developed amendments to  ensure that agriculture doesn't pay for  the exesses in this bill.  Since proponents of the bill claim  there's no added risk for agriculture,  my amendments would have merely  put these assurances in the legislation.  Since  the amendments weren't ac cepted, my suspicions over who pays  for this bill have grown.  We recently retaliated against Japan  which has failed to live up to an agree mr- on computer chips.  For  this  decision,  the  President  made an  assessment  of  the  conse quences. The Secretary of Agriculture  had his say on the likely effect of this  action of our $5.1 billion in farm sales  to Japan. By the way,  they are our  biggest farm customers.  This  is  not  procedure we would  follow under this bill. Under H.R. 3,  retaliation would be ordered according  to a pre-set formula. It's trade policy  by automatic pilot.  We wouldn't have  input from  the  Secretary of Agriculture. It wouldn't  matter  that  the American  farmer  might have to foot the bill for the re taliation ordered by H.R. 3.  This is because you can't effectively  waive retaliation under section 301<a>.  The  test  is whether counter-retalia tion is  likely to result in substantial  harm to the national economic inter est.  We exported $8.5 billion in farm ex ports  to  the  targeted countries  last  year. Can $8.5 billion be considered  substantial in a $4.2 trillion economy?  The fact it is even a close call ought to  send shivers down the backs of those  interested in overseas farm markets.  The semiconductor retaliation may  have been necessary to get Japan's at tention. But section 301(a) could go  off like a string of firecrackers in an  ammo dump. It would set in motion  multiple  retaliatory  actions  against  major AG buyers all at the same time.  Consider that in the markets against  which portions of the bill are aimed,  farm exports make up some of  the  highest proportions of total U.S. ex ports. Agriculture has the most expo sure and, consequently  the most  to  lose in any trade combat.  Of the countries targeted by section  301<a) (Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and  West Germany), over 32 percent of  our exports are farm related.  One positive provision in this trade  bill for agriculture is continued negoti ating authority for the GATT round.  A successful GATT round is desperate ly needed to reduce world farm export  subsidies that have crushed prices.  Unfortunately,  even  the prospects  for a successful round are undermined  by the bill because it directs GATT il legal actions. We can't sit at the table  arguing for  fairer  trade  rules while  violating the current ones and expect  to succeed.  One of my amendments, also sup ported by a number of farm groups,  merely said that actions taken under  section 301(a) must be consistent with  our international obligations. This was  rejected. So much for suggestions that  this provision is GATT legal.  The proposed changes to section 201  also threaten overseas farm sales. Sec tion 201 mandates  increased  import  protection from goods that are fairly  traded, that is one not subsidized or  dumped.  In  responses,  trading part ners will retaliate by cutting American  farm purchases or demand legal com pensation.  Section 201 relief will increase under  the change because barriers will go up  unless their economic cost outweighs  the economic and social benefits of  providing relief. This unusually ambig uous language has been described as  harmless. However, the only relevent  question is whether section 201 relief  ",1987

457,469,8,Mr. BILBRAY.," Mr. Chairman, I would like to  take  this opportunity to commend  the chair man of the  full committee, Mr. FASCELL,  for  his support and efforts to facilitate legislative  action on title Ill of H.R. 3.  I especially would like to recognize the work  of the chairman of the Subcommittee on Inter national Economic Policy  and  Trade, Mr.  BONKER, and the ranking member, Mr. ROTH,  for their hard work and diligence in putting to gether a trade bill. As a freshman Member,  and a new member of  the subcommittee,  I  want  to personally recognize  their help and  leadership.  Mr. Chairman, we are considering  today a  measure which can  restore America's com petitive edge in  international trade and begin  to reduce our trade deficit. Since 1981 , when  our trade deficit was $40 billion, we have seen  it grow to a record $148.5 billion and about  $170 billion in 1986. At 4 percent of GNP, the  trade deficit is unprecedented in both size and  the speed with which it grew.  Additionally, it is becoming increasingly evi dent that the U.S. high-technology industry will  post its first ever trade deficit in 1986. Only 6  years ago, this industry had a $27 billion sur plus.  These figures point out that we need to re examine our export control laws and consider  making significant changes that will help our  high-technology industry compete overseas.  A major source of information that was pre sented before the subcommittee regarding our  current export license system was the report  prepared by  the National Academy of Sci ences.  I won't take the time to review the findings  and  recommendations of  the  report, but  I  would  like  to emphasize one aspect of  the  report. And  that is that export controls have  cost the American economy $9.3 billion and  188,000 jobs a year and worsened relations  with allied nations, without significantly improv ing national security.  Mr. Chairman, I believe that the subcommit tee has taken the  findings of the report and  has  incorporated  them  into a bill  that will  insure that our high-technology industry gets  back into the world's competitive market.  Title Ill of the bill contains initiatives to open  new markets for U.S. exports, to protect U.S.  business  interests abroad, and  to streamline  our export control system  in a way that will  enhance national security while strengthening  America's high-technology industrial base.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to address sever al provisions in the bill that I feel are impor tant.  Recognizing the need for export promotion,  the  legislation gives  the U.S. Foreign Com mercial Service statutory authority. The Serv ice  is currently engaged  in developing new  markets overseas and has been particularly  helpful to small-and medium-sized business es. The measure authorizes more overseas  positions for the Foreign Agricultural Service  and provides additional resources for the de velopment of overseas agricultural markets.  In  the export control area,  the package  carefully balances  the protection of our na tional security and promotion of U.S. exports  necessary  to strengthen our high-technology  industrial base. The bill streamlines the export  licensing system to focus on high-technology  goods that are critical  to U.S. security inter ests, and to reduce licensing requirements on  exports of  low-technology goods to Western  countries.  Low-level goods that are no longer militarily  important are  removed  from  the control  list  and ineffective unilaterial controls are limited.  We also establish an Export Administration  Reform Commission  to examine  the current  export control system and  report on  recom mendations and reforms for a more effective  and efficient system.  This proposal, which I authored in subcom mittee, will  review  the effectiveness of our  export licensing system and make recommen dations to Congress to strengthen the control  system to be more effective in protecting U.S.  and Western military technology.  Mr. Chairman,  I  insert  in  the RECORD a  letter sent  to Chairman BONKER  from Mr.  Lionel Olmer,  former Under Secretary  for  International Trade, in support of the Commis sion.  Mr. Chairman, the main goal of this legisla tion  is  to  restore America's competitiveness  around the world. I urge support of it.  Mr. Chairman,  I include the following  and excerpts of sections 339 and 340:  PAUL, WEISS, RIFKIND,  WHARTON & GARRISON,  letter  Washington, DC, March 30, 1987.  Hon. DON BONKER,  Chairman, Subcommittee on International  Economic Policy and Trade, Committee  on Foreign Affairs, House of Representa tives, Washington, DC.  DEAR DoN: Many thanks for the opportu nity to share with your Subcommittee my  thoughts on current efforts to reform the  U.S.  export control  system. Despite  the  ""winds of change"" being felt in recent weeks  and the committed efforts of Secretary Bal drige and Paul Freedenberg, it remains my  sincere belief that fundamental reform  is  necessary. The establishment of a  ""blue ribbon""  commission  to  shape  enduring  reform is essential.  During  the question and answer period  following my testimony, the issue was raised  as  to the utility of ""commissions."" I  fear  that my response was not satisfactory. On  reflection, I believe a strong case can and  should be made for the usefulness of com missions. Admittedly, commissions are not  always an effective solution for every prob lem and sometimes have been used to post pone actions or sidestep  tough decisions.  But  in  fact  they have proved extremely  useful in many instances of recent vintage.  Four examples come to mind:  The President's Social Security Reform  Commission <the ""Greenspan Commission"">  took the politically intractable Social Secu rity dilemma and  reached a  compromise  suitable to Congress. The Commission rec ommended benefit changes and payroll tax  increases which restored financial stability  to the Social Security trust funds;  The President's Commission on Strategic  Forces  (the  ""Scowcroft  Commission"")  bridged divisions between the Administra tion and Congress over the MX missile and  paved the way for full-scale development of  the small ICBM;  The President's Blue-Ribbon Commission  on Defense Management  <the  ""Packard  Commission"") made a number of recommen dations for broad organizational changes in  the Department of Defense, many of which  were adopted by Congress and are being im plemented; and  The President's Commission on Industrial  Competitiveness <the ""Young Commission"")  served to generate interest and focus debate  on many  trade-related  issues  currently  under  consideration  in  the House  and  Senate; even though there has been criti cism expressed as to the lack of adequate at tention to this report, there is no doubt it  stands as one of the premier statements on  ''competitiveness.''  I believe similar success is possible for the  proposed export control commission. It is  now more than ten years since the ""Bucy  Commission"" examined the premises-tech nical, strategic and practical-on which the  export control system is based. This decade  has witnessed astonishing change  in  the  character, content, and complexity of tech nology. It is time to reexamine these prem ises again. I note that the proposal for the  export control commission's establishment  has been reported out of the Foreign Affairs  Committee. I look forward to helping in any  way I can to see that this provision is en acted.  Sincerely,  LIONEL H. OLMER.  SECTION 339-EXPORT ADMINISTRATION  REFORM COMMISSION  This  section  directs  the President  to  create, not later than 60 days after enact ment of this bill, an Export Administration  Reform Commission,  to examine  the cur rent export control system and report on  recommendations and reforms for a more  effective, efficient system. Membership on  the Commission is to be comprised of 24 in dividuals knowledgeable in relevant scientif ic, business, or legal matters, 12 of whom  are appointed by the President and 12 by  the Congress.  One of the most difficult yet fundamental  export control issues concerns the definition  of what is militarily significant. The current  export control system is based on control ling items which could enhance the military  capability of adversaries, yet nowhere  in  statute or regulation is there a definition of  ",1987

459,495,8,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Chairman, the  Agriculture Committee provisions con tain the enhancement or the augmentation of something called the export  enhancement program, which is really  the primary message under which the  United States will meet unfair trading  practices by others, as has been the  case in North Africa and the Middle  East in meeting the European Com munity subsidies.  Under  this provision we would  in crease  the export enhancement pro gram's authorization level to $2.5 bil lion, we would extend the program for  2 years, and we would change the ac counting method to use market value,  which has  the  effect of  increasing  commodities used in the program by  30 percent.  What the EEP or export enhance ment program is, Mr. Chairman, is a  tool by which our foreign competitors  who play the game in an unfair and a  very subsidized manner with respect to  exports overseas will know by our de termination to use the EEP Program  that we will meet fire with fire, and  that we will not permit them to take  advantage of us by offering unfair sub sidies around the world.  Our goal in the Agriculture Commit tee hopefully is that we will not have  to use these EEP subsidies to fight fire  with fire, and that we can get agree ments with the Argentines, the Cana dians, and the Europeans, particularly  the Europeans,  to  stop using  these  kinds of subsidies and  to  reach an  international agreement in connection  with the production of grains in this  world, although the EEP does apply to  other commodities as well, not  just  grains. But if those countries choose  not  to  join with us  in an effort  to  reduce unfair pricing practices in the  world and unfair subsidies, then they  need to know that the United States  of America is going to devote its full  effort and complete agricultural policy  to fighting fire with fire, and in that  case we will use these increased EEP  authorities which this bill provides.

461,495,8,Mr.  JEFFORDS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  want to talk to the Members  today  about the dairy amendment which is  in the bill and about which we have  heard considerable controversy. It is  section 662 of H.R. 3, which will be  before us to vote on tomorrow.  First of all, I would like to remind  the Members that this is not the first  time we  have  talked  about  these  issues. I would like to take the Mem bers back to 1983, when the gentleman  from Virginia,  the gentleman  from  Massachusetts, and I had long debates  on similar issues. Again in 1985 we had  similar debates.  Many figures are flying around, and  that always happens when we get into  these dairy  issues. We have  figures  going this way and that way, and the  question is, what figures do I use in  making my judgment on how to vote  on this?  I would ask the Members to take a  look at history, to go back and take a  look  at what we  told  you would  happen in 1983, what our opposition  told you would happen in 1983, and  see what did happen. Everything we  told you would happen did happen.  We brought the surpluses down, we  saved  the  taxpayers money, and we  began that long tortuous course, with  dairy farmers contributing, to bringing  stability to the milk market.  In 1985, we again debated this issue.  They made their statements, we made  ours, and I ask the Members again to  look at what happened,  to establish  credibility as  to what may and will  happen  this  time. We  told  you  it  would again  reduce  the cost of  the  program by over $1  billion,  that  it  would bring things into balance, and it  would allow us hopefully sometime to  have  stability. That  again has  oc curred,  except  that we  have  some  problems, one created by casein, and  the second created by the fact that  east of the Rockies we do now have an  imbalanced situation which could be  very, very detrimentally affected by  any further price cuts.  So what does section 662 provide?  Now is the time to stop subsidizing  European Economic Community dairy  farmers and killing U.S. dairy farmers.  The Agriculture Committee amend ment, section 662 of H.R. 3, is a very  reasonable incentive for the adminis tration  to use  its authority  to stop  American subsidization of European  farmers. The American consumer is fi nancing these subsidies by hundreds  of millions  of dollars.  In  addition,  during surplus periods, taxpayers have  paid billions of  dollars  because  of  casein  imports.  Furthermore,  these  subsidized  imports are driving 5,000  U.S. dairy farmers out of business.  By the end of this year, the effective  dairy support price will have been cut  by $2 per hundredweight since Decem ber 1983. Current law calls for a fur ther cut of 50 cents on January 1,  1988, if the dairy surplus is above 5 bil lion pounds. Latest  estimates  from  USDA  indicate  a  surplus  figure  of  about  5.7  billion  pounds  for  1988,  down from an average of 12.9 billion  pounds over the past 3 years, but not  sufficient to avoid further price cuts.  However, about 28 percent of the es timated Government purchases of sur plus dairy products can be directly at tributed to increases in casein imports.  In  addition,  according  to USDA's  own  studies,  imports  of  subsidized  casein from Europe and New Zealand  are not only displacing domestic dairy  production,  but,  are  increasing  the  cost of the Dairy Program by $300 to  $800 million annually.

463,508,8,Mr. KLECZKA.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the chairman of the Govern ment Operations Committee for yield ing me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  H.R. 3 the Omnibus Trade Act of 1987,  the Gephardt amendment, and specifi cally in support of title X of this act  relating  to  trade  reforms  as  they  affect Government procurement.  Mr. Chairman, we have heard and  will continue to hear many speeches  by Members of this body who are op posed to various aspects of the omni bus trade bill we are debating today.  Opponents will tell us that one or  another provision of this bill will ""tie  the President's hands"" in dealing with  our  trading partners who engage  in  unfair trading practices;  Or will undermine  the President's  ability to negotiate quietly for an end  to discriminatory trade practices;  Or they will say that mandating spe cific remedial action in response to vio lations of fair  trade agreements and  principles will invite similar retaliation  by our trading partners.  We will hear of  the  dire  conse quences of such actions, and oppo nents will plea for the status quo: ""Let  the system work as it's presently de signed and intended."" They will say.  Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman,  the  system doesn't work any more. Our  trade  policy  engine  is  broken  and  rusty. It has been weakened by neglect  and disuse.  It sputters, gasps, chokes, wheezes  and  lurches-sometimes  forward,  sometimes backward. It needs to be re paired, tuned up and redesigned. The  manufacturer's warranty  has  long  since expired, so the repairs won't be  free. But they are necessary.  That, my colleagues, is what H.R. 3  is  all  about, what  the Gephardt  amendment is all about, and what the  ""Buy American"" provisions of title X  of this bill are all about. The bill does  not propose  retaliation  against our  trading partners-it proposes equaliza tion with them, whether the market is  private enterprise or government pro curement.  The ""Buy American"" provisions of  the title before us are simple, straight forward, and above all fair. They say  basically this:  Federal  agencies  cannot use U.S.  taxpayers' dollars  to purchase goods  and  services  from  foreign  suppliers  whose governments don't give our su pliers the same opportunity.  To accompany  this  fundamentally  fair and reasonable principle, the bill  prescribes a mechanism for determin ing who is in compliance with it and  who isn't.  Countries who are in compliance that is, those who provide our suppli ers with access  to  their government  procurement activities-are unaffected  by this bill.  For those who aren't, the bill let's  them know what we  intend  to do  about it. It does not allow them, or us,  to look the other way and hope the  problem disappears. It requires negoti ations with the offending governments  to eliminate practices which discrimi nate against our suppliers within a de fined period of time.  If that approach does not produce  the desired result, the door is closed  until the problem is solved.  The present system, Mr. Chairman,  does not work. Indeed, if it did, these  ""Buy American"" provisions would not  be necessary.  Flexibility, latitude, low-key negotia tions and other buzzwords used  to  characterize the present system have  not produced  the desired  result.  In  fact,  the General Accounting Office  [GAOl has  identified  this aspect of  our trade policy to be one of the most  widely neglected areas of monitoring  and enforcement.  So negl-ected, in fact, that according  to a GAO report issued in 1984 which  reviewed the International Agreement  on Government  Procurement,  the  agency was forced to rely on Govern ment procurement data  that was 3  years old at the time. Under the cir cumstances,  any  reasonable  person  would be skeptical,  to say the least,  about whether compliance with  the  agreement was being monitored.  The ""Buy American"" provisions are  a solid addition to this trade bill. They  are part and parcel of the overhaul  our trade policy engine needs. I urge  my colleagues to keep title X's reason able and moderate reforms intact by  rejecting  the Konnyu  amendment  when it comes before the body.  ",1987

466,508,8,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr.  Chair man, I rise in support of two very im portant provisions  in  the committee  print of H.R. 3 that were favorably re ported by  the House Committee on  the  Judiciary  and were drafted  in  large part by my subcommittee, the  Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liber ties and the Administration of Justice.  Both measures improve the adminis tration of  this Nation's intellectual  property,  patents,  copyrights  and  trademarks, system; both will have a  positive effect on reducing the trade  deficit; both will maintain and create  American jobs, especially in new tech nology areas. Enactment of these two  proposals-considered  collectively would be a major step in bolstering  the protection of American intellectu al property rights and  in  improving  American competitiveness in the world  marketplace. Neither proposal is pro tectionist, and both proceed on no tions of international comity and har mony between nations.  The  first  provision  reforms  the  International Trade Commission, par ticularly as relates to its authority to  enforce  intellectual property  rights.  Section 172 of  the committee print  makes  procedural  and  technical  changes in the current laws that bar  unfair trade practices. Under section  337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, products  can be  excluded  from  the United  States if they have been produced or  manufactured  through  use  of  an  unfair trade practice.  Section 172-which  is  identical  to  H.R. 1509,  approved by  the House  Committee on the Judiciary on April  8, 1987-eliminates an existing require ments that owners of patents, copy rights, trademarks and semiconductor  mask works, prove  to  the ITC that  they have been injured by an unfair  trade practice. Under  the proposal,  owners have to show only that they  own the intellectual property right in  question, and that there has been in fringement.  In addition, section 172 clarifies who  can bring a  case before  that  ITC.  Under current law, an industry must  prove that it is an ""efficiently and eco nomically  operated  industry.""

492,534,8,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, my distinguished  colleague  from New Jersey, JIM COURTER,  has written a thoughtful piece for the Wash ington Post which compares the 1961 Bay of  Pigs  invasion with  the current Iran  imbroglio.  Mr. CouRTER contrasts the manner in which  Presidents Kennedy and Reagan  reacted  to  these political crisis. Since his comments offer  a historical perspective on our present situa tion, I submit them for your study.  Mr. CouRTER observes  that  there are nu merous similarities between the Iran and Cuba  incidents-the possibility of  illegal acts;  the  President's contention that he was not fully in formed; operational oversight by a risk-taker;  use of private humanitarian aid to rescue hos tages; and appointment of a Presidential  in vestigatory commission which concluded that  the Presidential style of management and the  lack of a written record were partly to blame  for the policy confusion.  Mr. CouRTER concludes, however,  that by  immediately accepting  full  responsibility and  then quickly  launching major space and de fense  initiatives, Kennedy cut his losses and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  revived a forceful Presidency. Though he has  wasted  precious  time,  perhaps  President  Reagan may yet overcome the Iran preoccu pation by shifting his energy and the Nation's  attention to more important issues and chal lenges.  [From the Washington Post, Apr. 9, 19871  WHAT REAGAN SHOULD HAVE LEARNED FROM  KENNEDY'S BAY OF PIGS  As  <By Jim Courter)  President Reagan's  Iran  initiative was  hardly America's first foreign policy failure.  Although Iranscam is compared with Wa tergate, a more revealing precedent is the  Bay of Pigs fiasco.  President Kennedy escaped the political  hurricane that has engulfed Reagan only  partly because the Kennedy administration  was in its honeymoon period and Congress  was controlled by Kennedy's party. There  are valuable  lessons  in statesmanship  to  learn by comparing these  two policy fail ures.  U.S.  forces  trained and equipped about  1,300 Cuban exiles and, in April 1961, landed  them at the Bay of Pigs. American B-26 air  strikes against Cuban air bases preceded the  landing. The invaders soon ran out of am munition, and all but 100 were captured by  Castro's communist forces.  President Eisenhower began the plan for  ~hat became an  invasion. Originally,  the  tdea was  just for exiles  to  infiltrate  the  mountains and establish a Castro-style guer rilla force for freedom. The proposal soon  evolved  into a  full-scale  invasion. Shortly  before the action began, the landing areas  was moved to the Bay of Pigs. Just as Rea gan's Iran opening was transformed into a  different policy, it became clear to Kenne dy, according  to Ted Sorensen's account,  ""that he had in fact approved a plan bear ing little resemblance to what he thought  he had approved.""  president-elect,  Kennedy  already  doubted the whole scheme. But he was con vinced that he would be thought weak if he  canceled his Republican predecessor's plan.  With no forceful opposition from his secre taries of state and defense, he assumed his  senior advisers were all in favor. <Foreshad owing George  Shultz's protestations  in  Iranscam, Chester Bowles, an undersecre tary of state, infuriated Kennedy by leaking  a post-facto story that Bowles always op posed the project.)  The CIA, not the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  mastermined  the Bay of Pigs operation.  Only a handful of administration personnel  knew the details. Peter Wyden's book ""Bay  of Pigs"" describes CIA Deputy Director  Richard Bissell in terms Oliver North would  recognize  instantly: he ""relished risks-in  his mountain climbing, as skipper of his  boat, as commander in chief of the Richard  Bissell Air Force with  its  fleet of U-2s   thumbing noses at the whole earth. To con trol the never-before-controlled, to systema tize messes, in economics as in spying-his  life was made of  such challenges."" The  plan's principal architect was Bissell rather  than the senior Allen Dulles.  Attorney General Robert Kennedy helped  put together $53 million in private humani tarian aid, which the president later gave  Castro  to  rescue  the  1,200 POWs. The  White House even provided the donors with  special tax benefits. (Thus, William Casey's  1985 proposal to create a  tax-free corpora tion for contra contributors had a Kennedy  root.)  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee  held some closed-door hearings, but no new  April 28, 1987  congressional committees were created  to  look into the defeat. Kennedy himself ap pointed an investigative commission includ ing then-retired general Maxwell Taylor as  chairman, Allen Dulles, Robert Kennedy  and Adm. Arleigh Burke, chief of naval op erations. <A similar Reagan board,  instead  of the Tower Commission, would have in cluded Bill Casey, Ed Meese, Adm. James  Watkins and perhaps Gen. Al Haig.)  The Taylor Commission criticized the ad ministration for its decision-making proce dure and the Kennedy ""style of manage ment."" Normal  processes  had  been  by passed. The CIA, like Reagan's National Se curity Council, had gone beyond its mission.  Plans were changed under pressure from  Cuban ~miges. <In Iranscam, Israelis, Arabs  and financiers were variously blamed.)  The Taylor group found that ""top level di rection was given through ad hoc meetings  of senior officials without consideration of  operational plans in writing and with no ar rangement for recording conclusions and de cisions reached."" During operations, serious  misunderstandings among Kennedy and his  advisers became apparent as to what they  had approved. Lacking written records, a 44year-old president is no less liable to confu sion than a 76-year-old is. With some name  changes,  Kennedy's Taylor  Commission  could have written Reagan's Tower report.  Considering the similarities, why has Rea gan's crisis become so deep and protracted?  It is not because Reagan secretly  traded  arms for hostages while publicly promising  not to. Five days before the invasion, Ken nedy played fast and loose with the truth,  asserting ""there will not be, under any con ditions,  an  intervention  in Cuba by  the  United States Armed Forces.""  Nor does  the difference stem from  the  charge that illegalities were committed in  Iranscam. CIA actions in the Bay of Pigs  episode were questionable, and the Neutrali ty Act,  international  law and/or certain  treaties may have been violated.  One difference  is  that Kennedy, unlike  Reagan, consulted the Senate in advance in  the person of Foreign Relations Chairman  William Fulbright, who  lobbied  strongly  against the invasion.  The decisive difference,  though,  is sim pler. Kennedy quickly announced that he  alone was responsible for the failure. That  he privately also criticized ""the experts"" for  giving bad advice does not detract from his  public self-blame.  Sorensen's comment in 1965 says it all:  ""By taking full blame upon himself, he was  winning the admiration of both career serv ants and the public, avoiding partisan inves tigations and attacks, and discouraging fur ther attempts by  those  involved  to  leak  their versions and accusations.""  A few days after the fiasco, Kennedy ex pressed little interest in such exotic topics  as a moon shot. Yet a month later Kennedy  gave  Congress  an  extraordinary  second  State of the Union address, offering solid  proposals  to  strengthen  our  defenses,  capped with a breathtaking plan to land a  man on the moon before the end of the  decade. By refusing to wallow in the Bay of  Pigs, Kennedy cut his losses and advanced  the nation's agenda.  Reagan, unfortunately,  took a different  course. He insisted that he was in the dark  about the facts. He fired two individuals he  said were responsible. He practically invited  Congress to form the panels that have still  not held televised hearings. It took him four  months to admit he was to blame. By then  the damage was done.  ",1987

506,586,8,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President,  I  will shortly yield some time to the dis tinguished Senator from Colorado, but  let me say, in particular to Republican  Members, our Republican leader has  scheduled a conference of Republicans  in room 207 at 4:45. I would say to the  distinguished majority leader that it is  the Republican leader's idea that that  will take no longer than a half-hour.  I might say I did not know that the  distinguished chairman was going to  offer an amendment. I thought it was  going to be rotated and it would be our  turn. He has indicated to me that he  did not know that we had an amend ment on our side. I have since learned  that perhaps the amendment that he  has sent to the desk  is one that we  might have already assumed was part  of his package. I am not sure of that.  Nonetheless, we would  like  a  little  time to look at it.  I might say that I promised to yield  some time to the Senator from Colora do, some time from the resolution, not  in opposition to the amendment.  How much time would the Senator  wish?  ",1987

519,586,8,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, I  just want to take a moment to put one  issue on the RECORD  straight. There  are a lot of things about this budget  that need to be talked about, but in  the moments leading up to the vote  which  just occurred,  an  impression  may have been  inadvertently made  which should not stand unchallenged  even for a matter of a  few minutes  while we are  in recess. That is  the  question of the participation in this  process by the President of the United  States. A casual reader of the RECORD  or someone who might be watching  these proceedings on television might  somehow gain the idea that the Presi dent  is a nonparticipant, that some how he has run away from the budget  process.  I  just want the REcORD  to be clear  that this is not the case at all.  Mr.  Reagan  has  submitted  his  budget. He stands by  it. It is not a  budget which I  think is particularly  admirable. It is a budget which I can  criticize. In fact, Senators will recall  that I have felt free  to criticize the  budget submitted by President Reagan  and his predecessors on many occa sions.  But the notion that somehow he is  not participating  in  the process  is  wrong.  Let me also state for the record that  while there is a  lot about the Presi dent's budget I do not care for, it is a  ",1987
520,612,8,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  there  have been indications of reform in the  Soviet Union over the past 3 months.  Greater openness within  the media  has been permitted. Selected Prisoners  of Conscience have been released, and  emigration  levels  have  picked  up  slightly. Although the changes have  not been dramatic, I strongly encour age the Soviet Government to contin ue implementing them.  The question remains unanswered,  however, whether the Soviet Union is  sincere about  its desire  to promote  glasnost. A group of recently released  Prisoners of Conscience have stated  that reforms have practically grinded  to a halt. Therefore, in order to dem onstrate the validity of the new Soviet  policy, substantial changes in human  rights must occur.  It is  imperative that Soviet refuse niks who desire to practice their reli gion freely in the West be permitted  to emigrate. Among the hundreds of  thousands of  Jews waiting  for exit  visas is Naum Meiman, a political activist who has been denied permission  to leave for over 10 years. Naum is re covering from  the recent loss of his  wife, Inna, and desperately wishes to  live in the West.  I urge  the Soviet Union  Naum Meiman an exit visa.e  to grant  SALUTE TO FATHER PAULSEN   ",1987
521,612,8,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, for more  than 20 years, Father Casimir Paul sen, an American priest of the Mar iannhill Mission, has worked  to  im prove the well-being of the people of  southern Africa. Not a politician, not a  leader of masses, Father Cas-as his  friends call him-has been instead a  soft-spoken  preacher,  a  teacher,  a  counseler,  a healer of  the spirit, a  helper to the poor-in short, a diligent  doer of God's work among individuals  and their families. He has been par ticularly concerned with  the young,  those on whom the future of that tor tured region depends.  Over the years, amid growing injus tice, oppression, and violence, Father  Cas has spoken out against what he  saw as growing evil by man against  man. Suddenly, last December, in the  Transkei, where he had been assigned  since 1978, he was arrested and taken  away. And, as he revealed later, he was  tortured, in a fruitless effort to make  him confess to being party to acts of  resistance  which  the  government  there was and is trying to put down.  The  improper,  cruel detention of  Father Paulsen was protested by many  of us, here and across the country. We  talked, we wrote letters, we explored  whatever  channels  we  could,  we  banged and banged again on the Gov ernment of South Africa. And finally,  after 3 months, Father Cas was re leased, as abruptly as he had been  seized, with no explanation, much less  an apology, just an order of explusion.  Since then, in safer places, Father  Cas has been  recuperating, and  re counting his terrible experiences to his  colleagues and superiors in the church  in Africa  and  in  Europe.  Easter  Sunday he was in Rome and partici pated  in a mass celebrated by  the  Pope. And last week, for the first time  in several years, he returned  to his  native shores. He will soon head back  to his home State of Michigan, to be  with family and friends there and to  celebrate his 25th anniversary in the  priesthood.  At a  recent news conference  that  Senator RIEGLE and I hosted for him,  Father Paulsen discussed his harrow ing experiences and shared his obser vations on  the  terrible  events  that  have been occurring in South Africa.  And he asked me to express to our col leagues his deep appreciation of our  efforts to help gain his freedom. We,  in turn, Mr. President, can thank God  that Father Cas  is  free and  is once  again able  to raise his voice against  the injustice and terror of South Afri ca's racial policies.e  THE THREE PERIODS OF  ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI  e ",1987
522,612,8,Mr. HECHT.," Mr. President,  I will  ask that excerpts from an excellent ar ticle by Mr. Lev Navrozov  entitled  ""Zbigniew Brzezinski's Third Reincar nation,"" be printed  in  the RECORD.  This is a very interesting and well re searched article, and I commend it to  my colleagues. While Zbigniew Brze zinski  has  served  former President  Carter well, he  is also  today saying  some good things in support of Presi dent Reagan's strategic defense initia tive and national security policies.  I  am glad that Zbig is now on the side of  a  tough,  anti-Communist  foreign  policy, and Republicans welcome his  support for President Reagan's efforts  to restore America's strength.  Mr. Lev Navrozov emmigrated from  the Soviet Union  in 1972, and since  then Lev has been one of the most in cisive  analysts of American  foreign  policy.  Lev's article was published  in  the  Winter  issue of Global Affairs. This  journal is a strong new voice in inter national affairs. Global Affairs pro vides the Congress with a realistic per spective on international relations. It  is an outstanding new publication now  in its second year, which provides a  forum for responsible and expert views  on  international  security  affairs.  It  pages are filled with hard facts, realis tic analysis, and not rhetoric. It is pub lished by  the International Security  Council,  an  organization  aimed  at  deepening the public understanding of  the dangers confronting free societies  everywhere. Updates on the Interna tional Security Council's activities are  published in each issue of Global Af fairs. These updates are statements,  signed by seasoned experts on interna tional  relations, who  attended  the  council's  international seminars and  conferences. Global Affairs  is ""must  reading"" in a town filled with publica tions.  I ask that the excerpts from the arti cle be printed in the RECORD.  The excerpts follow:  ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI'S THIRD  REINCARNATION  <By Lev Navrozov)  The books  and  articles  that Zbigniew  Brzezinski published before 1962, between  1964 and 1976, and since 1983 seem to have  been written by three strikingly different  individuals who have never even met to ex change their strikingly different views.  Let us take as an example the treatment  of mainland China.  In his Memoirs of the National Security  Adviser, published in 1983, Brzezinski recalls  how he wrote to President Carter that ""we  would  acknowledge  the Chinese position  [that is, the position of the post-1949 rulers  of mainland China] that there is one China  and that Taiwan is part of it.""

NATIONAL TRADE POLICY.  (a) CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.-The Con gress finds that< 1) the United States is confronted with a  fundamental disequilibrium in its trade and  current account balances and a  rapid  in crease in its net external debt;  (2) such disequilibrium and increase are a  result of numerous factors, including(A) disparities between the macroeconom ic policies of the major trading nations,  <B> the large United States budget deficit,  (C) instabilities and structural defects in  the world monetary system,  <D) the growth of debt throughout the de veloping world;  (E) structural defects in the world trading  system;  <F) governmental distortions and barriers,  (Q) serious inadequacies in United States  trade policy; and  <H> inadequate growth in the productivity  and competitiveness of United States firms  and  industries  relative  to  their overseas  competition.  (3) the continuation of such disequilibri um, coupled with a further accumulation of  external debt, will<A> seriously undermine the United States  economy,  <B> continue, at a faster rate, the already alarming decline in United States industrial  and agricultural competitiveness,  <C> hasten the decline in living standards  of workers and consumers,  (0) increase unemployment, and  <E> bring about, over time, world-wide eco nomic disruptions and stagnation of world  trade, thus jeopardizing the economic secu rity of the free world; and  (4) it is therefore essential, and should be  the highest priority of  the United States  Government, to pursue a broad array of do mestic and international policies to ensure  future  stability  in external  trade of  the  United States and to guarantee the contin ued vitality of the technological, industrial,  and agricultural base of the United States.  (b) NATIONAL POLICY.-lt is the policy of  the United States(!) to reduce substantially the deficits in  the national trade and current accounts;  (2) to seek to achieve, no later than 1992,  a more consistent equilibrium  in such ac counts, allowing only for reasonable fluctua tions during periods of economic expansion  or contraction; and  (3) to maintain, through greater coopera tion and leadership within the international  financial  system,  a  system of  reasonably  stable  exchange  rates,  to  be  effected  through measures designed to ensure that  the value of the dollar remains at a level de signed  to maintain the competitiveness of  United States exports and prevent disrup tive surges in United States imports.  (C) PRESIDENTIAL ACTION.-The President  shall use all appropriate powers to achieve  the national trade policy set forth in subsec tion (b), including< 1) recommending to the Congress appro priate changes in implementing fiscal, regu latory, and general economic policy;  (2) making greater efforts to coordinate  economic  and monetary policy with  the  major trading partners of the United States;  (3) more effectively utilizing trade policy  measures  (including, but not  limited  to,  those authorized under this Act) to expand  markets  for United States exports, disci pline the unfair trade policies of other na tions, and negotiate a more open world trad ing system; and  (4) effecting better management of Third  World debt.  The President shall report to the Congress,  in conjunction with the annual trade policy  agenda statement  required under section  102,  regarding  the progress made, or  the  reasons why no progress was made, during  the year covered by the report in reducing  the United States trade and current account  deficits.

530,755,8,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, I would  not have supported this amendment 3  years ago, but I do today.  I do not believe that trade barriers  are the major reasons for the squeeze  on family  income  in this country in  the last 6 years. I  think the biggest  reasons are irresponsible fiscal policy,  ineffective currency management and  an insufficient commitment to quality  on the part of many American manu facturers. Most of our trade problems,  I think, are made in America. But we  cannot deny the fact that many of our  trading partners have been  running  their economies in ways which impede  world  economic  growth  and  block  trade. They are simply not facing up  to their responsibilities to manage the  world economy as well as their own. It  seems to me we have to react to dem onstrate that they have that obliga tion.  We are not dealing here today with  protectionism. This is a question of al ternative  approaches  to  free  trade.  Some people who believe in virtually  unlimited military  spending  as  a  means of bringing the Soviets to the  bargaining table seem  to  think that  unilateral disarmament is the best ap proach to winning concessions in the  field of  trade. If nothing else,  this  amendment puts this body on record  for a new era of toughness in Ameri can trade negotiations. That action is  a necessary step  toward turning the  corner on family  income, wages and  balanced regional growth and expand ing the world's economy.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge support for  the Gephardt amendment.  ",1987

532,755,8,Mr.  BONIOR  of Michigan.," Mr.  Chairman, I thank my friend, the gen tleman  from Montana,  for  yielding  this time.  Mr. Chairman, over the last 5 years,  the U.S.  trade deficit has  set one  record after another. We have stood  idly by in this Congress and in this  country as factories have closed down  and jobs have been lost.  The bleeding of American industry  must stop. Trade barriers must end.  Behind  the  rhetoric of  the  trade  debate,  the  fact  remains  that  trade  barriers are real and that their effects  on the American economy and Ameri can industry are devastating. In fact,  in the last 6 years over 2 million jobs  have been  lost due  to declining ex ports.  The work ethic in my district and I  am sure in most districts across this  country runs deep. Our workers are  rea,dy  to compete; but high  tariffs,  import quotas, closing of markets, and  bureaucratic  redtape  are  tying  the  hands  of  American  industry  and  American workers.  Vve  can no  longer afford  the ap peasement policies of this administra tion. Last year we were tough on trade  when the deficit was at $148 billion.  Today it is $170 billion. We can afford  to be no less tough.  The Gephardt amendment gives us  the  leverage we need  to open world  markets to American goods. It is the  key  to  letting  the world know  that  America means business.  ",1987

536,755,8,Mr. PURSELL.," Mr. Chairman,  to  better understand  the potential eco nomic impact of the omnibus trade bill  and its amendments on our country, I  consulted  two  leading economists at  the University of Michigan-Dr. Paul  McCracken,  and Edmund Ezra Day  distinguished  university  professor  emeritus of business  administration  economics and public policy, and Dr.  Gardner Ackley, former chairman of  the Council of Economic Advisers to  President Lyndon Johnson.  Mr.  Chairman,  these  respected  economists  had  little  good  to  say  about  the Gephardt amendment.  In  Dr. McCracken's view, it would be to tally  irresponsible of  the U.S. Con gress  to pass  the Gephardt amend ment. To do so, in his opinion, would  create an enormous backlash or prob lems for us internationally because it  simply goes too far.  Dr. Ackley recognized that the clear  purpose of the Ways and Means sec tion of the trade bill, which includes a  watered-down version of the Gephardt  proposal, was  to throttle foreign  im ports. Apart  from  the  renewal  of  GATT authority, he found nothing in  the Ways and Means bill he could sup port and doubted that more  than a  handful of economists would support  its provisions.  Mr. Chairman, one  sector of our  economy which would feel  the back lash of the Gephardt amendment is  agriculture which comprises approxi mately 13 percent of all U.S. exports  and which is one of the few areas of  our economy which consistently shows  a  positive  trade balance. With our  farm-sector  struggling, we  need  to  expand agricultural exports. Yet the  Gephardt  amendment,  if  adopted,  could reduce American agriculture ex ports by as much as 15 percent per  year.  Mr. Chairman, the Gephardt amend ment clearly goes too far and I urge  Members to oppose it.  Mr. Chairman, I  include the corre spondence above  referred  to, as  fol lows:  THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,  Ann Arbor, MI, April 27, 1987.  Hon. CARL D. PuRSELL,  Member of Congress, 361 West Eisenhower  Parkway, Ann Arbor, MI.  DEAR CARL: I enjoyed seeing you the other  night at the Business School dinner. I am  sure that members of the Business School  Faculty and their guests appreciated your  attendance.  You sent me a set of materials on the  trade bill  recently reported by Ways and  Means, and asked for my views.  I am no  expert on the details of trade  legislation,  and/or on particular proposals for amend ing it. But the clear purpose of this proposal  is  to  throttle U.S.  imports. It is strongly  ""protective"" in almost every line.  I don't doubt that there are many individ ual  cases  and  problems where  imports  appear to-and some that clearly do-create  genuine hardship for particular U.S. pro ducers. As a  result firms  lose profits, and  some may go out of business. After all,  many firms cannot meet the prices or the  quality of their domestic competitors, too.  We sympathize with such firms, but we do  not normally subsidize their losses, or tax  their competitors.  I don't know why we  should make an exception to this policy just  because  their competitors are abroad. We  think that free and open domestic markets  benefit all of us. Free and open internation al markets bring about essentially the same  benefits as domestic ones.  Apart from the renewal of GATT author ity, I don't find anything in the Ways and  Means bill that I can support. Incidentally,  I don't think you will  find more  than a  handful of economists who would support  the Ways and Means bill.  Sincerely,  GARDNER AcKLEY.

542,768,8,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in support of H.R. 3, the Trade and Eco nomic Policy Reform Act of 1987. This legisla tion, favorably reported by five committees of  the House with bipartisan support is the most  comprehensive  restructuring  of  basic U.S.  trade policy since the Trade Act of 197 4. The  bill affects virtually every aspect of our basic  trade laws, from trade negotiating authority to  import relief and unfair trade practices to the  structure of executive branch trade functions.  The bill addresses our Nation's need to retrain  our existing work force  to meet the present  challenges and provide the necessary educa tion and  training  to our future work force  to  meet  future challenges  in a changing world  economy.  The bill before us  today strengthens  laws  that protect against unfair foreign trade prac tices  and  establishes  new  procedures  to  ensure that these laws are fully and effectively  enforced. The measure would transfer authority from the President to the Office of the U.S.  Trade Representative  [USTR]  to determine  whether a  foreign  trading practice  is unfair  under the U.S. law and to determine what re medial action to take.  The bill defines additional foreign practices  a:s unfair trade practices subject  to possible  rEltaliatory action: export targeting, government  toleration of cartels that restrict purchases of  U.S. goods, and denial of certain basic work ers' rights.  The bill strengthens provisions  for  tempo rary relief to firms and workers that have been  injured as a result of large  increases  in  im p()rts regardless of whether such  imports re sulted  from unfair trade practices. This relief  can  involve import restrictions or provision of  Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits-includ ing supplemental unemployment benefits, re training aid, and payments for firms.  The bill  increases  the ability of  the U.S.  Government to act against imports that have  an unfair price advantage either through gov ernment subsidization or dumping. Further, the  bill strengthens laws which protect against im ports resulting from  foreign violations of U.S.  trademarks,  patents,  and  copyrights.  The  measure also directs the administration to ne gotiate  the opening of  foreign markets  for  telecommunications equipment and services,  and requires countermeasures to be taken  if  the negotiations are not successful.  The bill takes various steps to promote eco nomic  development  and  help  reduce  the  burden of debt on developing nations, includ in!~ that of Mexico. The measure calls for ne gotiations to set up a new international finan cial  institution which would buy Third World  loans  from private banks at a discount and  then pass that discount on to the debtor na tions. This  is a reasonable  free market ap proach which should be considered by  the  major industrial nations as a means by which  to defuse the international debt bomb.  The bill seeks to expand private investment  in the Third World by authorizing U.S. partici pation in a new World Bank agency that pro vides  long-term guarantees  to private  inves tors, and by expanding the assistance provid ed  to U.S.  firms  investing  in developing na tions by the quasi-governmental Overseas Pri vate Investment Council.  Mr. Chairman,  this section of the bill  is of  gn9at  economic  and  strategic  importance.  First, it provides an opportunity to address the  Third World debt situation  through a  free market approach and hopefully enhance their  economies  thereby  increasing  the  growing  U.S. export markets in those regions. Second,  it provides  for a means by which  to  lift  the  debt burden from the backs of the developing  nations  thus allowing  them  to achieve eco nomic growth and stable market-oriented de mocracies. This  is of grave strategic  impor tance to our Nation.  THE GEPHARDT AMENDMENT  Although I support the committee bill as re ported, I believe we must go further. We must  take a stand with our  trading partners. We  must  tell our  trading partners  that we  favor  fme and open markets, but so  too should  they. The bill as written falls short of this goal.  The Gephardt amendment addresses this void  and for that reason I support it.  Contrary  to  the opponents of  the amend ment,  the Gephardt amendment  is not anti trade, but rather a market opening measure.  The amendment provides that the administra tion identify nations with a huge trade surplus  with the United States. Such a nation would  be defined as one which exports 75 percent  more to the United States than it imports and  which has a pattern of unfair trade practices  that has a significant adverse affect on U.S.  commerce. The administration would be given  a 6-month period in which to reach an agree ment with unwarranted surplus countries that  would  result  in  the elimination of  trade bar riers.  If such negotiations were unsuccessful,  the United States would  retaliate dollar  for  dollar against the value of the unfair trading  practices which  that  country maintains. A  yearly  reevaluation of  the practices of  that  country would occur to determine whether it  has in  fact eliminated  its unfair trading prac tices and whether an excess surplus remains.  If that country fails to eliminate its unfair trad ing practices and still has a huge surplus,  it  would be faced with a bilateral surplus reduc tion requirement of 1 0 percent for each of 4  years.  This amendment provides for negotiations,  it  does  not  unilaterally  impose  retaliatory  measures.  It provides a mechanism  through  which  trade barriers may be removed, but if  our trading partners fail to utilize that mecha nism and ignore our negotiations, we have the  ability to back up our efforts to open markets.  Mr. Chairman, we cannot live with $170 bil lion  trade  deficits or accept our Nation's  status as the world's largest debtor nation. In  1980,  this Nation had a $40 billion surplus.  The fiscal policies of the past 7 years have  dramatically reversed that situation. According  to the Federal Reserve, in order to pay back  the  foreign debt we have accumulated over  that period, we will have to maintain at least a  $50 billion  trade surplus  for many years  to  come. That  is a  far cry  from our position  today. Surely, many factors are to blame for  our present trade deficit-the 1982-83 reces sion,  the massive  budget  deficits  of  the  1980's, and an inflated dollar. But our econo my has recovered, albeit at a lethargic pace.  We have  tightened our  fiscal belts  through  Gramm-Rudman. We have driven  the dollar  down to historic lows, and yet, the trade defi cit persists, long beyond the normal transition  period  necessary  for  fiscal  and monetary  policy  to take effect. We must now address  unfair trade practices.  When  the United States  negotiated  an  agreement with the Japanese on semiconduc tors  last year, many hailed  the accord as a  step  toward  reducing  foreign  trade barriers.  Unfortunately, we  later discovered  that  the  Japanese had no  intention of abiding by the  agreement. This administration, which has so  adamantly opposed  trade  legislation of any  type as protectionist imposed dollar for dollar  tariffs against the Japanese in retaliation. That  was the only way to move toward open mar kets.  I support free  trade. Free  trade and open  markets provide economic growth and em ployment opportunities.  In  the world  trading  system today, we do not have such a system.  We  face barriers  throughout  the world. The  ",1987

544,781,8,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska., I yield to the  gentleman from Texas.  ,1987
545,781,8,Mr. ARMEY.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I would  like  to ex press my disappointment that the gen tleman is not going to offer his amend ment. I understand his reasons,, and I  can appreciate them.  I would  like  to  take a moment  to  point out  the patent  absurdity  of  having this provision in the law. It is  absured to believe that we can eorrect  our balance of payments with a~ trade  bill that shuts down exports when it is  a decline in exports that is primarily  responsible  for  our  balance-of-pay ments problem.  It is  crazy  to shut  down  the development of a  critical  high linkage industry in this economy  when it is our budget deficits, which  could be abated by its expansion that  is such a critical cure of this trade def icit problem to me.  I understand that it is in the a.rea of  trade that we often get the most erro neous and errant legislation because of  its complex problems, but this provi sion in this bill not only betrays good  economics, but betrays the intent and  purpose of the bill.  I wish the gentleman well with his  other efforts, and I hope quite frankly  on the basis of  this provision alone  that this body will defeat the bill.  ",1987
546,781,8,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska., I thank the  gentlemen for speaking in favor of my  position.  ,1987
547,781,8,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Chairman,  I ask  unanimous consent to strike the last  word.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Michigan?  There was no objection.  ",1987
548,781,8,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Chairman, let me  say first of all that on this matter I  am speaking on behalf of myself and  also my distinguished colleague and  good friend, the gentleman from Con necticut  [Mr. McKINNEY],  who  is  unable to be here today.  As  many  Members  know,  Mr.  McKINNEY's efforts  to  prevent  the  export of Alaskan oil date back to the  1970's, and we are the coauthors of the  provisions in section 331.  I must reaffirm my opposition that  has been expressed by this entire Con gress  on  several  occasions,  to  the  export of Alaskan oil. As this Congress  has determined many  times  in  the  past, the export of Alaskan oil is not  in the interests of our national securi ty, it is not in the interests of sound  U.S. energy policy, it is not in the in terests of the American consumer, and  it is not in the interests of the Ameri can worker.  I must object strenuously to any at tempts to exploit loopholes in the cur rent restrictions on the export of Alas kan crude by exporting refined oil in  its place. For that reason section 331  contains  a  prov1s10n  making  the  output of an export refinery-any re finery exporting more than 33 percent  of its output annually-subject to the  restrictions that presently cover crude  oil.  That said, let me clarify that I am  not opposed to the construction of a  refinery in Alaska which can meet the  requirements of section 331. I under stand from press reports that the com pany planning to build a  refinery at  Valdez feels that it can operate within  those  restrictions,  and  I  certainly  would encourage it to investigate that  possibility. But the export of Alaskan  oil must be resisted by this body, as it  has been in the past.  It makes no sense to export Alaskan  oil because such exports would threat en our national security. We are net  importers of oil. Indeed, our dependen cy on foreign oil is increasing at an as tounding rate, up from 27 percent last  year to 33 percent this year. The De partment of Energy estimates we will  import half our oil by 1990. Giving up  our precious and dwindling Alaskan  supplies will further increase our de pendence on unstable sources of foreign oil. It was not so long ago that  the United States was devastated by  an oil embargo, today we watch a vola tile war between Iraq and Iran and  military  escorts  through  the  Suez  Canal. Can anyone doubt  that our  goal must be to limit dependence on  foreign sources of oil as much as possi ble?  Exporting Alaskan  oil makes  no  sense because it can only increase our  astounding trade deficit. It has been  argued that by shipping our precious  raw materials to Japan we can balance  the flood of Japanese finished prod ucts that glut our market. This think ing is  flawed on two accounts. First,  any  oil  exported will  have  to  be  matched by  the  importations of an  equal quantity of foreign oil at higher  prices. Make no mistake about  this,  Mr. YouNG's  amendment  could  in crease the trade deficit by over $700  million.  Second, we cannot let the exploita tion of our natural resources provide a  smoke  screen masking  the  serious  problem underlying our trade inequi ties with Japan. This trade bill creates  real opportunities for American indus try  to  regain  its  competitiveness  abroad, it makes no sense to clutter it  with deficit balancing smoke and mir rors.  Exporting Alaskan  oil makes  no  sense because it hurts the American  worker. Simply put, exporting Alaskan  oil means exporting U.S.  jobs. By en couraging the spending of U.S. dollars  on foreign  flagships and  idling U.S.  flagships, this amendment would fur ther harm an already struggling U.S.  maritime  industry. By diverting oil  trade from  the United States to the  Pacific rim this amendment will also  hurt dock workers up and down our  west coast. Estimates indicate that the  Young  amendment would  cost  the  American worker between 6,000 and  8,000 permanent jobs.  Let me say that I greatly respect the  persistence  of  the gentleman  from  Alaska on this matter, but sadly, Alas ka's gain  in  this  instance would be  America's loss.  ",1987

553,794,8,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Chairman, there  are basically four  issues  in disagree ment between the Banking Commit tee's  title of this bill and the Wylie  substitute. I shall leave one of them to  others to discuss, and I shall attempt  to discuss the three I had perhaps a  hand  in authoring,  the Competitive  Exchange Rate Act, the Council of In dustrial  Competitiveness,  and  the  Third World debt facility, and I shall  try to draw distinctions between our  approach and the approach taken by  the gentleman from Ohio, ",1987
554,794,8,Mr. WYLIE.,"  With respect to the Competitive Ex change Rate Act, first of all, Congress  is not attempting to fix a specific set  of exchange rates. No, what we are ba sically doing is this: we are saying that  the policy the Reagan administration  followed from 1981  through Septem ber of 1985  is wrong. What we are  saying is that if there is an overvalued  dollar that has contributed in a major  way to our trade deficit-and we say  the overvalued dollar has contributed  in a major way to our trade deficit then the U.S. Government, working in  concert and coordination with other  governments,  should attempt  to do  something about that.  Jim Baker  in September of  1985  changed the policy of the Reagan ad ministration. In a sense, what we are  doing is endorsing it. In a sense what  the Wylie substitute does, perhaps un wittingly, perhaps unknowingly, is to  go back earlier to the first 4 years of  the Reagan administration's approach  when  they said  that the overvalued  dollar,  the strong dollar,  is  a  good  thing for the American economy. That  is wrong.  ",1987

557,794,8,Mr. KEMP.," I have been talking with  the gentleman and also with the gen tleman from Ohio [Mr. WYLIE]. Since  the gentleman says we are going back  to the pre-Plaza accord and the gentle man's substitute would endorse  the  target zone of the Plaza and Paris ac cords, how do you do  it, and what is  the target zone?  ",1987
558,794,8,Mr. LAFALCE.," We do not establish  any target zone. We think it is abso lutely  imperative  that  the Treasury  Department have about as much dis cretion as we can possibly give them.  We cannot prescribe that by legisla tion so we give them that discretion,  but we establish what  the policy  is  going to be so that if some new Secre tary of the Treasury comes in, if, for  instance, Beryl Sprinkel, is made Secretary of the Treasury, he cannot go  back  because we  have  established  what the policy is. We leave the imple mentation  to  the Secretary of  the  Treasury.  ",1987
559,794,8,Mr. KEMP., What is the policy?  ,1987
560,794,8,Mr. LAFALCE., The policy is to have  a competitive exchange rate. We leave  that up to the Secretary of the Treas ury to establish.  I am afraid I am going to have tore claim my time because I only have 4  minutes.  ,1987
561,794,8,Mr. KEMP., I realize that. Perhaps it  is not a very important thing.  ,1987
562,794,8,Mr. IJA.,"FALCE. It is a very important  thing. 'We define it in the bill.  With  respect  to  the Third World  debt problem, here again we have a  fundamental difference of approach.  The Reagan administration was basi cally saying to leave this to the magic  of the marketplace, and again, in Sep tember of 1985, Secretary Baker went  to Seoul, Korea. Then he came back  with the Baker plan. But the Baker  plan has gone no place and will go no  place for a good many reasons.  We have to get beyond Baker. One  of the ways we have  to get beyond  Baker :is to recognize that our existing  institutions  such  as  the  IMF have  failed us. Brazil cannot, for political  and soeial reasons, go to IMF.  We also have to realize that we have  to deal with more than new debt as a  way of dealing with the problem of old  debt. TJVe have to deal with the prob lem of old debt directly. What we do  here is not create a new entity. We tell  the Seeretary of the Treasury that he  should negotiate with other countries,  and again we give him a  tremendous  amount of discretion. We simply tell  him to negotiate. We leave the imple mentation up  to him  regarding  the  creation of a Third World debt man agement facility that could do many  things, including facilitating the devel opment  of  the  debt  equity  swap  market and  the development of the  private sector market.  Mr. Chairman, the House omnibus trade bill  includes important provisions that seek to deal  comprehensively with  serious  trade  policy  problems. These initiatives are vital to revers ing the deterioration of our trade position. But,  standing alone, they will not suffice.  We must also  take steps  to  improve  the  competitive environment in which U.S.  indus tries opHrate both at the national and interna tional  level. The banking title provisions con tained  in  H.R.  3 would make  important  progress in this direction. This title would:  Increase the accountability of the adminis tration and the oversight role of the Congress  in  regard  to  the  impact of exchange  rate  policy on the U.S. economy;  CreatH a Council on  Industrial Competitive ness, comprised of representatives from Gov ernment, business,  labor, and public  interest  groups, that would serve as a purely advisory  body  to  focus Government policymaking on  the critical issue of U.S. competitiveness;  Help  restructure  the debt burden of  the  most heavily  indebted developing countries,  thus expanding the world trading system and  increasing U.S. exports  to developing coun tries; and  Increase the flexibility of bank-related export  trading companies  to promote  the export of  U.S.-produced goods and services.  The continuing rapid fluctuations in  the ex change rate situation underscore the need for  a mechanism  through which a coherent ex change rate policy can be formulated and sus tained. The Competitive Exchange Rate Act  does not require the administration to achieve  a specific exchange  rate.  It simply  requires  that  the administration have a policy  that  it  must defend to the Congress in the context of  other economic policy choices.  The bill achieves this by creating a structure  of  accountability  regarding  exchange  rate  issues.  It requires the Secretary of the Treas ury to report semiannually to the Congress on  the impact of exchange rate policy on the U.S.  economy. This report is analogous to that on  monetary policy of the Chairman of the Feder al Reserve under the Full Emloyment and Bal anced Growth Act.  That detailed and frank discussion of policy  on a regular prompt basis has elevated  the  political debate surrounding monetary policy.  The Congress must make decisions on such  issues as  the budget deficit  that have an  effect on exchange  rate policy all  the  time.  With a better understanding of the trade-offs  involved and an explicit statement by the ad ministration of its recommendations, Congress  and the public could more effectively debate  alternatives.  In addition, the  legislation requires the ad ministration to continue the thrust of its more  recent efforts in regard to the international co ordination of macroeconomic policy;  interna tional coordination of participation in currency  market; and  the pursuit of bilateral negotia tions with countries which peg their currencies  to the dollar, thus maintaining an unfair com petitive advantage. We cannot risk  return  to  the situation characteristic in earlier years of  this administration  in which currency  imbal ances and fluctuations undercut the competi tiveness or threatened the stability of the U.S.  economy while our Government  looked on  with benign neglect.  The Council on  Industrial Competitiveness  Act would help to rise competitiveness issues  to  the  top of our national agenda. No high  level forum now exists in which key actors in  our economy can deliberate together to offer  advice  regarding economic policies  that will  positively enhance our competitive position.  In the past few years, dozens of reports on  the  long-term competitiveness of  the Ameri can economy, including that of the President's  own Commission on  Industrial Competitive ness, have concluded that we need an institu tional mechanism to focus attention on com petitiveness issues in  the policymaking proc ess and develop a consensus regarding Gov ernment policies affecting industry. The coun cil would be precisely such a mechanism.  The council would function solely as an ad visory body, but it would be a significant step  in increasing the focus throughout our econo my on methods of enhancing our competitive  ",1987

565,807,8,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the Olin amendment.  With section 662 we are not chang ing farm policy. We are injecting fair ness  into the dairy policy. What we  called for in the farm bill of 1985 was  not an automatic cut in the price sup port in January of 1988, but the possi bility of a cut, if the surplus still ex ceeded 5 billion pounds.  Every region of the country, except  California, brought production levels  down. It is unfair to the producers in  those other regions  to  take an addi tional price support cut when  they  have met the requirements of the law.  Furthermore, we would be under the  5 billion pound trigger if we did not  have significant casein  imports. But  every producer across the country will  take a price support cut due to some thing-casein  imports-which  they  have no control over.  I do not see the gentleman from Vir ginia  [Mr. OLIN]  recommending an  elimination  of  the  discrepancy  be tween price supports from one region  to another; but it would save us a lot  more money if we would do that.  Instead, we in the Midwest who al ready have a lower price support than  Virginia are being asked to take it on  the chin and let the rest of the regions  get off with a much higher price sup port.  The fairness issue is what is involved  here. The Olin amendment would lead  to an additional price cut in those re gions that have met the requirements  of  the 1985  farm bill  to reduce  the  dairy surplus. That isn't fair. The Olin  amendment should be defeated.  ",1987

568,807,8,Mr. SCHUETTE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the gentleman from Vermont  [Mr.  JEFFORDS]  for yielding me  this  time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Olin amendment, and  in strong  support for the Jeffords language in cluded in H.R. 3 for four facts.  Fact one, the committee amendment  would merely require the Secretary of  Agriculture  to take into account the  amount of casein imports when calcu lating future dairy price support re ductions.  D 1720  That is one fact. Second fact: The  European Community  subsidizes  its  own casein industry to the detriment  of the American dairy farmer.  Third, the American dairy farmers  are in compliance with the 1985 farm  bill. They play by the rules. But no,  foreign casein  imports, foreign dairy  producers  bend  the  rules  and  the  losers are the American dairy farmers.  Fact No. 4: So the imports of casein  into our country displace our domestic  market to the detriment of the Ameri can dairy farmers; it is our responsibil ity, Congress' responsibility,  to  take  action and to remedy that imbalance.  That is why we should adhere to the  Jeffords language in the bill and vote  ""no"" on the Olin amendment.  ",1987

570,807,8,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in support of the Olin amendment  and hopefully we will not rewrite the  farm bill in a trade bill, but we will do  it when we  thoughtfully look at the  Dairy Program.  ",1987
571,807,8,Mr. OLIN.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 1  minute to tlhe gentleman from Arizona  [Mr. KOLBE].  ",1987
572,807,8,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the amendment offered by  Mr. OLIN to strike section 662 of H.R.  3, a provision allowing the USDA to  subtract casein imports when calculat ing the dairy surplus. If enacted, sec tion 662 would prevent a 50-cent re duction  in  the  dairy  price-support  level from going into effect.  This body recognized the problems  inherent in the Dairy Price Support  Program when it established the sup port reduction privision  in  the farm  bill. This was designed as a followup to  the chaotic Dairy Buyout Program. To  deny this reduction now is to fly in the  face of an agreement that was reached  in the 1985 farm bill.  Promises were made in the last Con gress, Mr. Chairman. The dairy indus try got the Whole Herd Buyout Pro gram when it accepted the prospect of  a reduction in the support price level  if purchases of surplus products  re mained high after  the buyout. The  levels of surplus are still unacceptably  high. Congress should not now turna round and tell the cattle industry and  others that a deal made last year is  null and voi.d now.  Section 662 is a poorly conceived so lution  to whatever problem  is  per ceived because of casein imports. Cer tainly decisions about agriculture price  supports should be made  in agricul ture legislation, not hidden behind the  pretense of trade. And with the Uru guay GATT negotiation coming up  shortly,  the  relationship  between  casein and the ""ills"" of the dairy in dustry  can  certainly better be  ad dressed at that time.  But trade is not at the heart of this  issue. The issue is the anxiety in the  dairy  industry  about  being weaned  even  slightly  from  their price  sup ports. I understand that anxiety, but  the evidence is clear. The supports as  constructed are insensitive to market  constraints, they are damaging to the  consumer as well as related industries,  and they result in massive over sup plies of dairy commodities.  The plan outlined in the farm bill  was designed to reduce the dairy sur plus in the most sensitive way possible.  But the problems are real, and real so lutions are what is needed, not delays  or evasions. It may be a bitter pill for  them  -to  swallow-but  sometimes  what's good for us doesn't always taste  so good. It would be impossible to con struct an argument to say that the 50cent reduction in price supports could  do any serious harm to the industry.  If we don't stick with the farm bill  agreement and lower price supports,  then it's possible that another supply  adjustment program will be needed.  That is the worst possible answer to  surplus  commodity  problems.  The  pain of price support cuts to industry  pales in comparison to the pain experi enced by other industries as a result of  the buyout.  According to the Farm Bureau, the  supply and demand imbalance  is  im proving as a result of the Buyout Pro gram. This is therefore the worst time  for Congress to send the false signal to  dairy producers  to  increase produc tion. The signal we should be sending  is for the dairy producer to decrease  production as the free market would if  it were allowed to operate unencum bered.  ",1987
573,807,8,Mr.  JEFFORDS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York [Mr. MARTIN].  Mr. MARTIN of New York. I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, I  think part of the tragedy in today's ac tivities in the passage of the Gephardt  amendment  is  going  to mean  an  almost certain veto. We need a piece of  trade  legislation,  that goes without  question. I far prefer the original ver sion.  One of the reasons is that the provi sion that the Agriculture Committee,  Mr.  JEFFORDS, placed  in here.  Infer ences were made that  this does not  belong in a  trade bill. Let us keep in  ",1987
574,820,8,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Chairman,  while the Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology did not report any provisions for  H.R. 3,  the  trade bill, many of the programs  within  the  committee's  jurisdiction  have  a  major bearing on the degree of U.S. competi tiveness  in world markets. The committee  is  holding hearings  this week which  focus on  several  bills affecting U.S. competitiveness  which have been referred to the committee or  drafted by committee members. Potentially,  each of these bills could fit within the frame work of H.R. 3, should the Senate choose to  legislate in  these areas.  In  that event, these  hearings will help develop a House position  for a conference committee. Alternatively the  hearings will determine  if  it makes sense  to  report some of these bills either individually or  collectively as a Science Committee competi tiveness initiative. The specifics of the bills are  described below as part of a day-of-day de scription of what the committee plans to ac complish in these hearings.  APRIL 28-THE !ROLE OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU  OF STANDARDS lNBS] IN COMPETITIVENESS  Senator Holl:ings and Congressman Ritter  have both written bills which would com bine the NBS and the Office of Productivi ty, Technology and Innovation <OPTD into  a single more powerful component of the  Department of Commerce that aggressively  promotes U.S.  industry  use  of  advanced  technologies such as automated manufac turing. Yesterday, witnesses discussed  the  appropriatenes,s of such a role for the NBS  as well as the desirability of permitting the  Federal Government  to branch  into  this  area which ha:> been traditionally reserved  for the private sector. Other aspects of the  Hollings competitiveness bill were consid ered as well. Witnesses also  advocated a  major  increase, perhaps even a  doubling  over a five year period, in the NBS budget  for current programs. This would permit  NBS to provide additional calibration serv ices and standard  reference materials,  to  verify the accuracy of engineering data and  provide the verified data on line, and to es tablish the capability to help create a meas urement base for emerging industries, such  as biotechnology, advanced materials and  fiber  optics. Witnesses  also  called  for  a  quadrupling of  the Director's Competence  Fund which allows NBS to do basic research  that  leads  to  the competence  to develop  more precise  standards. Clearly  there  is  broad interest in strengthening this crucial  but badly neglEcted agency whose standards  work often underpins the competitiveness of  American industry.  The Committee also considered my bill,  H.R. 1965, which amends the 1976 Metric  Act. This bill would require most govern ment programs and procurements to be run  in metric. Of particular concern to the com mittee is whether the continued U.S. use of  the English system of measurement is plac ing American small business at a competi tive disadvanta:5e in a world market which is  almost entirely metric outside  the bound aries of the United States.  APRIL  29-REORGANIZATION OF  THE  FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT  REGARDING  INDUSTRIAL  RE SEARCH AND m;:VELOPMENT  This morning,  the Committee examined  the Federal Government's capability of pro viding research funds  to  industries which  are  competitively  disadvantaged without  picking winners and losers among specific  technologies and companies. My National  Policy  and Technology Foundation  bill,  H.R. 2165 and Department of Science and  Technology bill, H.R. 2164 were considered.  Both bills would create foundations which  could give research grants to develop fur ther promising discoveries which may be im portant to specific industries. Both agencies  would  have  the  information  gathering  policy, and coordination functions generally  associated with the Japanese agency MITI.  The semiconductor industry was then dis cussed as an example of how these agencies  might  function  in practice, and  to probe  whether the appropriate federal role should  be geared  towards basic research or some  point further along the development path.  Mr. Valentine's bill to create a National Ad visory Commission on Semiconductors <H.R.  2191) was also considered. Witnesses includ ed representatives of the semiconductor in dustry and academia who are interested in  the competitiveness of  the semiconductor  industry. The General Counsel of the De partment of Commerce also presented testi mony on Administration proposals concern ing competitiveness,  including  the  recent  Executive Order implementing the Technol ogy Transfer Act of 1986.  APRIL  30-TECHNOLOGY  TRANSFER,  GOVERN MENT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMPETI TIVENESS  Proposed changes in technology transfer  and intellectual property laws are being pro moted to improve competitiveness. Tomor row,  legislation by Congressmen Boehlert  and MacKay promoting the use by Ameri can companies of  the research  results of  government-funded research will be consid ered as a method of getting American indus try interested in the best ideas of our uni versities. A second piece of  legislation  to  promote domestic  technology transfer will  be presented by its Senate sponsor, Senator  Dale Bumpers; the chief House sponsor is  the Honorable Claudine Schneider. The  President's Science Advisor will  testify on  new Administration initiatives that are re lated to the transfer of government inven tions and innovations to the private sector  and the collection and dissemination of for eign scientific and technical literature.  In the government patent field, the Com mittee will consider making patent rights  available to all companies running govern ment owned/contractor operated laborato ries. The Committee will examine whether  there is any reason to treat GOCO's operat ed by big businesses differently from others  since the benefits of licensing these patents  accrue to the laboratories rather than the  parent companies. The General Counsel of  the Department of Energy has been  re quested to testify about how his department  plans to implement the recently promulgat ed  federal  regulations.  Various  private  sector witnesses will then comment on the  day's proposal.  Mr. Chairman, it is clear that the Committee  on Science, Space, and Technology has much  to add to the solution to our competitiveness  problems,  to a  large extent building on our  work in this area of the last decade. We stand  ready to contribute our expertise as appropri ate both  in  the subsequent development of  this  legislation and  in  future  legislative  initia tives during the 1 OOth Congress.  ",1987
575,820,8,Mr.  BRYANT.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly  the Committee  rose;  and  the Speaker pro  tempore <Mr.  McMILLEN  of Maryland) having  as sumed  the  chair, Mr.  BEILENSON,  Chairman of  the Committee of  the  Whole House on  the State of  the  Union, reported that that Committee,  having had under consideration  the  bill <H.R. 3) to enhance the competi tiveness of American industry, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolu tion thereon.  COMMUNICATION  FROM  THE  CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMIT TEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS  The SPEAKER pro  tempore  laid  before the House the following com munication from the chairman of the  Committee  on  Veterans'  Affairs,  which was read, and, without objec tion, referred to the Committee on Ap propriations.  ",1987
576,846,8,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  introduce  legislation  to  reform  the Davis Bacon Act. This proposal is the result of many  months of careful study by the Subcommittee  on Labor Standards of comments and com plaints that have been brought to our attention  during my term as chairman.  As many of my  colleagues will  recall,  I  made a commitment during the last Congress  to take up this issue and study the effects of  Federal construction prevailing wage law. I am  an individual who takes my promises very seri ously. Since  last August, when  the Davis Bacon amendment to the armed services bill  offered by Mr. HAWKINS and myself passed  the House overwhelmingly, I have held sever al hearings. We have carefully reviewed  the  record of those hearings as well as proceed ing  in other committees which  relate  to  this  subject.  The amendments to the act that I am intro ducing today will eliminate problems identified  with  the  application  of  the  act  to  small  projects as well as answer criticism about en forcement.  To those who in good faith have urged that  the Davis-Bacon Act be updated, I believe this  April 29, 1987  measure will be welcome news. To  those  whose support  for Davis-Bacon  reform has  been a Trojan horse approach  to abolishing  the act, I am quite certain this measure will be  a disappointment. The  committee  believes  very strongly in the continuing need for statu tory minimum  labor standards protection  for  American workers.  A free market economy is not a free for all.  There are basic rules which govern the rela tionship between employers and their employ ees. Those basic  legal protections are as  timely today as they were when they were en acted. The  idea  that market  forces  alone  should control  fundamental matters such as  minimum or prevailing wages,  occupational  safety and health or for that matter, even with  respect to investors under our securities laws,  is certainly a  failed notion whose  time has  come and gone. Last year's vote on Davis Bacon and this week's vote on  trade regula tion would seem  to  indicate that the majority  of this body and the American people under stand the need for continued government in volvement  to  insure  fair competition  in our  economy.  Last year, the Members spoke very strongly  in favor of raising the threshold for application  of  the Davis-Bacon Act. An  increase  in  the  threshold  to $25,000 for military construction  and military housing passed  the House by a  vote of 406 to 5. My bill will take the threshold  for new construction to $50,000 which is twice  as high as  the measure which passed  the  House on August 15, 1986. I believe that this  proposal which raises the threshold 25 times  its present level will provide a fair and realistic  procurement exemption for small projects.  This bill acknowledges  the differences be tween new construction and repair work. We  have set a  threshold  level of $15,000  for  repair, alteration,  renovation,  reconstruction,  or rehabilitation. This is a sevenfold increase  in  the present  threshold yet still  recognizes  the fact that repair work is more often award ed under small contracts and  is much more  susceptible  to  fragmentation of projects  into  even smaller contracts  to avoid  the  require ments of the act.  Along with our adjustment in  the threshold  we have undertaken a comprehensive revision  of the act. Despite strong judicial or adminis trative precedent  interpreting  various provi sions, we have encountered a number of situ ations where disputes have arisen between  granting  agencies  and  the Department  of  Labor on how the act should be applied or en forced. This Davis-Bacon  reform bill codifies  the authority presently vested in the Secretary  of Labor pursuant to Executive order. Clarifi cation of administrative authority, streamlined  enforcement mechanisms, more  timely wage  determinations  and  other  improvements  should go a long way to improving administra tion of the act. A comprehensive reform of the  act will free all of us from the annual attempts  to attach Davis-Bacon amendments  to de fense, transportation or other vital legislation. I  believe  this measure accomplishes  the dual  objectives of providing greater  flexibility  to  granting agencies as well as continued protec tion for workers.  Included  in  the RECORD  following my  re marks is a section-by-section analysis of this  ",1987
577,859,8,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, as many Mem bers know, the month of May has been desig nated as ""Older Americans Month."" There are  an estimated 29 million senior citizens 65 or  over, more than one out of every ten Ameri cans, with the numbers growing everyday. Our  older Americans have contributed many years  of service to their families, their communities,  and  the Nation, representing  the bulk of our  wealth of knowledge and experience. During  May, we should acknowledge our older Ameri cans  for  their accomplishments and dedica tion with appropriate programs, ceremonies,  and activities. But we should not stop here.  We should provide  them with quality health  care programs, adequate social security bene fits, and sufficient social services programs.  Protecting the life-savings of our senior citi zens from  the high medical costs associated  with catastrophic illnesses must be a top pri ority of the 1 OOth Congress. During the month  of May we should rededicate ourselves to ef forts to enact comprehensive health coverage  for our senior citizens which will protect the  savings  they  have accumulated  over  their  working lives. The Ways and Means Commit tee's Health Subcommittee recent approval of  a package of significantly expanded Medicare  benefits for victims of catastrophic illnesses is  a positive step toward reaching this goal. But  must also consider subsidizing other major ex penses not covered under Medicare, including  nursing home care and prescription drugs.  Congress must also have certain  that we  provide sufficient social services to the elder ly,  including meals-on-wheels, adult day care,  senior citizens centers,  legal services, pre-re tirement counseling and  transportation. The  Olders Americans Act of 1965 has provided  these services  to our senior citizens to help  enable  them  to adapt  to  the  rising cost of  living. In 1987, a total of $1.38 billion was au thorized, with $976 million going  for social  services and nutrition. Congress will be asked  this session to reauthorize the immensely pop ular Older Americans Act for 4 years at levels  5 percent above  fiscal 1987  levels. Also  in cluded  in  this  legislation  is a provision  that  persons with Alzheimer's disease and  their  families to be among those eligible to receive  the new in home services for the frail elderly.  This would help our senior citizens meet their  financial  burdens while  coping  with  their  trauma at home with  their  loved ones. And  while Congress is working to ensure the avail ability of low-income housing for the poor, we  should see  to  it  that affordable housing  is  available to all senior citizens.  Despite the continued build up of the Social  Security Trust Fund reserves, legislative action  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  must be taken to safeguard against future dis investment of Social Security Trust Funds for  purposes not outlined  in  the Social Security  Act. The Social Security Program was de signed in 1935 to replace income lost due to  retirement, disability, unemployment or death.  We must ensure that the Social Security Fund  is used for  its intended purpose. Many older  Americans rely on  their social security check  as their only source of income. It is therefore  our duty  to ensure  that  these savings are  available to them.  I have outlined just a few concerns of our  older Americans which must be addressed by  Congress. Along with  the  invaluable assist ance of my Senior Advisory Committee, I have  worked to address these and other issues of  concerns of my older constituents. We must  direct our energy  to meet the needs of our  seniors  in order  that  these Americans can  continue  to play an active role  in  the life of  the Nation.  INVADING THE PRESIDENT'S  RIGHT TO CONTROL TREATIES  HON. JIM COURTER  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 29, 1987  ",1987
578,859,8,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Speaker, Bruce Fein  has published an article  in  the Washington  Times pointing out that the House of Repre sentatives has no constitutional ground on  which to assert control over the Executive au thority over treaties.  I highly recommend  this  article to remind Members of the limits of our  powers.  It has never been quite clear what this ad ministration thinks  it is doing by downplaying  its exclusive  right  to control,  interpret, and  where  necessary  terminate  participation  in  treaties. What is certain is that if these excu tive prerogatives are not reasserted periodical ly by the administration, the House of Repre sentatives  and  the  Senate will  gradually  assume  them by a kind of squatters'  right.  And as harmful and dangerous as  it  is  for  Congress  to claim power over  treaties,  the  danger to  the conduct of successful  foreign  policy  is  increased by an administration  too  paralyzed  to protect  its  rights against Con gress. Worse yet when the same administra tion is the one that says it takes seriously the  original intent of the Constitution.  INVADING REAGAN'S TREATY TURF  Time is out of joint. The Constitution ex plicitly denies the House of Representatives  any role  in the formation of treaties. Yet  House Speaker Jim Wright, Democrat of  Texas, recently headed a congressional dele gation to Moscow to meet and confer with  Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on arms  control.  Glowing with optimism after the consulta tions and voicing hopes that defense spend ing would be slashed if arms control agree ments were concluded, Mr. Wright appeared  on national television  to communicate his  views on Soviet-U.S. relations.  Mr. Wright,  however did not  stop  at  words. Last Friday, he ramrodded through  the House of Representatives a supplemen tal appropriations bill by a vote of 208-178  that would  compel President Reagan  to  10609  comply with the unratified SALT II treaty  regarding numerical limits on nuclear weap ons and two nuclear test ban agreements.  Mr. Wright declared he had secured an un derstanding with Mr. Gorbachev that the  U.S.S.R. would likewise adhere to the nu merical nuclear weapons limits of SALT II.  Waiting  in  the wings  is undoubtedly a  House bill that would exploit the power of  the purse to compel the president to inter pret the 1972 ABM treaty with the Soviet  Union  to preclude the testing in space of  President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initia tive technology based on new physical prin ciples.  These constitutional frolics of the House  of Representatives into the forbidden  ter rain of treaty-making authority portends a  wholesale  clash with  the President  and  Senate over the role of the House  in the  forging of  foreign  and national  security  policy. The power of the purse does not in variably trump other constitutional prerog atives.  The Constitution empowers the president  to make treaties, with the advice and con sent of  two-thirds of  the senators voting.  John Jay, in ""Federalist 64,"" explained that  the  important  treaty-making power, espe cially as it relates to war or peace, was en trusted  to the president and the senators  because they possessed a longevity of office,  knowledge of foreign affairs, and a capacity  for continuity of policy that is indispensable  to success in making treaties.  The president was endowed with exclusive  negotiating authority to ensure the secrecy  and dispatch essential to exploiting oppor tunities in the negotiating process.  The House of Representatives, on  the  other hand, was excluded from the treaty making process. Its ""fluctuating and multi tudinuous composition,"" Alexander Hamil ton observed in ""Federalist 75,"" was incom patible with the qualities necessary for ex ercising treaty-making responsibilities: com prehensive knowledge of foreign politics; a  firm  and  systematic  adherence  to  long range goals; an unyielding defense of na tional dignity; and decisiveness.  Mr. Hamilton's view was shared by Alexis  de Tocqueville, who noted 150 years ago  that democratic institutions with numerous  members are generally inept in foreign af fairs because of a propensity  to obey mo mentary passions and to insist on immediate  results.  The House appropriations bill that would  give long-moribund portions of SALT II the  status of law nicely demonstrates why the  House of Representatives was fenced off by  the Constitution  from  the  treaty-making  process.  1. Lack of comprehensive knowledge of  foreign affairs:  The vast majority of the House members  are  foreign-policy amateurs. They devote  most of their cerebral time and energy to  satisfying parochial constituent needs and  planning re-election campaigns at two-year  intervals. These tasks representatives gener ally perform with virtuosity.  In contrast, most representatives are un schooled in the intricacies and evolution of  foreign-policy or national-security measures.  Their votes on these matters reflect more  feelings of the heart than sober judgments  of the head. The House appropriations vote  on SALT II reflects a natural yearning for  hopes and symbols of international peace,  but neglects the unsentimental realities of  Soviet behavior.  The bill denies  the president  funds  to  deploy strategic nuclear weapons in excess  ",1987

DAVID DREIER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 29, 1987  ",1987
580,872,8,Mr. DREIER of California.," Mr. Speaker, we  often wish we could run the Federal Govern ment in a more business-like manner, that we  could adopt some of the same approaches to  cost control that private industry uses. Today I  am  introducing  legislation  to promote wider  use of one such approach, value engineering,  in Federal construction and procurement.  Value engineering is a management tool de veloped by General Electric over 40 year ago  which seeks  to systematically eliminate un necessary costs  in manufacturing and con struction. The value engineer's role is to care fully study existing plans for any potential im provements which would lead to savings with out reducing quality. The process of value en gineering has been likened to a doctor giving  a second opinion, but  it  is much more  than  that. The value engineer is an expert in mate rials, standards, and processes, and can pro vide insights which may escape the best build er or design engineer.  The  technique has already provided great  savings within  the Federal Government.  In  fact,  the Department of Defense estimated  that it saved over $300 million in 1985 through  limited use of value engineering reviews. GAO  has completed numerous favorable reports on  value engineering over the past 1 0 years, con cluding that every dollar spent on this process  yields an average savings of $10.  My bill would create a Value Engineering  Council  appointed  to  identify Federal  pro grams which might benefit most from utilizing  the process. Saving money  is a bipartisan  issue, and  the 16-member council would be  bipartisan, as well, with no more  than  10  members from the same party serving.  Value engineering is a proven money-saving  technique whose wider use  throughout  the  Federal Government will yield great savings.  Mr. Speaker, we are always seeking the most  painless routes to deficit reduction-the better  management that value engineering could pro vide is an outstanding opportunity to achieve  such responsible savings.

Washington arrived at Federal Hall  dressed in a dark brown coat and knee  breeches with metal buttons embossed  with eagles, white  stockings, and a  steel-hilted sword.

Vice President  John Adams led him to the chair. The  Senate and Adams, its President, were  arrayed on Washington's  right,  the  House and  its Speaker on his  left.  Washington then stepped out onto a  balcony and acknowledged the shouts  from the crowd below with a bow. He  laid his hand upon the Bible, solemnly  repeated the oath administered by the  chancellor of the State of New York,  Robert Livingston, and bending rever ently,  kissed  the  book.  Livingston  stepped forward and raising his hand,  cried, ""Long live George Washington,  President of the United States!"" On  that  note,  cannons  pounded,  bells  the  three cheers erupted  rang, and  crowd.  Washington returned to the Senate  Chamber and read his inaugural ad dress  to a  standing Congress. After wards there was a grand walking pro cession to St. Paul's chapel for pray ers.  The Senate  resumed  business  after the service, appointed a commit tee to draft a  reply to Washington's  address, and adjourned. That night  New York was illuminated with bon fires making the end of an auspicious,  exciting day.  IRAN/NICARAGUA  COMMITTEE  HEARINGS TO BE TELEVISED  ON CHANNEL 13  ",1987
582,885,8,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased  to announce  that at the re quest of  the  two chairmen, Senator  INOUYE and Congressman HAMILTON, I  have  authorized  on  behalf  of  the  Senate that the public hearings of the  Senate Select Committee on Secret  Military Assistance  to  Iran and  the  Nicaraguan Opposition and the House  Select  Committee  to  Investigate  Covert Arms Transactions with Iran  be broadcast live on the closed circuit  congressional cable system. These pro ceedings will be carried on channel 13.  I  am  informed  that Congressman  RosE has made a similar authorization  on behalf of the House.  I hope that this will permit Senators  and staff  to keep  informed on  the  events as they occur during these im portant hearings.  TRIBUTE TO AMERICA  REMEMBERS CAMPAIGN  ",1987
583,885,8,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I would  like to share a very special story with  my distinguished colleagues  today; a  story about one man who has touched  the lives of tens of thousands of Amer icans;  a  special group of Americans  who  live  and  work  overseas-our  armed services personnel.  Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to pay  very special tribute to an organization,  the America Remembers Campaign,  and  its  founder, Don Grimes, who  brings joy and happiness to these tens  of  thousands of military servicemen  and women stationed overseas.  The America Remembers Campaign  is a 4-year-old project that publicizes  the addresses of U.S. military units  throughout the world and encourages  Americans to write to these overseas  servicemen  and women  during  the  Christmas season.  The holiday season is a difficult time  for our overseas service people. Many  of them are quite young-only 18 or 19  years old-and have never spent much  time away from home. The cards and  letters that they receive from our Na tion's  citizens  truly  tell  them  that  America  remembers;  that Americans  ",1987
584,898,8,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing legislation intended to  provide new incentives for commercial  banks and debtor countries to resolve  the international debt problem. Unless  we breathe new life into the negotiat ing process between debtors and credi tors, we risk having the debt problem  become a permanent plague on  the  world economy.  We can ill afford such a stalemate. It  is contrary  to our political  interests  that most Latin economies are smaller  now than they were prior to the debt  crisis in 1982. Our financial system is  strained by heavy bank exposure  to  troubled debtors. Despite 5 years of  capital building, aggregate exposure of  our largest banks to Latin debtors is  still larger than their total capital.  Most worrisome  is  the continuing  impact of  the debt problem on U.S.  trade. U.S. exports to Latin America  are more than $10 billion below their  level  in 1981,  representing a  loss of  roughly a quarter-million jobs in U.S.  export  industries. Total U.S.  trade  with Latin America has gone  from  rough balance in 1981  to an accumu lated deficit of $78 billion over the last  5 years. There will be no relief for U.S.  exporters until sustainable economic  growth  is  restored  in Latin America  and these economies can service their  debt without running large trade sur pluses.  The question of course is how best to  promote debtor recovery. In redefining  the U.S. debt strategy in 1985, Secre tary Baker focused on growth as the  key  to  recovery based on economic  reform by each debtor country and  supported by new  funds  from  their  creditors. This growth  focus was  a  breath of fresh air that unfortunately  has now gone a little stale. Economic  growth and policy  reform  in debtor  countries have been erratic and ar ranging new bank loans  is becoming  increasingly difficult.  It is appealing to think that we can  overcome  the debtor-creditor  logjam  with a new and simpler approach to  debt. It has been suggested that we  create a debt facility to buy out the  banks  or  build  a wall  of  reserves  around the banks so that we need not  worry about the debt problem. These  approaches are simple and direct but  will not solve the problem.  Debt relief offers limited promise of  economic reform or recovery, at a high  cost to taxpayers. A plan focused only  on bank capital may appear  to  im prove bank safety but does so by sacri ficing  already  tenuous  relations be tween banks and debtors that are the  key to the health of the debtors and  bank portfolios alike.  The debt problem will only be  re solved through continued negotiation  and  accommodation by  the debtors  and their creditors. We must encour age this process by providing stronger  incentives  through  the  regulatory  system-a regulatory carrot and stick.  This would involve greater differentia tion of country risk by regulators cou pled with measures to support coun tries  that are coming  to grips with  their debt problems while  increasing  bank capital requirements in the case  of  exposure  to  countries  that  are  moving toward insolvency.  This approach implies a more activ ist role for the regulators in differenti ating country risk and in influencing  bank capital and reserve policies. Cur rent practice is to categorize country  exposure as other transfer risk prob lems or substandard, but to take no  other action with regard to the loans.  My approach would have  regulators  distinguish  significant  repayments  risks in countries unable or unwilling  to  undertake  policy  reforms  and  moving toward insolvency from good  loans  to countries  implementing  re forms  and  self-help measures  and  working with their creditors.  For good performers and their credi tors, regulators would affirm the col lectibility of that debt, take no action  with regard to bank capital, and pro vide  the widest possible support for  debt-equity conversions and efforts to  provide a breather on debt service con sistent with bank safety and sound ness.  For  poor  performers  and  their  banks,  regulators would ensure  that  the higher risk of exposure to these  countries is reflected in bank capital  and reserve positions. This would be  above and beyond any special reserves  for value impaired countries.  This proposal would encourage con tinued debtor-creditor cooperation and  a greater range of options in formulat ing financing packages. To the extent  that  debt-equity  swaps  and  other  modest debt-service  reducing options  are added to the equation, the chances  of success are enhanced. I urge my col leagues  to  support  this  reasonable  plan  that  avoids  sending  the  false  signal to debtors that congressionally  mandated debt  relief or debt write downs will solve their economic prob lems.e  By Mr. SYMMS <for himself and  Mr. BYRD):  S.J.

587,924,8,Mr. BRYANT.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  1 minute to the gentleman from Mary land [Mr. McMILLEN].  Mr. McMILLEN of Maryland. Mr.  Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by my colleague,  the gentleman from New York.  Earlier this year I attended a meet ing held by my colleague from Califor nia, Mr. DoRNAN. At this meeting, an  internal high level Japanese Govern ment memo was brought to our atten tion. This memo stated that Japanese  investment in the United States will  be targeted to congressional districts  where it would result in the most po litical benefits. Such political benefits  include PAC contributions  to  influ ence elections, the rallying of workers  employed by foreign investors to polit ical causes, and the use of direct and  portfolio investment to influence the  American political process.  Mr. Chairman, it is obvious that the  Japanese and other foreign  investors  plan to use  their dollars from  trade  surpluses to gain as much leverage in  this country's decisionmaking as possi ble. In a report from the Special Trade  Representatives Office, over $30 bil lion in foreign capital inflows are un accounted for by present disclosure re quirements. These funds could be for eign investors developing excessive in fluence  in our political process, drug  money, or flight capital from corrupt  leaders such as Duvalier and Marcos.  Mr. Chairman,  if we are  to retain  our domestic political and economic  sovereignty that is clearly threatened  by the influx of foreign capital into  the United States we must be fully ap prised of  the extent of such  invest ment through rigid disclosure require ments.  Foreign  investment  already  totals well  over  $1  trillion  in  the  United States. With  the  fall  in  the  value of the dollar, foreign  investors  have been given a huge discount on  American assets which will surely in crease the flow of foreign capital into  the United States. I,  therefore, urge  my colleagues to vote with me in de feating the amendment before us.  ",1987
588,924,8,Mr. LENT.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Minne sota [Mr. FRENZEL].  ",1987
589,924,8,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong opposition to section 703 of  H.R. 3 which would impose additional,  unfair reporting requirements on for eign investors, and in favor of the Lent  substitute, which makes the requirements  slightly more  palatable  by  granting the Secretary of Commerce  the authority to waive them in certain  cases.  Section 703, which I would call the  maybe we can get our interests rates  up  to 20  percent again amendment  mandates the following: Privately held  companies in which a foreigner has ac quired  a  25-percent  interest must  report for public disclosure the loca tion of  all  facilities  in  the United  States, the identity and nationality of  directors and officers and their com pensation,  related  business  transac tions, officers, and ""significant civil  litigation."" Similar requirements apply  to  foreigners with an  investment  in  U.S. property.  Lacking any arguments  that  they  care to articulate clearly, proponents  only mention that we have a right to  more information about foreign inves tors because  they are somehow sus pects. My guess  is that the real mo tives lie along the lines of harassment.  This  provisiOn,  discriminatory  against foreigners, would violate  the  principle of national  treatment and  undercut U.S. efforts to eliminate bar riers to U.S. investment abroad. A top  objective for  the Uruguay Round of  Trade Negotiations which this bill au thorizes, getting an agreement on in vestment restrictions will be difficult  to achieve  if we have  just increased  our own. If our trading partners en acted mirror restrictions against  the  foreign investments of U.S. companies  they would be  tempted  to pull up  stakes I am sure.  Federal Reserve  Chairman,  Paul  Volcker, and other economists have  testified in numerous occasions before  the Ways and Means Committee that  economic expansion  in  this country  and lower interest rates are due in no  small measure to the faith that for eigners have in our market and their  willingness to invest here. If this were  not the case, we would be denied the  foreign capital that supported 3 mil lion jobs in the United States in 1985.  As  dissenters  in  the  committee  report point out, the United States is  known  for  its  respect  for  personal  property and the privacy of  individ uals. Sending  signals  that we  now  intend to hassle foreign investors is, I  believe,  a misguided  and  somewhat  dangerous way to proceed. The retro active nature of  the requirements  is  highly unfair to those who decided to  invest here based on current regula tions.  Finally,  the Department of Com merce  and  the Securities  and Ex change Commission already have nu merous reporting mechanisms in place  to monitor foreign investment if that  is the intention of the proponents of  this  section.  Comprehensive  data  exists and to require more paperwork  and public disclosure of foreign inves tors will only send their needed capital  fleeing to stock exchanges and plant  sites in other countries.  The substitute language offered by  Mr. LENT to subsection J of the section  703 would authorize the Secretary of  Commerce to exempt a person, inter est, or class of interests from the re porting requirements if he determines  the exemption is necessary to prevent  a ""substantial impairment of benefi cial foreign investment in the United  States."" It's the least we can do to im prove an exceedingly unwise provision  and I urge my colleagues to support  the Lent substitute.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Texas [Mr. FIELDS] stated the case ac curately a few moments ago. Under ex isting  law,  the Department of Com merce keeps sufficient data so  that  policymakers can make responsible de cisions.  The extra data required by the gen tleman from Texas [Mr. BRYANT], arti cle  703,  is  expensive  to maintain,  would not be much help, and is going  to discourage  foreign  investors  from  investing in the United States.  It  is  a  pretty  simple proposition.  This country has  the  lowest savings  rate in the industrialized world. Our  closest competitor is Canada, with a  rate  twice  our  size. Germany  and  Japan have from three to five  times  higher rate of savings than we do.  Because our Congress  is profligate  and openhanded, we incur about $200  billion of deficit every year. With our  consumers on  their usual  spending  binge, as was noted here yesterday,  there simply is not enough capital in  the United States of America to carry  our economy and provide more jobs.  0 1050  Thank heaven for offshore capital,  for imported capital to keep this coun try going,  to  provide  jobs  for our  people. If we pass the Bryant amend ment, we can't keep it out. We can re capture those old glory days of Jimmy  Carter when we had interest rates of  20 percent and more.  Do not pass this amendment which  is calculated only to harass foreign in vestors. What I will do  is discourage  the marginal  investors,  and  deny  America the capital it needs to move  forward.  If you like high interest rates, you  will  love,  the Bryant amendment.  I  only wish the Lent amendment would  strike  it all  instead of  touching  it  lightly with a glove.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge support for  the Lent amendment.  ",1987

592,937,8,Mr. KONNYU.," Mr. Chairman,  yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman,  this bill  is,  as  the  gentleman from Ohio just said, is true  veto bait. The U.S. Trade Representa tive has said  that,  the Secretary of  Commerce has said that, the President  is against this bill because he knows  what it will create.  I have already told you about Toy otas built in Freemont in cooperation  with GM, semiconductors built mostly  in the United States that are not going  to be able to be sold at the Federal  level.  The amendment is simply amending  the Buy America Act of 1933. Think  about when  it was created. In 1933,  the days of the Depression, and that is  the thinking that is prevailing behind  this  amendment; more Depression  type thinking.  Instead of recognizing, as obviously  some in this room have not, that this  is the time of international trade. It  would cost California, if you cut off all  the trade, 1 million jobs in California,  1 out of every 10 jobs, 1 million jobs.  That is what the Governor wrote me  in  a  letter  expressing  his  concern  about what is going on in Congress.  That is Depression-era thinking.  The macho thinking of this bill; for getting about  foreign  retaliation,  if  you are an aircraft worker from Wash ington State building  those Boeing  747's, you might as well forget a bunch  of your jobs, workers in Washington,  because this bill in not going to allow  Boeing  to sell  those aircraft  to Air  France, to Lufthansa, to British Air, to  JAL, because it is the government air line, a government owns that and they  are going to retaliate against America.  This, Mr. Chairman, and Members,  is a  terrible provision. That is why I  really believe in opposing it. This is a  macho bill that will  feel good  today  and hurt us for decades to come.  ",1987
593,937,8,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield the balance of my time to myself.  Under this bill, the U.S. Government  would use access to our $200 billion a  year procurement market  to encour age other nations to open up their procurements  to American  firms. The  rules would be simple and effective. If  a  government  in a  foreign country  continues to discriminate against the  United States and our companies, then  products  from  that country will be  banned  from  eventual procurement.  Every year billions and billions of dol lars in potential contracts with foreign  governments are being denied to U.S.  firms;  those jobs, those profits, those  opportunities.  In the meantime, our Government  has been continuing to blithely award  contracts  to  companies  from  these  very  same countries. U.S.  taxpayers  cannot continue to contribute to the  welfare of countries that do not treat  American producers fairly.  The Buy America Act of 1987 will  make sure that everybody is playing  by the same rules and that our compa nies-and there is nothing wrong with  our companies, made  in  the United  States is not criminal-will be given an  even chance.  I  urge you  amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. All  pired.  The question is on the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Cali fornia [Mr. KONNYU].

595,1054,8,Mr. SCHUETTE.," Mr. Chairman, before Con gress  today  is a sweeping  trade bill which  aims to address our Nation's rising  trade im balance. Whether this trade bill, or any legisla tive  remedy  for  that matter,  is  the proper  means to an end remains very much open to  debate.  Perhaps  the most important component of  H.R. 3 is that the United States is sending a  crystal clear message  to our  foreign  trade  partners that enough is enough. No longer will  we sit back and pursue a hands-off approach.  In  too many  instances American policy has  been to stand aside while our trade partners  engage in unfair trade practices.  All  the United States wants  is  to be on a  fair playing field; reciprocity on the part of our  trading partners  for our businesses  to com plete with  foreign competitors.  I believe  that  American business  is  the most  innovative  in  the world. We can compete in the world mar ketplace, if only given an opportunity to do so.  Equal access and  fair  reciprocity,  in my  opinion,  is one of the most important factors  missing  in our current  trade  relations. Equal  access to our trade partners' markets is not  only a necessity, but a right that our business es should enjoy  throughout  the world. Our  markets are open and accessible.  It  is only  fair that our businesses enjoy the same reci procity in foreign marketplaces.  While some Members assert  that our  for eign trade partners' trade practices cannot ac count  for our trade deficit, and  I must state  that I agree with that statement for the most  part, we must clearly affirm our policy of fair  trade practices. Fair trade practices, such as  free and open markets, are essential and non negotiable. I could list hundreds of unfair trade  practices and barriers  to deny U.S. products  and services access  to  foreign markets. My  colleagues have detailed many of these and I  concur  in  the  conclusion  that we  can  no  longer tolerate these activities.  This trade measure, while not perfect, gives  the U.S. Trade Representative the ability and  the ammunition to address these unfair trade  practices. Despite many provisions of the bill, I  do believe  it will send a clear signal  to our  trade partners to open their markets, engage  in  fair trade practices, permit reciprocity and  open competition.  We have come  to  the point  in our history  that we must pass a  tough  trade bill. Our  hands have been forced.  It is indeed unfortu nate that we have come to this juncture where  Congress must implement a plan to  legislate  equal markets and equal access. However,  we are at that juncture, and strong action  is  necessary.  I mentioned earlier that I do not adhere to  the notion  that this bill  is a panacea for our  trade problems. In fact, it may not address the  root of the problem because our current trade  problems are  related  to many complex  fac tors. At least part of our growing trade deficit  may be  attributed  to  our  looming Federal  budget deficits, the horrendous debt problems  of  underdeveloped  nations,  particularly  in  Mexico and South America, our quick recov ery  from  the early 1980's recessions, and a  strong U.S. dollar.  This  trade bill before us offers sweeping  reform to our trade laws. However, it would be  a mistake to promise Americans that our ac tions today will solve the trade problem, elimi nate our excessive trade deficit, or resurrect  our failing  industries. The United States does  not operate in a vacuum; we are operating in  a  global  economy. As  a world  economic  leader,  the United States must balance  the  global  economical  consequences with  the  need  to make a statement that  fair  trade  is  essential. For the American businessman, the  American manufacturer,  and  the American  worker, we must make it clear that we cannot  accept unfair barriers to trade.  As  I said earlier, while  I do have serious  concerns  regarding some of  the aspects of  the trade measure before us,  I want to briefly  comment on  those provisions  I strongly sup port.  First,  I am extremely pleased that the Agri culture Committee, on which I am honored to  be Michigan's only Representative, included a  number of strong  trade provisions  to assist  our agricultural exports. My colleagues on the  Agriculture Committee,  the  ranking Republi can, Mr. MADIGAN, and my colleague  from  Oregon, Mr. SMITH, are to be commended for  their efforts  to draft  these agriculture  trade  export provisions.  The agriculture provisions increase funding  for  the Export Enhancement Program  [EEP]  from $1.5  to $2.5 billion. EEP  is one of the  strongest tools in our arsenal to increase agri cultural exports. By increasing our agricultural  markets, we will be working toward eliminating  our agriculture  surpluses, which will  be of  enormous help to our hard-pressed farmers.  The bill also  increases funding  for the for eign agriculture service. This increase will like wise help  improve our agricultural  trade bal ance because the FAS is an important part of  our trade export activities.  In addition,  I applaud  the  fact that  the bill  makes wood and wood products eligible  for  export programs under  the GSM  1 02 and  GSM 103 export credit guarantee programs.  Prior  to  this  time, wood and wood products  were excluded from these helpful programs.  Finally, my colleague, Mr. JEFFORDS,  is  to  be commended for his commitee amendment  to H.R. 3. which would have required the Sec retary of Agriculture to consider the amount of  casein imported into this country when calcu lating the milk price support reduction sched uled for January 1, 1988. Under the provisions  of  the  1985  farm  bill,  the Secretary may  reduce the milk price support by 50 cents per  hundredweight if purchases by the Commodity  Credit Corporation  [CCC]  exceed  5  billion  pounds. Mr. Jeffords' amendment, embodied  in  the trade bill, merely would have required  the Secretary  to  take  these casein  imports  into account when calculating  the 5 billion  pound  limit. This is only fair  to the American  dairy  farmer. There can be no doubt  that  casein  imports are displacing  the  domestic  dairy  production,  putting  thousands more  American dairy farmers out of business.  Unfortunately,  the amendment offered by  Mr. OuN  from Virginia  to delete the Jeffords  language passed  the House by voice vote. I  must reiterate  the need  to address the seri ous problem of casin  imports  flooding our  markets.  I urge Congress to quickly consider  an appropriate legislative remedy to deal with  the flood of casein imports which are displac ing American dairy products.  I also  feel quite strongly about one other  provisions of the bill, the transfer of authority  for section 201 and section 301  cases  from  the President to  the U.S. Trade Representa tive. This  I trust will  take trade cases out of  the political arena and provide a better forum  to access import injury and unfair trade prac tices.  The most contentious provision of the trade  bill  is  the Gephardt amendment. The mere  fact  that  the Gephardt  provision  focuses  mainly on the existence of a trade surplus as  the basis  for automatic  retaliation  is,  in my  opinion, simplistic. It does nothing  to directly  address unfair trade practices. The Gephardt  provision offers a quick fix but does nothing to  address  the  root of  the problem-a  lack of  reciprocity, a lack of free and open markets.  I supported H.R. 3 on  final passage even  though  the Gephardt provision was a part of  the bill.  It should be noted  that  this short sighted retaliatory scheme passed the House  without my support by a very small margin in a  vote of 218  to 214.  I supported the omnibus  bill  in  the end  simply because  the United  States can no longer tolerate the unfair trade  practices of our  trade partners. The United  States  cannot  pursue  free  trade  without  access  to  free markets. America deserves,  America demands a fair,  tough and balanced  trade bill.  It is my hope that as  this process  evolves,  this goal will  be achieved  in  the  1 OOth Congress.  ",1987
596,1054,8,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Chairman,  I want  to ex press my deep concern over the passage of  the Gephardt amendment to H.R. 3. Although  not perfect, H.R. 3 represented a balanced ra tional approach to dealing with our trade prob lem. Now I cannot vote for this bill.  ",1987
597,1067,8,Mr. DICKINSON., No;  it does not  save a crying dime. It is a  technical  thing to get past a year so that we can  delay payment  into  the next  fiscal  year so we can meet the target and  avoid the impact of Gramm-Rudman.  It is another gimmick to get by  the  target date.  ,1987
598,1067,8,Mr. WALKER., Similar to the fact of  delaying the pay to the soldiers last  year?  ,1987
599,1067,8,Mr. DICKINSON.," Exactly, another  gimmick  to slip  the pay date,  to go  into another budget,  another  fiscal  year. That  is what  it  is, pure and  simple.  I do not say  it  is good.  It is not  saving anyone money. It is just a me chanical means of avoiding what we  should do, face head on.  ",1987
600,1067,8,Mr. WALKER.," Twelve days does not  make much more difference than 10, I  would not think.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reserva tion of objection.  The SPEAKER. Without objection,  the amendment is agreed to.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER. The Chair  recog nizes the gentleman from South Caro lina [Mr. DERRICK].  ",1987
601,1067,8,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, House  Resolution 152 is a rule providing for  the initial consideration of H.R. 1748,  the National Defense Authorization  Act for fiscal year 1988-89. The rule  provides 3 hours of general debate,  with the time divided equally between  the chairman and  ranking minority  member of the Armed Services Com mittee.  The rule waives section 303(a) of the  Budget Act against consideration of  the  bill.  Section  303(a)  prohibits  consideration of budgetary legislation  prior to  the adoption of  the budget  resolution for a fiscal year. Since the  budget resolution for fiscal year 1988  has not yet been finally adopted by  the House and Senate, any spending  included  in H.R. 1748 as  introduced  would subject the bill  to a point of  order. Therefore, a waiver was provid ed to ensure that the House will be  able to proceed to consideration of the  committee-reported bill  and  amend ments to that.  The rule makes in order an amend ment in the nature of a substitute con sisting of the text of H.R. 2169, if of fered  by Chairman Aspin  of  the  Armed  Services  Committee.  That  amendment  is  considered  as having  been read and is debatable for 2 hours,  with the time divided between Chair man AsPIN and a member opposed to  the amendment. The rule waives sec tion  303(a)(4)  of  the Budget Act  against  the  substitute.  Section  303(a)(4)  prohibits  consideration  of  new entitlement authority prior to the  adoption of a budget resolution for the  fiscal year. Since the Aspin substitute  provides  new  entitlement  authority  for a military pay raise, the waiver is  necessary to allow consideration of the  substitute. I should point out that the  pay raise included in the Aspin substi tute is consistent with the budget reso lution <H. Con. Res. 93) adopted by  the House on April 9.  The rule waives clause 7 of rule XVI,  which prohibits nongermane amend ments,  against consideration of  the  Aspin substitute. This is necessary be cause  the  substitute  is  broader  in  nature than the underlying bill. The  rule also waives clause 5(a) rule XXI,  which prohibits appropriations  in an  authorization  bill,  against  consider ation of  the Aspin  substitute. This  waiver is necessary because the Aspin  substitute carries appropriations with  respect to proceeds of certain military  construction  land sales and  replace ment and national defense stockpile  transactions.  The  rule provides  that  the Aspin  substitute  is not subject  to  amend ment during its consideration. Howev er, if the substitute is adopted, it shall  be considered as original text for the  purposes of amendment.  The rule provides that, upon disposi tion of the Aspin substitute, the Com mittee of the Whole shall rise without  motion and no further amendments  shall be considered except as subse quently  determined  by  the House.  This somewhat unusual procedure  is  recommended because the Rules Com mittee anticipates reporting a second  rule on this bill that will govern the  consideration  of  amendments. This  two-step process allows the House to  proceed with general debate on H.R.  17 48  and  to determine whether  the  committee-reported bill or the Aspin  substitute should be the base bill for  the purposes of amendment, before  the Rules Committee recommends the  procedure for consideration of amend ments.  As I am sure most of you know, the  Armed Services Committee reported a  bill which would provide $306 billion  in budget authority for defense pro grams  in fiscal year 1988. After the  committee acted, the House adopted a  budget resolution which calls for only  $288.7 billion for defense. Chairman  AsPIN then asked the Armed Services  Subcommittees to go back and recom mend ways that the budget authority  in the bill could be reduced in order to  conform to the budget resolution, and  he  largely  took  those  recommenda tions  in putting  together the substi tute he will offer which does reach the  budget  resolution  target. This  rule  allows the House to decide, before be ginning the long process of amending  the Defense bill, whether it intends to  stay within the defense levels it set in  the budget.  As I stated before, the Rules Com mittee intends to report a second rule  which will govern the consideration of  further amendments. To facilitate this  process, the Rules Committee has no tified members that anyone wishing to  offer  an  amendment  to H.R.  17 48  should  deliver  35  copies  of  that  amendment to  the Rules Committee  office, H-312 in the Capitol, by 6 p.m.  on Friday, May 1.  Mr. Speaker, the National Defense  Authorization Act for fiscal year 198889 is obviously one of the most impor tant pieces of  legislation  the House  will consider this year. It provides au thorizations for the full range of de fense activities and sets policy on a  wide range of national security issues.  The rule before us allows us to begin  considering  this  legislation  in a  fair  and orderly manner.  I  should point  out that both the chairman and rank ing minority member of  the Armed  Services Committee are in agreement  with this process for consideration of  the bill.  ",1987
602,1067,8,Mr. LATTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield  such time as he may consume to the  gentleman  from  California  [Mr.  BADHAM].  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  ",1987
603,1067,8,Mr. BADHAM.," Mr. Speaker, on roll call Nos. 77 and 78 I was unavoidably  away from the Capitol due to a minor  medical emergency.  Had I been here, I would have voted  as I was paired, yes on the Michel sub stitute and no on final passage.  ",1987
604,1067,8,Mr. LATTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  this  rule makes  in  order a bill, if passed as presented to  the House,  that will do  irreparable  harm to the defenses of this country.  The Defense Authorization bill will  almost certainly be the largest single  authorization bill of this session, and  probably consume the most floor time.  According to testimony in the Rules  Committee,  the number of  amend ments on this bill has been increasing  in recent years. On the fiscal year 1984  bill the House considered 54 amend ments. On the bill for fiscal year 1985,  60 floor amendments were considered.  On the bill for fiscal year 1986, that  number  doubled,  exceeding  120  amendments. On the bill for the cur rent fiscal year 1987, 116 amendments  were actually considered under proce dures which established a time limita tion for each amendment. Now, we are  considering  the  bill  for next  fiscal  year, and there is no reason to suspect  that the number of amendments will  drop.  Therefore  the Rules Committee  is  proposing to use the same procedure  this year that was used last year.  There were two separate rules used  last year, and two are planned for this  year as well.  ",1987
605,1093,8,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  introducing, with Mr. DYMALL Y, Mr. TORRES,  Mr. WHEAT, Mr.  PEPPER, and Mr. LENT your  amendments to H.R. 27, FSLIC minority insti tutions bill which will extend  the  forbearance  and oversight provisions to a unique and en dangered group of FSLIC-insured  institutions,  minority owned or operated associations.  It is  my understanding that these provisions will be  incorporated  into H.R. 27 as Chairman Pep per's amendments.  The first amendment broadens the present  definition of institutions eligible for capital for bearance contained in section 202 and, by ex tension, institutions eligible for the Capital Cer tificate Program of section 203, by adding mi nority associations  50  percent or more of  whose  loans are minority  loans and 50 per cent or more of whose originated loans are for  one  through  four dwelling units or consumer  loans. This  two-part definition  is  intended  to  identify those minority associations which are  clearly serving  the minority community and  which are performing the classic funtions of a  thrift  institution. Minority  is defined  to mean  black, native, Hispanic, and Asian Americans.  The second amendment includes regulation  of minority associations among the topics for  which quarterly reports to Congress are man dated by existing section 209.  The urgent need for legislation assisting mi nority associations and recognizing the special  difficulties they confront is revealed  in a few  stark statistics. From a peak of 85 minority as sociations in 1982, there were only 64 remain ing associations by yearend 1986, and  the  number continues to decline. Those 64 minoriEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ty associations had combined assets of $4.8  billion, and 19 had regulatory net worth of less  than 3 percent. Of the 19, 4 are in Florida, 4  are in California, 2 are in Texas, and 2 are in  Louisiana.  Minority associations provide a unique serv ice  to their customers despite economic and  cultural barriers. They often must overcome  inner-city adversity and welcome as  their cli ents  individuals shunned by conventional  fi nancial institutions. They are pioneers in their  promotion of minorities to executive positions  and in their ability to raise capital from within  the minority community. They are very often  the only source of  financial services that are  accessible and affordable  to minorities, and  must contend with  the  fact that the costs of  administering minority transactions are gener ally greater due to the smaller average size of  deposits and loans.  Current conditions in the thrift industry com pound the obstacles that minority associations  must  overcome.  The  private  initiative  and  public service demonstrated by minority asso ciations deserves our encouragement.  In  this  period of  financial  turbulence and  regulatory  uncertainty,  every effort must be made  to  foster  those minority associations which  find  themselves  in a distressed condition through  no fault of their own.  This bill  recognizes  the special need and  importance of minority associations, and are  eminently entitled to our support. I urge each  of the Members of  this body  to support this  legislation. Thank you.  A SALUTE TO STANFORD  UNIVERSITY  HON. ERNEST L. KONNYU  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 30, 1987  ",1987

MAZZOLI  OF KENTUCKY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 30, 1987  ",1987
607,1093,8,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker,  I wish  to ex press my concern about the flood of unsolic ited direct mailings  that older citizens  in my  district-and across  the country-are receiv ing  from organizations which claim  to  repre sent the interests of these older Americans.  Our elderly are  being  unnecessarily dis turbed and even frightened by  these unsolic ited mailings.  It would appear some of these  organizations are actually preying upon  the  vulnerability and susceptibility of  these sen iors.  The pitch usually made  is  that a vital gov ernment program is about to go broke or that  a valuable Government benefit is about to be  curtailed. This  is never the case. These pro grams are as solid as Gibraltar.  Furthermore, often these missives come in  Government  ""look alike"" envelopes. These  tend to mislead the elderly into believing that  the mailing is an official mailing from the Fed eral Government or one of its agencies.  I commend  the efforts of my colleagues  here in the House who are, even now, in the  process of developing  legislative  recommen dations which,  if approved, will protect our  ",1987
608,1106,8,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, on April 8, 1987,  I introduced eight bills which will amend and  strengthen  the Older Americans Act. These  bills are wide ranging and as the following de scriptions indicate, they are efforts to fine tune  this important legislation.  THE CAREGIVER REFERRAL ACT OF 1987  This bill requires the Commissioner to con duct a study to determine the efficacy of de veloping a nationwide  referral system using  the area agencies on aging and State units on  aging for geographically remote caregivers of  older persons.  Recent research has shown  that 80  to 90  percent of care is still provided by the family.  Adult children  living  in geographically distant  parts of the country are not necessarily any  less concerned about the well-being of  their  aged parents  than are  the  family members  who  live  in close proximity. Many attempt to  perform  the  role of caregiver at a distance,  but their tasks are more difficult because they  do not know how to access available, reputa ble services in another community. Their con tinued involvement could be enhanced if there  were a way to identify services for older family  members who are geographically distant. The  Older Americans Act consists of over 660  area agencies and 56 State units all of which  provide a variety of services  that could be  made available to geographically distant family  caregivers and which could serve  to assist  them  in  their caregiving  role. This bill would  determine  if  a  nationwide  referral  system  could be developed.  THE RURAL ALLOTMENT ACT OF 1987  This bill updates the current pr.ovision that  in each fiscal year the State agency will spend  for services  in  rural areas an amount of not  less than 1 05 percent of the amount expend ed for such services in 1978.  This bill will update the base year from 1978  to 1986 in order to better reflect the growth in  the need for services in rural areas.  THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE COORDINATION ACT OF  1987  This bill  requires  that AAA's work closely  with  local Alzheimer's disease organizations  for the purpose of coordinating services to in dividuals and  families with Alzheimer's dis ease.  Each of us is aware of the devastation that  Alzheimer's disease causes the victim and the  family. Requiring the Older Americans Act net work  to better coordinate their activities with  organizations providing support services  for  Alzheimer's disease will serve  to strengthen  both the network and the community organiza tions involved in this important activity.  OLDER AMERICANS DAY CARE AND RESPITE SERVICES  ACT OF 1987  This  bill  requires  that,  where  possible,  AAA's encourage the use of older volunteers  in the provision of adult day care and respite  care services and includes the provision that  not less than 15 percent of new title V monies  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  must be spent on employment in day care adult and child-and respite care projects.  Increasingly,  family caregivers have  identi fied  the need  for day care and  respite care  services, creating a potentially large demand  for these services as a means of staving off  more  costly and  less personal  institutional  care. On  the supply side, older persons who  have an  interest or expertise  in  the care of  frail or dependent adults should be encour aged  to volunteer  to provide assistance  in  these areas. Title V workers should be chan neled  into work in day care and respite care  as  these workers can bring  important skills  and  increase the available supply of services  identified by caregivers as essential.  THE MEDIGAP AND LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE  COUNSELING ACT OF 1987  This bill allows  for the  training and estab lishment of volunteer programs  to evaluate  the provisions of medical insurance policies long-term care and Medigap-which older per sons are considering purchasing and requires  the State to develop consumer education  in formation on such plans.  Presently, approximately 65 percent of older  persons purchase Medigap insurance. While it  is unclear how many have more  than one  policy,  anecdotal  information  suggests  that  many buy multiple policies on which their mar ginal gain may be very small. The purpose of  this  insurance counseling program, modeled  after  tax  counseling  programs  currently  in  place, would be to inform older persons what  benefits  they can expect  from purchasing a  given Medigap or long-term care policy as well  as the value of multiple policies. As older per sons are  increasingly  targeted by  insurance  companies for television and direct mail sales,  the ability to evaluate policies will be essential  in assuring  that older persons get value  for  their dollars.  OLDER AMERICANS TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 1987  This  bill  requires a study of  how Older  Americans Act money is being spent on trans portation, what  it  is  buying  and  how  this  money could be better leveraged through tap ping into mass transit systems.  Transportation services are both essential  and  expensive  services.  Under  the Older  Americans  Act,  transportation  has  been  funded as a means of providing access  to  services. Particularly in rural areas, transporta tion  is  the  key  to  adequate  utilization  of  needed services. The purchase of vehicles,  staffing and maintenance consume a share of  the Older Americans Act, but how  large  the  share and what  is being purchased has not  been documented; neither has  the extent to  which Older Americans Act moneys can be  used to draw mass  transit and other alterna tive systems of  transportation  into  the net work. A study of these factors will enable the  network to plan for the rational use of trans portation without establishing parallel systems  to those which are already in place.  THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH COORDINATION ACT  OF 1987  This bill  requires AAA's  to  include  in  their  plans  the provision  that  they will coordinate  with  community mental health  centers and  other public and private nonprofit organiza tions.  Historically,  older persons have underuti lized mental health services. Better coordinaApril 30, 1987  tion among  those who provide mental health  services and the AAA network help to insure  that the elderly in need of mental health serv ices will have improved access.  AREA AGENCY ON AGING UNIFORM LISTING ACT OF  1987  This bill requires that all area agencies uni formly  list themselves  in  the  telephone book  under area agency on aging  for purposes of  easy access by consumers.  Area agencies across the country use differ ent names and are located in different sites that is, some are private while others are part  of  local government. The point of a uniform  listing provision  is  to assure  that  those who  wish to obtain service can do so by knowing  that, wherever they are, they can gain access  to the local area agency on aging. The use of  a uniform listing is an essential step in estab lishing an easily accessible nationwide net work of area agencies on aging.  As each of you knows  from your constitu ents, the Older Americans Act is important far  beyond  the confines of its $1 billion budget.  This act and  the network of area agencies  and State units has focused national attention  on the needs and concerns of older persons.  As we  consider  the  reauthorization  of  the  Older Americans Act in 1987, I hope you will  join me in supporting these provisions and in  further strengthening a 22-year-old success  story.

609,1106,8,Mr. NIELSON.," Mr. Speaker,  the  following  letter was sent  from  the U.S. Trade Repre sentative Clayton Yeutter to the chairman of  the Government Operations Committee, Mr.  BROOKS,  regarding H.R. 1750, which was in corporated into title X of H.R. 3.  The letter follows:  THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE,  Washington, DC, April2, 1987.  Hon. JACK BROOKS,  Chairman, Government Operations Com mittee,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: We are both eager to  find solutions to our trade problems. Howev er, I have concluded that H.R. 1750, which  was introduced on March 23, will have some  serious negative unintended effects. After a  careful evaluation of the bill, I believe that  it could not be effectively  implemented,  that it is too costly from both an economic  and a policy perspective, and that it would  not  improve  the  existing  situation. For  these reasons, the Administration is strong  ly opposed to its enactment.  As  I understand H.R. 1750,  this bill  is  aimed at expanding the foreign government  procurement markets available  to U.S. ex porters while  the Administration and  the  Committee share  the same objectives-our  exporters deserve  the same access  to mar kets overseas  that foreign exporters enjoy  in our markets-we  are  very  concerned  about  the strategy you have proposed for  pursuing this objective.

On May 20, 1987, the school will be  celebrating the Bicentennial of America's Con stitution in a special way with a commemora tive show for the school and  the entire sur rounding community.  Students  from  kindergarten  through  the  eighth grade will be the stars of the perform ance. Under  the  caring guidance of Sister  Frances Anne, they have been diligently prac ticing and are anxiously awaiting for May 20 to  come. They plan to portray the history of our  Nation  through  dance, poetry, music,  and  drama. This is indeed a special event. In com memoration of the performance, the Pennsyl vania Department of Education's bicentennial  project has officially recognized  the students  and faculty for their commitment to recogniz ing  the historical  importance of our Nation's  Constitution. It is my honor to also recognize  these fine young men and women on this oc casion. I know that my colleagues will join me  in honoring the students and faculty of the An nunciation-St. George School and  in wishing  them continued success and good  fortune  in  the years to come.  TRIBUTE TO DR. JOYCE  YERWOOD  HON. STEWART B. McKINNEY  OF CONNECTICUT  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April30, 1987  Mr. McKINNEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask my col leagues to join me in giving proud recognition  to one of my constituents, Dr. Joyce Yerwood.  The Union Baptist Church,  the  citizens of  Stamford, CT, and  I are honoring  this very  unique physician for her dedicated service as  a leading woman  in  the medical field and for  her outstanding contribution to the black com munity.  Dr. Yerwood earned her medical degree  from Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN,  in 1933, an accomplishment nearly unheard of  for a black woman at that time. After complet ing her internships in Kansas City and Phila delphia, Dr. Yerwood settled in Stamford with  her husband, Dr. Joseph L. Garwin, to  raise  their  son,  Joseph. Remarkably,  she main tained  an  active medical  practice  in  Port  Chester, NY, from 1937 to 1955.  In 1955 Joyce moved her practice to Stam ford and set a precedent by becoming the first  black,  female  family practitioner  in Fairfield  County. She devoted  her practice  to  low income women and children. She also recog nized the vital need for a community organiza tion to promote both the educational and cul tural  needs of black youth. Dr. Yerwood's  commitment to improving the quality of life for  her patients and her community  led her  to  start  the Negro Youth Theatre Group, which  later grew into the West Main Street Commu nity Center, and, in 1976, became the current ly active Yerwood Center. Furthermore, she  was among the first to recognize the emerging  drug problem  in Stamford and  in  the 1960's  was involved in a federally sponsored drug re search program. Finally, she was instrumental  in starting  the NAACP chapter in Greenwich.  Although now retired from her formal prac tice,  Joyce  should be  commended  for her  continued activity. She is the medical director  of  the Methadone Clinic of Liberation pro grams  in Stamford, she  is a member of  the  board of directors of Yerwood Center, and  she is chairman of the trustee board of Union  Baptist Church.  Many honors have been bestowed upon the  deserving Dr. Yerwood. A  few of  the more  outstanding  include  the naming of  the Yer wood Center and an appointment to serve on  the National Advisory Council of Comprehen sive Health Manning Programs under HEW.  She has been  the  recipient of  the mayor's  award,  the  Alpha  Kappa  Alpha  Heritage  Award, and  the Hannah G. Solomon Award.  Dr. Yerwood is listed in ""Who's Who of Ameri can Women,"" appears in the Connecticut His torical Society list ""Black Women Against the  Odds,"" and  is mentioned  in  the publication  Stamford: an Illustrated History.  Because of her many contributions  to  the  welfare of mankind, Dr. Joyce Yerwood de serves  the  respect and admiration of young  and old alike. To quote Pal Kusso, chairman  of the Permanent Commission of the Status of  Women, ""Dr. Yerwood is a pioneer woman in  the  true and most wonderful sense of  the  word. She  is  a  shining  example  of what  women can achieve.""  H.R. 2228 AN AG TAX PACKAGE  HON. HAL DAUB  OF NEBRASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 30, 1987  ",1987

616,1132,8,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President,  this  Nation  faces unprecedented  interna tional challenges, reflected in the bil lions of dollars' worth of foreign prod ucts surging into our ports.  As a result, our political system also  faces great challenges.  The American people are frustrat ed-they are concerned, they are anx ious-about the decline of America's  competitive position, and  they want  action.  We all know that a main cause of  the trade budget deficit  is the fiscal  deficit. We must  reduce our  fiscal  budget deficit  if we are going to be  competitive and to lower capital costs  in order to compete with other coun tries.  At the same time, we in Congress are  considering comprehensive trade legis lation. The House recently passed its  trade bill. We in the Senate are now  working on ours.  I  think that, when all  is said and  done, we will have a solid trade bill.  A key provision,  however,  of  the  House trade bill is the Gephardt provi sion. I am disappointed that the House  adopted the Gephardt provision. It is  unfair. And if it becomes law, it may  undermine rather than enhance Amer ica's  international  competitive  posi tion.  The Gephardt  provision  requires  countries that enjoy large trade sur pluses with the United States to cut  their surpluses by over 40 percent over  4 years or face stiff sanctions.  Now,  I am sympathetic with Con gressman GEPHARDT's  concerns. How ever, the amendment is too rigid. It is  simplistic. And  it  takes a unilateral  ""Lone Ranger"" approach  that could  undermine our relationship not only  with Japan but with the rest of the  world.  It assumes that the entire cause of  the bilateral trade deficit is to Japan's  unfair  trade barriers. It does not  in  any way acknowledge that some of the  reasons for the trade deficit are also  approach  is  approach has  due to problems we have here in our  country, as well.  During  the  Finance  Committee's  consideration of the trade bill I will  propose a very different approach.  This approach builds upon GATT  and our multilateral  relations.  In a  nutshell, it requires the President to  bring an action against excessive trade  surplus countries like Japan under ar ticle 23 of the GATT, on the ground  that Japan's trading system nullifies  benefits negotiated under GATT. If  GATT fails to act, the President would  seek a separate, multilateral approach.  As a last resort, he must impose uni lateral sanctions.  I  believe  that  this  three main advantages.  First,  a mulitlateral  more likely to succeed.  Japan's trading practices hurt us.  But they hurt many other countries as  well. These countries are likely to join  us in the GATT. In fact, the EEC pro posed bringing Japan to the GATT in  1983 but we at that time refused. The  conditions are  ripe  for such a  case  today.  Second, a multilateral approach will  reinvigorate the GATT by demonstrat ing that it can be an effective forum  for major trade disputes.  The drafters of GATT originally en visioned that article 23 could be used  in a situation like the Great Depres sion, in which closed markets and re strictive economic policies led to stag nating world economy. We face a simi lar situation today. Rising protection ism and deteriorating international co operation threaten to ignite a global  recession.  Third, a multilateral approach pro vides necessary flexibility.  We must put economic pressure on  countries  like Japan. Otherwise,  the  necessary changes will not occur. But  we should do so through flexible mul tilateral negotiations, rather than by  applying a mathematical formula that  puts the trade war on automatic pilot.  The Gephardt  amendment would  lock us into a cycle of retaliation and  counterretaliation, and counterretalia tion again, because  it assumes  that  Japan is the entire cause of the entire  problem. An article 23 action in con trast, would permit us to expand the  negotiations  to  include not only  the  elimination of unfair trade practices,  but also changes in monetary policy,  changes in fiscal policy, and a greater  Japanese contribution to solving the  problem of Third World debt.  In short, the Japan problem square ly presents the central dilemma facing  U.S. trade policymakers today.  Foreign markets  are more  closed  than our own. This may have been tol erable at one time. It is not tolerable  now. We must insist on reciprocity.  At the same time, the United States  remains  the engine of world growth  ",1987

Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent  that Mrs. Wells'  responses be  printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  at the conclusion of my remarks.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  REcORD, as follows:  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE,  Washington, DC., March 23, 1987.  Hon. CLAIBORNE PELL,  Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,  U.S. Senate.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Following the March  17 hearing for Melissa Wells, ambassadorial  nominee  for Mozambique, Senator Helms  submitted questions to be answered for the  record.  Please find enclosed the answers to those  questions.  Sincerely,  J. EDWARD Fox,  Assistant  Secretary,  Legislative  Intergovernmental Affairs.  and  Enclosures: as stated.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  1. Q. What is your view of the present con flict in Mozambique? What effect is the civil  war having on the social, political and eco nomic situation in Mozambique?  A. I express my view on the conflict in  Mozambique on the basis of what I have  learned in preparation for my assignment  and on the basis of my previous experience  in violence-torn areas of Africa, but with  the qualification that I have not yet been to  Mozambique.  In my opinion, the South-African support ed insurgent movement RENAMO <Mozam bique National Resistance) is operating in a  manner that can only have as its objective  destabilization of the country. Judged by its  actions and not by its claims, the actions of  RENAMO are not  those of a nationalist  movement. It has not demonstrated a capac ity  to  take,  hold  and  govern  territory.  RENAMO is politically fragmented,  it has  no political program and has not shown evi dence of a structure (other than military)  that could be called a permanent presence  in the country.  The effects of the civil strife have devas tated Mozambique's economic  infrastruc ture, transportation routes, health centers  and schools. Agricultural production has de clined steadily. The emergency situation has  generated more than 350,000 refugees and  displaced almost two million people  inside  Mozambique.  2. Q. Do you advocate a negotiated settle ment  to  the conflict  in Mozambique?  Is  American  aid presently being used  in  a  manner that would promote dialogue?  A. The Government of Mozambique made  an  honest  effort  to  negotiate  with  RENAMO in 1984 shortly after the Nkomati  Accord, with South Africa acting as the go between. These negotiations were on  the  verge  of  reaching an agreement on  the  terms of a ceasefire. The RENAMO repre sentative  asked  for  time  to consult and  never returned to the negotiating table. We  have never encouraged the Government of  Mozambique to try and prevail through a  strictly military approach. If there is an op portunity in the future for a second try at  negotiations and if the Government of Mo zambique decides that it is in its interest to  again pursue negotiations with RENAMO, I  would be prepared  to encourage contacts  and dialogue among Mozambicans within  Mozambique.  Because  of  legislative  restrictions,  re sources from our ESF Program in Mozam bique are directed  solely  to  the private  sector. A more effective political ""handle""  on our ESF Program permitting resources  to government entities and programs does  therefore not exist at the present time due  to  legislative restrictions. Our food assist ance  to Mozambique under  the present  emergency is to assist the people of Mozam bique and has no political objective such as  to promote dialogue.  4. Have you personally spoken to repre sentatives of the various opposition parties  and groups in the Mozambican Civil War?  Provide a list of all contacts made by United  ",1987
619,1158,8,Mr.  GRASSLEY.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing a bill which  would  improve  the accountability of  the Federal Reserve System. My bill  would require the General Accounting  Office to annually examine and audit  the operations of the Federal Reserve  Board, the Federal Advisory Council,  the Federal Open Market Committee,  and all Federal Reserve branch banks.  Though  independent CPA's  from  firms such as Peat Marwick presently  conduct annual audits of the Federal  Reserve,  these audits do not include  an examination of either the Federal  Open Market Committee  or  other  branches of the Fed. Congress must  have information relating  to the ac tivities, not  just to  the expenses, of  the Federal Reserve Board.  Audits dealing with the Fed's activi ties are severely limited by the United  States Code Annotated (title 31, sec tion  714(b}), which  specifically  ex empts the Federal Reserve from these  four types of examinations:  First, audits may not include trans actions for or with a  foreign central  bank, government or foreign country,  or nonprivate  international financial  organizations;  Second, audits may not include de liberations,  decisions,  or  actions on  monetary  policy matters,  including  discount window operations,  reserves  of member banks, securities credit, in terest on deposits, and open market  operations;  Third, audits may not include trans actions made under the direction of  the Federal Open Market Committee;  Fourth, audits may not include parts  of  discussions  or  communications  among or between members of  the  Board of Governors and officers and  employees  of  the  Federal Reserve  System.  These  types  of  decisions  by  the  members  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Board affect the entire American pop ulation. Their activities must be ac countable to the public's elected repre sentatives in Congress.  The actions of the Federal Reserve  Board can raise and  lower  inflation  and  interest rates,  thereby affecting  farmers' decisions, workers' employ ment  opportunities,  and businesses'  development plans.  ",1987
620,1184,8,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, I would  like to call attention to an issue that is  often overlooked. There is a problem  in Yugoslavia that is getting worse and  worse, and we can no longer afford to  look the other way.  Yugoslavia  is a country of minori ties, some of whom unfortunately do  not get along with each other. An ex treme example  is  the persecution of  Albanians  in Kosovo. Kosovo  is  a  small  region  of  Serbia  along  the  border of Albania. The region has a  majority  of  ethnic Albanians. The  people of Kosovo want to have repub lic status, however, and the Govern ment of Serbia misconstrues that to  mean Kosovo wants to unite with Al bania.  The Government of Serbia, saying it  wants  to stop separatism, suppresses  the desires  of  the Kosovan people  through the use of informants and fre quent arrests. In the past few years  there have been over 25,000 Albanians  arrested or harassed in Yugoslavia for  political activism. This has grown well  out of control, and the United States  must make its voice heard.  The United States has given much  assistance  and  encouragement  to  Yugoslavia  because Yugoslavia was  the first Communist country to break  relations with Stalin's Soviet Union in  1948. This was a fair step at the time,  one  that made good  foreign policy  sense. We still ought to encourage an  independent Yugoslavia,  free  from  Soviet  troops and control. But Bel grade must also hear a clear United  States voice condemning human rights  abuses. I hope my colleagues will join  me in speaking out against the perse cution of ethnic Albanians  in Yugo slavia's Kosovo province.e  PRESIDENT REAGAN'S  COMMENTS ON EDUCATION   ",1987
621,1184,8,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, we are  all distressed by  the  reports of  the  failure of security in our Embassy in  Moscow. But we  should not let our  frustration lead us to look for conven ient scapegoats or simplistic explana tions. Unfortunately, the President en gaged in some of this recently when  he suggested that our Nation's schools  may bear substantial responsibility for  the alleged misconduct of the marine  guards at the Embassy. James Reston  of  the New York Times  responded  with a very thoughtful article which  put  the  allocation of blame  in  its  proper perspective. I ask that the article by James Reston appear  in  the  RECORD.  The article follows:  REAGAN ON EDUCATION  WASHINGTON.-President Reagan  has  a  story for every occasion and an excuse for  every disaster.  He blames  the Congress for  the budget  deficit,  the Japanese for the trade deficit,  his aides for the Iran-contra scandals, and  now  the educators for  the latest security  outrage at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.  In California for the Easter recess, he con demned the Russians for spying on our em bassy and the marines for letting them in,  but then suggested that maybe the problem  was not that boys like girls, but that we  were no  longer  teaching ""values""  in  the  schools.  His story this time was about the counsel or who asked his students what they'd do if  they found a pocketbook with a hundred  dollars inside and the owner's name on the  flap. Most of  them said  they'd keep  the  money, but when they asked the counselor  what he'd do, he didn't distinguish between  right and wrong but ducked the question.  The national  teacher's association could  sue Mr. Reagan for that one, yet he was get ting at a valid point, namely that we cannot  explain  the scandals of  the present  time  without looking at the decline of decency  and moral values in the society as a whole.  No doubt the educational system is part of  the problem. More young Americans are  spending more years  in school  than ever  before, and more, like the Marine guards in  Moscow,  are  going  to  high  school  and  beyond at greater  expense  than  in any  other country in the world.  But in  this  last half-century  there has  been a startling change in American society  that requires much more knowledge of the  world and places a far greater burden on the  schools.  Now, as the President suggested in Cali fornia, the schools are expected to perform  many of the educational functions that used  to be performed by the family, the settled  community and the church, and they often  perform them in peculiar ways.  Modern American education, most of the  time and most of the places, no longer em phasizes, for examples, the cultural  tradi tion on which  the Republic was  founded  and the Constitution written 200 years ago.  Instead,  the usual school curriculum  is  filled not with a study of the student's re sponsibilities, but of his rights. It is con cerned largely with elective, specialized, ac cidental and incidential studies, in accord ance with the student's personal ambition  rather than his public responsibilities. Ac cordingly, it is probably not too much to say  that the present generation is now coming  out of school with no common body of  knowledge, no common moral and intellec tual discipline and no common truth.  But it would be too much to say that the  schools are wholly to blame for this predica ment. Look at the predicament of the Amer ican family, which always was and still is  the main repository of our values; look at  the divorce  rates, and the rate of  illegit imate births, and the dropout rates, and the  models put before our children by Madison  Avenue and Wall Street, and Pennsylvania  Avenue, and on the television screens of the  nation.  Look also at the record of the President's  own Administration. For he also is supposed  to be a teacher, in fact the principal teacher  in a secular society, and he has been teach",1987

623,1197,8,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding. I want to  thank  the gentleman  from Arizona,  for his work on this bill, the gentle man from Minnesota [Mr. VENTO] for  his long hard work trying to get this  bill together, and also the ranking mi nority member  the gentleman  from  California [Mr. LAGOMARSINO], and all  those who have supported this bill be cause this bill is very important to the  safety of the people who travel in our  national parks.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 921 and urge my colleagues to  join me in voting for this important  bill. Now is the time to confront the  problems associated with overflights  of our national parks.  Aircraft noise is a serious problem in  Hawaii's national parks. Over the past  10  years,  sightseeing  aircraft  oper ations have increased, particularly on  the  islands  of Kauai, Maui,  and  Hawaii. It is not unusual for visitors to  some wilderness areas to be subjected  to  low-altitude overflights  every  15  minutes. Nowhere are  the problems  more serious than in Hawaii's two na tional parks, Haleakala National Park  on Maui and Hawaii Volcanoes Nation al Park on Hawaii.  In 1984,  there were over 1 million  visitors  to Haleakala National Park.  Many came  to view  the spectacular  volcanic crater, Haleakala, the ""House  of the Sun."" The crater area can be  reached by hiking or by air. Haleakala  experiences an average of 30  tourist  helicopter  flights a day. The crater  itself, which is about 3,000 feet deep  from  rim  to  floor, magnifies noise  caused by helicopters as  the sound  bounces  off  its walls,  particularly  when helicopters are flown inside the  crater, below the rim.  A University of Hawaii graduate stu dent, Al Perez, surveyed 44 park visitors on the trails of Haleakala. Seven ty percent of those surveyed said they  came to the park for silence and soli tude. Without prompting  from  the  interviewer, 41 percent said that heli copter noise was the most disagreeable  aspects of  their visit.  In addition,  I  have  received numerous  statements,  letters and testimony from community  leaders,  local  officials, Hawaii  resi dents and park visitors which further  describe the problems with these over flights.  I have also  reviewed Park Service  cases of aircraft complaints by park  rangers and visitors. These records in dicate  that  sightseeing  helicopter  flight practices often go beyond being  a  nuisance  and  create  unnecessary  safety  hazards.  Complaints  from  horseback riders have been filed after  low-flying  helicopters  startled  their  mounts. Several stockmen with trail riding concessions in the park have re marked that this is a recurring prob lem. Complaints have also been filed  by park rangers who have observed  actual unsafe flight practices, some in  violation of a Federal air regulation  requiring helicopters carrying paying  passengers to maintain a minimum al titude of 300  feet  above populated  areas.  It is time to address these problems.  Since 1984, an FAA advisory has been  in effect requesting aircraft to fly at  least 2,000 feet above the highest land form of any national park. Unfortu nately, this advisory has been ignored,  particularly with respect to Haleakala  National Park. We need the temporary  restrictions over Haleakala which H.R.  921  provides during  the  study and  review period. We need not only  to  protect our. national parks but also  public  safety.  Finally, we  need  to  study  the problems associated with  aircraft overflights of our national  parks by passing H.R. 921. I urge my  colleagues to join me in this effort.  ",1987

Mr. Speaker, Mr. MINETA, the gentle man from California, has been very  helpful, and in light of that and since  his subcommittee shares  jurisdiction  here, I want to yield 10 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. OBER STAR, who is representing Mr. MINETA  today because of the shared jurisdic tion in this matter, so that he has that  time available to state out the position  of the subcommittee and his position  on this measure.

625,1197,8,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker,  yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of this legislation, and commend our  distinguished colleagues on the Com mittee on Interior and Insular Affairs  and  the Subcommittee on National  Parks and Recreation  for  their fine  work on this bill. I also thank them  for  their most cooperative and con structive efforts in working with the  Committee  on  Public Works  and  Transportation and the Subcommittee  on Aviation to accommodate our Com mittee's interests and concerns. Be cause of this cooperation, the Commit tee on Public Works and Transporta tion, which shares jurisdiction on this  legislation, was able to quickly agree  to the bill being brought to the floor.  Our interest in the problem of over flights of the national parks is nothing  new. Three years ago, Congressman  SEIBERLING, then chairman of the Na tional Parks Subcommittee, and Avia tion Subcommittee Chairman MINETA  urged changes  to FAA-recommended  operating procedures  covering  over flights of national parks. The change  was to advise pilots to fly 2,000  feet  above canyon rims in units of the Na tional Park System for noise abate ment reasons. We recognized then, as  did the Federal Aviation Administra tion, that flying below the canyon rim  in national parks, like Grand Canyon  and Yosemite, produced noise incom patible with the purpose of a national  park-that  being  establishment  of  areas where citizens can enjoy our na tion's natural beauty and quiet.  This change in recommended operat ing procedures has had a positive ben efit, but it has become apparent that  we now need to go beyond recommen dations or advice to the aviation com munity, because there continue to be  abuses resulting in environmental deg radation of some units of the national  parks.  I will not  reiterate what my col leagues from the Interior Committee  are proposing in this legislation. They  have already ably described the com prehensive approach in this legislation  of study and  regulation of airspace  over  specific  units of  the national  parks.  I would like to take a few moments  to describe  the  legislation  from an  aviation safety perspective. The Avia",1987

The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 1207  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the  United States  of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCE.  (a) SHORT TITLE.-This Act may be cited  as the ""Prescription Drug Marketing Act of  1987"".  (b) REFERENCE.-Whenever in this Act an  amendment or repeal is expressed in terms  of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section  or other provision,  the reference shall be  considered to be made to a section or other  provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  The Congress finds the following( 1) American consumers cannot purchase  prescription drugs with the certainty that  the products are safe and effective.  (2)  The  integrity  of  the  distribution  system for prescription drugs is insufficient  to prevent  the  introduction and eventual  retail  sale of  substandard,  ineffective, or  even counterfeit drugs.  (3) The  existence  and operation of  a  wholesale submarket, commonly known as  the ""diversion market"", prevents effective  control over or even routine knowledge of  the true sources of prescription drugs in a  significant number of cases.  (4) Large  amounts of drugs are being  reimported to the United States as Ameri can goods  returned. These  imports are a  health and safety risk to American consum ers because they may have become subpo tent or adulterated during foreign handling  and shipping.  (5) The  ready market  for  prescription  drug reimports has been the catalyst for a  continuing series of frauds against Ameri can manufacturers and has provided  the  cover for the importation of foreign coun terfeit drugs.  < 6) The existing system of providing drug  samples to physicians through manufactur er's representatives has been abused for dec ades and has resulted in the sale to consum ers of misbranded, expired, and adulterated  pharmaceuticals.  <7> The bulk  resale of below wholesale  priced prescription drugs by health care en tities, for ultimate sale at retail, helps fuel  the diversion market and is an unfair form  of competition to wholesalers and retailers  that must pay otherwise prevailing market    (8) The effect of these several practices  and conditions is to create an unacceptable  risk that counterfeit, adulterated, misbrand ed, subpotent, or expired drugs will be sold  to American consumers.  price~  SEC. 3. REIMPORTATION.  Section 801 <21 U.S.C. 381) is amended by  redesignating subsection  (d) as subsection  (e) and by inserting after subsection (c) the  following:  ""(d)( 1) Except as provided  in paragraph  (2), no drug subject to section 503(b) which  is manufactured  in a State and exported  may be  imported  into  the United States  unless the drug is imported by the person  who manufactured the drug.  ""(2) The Secretary may authorize the im portation of  a  drug  the  importation of  which is prohibited by paragraph < 1) if the  drug  is  required  for  emergency medical  care."".  SEC. 4. SALES RESTRICTIONS.  Section 503 <21 U.S.C. 353) is amended by  adding at the end the following:  ""(c)(l) No person may sell, purchase, or  trade or offer to sell, purchase, or trade any  drug sample. For purposes of this paragraph  and subsection (d), the term 'drug sample'  means a unit of a drug, subject to subsection  (b), which is not intended to be sold and is  intended to promote the sale of the drug.  Nothing in this paragraph shall subject an  officer or executive of a drug manufacturer  or distributor to criminal liability solely be cause of a sale, purchase, trade, or offer to  sell, purchase or trade in violation of this  paragraph by other employees of the manu facturer or distributor.

634,1223,8,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Chairman, I just  wanted to talk for a couple of minutes  about the ABM Treaty and about the  language regarding the ABM Treaty  that is in this particular bill, and also  about  the number of programs that  have been cut from what the commit tee felt was important and what the  administration felt was  important in  the defense bill this year.  To start with, let me just reiterate  what I spoke about with the ranking  Member, the gentleman from Alabama  [Mr. DICKINSON] and that is that we  formed  a  policy  committee  in  the  Committee on Armed Services  this  year  to build the defense authoriza tion bill from the ground up, and that  meant that we elicited testimony from  experts on sealift requirements, airlift  requirements,  the  situation  in  the  Middle East, the submarine capability,  our  strategic  systems  vis-a-vis  the  Soviet Union, and all areas of defense  so that we might build a defense bill  that simply was not a  reiteration of  President Reagan's bill.  We did not know where  that was  going to go, but we did meet after this  testimony had been elicited and after  this committee had been put together,  and that was its charter, so the Armed  Services Committee could really build  a defense authorization bill out of the  threat and out of our analysis of the  threat, rather than simply reacting to  a number that the White House gave  us.  After  this was done and we met  again, it was the consensus of the com mittee that the President's 3-percent  real growth, which I believe was $312  billion, was the minimum required to  defend America. That was the consen sus, as I understand it, and I hope that  the committee chairman will set me  right if I am incorrect. That was the  consensus, not on the Republican side  but on the Democratic side, and it i,n cluded the chairman of the committee.  The chairman,  the gentleman  from  Wisconsin [Mr. AsPIN] felt that we did  need a 3-percent real growth to defend  America, and that President Reagan's  request this year was not an unreason able  request,  it was something that  was necessary.  After that we came up with the posi tion that was put forth by the Budget  Committee of the House that passed  on the floor, and that was essentially  $288.7  billion,  representing  a  fairly  major cut. One point that I would like  to make to the full House is that this  number did not come from eliciting  this testimony, the testimony that the  Committee on Armed Services went  through. It did not come from a com parison of the strategic forces of the  United  States  vis-a-vis  the  Soviet  Union. It did not come from airlift re quirements and sealift  requirements  versus what we have today. It did not  come  from an analysis of American  mobility requirements  in the Middle  East and Europe. It came as a rather  arbitrary  figure  that was  offered  strictly  because  of  budgetary  re",1987

636,1236,8,Mr. DARDEN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the chairman for yielding time  to me.  Mr. Chairman, for the past 4 years,  it has been my privilege and opportu nity  to serve on  the Committee on  Armed Services,  and  specifically,  to  serve on  the Subcommittee on Re search  and Development with  the  Honorable MELVIN  PRICE  of  Illinois  and the ranking minority member, the  gentleman from Alabama [Mr. DICK INSON].  This has been a very wonderful ex perience for me to have an opportuni ty to see first hand how our military  procurement is begun at the research  and development level.  At this time, I would like to issue a  report on behalf of our chairman, the  gentleman from  Illinois  [Mr. PRICE],  outlining briefly the activities of this  committee to be found in this bill.  FLOOR STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE MELVIN  PRICE OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  SUBCOMMITTEE  ""Mr. Chairman,  the administration  requested $43.7 billion for the Depart ment of Defense fiscal year 1988 re search, development, test, and evalua tion program. This represents a sizable  increase over the $35.8 billion appro priated by the Congress for the fiscal  year 1987 RDT&E program.  ""In  consideration  of  Gramm Rudman-Hollings and the present situ ation with  the Federal deficit,  the  committee could not endorse the ad ministration's request  for 18-percent  real growth  in  the  fiscal year 1988  RDT&E program.  ""The committee recommends reduc ing  the  administration's request by  $7.9 billion for several significant rea sons.  ""First, in several areas the Depart ment of Defense wanted to pursue re search and development at  the ex pense  of  on-going  production  pro grams. The most notable example was  the decision to begin the phase out of  the Army's AH-64 Apache Helicopter  line. Accordingly,  the committee did  not support the Army's light helicop ter experimental  [LHXJ program  in  consideration of the fact that several  hundred million dollars would be rec ommended for addition to the procure ment account to ensure continuation  of the Army's first line helicopter pro grams.  ""The second reason for the commit tee's mark stems largely from the fact  that the dollars that we approve today  for research and development gener ate a requirement for tens of dollars  within a 5to 10-year period. There is  a perception that in the Department  of Defense research and development  program the services are trying to exe cute  too many  programs-some  of  which are ""nice to have"" rather than  pursuing fewer programs that are ab solutely essential in a more efficient  manner.  ""There has been far too much dupli cation of effort  in  the defense  re search program and  it  is  imperative  that we eliminate needless redundancy  and improve the return on our defense  research investment.  ""The more significant actions taken  by  the  committee  in  reaching  this  level included a reduction of $1.7 bil lion from the administration's request  of $5.2 billion for the strategic defense  initiative [SOil; a reduction of $106.0  million from the request of $356 mil lion for  the Antisatellite Program, a  reduction of $227 million from the re quest of $402 million for the light heli copter experiment [LHX] program; a  reduction of $200 million from the re quest of $1.2 billion for the C-17 air craft; and a reduction of $342 million  from the request of $592 million for  the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile  Alternate Basing Program. The com mittee  recommended deletion of all  funds for the Army's Aquila and Patri ot Antitactical Missile Systems, and  the Navy's Advanced Anti-Aircraft  Missile,  Airship,  Advanced  Light weight Torpedo and Battle Group Pas sive Horizon Extension System Train er. The committee recommended  in creasing authorization for the conven tional defense initiative [COil by $328  million, university research  initiative  [URI] by $107 million, and  the ad vanced attack submarine by $100 mil lion. The committee also recommend ed authorization of $2.9 billion of the  $44.2 billion requested for fiscal year  1989  primarily  for  the  technology  base, 6.1 and 6.2, activities.  ""The committee made a number of  'efficiency' adjustments-most notably  in the areas of tactical fighter aircraft  and electronic warfare.  ""Mr. Chairman, I have highlighted  the more significant actions taken by  the committee.""  However, many changes were made,  and the reason we were able to make  these changes, I think, and stay within  budget, was because of  the  tremen dous amount of cooperation exhibited  by both  the majority and minority  members of this committee.  We work together as a team, and I  think we have an effort of which we  can all be proud.  I ask that my colleagues join us in  passing the recommendations of  the  Subcommittee on Research and Devel opment.  ",1987
637,1249,8,The SPEAKER pro tempore., Under  a previous order of the House the gen tleman from Texas [Mr. GoNZALEZ]  is  recognized for 60 minutes.  ,1987
638,1249,8,Mr. GONZALES.," Mr. Speaker, it cer tainly is not my intent to importune  the House for a full hour and it will  not be difficult to add to the discus sion on what I guess this would be the  impeachment of Ronald Reagan No. 7  because of the fact that the introduc tion  of House Resolution  111  on  March 5 which included seven particu lar bills of impeachment or recitals of  particulars was introduced in the clear  prediction  that  the President would  utilize an invasion of Nicaragua in the  very near future.  0 1720  I predicted that at the beginning of  this summer, and it looks as if that is  about the way we are going.  The Congress, having very much ab rogated a very serious  responsibility  under the Constitution to exact from  the President, complying with its own  laws, which he  is under his oath of  office charged  to execute  faithfully,  and second, the flouting of our Consti tution, also contained in his oath as  President, to uphold the Constitution,  and the oath we take to defend that  same Constitution against foreign, as  well as domestic, enemies of that Con stitution.  This  is what makes the difference  between our systems and those that  perhaps have prevailed in other coun tries. When the President, through his  Secretary of State, the first one, Gen eral Haig, pronounced the fact that he  would soon be having the equivalent  of these  juntas, military juntas that  we are so accustomed to reading in his tory, and even to the present day in  some  other  less-happier  benighted  lands,  it was obvious to me that we  had our job cut out for us in the Con gress.  Perhaps I am more sensitive than  the average because I am the offspring  of a family that fled the parent coun try because of  the customary occur rence  into  the constitutional  rights,  such as  they were,  reflected  in  the  Constitution of that republic, and for  which  it was  taken for granted and  where  life,  limb,  and  every  other  earthly possession was at the mercy  and the whim of powerful usurpers of  those constitutions.  The times are on us, and in fact, the  President today, as reflected on page 1  of the Dallas Morning News, in an ar ticle entitled ""Continual Contra AidReagan Says,"" and it has a New York  byline, and it ends up saying that the  President,  even  though he  is  in  a  tough position with  the continuing  revelations of the rather malodorous  so-called Iran connection scandal,  is  saying  that we have  to pursue  the  course that I have predicted is inexo rable with him, that unless the Con gress deters, unless the Congress says,  as it should have done several years  ago,  ""Mr.  President,  the Congress  hasn't declared war. Under our Consti tution, only the Congress can do that,  so you stop making war,"" as he has  been doing for the past 5 or 6 years in  Central America and in other parts of  the world.  In  this  article  here,  it  quotes,  Reagan said  that  the Contras offer  ""the only political alternative to the  dictatorship of the past and the com munism of today."" This is so unbeliev ably a misstatement and a mispercep tion that it is hard to believe that it  could  be  attributed  to  a  national  leader.  In the Christian Science Monitor for  Monday, April 20, on page 12, there is  one more reflection of the total disar ray of this group that the President  refers to as the Contras, or the rebels.  It is entitled, ""Revelations About Hon duran Role in Contra War Fuel Oppo sition."" The article says that we have  subborned, we have occupied and we  have, in effect, raped one of our neigh bors in Central America, the Republic  of Honduras. It quotes a former head  of the military ruling body a few years  ago, in which he charges that our CIA  and our officials, both State Depart ment officials as well as others, have  literally infiltrated every level of Hon duran Government and,  in fact,  it is  an occupied country.  I pointed out that when I found out  on March 5 that the President was in tending to send 50,000 of our troops,  soldiers into Honduras this month, as  it is already, that I  felt  impelled at  that point to introduce the impeach ment resolution.  I have had some reaction and I am  awaiting further reaction from some  of  the subcommittee chairmen who  possibly could exert some jurisdiction  if they can find a manner of doing it.  The truth of the matter is that our  country is bent on a continued course  that unquestionably is going to be cat astrophic in its ultimate results. It is  going to involve us in a continual guer rilla war with all of the nations, not  with  just one country, whether it is  Nicaragua or El Salvador, but all of  the countries in that entire region.  In fact, throughout South America,  down the line from Isthmus, there is  great, great concern and hatred of the  United States because of its policies,  because of the fact that even though  as much as many of the leaders of the  South American countries do not and  are not congenial, do not agree and are  not congenial with  the approach of  the present Nicaraguan Government,  they detest more our occupation, our  ongoing war, our mixing into the in ternal affairs of these nations. They  always fear that we will in theirs be cause our history  in that respect  is  rather dreary.  There is no question that, with the  President's restatement of his inflexi ble, unchanging  intention,  that will  lead  to a direct  intervention on our  part and which will be done at great  cost of blood and treasury. I think my  colleagues should realize that Nicara gua is not Grenada and that, for the  first time, we will be confronted. with  the major dimensions of a costly war.  We must never forget, as disastrous as  the  results were  in South Vietnam,  where  the fact situations were very  little different, the fact remains that  never were we ever challenged in the  skies. We never heard of North Viet namese  or Communist Vietnamese  bombing  our  troops  or  strafing  through helicopters or any other way.  This will not be the case in the new  war. Even at that, we could not con quer in Southeast Asia because it is  obvious that under the circumstances  that we have  involved ourselves, we  have done so with the thought, the  mistaken notion,  the  fallacious con~  cept that we can, through purely mili tary means come out the winners or  triumphant in a civil war in an indige nous situation in which we go in and  try  to  take sides and dominate and  impose our will.  0 1730  It never has really happened in man kind's history, and I do not see any  reason why it would not, atomic bomb  or no atomic bomb. But what I think  is the most shameful thing is that the  administration and President Reagan  are acting contrary to the great tradi tion and the history and the honor of  this country, for he openly has advo cated and he has openly solicited arms  help and aid in violation of our Neu trality Act. The express terms of the  Neutrality Act are limpidly clear. He is  against a government that he himself  and his  administration proclaims  is  the legitimate government with whom  we are at peace, because we have a  duly accredited ambassador in Mana gua who  is  there  to  testify  to  the  world that he as our emissary recog nizes the government as the legitimate  government and one with whom we  are ostensibly supposed to be at peace.  We have been found guUty of acts of  state terrorism by the world tribunal  of  justice,  the World Court.  It has  found us guilty, it has convicted us, it  has imposed a fine, and we thumb our  nose at world  law and order. As  a  matter of fact, we walked out of the  Court. Our country happily was one of  those that initiated it, but we walked  91-059 0-89-40 (Pt. 8)  ",1987

641,12,13,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, every  day we  read  about  the difficulties  facing  our  financial  institutions  throughout the country. Despite these  troubling times, the North Carolina fi nancial industry continues to thrive.  Mr. John G. Medlin, Jr., chairman  and president of First Wachovia Corp.,  addressed the North Carolina Bankers  Association at its annual meeting in  Pinehurst, NC. John's remarks reveal  the quality of  the men and women  who run North Carolina's financial in stitutions.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that excerpts from his address be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the ad dress was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  THE CHALLENGES OF BANKING  <By John G. Medlin, Jr., chairman and  president, First Wachovia Corporation)  While banking  is  doing well  in North  Carolina and across much of the Southeast,  it has some troublesome problems in other  parts of the nation and in an overall sense.  We should be mindful that our challenges  in the times ahead are much the same as  bankers everywhere. To help put those chal lenges  into perspective,  I will  review  the  state of the financial system and economy  and then offer some suggestions to maintain  the exceptional record of banking in our  state.  The cumulative effects of three progres sively  severe business  and money  cycles  since the late sixties have left the financial  system in a fragile and vulnerable state. The  underpinnings have been weakened, and the  ability  to withstand has been diminished.  The principal villain was  inflation, which  periodically throughout history has wrecked  the financial system.  The price spiral from the late sixties to  the  early  eighties  produced  a  financial  ""high."" Lenders felt euphoric as loans grew  rapidly. Risk management practices gradu ally were relaxed, and weak credits were ob scured or bailed out by the fast-rising value  of real estate, petroleum, commodities, and  other collateral.  The inflation cycle caused the volume of  financial  services business  to grow at  a  strong rate for an extended time. Banks and  other financial services providers expanded  rapidly. Like some other fields such as air lines,  service capacity and  fixed  expense  rose substantially. l.ow-cost producers like  money market func. 5 began to emerge and  take market share.  In  the early eighties,  the relaxation of  lenders was replaced by shock as inflation  decelerated and prices even declined in some  sectors. Loans made on the expectation of  continued inflationary growth became prob lems. As has been the experience through out history the winding down phase of the  inflation cycle was the most damaging for  the financial system. Disinflation weakened  loan portfolios,  strained capabilities, and  eroded capital structures.  A notable example  is  the  farm  credit  system which has debts of around $90 bil lion, nearly  twice  the estimated current  value of its assets. Also, the resources of the  Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corpo ration have been depleted by failed mem",1987

What is  really  in  need of repair is some leadership on  Capitol Hill and down  in the White  House that will say, ""Let's make the  right decisions and reduce these defi cits.""  Giving a constitutional amendment  to balance the budget to this President  will mean nothing. Why? Because he  has already had seven opportunities to  present a balanced budget, and he has  not presented one yet. But he wants a  constitutional  amendment  for  the  next person who sits  in  the White  House, not for him.  What about a line-item veto, which  would badly bring into imbalance the  constitutional  checks-and-balances  system? Would it mean that he would  strike educational programs, health care programs, as he did in his budget?  No, I do not think that is the solution.  What we really need is some leader ship on all sides of the aisle, and also  down at the White House,  that will  say, ""Let's come up with a deficit-re duction plan.''  Until we have that leadership from  my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle who voted ""present"" as we wrote  the budget  in committee  and who  voted against practically every alterna tive, I say that this is the best vehicle  that says, ""Mr. President,.if you want  I  more defense, pay for it. If you want  lower deficits, here it is, it is up to you.  And if you want lower spending, it is  up to you also.""  I urge Members to vote for the rule  and  also  for  this  deficit-reduction  plan, the comprehensive approach and  a balanced approach for 1988.  ",1987
648,90,13,Mr. LATTA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 4  minutes to the gentleman from Ten nessee [Mr. SuNDQUISTl.  ",1987
649,90,13,Mr. SUNDQUIST.," Mr. Speaker,  rise  in strong opposition to the rule  and  to  the 1988 budget conference  agreement.  Mr. Speaker,  for  the past several  weeks, we've been watching the clash  of priorities within the leadership con trolling  the budget conference com mittee. The  issue  today  is not  the  President or the Vice President,  the  issue today is the 1988 budget confer ence agreement.  For  the past  several months, we  have witnessed the partisan lambast ing of the President's budget and the  President's priorities. Even the great  economic growth  that the President  created in his administration cannot  outdistance the big spenders  in this  House.  For the past several years now, we've  heard the attacks on deficit spending  from the born-again budget balancers  in the Congress. If only they regained  their chance to fully govern the Con gress, we were  told, deficit spending  would stop dead in its tracks. ""Words  are not enough,"" we were told. ""What  counts is action.""  Well, the time for action arrived on  the day the conference convened. And  after a month of inaction, the moment  of truth arrived last week.  We were promised a budget agree ment which ratchets down the size of  Government.  Instead, we have been  presented with a budget that increases  domestic spending $47 billion above  fiscal year 1987-and $38 billion above  President Reagan's budget.  We were promised an end to ""smoke and-mirrors""  deficit-reduction  tech niques. Instead, we've been presented  with $7.2 billion in accounting changes  that cut the deficit on paper only.  We were promised ""truth in budget ing."" Instead, we've been presented a  budget using clearly outdated econom ic assumptions.  We were promised a document that  makes the tough choices necessary to  hammer away at the deficit. Instead,  we've been presented an agreement  that terminates not a single Federal  program;  that  increases  outlays  at  almost twice the rate of speed as last  year; and that threatens to raise taxes  on lowand middle-income Americans  before  the  ink  even  dries  on  tax  reform.  Finally, we were promised a respon sible defense budget based on the Na tion's national security needs-not pol itics. Instead, Congress will today rubberstamp a document that holds our  national security hostage to a political  blackmail scheme. In return for $7 bil lion  in outlays that would allow no  real growth in defense spending, the  President would have to agree to more  than $64 billion in taxes. Even more  distressing is the prospect that if the  President pays the ransom, theres no  guarantee he'd get the hostage. In the  past 5 years, Congress has shifted $27  billion from defense allocations  into  domestic programs. There is no guar antee that once the $7 billion inflation  increase is allocated, the money would  be spent on defense.  For all of those  in this body who  have expressed condemnation in the  past year for paying ransom for hos tages, I ask: Is this a serious proposal?  Is  this a  realistic negotiating docu ment for the budget summit you want  to force? Is this the way Members of  Congress should set priorities for our  Nation's defense?  Mr. Speaker, this rule and the con ference agreement may make for good  politics, but a conference report on the  budget should reflect much more than  political defiance. We are told today  that we are voting on a budget agree ment that cuts the deficit responsibly,  fairly, and with accuracy. This agree ment does none of the above. As some one once said, Mr. Speaker, words are  not enough. What counts is action.  Taxes are still taxes. Taxes are still  taxes. And to quote my colleague from  Ohio-I  think  that  this  is what he  said-my own party  is playing  flip pantly with a  subject that our sup porters do not understand. Well,  I  assume that that means that our con stituents do not want a  tax increase,  but the majority party in this body is  going to force it down their throats so  that  they can  tax and spend some  more.

651,90,13,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  support of this rule and in support of  the conference report on House Con current Resolution 93,  the congres sional budget resolution for fiscal year  1988.  Mr. Speaker, this budget is far from perfect.  In particular, I am greatly concerned by what I  view as excessive  funding  for defense pro grams. However,  I believe  that on balance,  the budget conferees have done an admirable  job of crafting a budget that is far preferable  to  the President's  version.  The  resolution  maintains or  increases  funding  for urgently  needed domestic spending programs,  includ ing a major increase for AIDS research, edu cation and prevention. And it begins the proc ess of identifying the real causes of our Na tion's deficit ills and proposing substantive so lutions.  There is  incontrovertible evidence that our  Nation's massive budget deficits are the direct  ",1987
652,103,13,Mr. GRAY  of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen tleman from California [Mr. FAZIO].  ",1987
653,103,13,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, we always  stand and debate this bill in some sort  of a  vacuum,  and  I would  like  to  supply a  little bit of  the data that  ought to guide this Congress to place  this resolution in context.  Since 1981, when defense and nonde f ense  discretionary  spending  were  about equal in the Federal budget, we  have had the Reagan revolution. Sur prisingly, I am sure, to many Ameri cans, the fastest growing budget cate""  gory in the last 6 years has been inter est on the debt now budgeted to cost  $135 billion. There has been a 53-per cent  increase  in that category since  1981.  The next fastest growing category of  our Federal budget, of  course, has  been defense, with a 40-percent  in crease in outlays since 1981. Spending  on entitlements-Social Security, Med icare, and other non-means-tested en titlements for  retirees are about 69  percent  of  our  overall  entitlement  spending-has gone up 21 percent, and  spending on the other entitlements for  the poor, those out of work, and for  our farmers has gone up about 8 per cent, and that despite the farm crisis  driving up the cost of the farm bill.  In contrast, domestic discretionary  programs, those things we think of as  the Federal Government-support for  the FBI, the Coast Guard, water de velopment, et cetera-have been cut  by  21  percent  since 1981; but  this  budget resolution puts a stop to those  kinds of spending priorities and sends  us back in the direction of balance. It  is a good attempt to start to reorient  our priorities, putting first of all as  our top priority-deficit reduction.  I think it is important to point out  that when President Reagan submit ted his budget to us back in January,  he  followed  the old priorities. The  President's 1988 budget did not  re quire any defense reductions to con trol spending despite the burgeoning  deficits. In fact he called for a 3-per cent  increase.  The  administration  sought spending cuts of almost $20 bil lion in domestic programs to pay for  the defense buildup.  When you place aside the asset sales,  those 1-year infusions of income and  revenue that delude us into thinking  that we have money to spend in the  outyears. This budget resolution puts  deficit reduction first, because it finds  $29 billion for deficit reduction, in con trast  to  the  President's effort  to  reduce the deficit by only $11 billion.  Mr. Speaker,  this  is a balance of  competing demands on  the Federal  Treasury. It is an appropriate fiscal  approach. It is a vision of the future,  not of the past. It represents where  the American people are today, and I  urge an ""aye"" vote by the Members  for this resolution.  ",1987
654,103,13,Mr. LA TT A.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Flor dia [Mr. MACK].  ",1987
655,103,13,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker, there are  many reasons why one could get up  here and rail against this budget, but  when  you  get  right  down  to  the  bottom line, the reason I oppose this  budget is that it just is not going to  work.  I hear Democrats  talking about a  $36 billion reduction. That just is not  going to happen. Why is it not going  to happen? Well, let us take a look at  the plan.  There is $19.3 billion in new tax col lections. The President is going to veto  that. You know that, I know that. The  revenues are not going  to come  in.  Therefore,  the deficit is going to be  larger.  For those who are interested in this  debate, let me put that $19.3 billion in  perspective. One would get the impres sion that the reason we have deficits  in this country  is  that somehow we  have starved the Federal Government  as far as taxes and revenues are con cerned. Do  the Members know how  much the revenues or the tax collec tions of the Federal Government are  going to increase next year, in 1988,  without any new  taxes? Almost $80  billion. Why is  that going to occur?  Because of new growth that has taken  place in the economy.  So I do not think it is necessary that  you raise $19.3 billion in new  taxes.  We ought to cut spending.  There is $7.2 billion in estimated rev enues to the Federal Government be cause of the refinancing of rural elec tric loans. Now, on the surface that  might sound good, that we ought to  reduce  interest rates on those loans,  we ought to give a break to REA. But  what happens is  the net cost to the  taxpayer over the life of those loans is  $15 billion, not a savings of $7.2 bil lion. So we are being told this year we  are reducing the size of the deficit $7 .2  billion because of the reduction in the  interest rate on those loans, but the  taxpayers are going to lose $15 billion  more over the life of these loans.  D 1600  Others say, well, we are going  to  have another $1.4 billion in new tax  collections because we are going to put  more IRS collectors out there. I think  there are many people who would say  there are enough IRS collectors out  there harassing the American public.  One more thing, $1.2 billion in as sumed interest savings because of the  $36  billion  in  deficit  reductions.  I  make my point again, that $36 billion  in deficit  reduction  is not going  to  occur. Therefore, there will be no $1.2  billion in interest savings.  Now, the previous speaker indicated  that our Democratic friends are not  telling us where they are making the  cuts. Well, one of the areas that they  have proposed, at least from what I  have been able to determine, is a $250  million  reduction  in Social Security,  $250 million. That  is,  $100 million  below what  the President proposed,  $100 million below.  Now, in order for him to get to that  number,  the President had  to  talk  about laying off 4,000 to 5,000 employ ees in the Social Security Administra tion.  ",1987

658,103,13,Mr. MACK.," If they are going to go  $100 million below what the President  proposed, how are they going to get it?  On the Senate side they said they are  going to do it by taking it out of the  computer account. Well, there is not  enough money in there to cover $250  million. On the House side, they say  they are going to take it out of the ad ministrative account. Well,  there  is  not enough money to do that unless  you are willing to reduce the number  of employees to 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, or  9,000.  The plan that they have put togeth er is wrong. It is wrong for America. It  is not going to happen, which I think  maybe we can all kind of have a little  sigh of relief; but the problem with  that is that we all are going to end up  with more red ink.  ",1987

Perhaps it would be informative if  we all just stopped, looked the Ameri can people in the eye and say, ""Look,  folks, we are doing the best we can.""  We have got to cut about $36 billion  from this deficit this coming year. We  did  the best we  could  last year. It  looks like that budget is going to end  I  ",1987

666,116,13,Mr. KOSTMA YER.," If we are not at  war with Nicaragua  and American  lives are not in danger, American Ma rines were mentioned, and we were not  at war, then I do not think it is any of  Congress'  business  to  decide why  Americans  travel  and where  they  travel. That is not our  judgment to  make.  The issue was raised as to whether  or not people go there to participate in  farm work, to raise food, which would  go to the Sandinista army, would they  be restricted from  traveling as well.  This is a very dangerous area. I am not  a  supporter of  the Sandinistas, but  this is a dangerous area in which the  Congress seeks . to limit the right to  travel.

668,116,13,Mr. DORNAN of California.," My col leagues, we are in a very dangerous  area and we are skirting all sorts of  issues here. But I  think that we are  going to need a bipartisan approach to  decide what we are going to do about  wars of liberation, and that is what  the  to  they are described as on both sides,  and whether it is any of our business,  as the gentleman said, whether Ameri cans want to choose up sides, as the  chairman of my Subcommittee on the  Western Hemisphere began to discuss  on the Spanish Civil War.  Americans fought on both sides of  the Spanish Civil War. Only  the  strangely  named Abraham  Lincoln  Brigade gets lionized on national tele vision by Pierre Salinger. The other  side is not too well talked about, the  side that tried to stop the murdering  of the priests and the nuns.  Both sides of the Spanish Civil War,  both sides got into a rather ugly situa tion where both sides slaughtered pris oners wholesale. So there is not too  much pride to be taken on either side  of that.  Then about 2 or 3 years later one  American went over to work for the  Japanese warlords. She eventually did  time. We did not murder her or kill  her as the British killed Lord HaHa,  but we put Tokyo Rose in jail.  On the other side there were Ameri can military pilots deviously secunded,  Army Air Corps, Navy pilots  to  the  Flying Tigers  to get $500  for every  Japanese Zero they shot down. They  were fighting for China against Japan,  and there was no declaration of war.  In this Chamber we have a picture  hanging of a man that Robespierre  called  a mercenary,  Lafayette.

What this amendment then really is  about is that many of my colleagues  on  the other side of  the aisle are  afraid of the American people,  they  are afraid of people who have gone  down  to Nicaragua, have  talked  to  people, who have engaged in work pro grams and discussed with members of  the government all the different fac tions, and have come home and have  lectured  to  their neighbors  and  to  their congregations about how stupid,  how brutal the American policy is in  Nicaragua. What we now find is in the  most recent polls over 70 percent of  the American people oppose the policy  of this administration, and this  is a  last ditch effort by taking away Ameri cans' freedom to travel, their civil lib erties and the democratic institutions  to try to overcome what the majority  of the American people want us to do,  and that is to end this administration's  policy in Nicaragua.

The  truth  is nothing  could be further from the truth.  The simple fact is first that the ad ministration opposes  this  legislation  for whatever reason, it opposes it for  procedural and administrative reasons.  Secondly, the people who are push ing this amendment are trying to de prive American  citizens  of  human  rights that the administration is not  trying to take away. As the gentleman  from Florida  [Mr. FASCELL]  so  elo quently pointed out  the other day,  whether he agrees or not, the values  of pro-Sandinista Americans may be  appalling, but they have the right to  have those values.

712,142,13,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Speaker, over  the  last 2  years we  have  had  several major media  events where the vaults of sunken ships and  hotel basements have been opened before  live nationwide audiences. Some of the excur sions have yielded treasures beyond anyone's  wildest dreams, while others yielded nothing.  In any case, these discoveries have engaged  the public interest.  Today, I am suggesting a media expedition  to open the Democrats budget on live, nation wide  television. For  the good of the country  and for the benefit of the American taxpayer, I  call upon some enterprising  investigative re porter to explore the hidden passageways of  the Democrats budget for the next fiscal year  and  to do so before a  live nationwide audi ence.  Sneak previews provided by  the majority  party in the Congress suggest that such an in vestigation would  find  that  this budget con tains over $19 billion  in a new, unspecified,  additional taxes. Viewers would also find that  a hostage is being held in this budget. Specifi cally, the Nation's defense is being held hos tage by  the  tax  increase. Finally,  there  is a  back door in this budget. This back door will  allow Members of this Congress to  increase  the national debt ceiling  to an alltime high,  without as much as a recorded vote on this  issue.  Even this preview, however, does not reveal  all that is contained within this budget. Much  larger questions remain to be explored-what  kind of taxes will be added to the burden of  the American taxpayer, what impact will these  increased  taxes have on  the vitality of our  economy, what higher costs will  there be for  selected domestic programs, and how much  will our interest payments on the national debt  increase?  While American viewers will be  intrigued  with  this  latest expedition,  they will not find  hidden  treasures. Rather,  they will  find  the  same old tax and spend policies of the Demo crats and a few surprises such as the back door attempt to slip by yet another increase in  the national debt.  Mr. Speaker, clearly our budget process has  become like many of these sealed vaults with  the Republicans shut out of the process and  many  unknowns  lurking  behind  the walls.  June 23, 1987  While this kind of show may receive high rat ings, the real result will be increased cynicism  on the part of the American taxpayer.  The American public deserves an honest  accounting of our budget process and how we  intend to spend their hard earned tax dollars.  If new  taxes are being proposed,  then be  honest and tell the American public how they  are going to be taxed. If you're going to slash  the Nation's defense spending, then say so. If  you're going  to support  increased domestic  spending  through  increased  taxation,  then  admit it. If you're going to try to reach the def icit reduction  target,  than do so  through real  budgeting rather than creative accounting.  I made a commitment several weeks ago to  withhold my support of any  increase  in  the  debt ceiling until substantial reforms are made  in this budget process. Budget process reform  has not been achieved and this budget resolu tion  fails  in every other  respect as well.  I  intend  to keep my promise by voting no on  this budget  resolution and  I urge my  col leagues to do the same.  IMMIGRANTS ARE A SOURCE OF  NEW ENERGY RATHER THAN A  BURDEN TO AMERICA  HON. STEPHEN J. SOLARZ  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 23, 1987  ",1987
713,142,13,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, much of  the  media discussion about the impact of immigra tion upon our society would  lead one to be lieve  that most newcomers  to our society  impose  further  burdens  upon  our  already  strapped resources. From my experiences, as  the representative of a multiethnic and multira cial urban New York district, newcomers con tinue to infuse our society with greater vitality,  intellectual vigor, business acumen, and cul tural riches which are a net plus to our Nation.  Even those who come to our shores as refu gees in a few years are contributing more to  our economy than they have received in ben efits.  One of the recognized experts in the field of  immigration in the New York area is Mr. Carl  Zuckerman,  the executive vice president of  the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. HIAS is an  outstanding  private  voluntary  organization  which has provided services to literally tens of  thousands of newcomers to the United States  for many decades and an agency which con tinues to develop innovative and cost effective  training and  resettlement programs  for new comers.  Mr.  Zuckerman,  no  stranger  to  anyone  active in humanitarian and philanthropic work,  now serves as the chairman of the Committee  on Migration and Refugee Affairs of  INTER ACTION,  the American Council for Voluntary  International Action, the U.S. umbrella organi zation of voluntary agencies. Carl was recently  interviewed, in his capacity as INTERACTION  spokesman on these issues, by a United Na tion's publication, Refugee Magazine,  to ex plain their views in support of increased immi gration flows to the United States and a more  generous and humane American asylum and  refugee policy.

714,155,13,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, on behalf of  Congressman STARK, Congressman FORD of  Tennessee, Congresswoman KENNELLY, and  Congressman MtLLER of California, I am today  introducting the Child Welfare and Foster Care  Amendments of 1987.  This  legislation builds upon  the  legislation  signed  into  law 7 years ago  this month by  President Carter,  Public  Law  96-272,  the  Adoption  Assistance  and  Child  Welfare  Amendments of 1980. That landmark legisla tion resulted from a number of years of con gressional hearings and research which found  that there were serious problems in the child  welfare and foster care programs in this coun try. The primary emphasis of that law was to  improve  service  to  children  and  families  toward the goals of preventing where possible  the need  for  removing  children  from  their  homes; reunifying families; or providing adop tion assistance to enable children who can't  return home, to have a permanent home.  The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare  Act has been an effective catalyst in encour aging States  to establish  laws, policies, and  procedures that encourage permanent families  for children. States now have an  increased  awareness of  the needs of children  in  their  care as a result of required tracking systems,  case plans, and periodic  reviews.  Increased  efforts  in States to promote  the adoption of  special needs children and to provide preven tive and reunification services reflect recogni tion of the importance of families for children.  Significant gaps still  remain, however, be tween these  laws and policies and the prac tices  involving  individual children at  risk of  placement or in foster care in the States. The  legislation we are introducing today represents  a significant step toward ensuring that children  actually receive  the help  intended by Public  Law 96-272. The bill will make a number of  refinements  in  the program  to assist older  foster care children prepare  for  independent  living; it requires health care plans for children  in foster care; provides assistance for special ized mother-infant  foster care programs;  im proves  training and support  for  foster care  parents and staff; and extends certain expiring  provisions of current law.  Every year over 460,000 children  spend  some time in foster care in this country. In any  1 month, approximately 276,000 children are  in foster care. A major goal of this legislation  is  to ensure  that  these  foster children ulti mately become productive citizens. Unfortu nately this too frequently is not the case. PerEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  haps no weakness in the foster care system  has been so telling as that of failing  to suc cessfully prepare foster care children for inde pendent and productive lives as citizens. The  abrupt termination of youth from foster care at  18, particularly when services aimed at pre paring  the youth  for  independent  living are  lacking, serves neither the goals of permanen cy planning, nor the youth, nor ultimately the  community into which he or she is tossed.  Our bill provides a remedy to the need to  extend and establish transitional  independent  living programs for older foster care children  in two ways. First it provides for a 1-year ex tension through fiscal year 1989 of the Inde pendent Living Program and allows States to  use their allocation under this program to any  child in foster care in the State which is under  the supervisions of the State. This is particu larly critical  in  light of the  fact that funds for  the Foster Care  Independent Living Program  were not released by the Department of HHS  until nearly 9 months into the fiscal year, and  the  fact  that  the original  law  requires  that  there be an evaluation of  the  Independent  Living Program prior to its reauthorization.  Second,  the bill provides  for  the continu ation of eligibility  for  title  IV-E  foster care  maintenance payments for children who have  been  receiving benefits under  title  IV-E as  long as  the child  is participating  in an  Inde pendent Living Program. This must  include  having  a  ""transition  to  independent  living  plan"" which, at a minimum, includes a plan for  education and  training activities. Participation  in a service program becomes a condition for  eligibility for foster care. Therefore,  the older  foster child must agree to and continue to par ticipate in activities which are intended to lead  toward a higher degree of independence. It is  a relatively small step in terms of needed re sources and organizational requirements but it  is a giant step  toward  improving  the  foster  care system and the lives of children it seeks  to protect and prepare.  A serious problem in  the Foster Care Pro gram  today  is  the  lack of a well structured,   comprehensive health care service  for these  children, many which have special needs and  may  require extensive medical care. Despite  the fact that all foster care children receiving  benefits under title IV-E are eligible for Medic aid and a number of States provide Medicaid  coverage for other foster care children, stud ies have documented  that many  foster care  children do not receive adequate health care.  A recent study conducted by the University of  California Department of Pediatrics states that  ""Although some counties  initially evaluate all  children by using specific protocols and exam ination sites, services are often poorly orga nized,  fragmented  and  inadequate  for  the  health care needs of the children.""  This bill would require a health care plan to  be a part of the case plan  for each child  in  foster care  in a State. It is particularly critical  to evaluate  the health status of  the  foster  child when  they  first enter care,  however,  given  that  these  children's caretakers and  places of  residence  frequently change,  it  is  critical  to establish a tracking system of that  child's health care history. The child welfare  agency and the foster care parent or staff of a  foster care  institution must assume  the  re sponsibility of managing  in conjunction with  17127  pediatricians and other health care providers,  the ongoing  responsibilities of arranging  for  and keeping track of routine health exams, im munizations, and constant monitoring of  the  mental and physical health status of a foster  child. Without  such  a health management  plan, many of our foster care children will fall  through the cracks.  While we recognize that children placed in  foster care bring with them a wide variety of  circumstances and needs, some of these spe cial needs were not anticipated under the cur rent Federal Foster Care Program. Such a cir cumstance  includes  those  cases where  a  teenage  foster care girl  is placed  in  foster  care with her own infant child.  Special residential programs for teen moth ers and their infants, including teenagers who  have been  removed  from  their home and  placed in foster care, involves care and super vision which is directed to the needs of both  the teenage mother and her child. However,  because of the requirement  in  the  title  IV-E  program that a child must have been removed  from  their home and placed  in  foster care  away from  their parent,  the infant of a teen ager in foster care is not eligible for federally  assisted  foster care under title  IV-E. This  is  the case even  though  the care of the  infant  may largely be the responsibility of the foster  care provider.  Prevention of still another generation of de pendency is a primary objective of specialized  foster care  for teenage  foster care girls and  their infants. Accordingly, the bill would amend  the current title IV-E statute in such a way as  to  recognize and provide additional support  for those programs which provide care, train ing, and supervision for adolescent foster care  children and their infants.  The bill also recognizes the ""unsung heroes  of the foster care system,"" namely those dedi cated persons  that are  frequently asked  to  care  for  troubled children with very special  needs without the training, adequate support,  or compensation  necessary  to provide  the  care they need.  It is essential that the care takers to whom  these children are entrusted  are adequately prepared  to carry out  their  task.  Therefore,  this  bill  requires  that  the  States provide, as a condition of  licensing,  training, and retraining for individuals maintain ing or preparing  to maintain a  foster  family  home and for members of the staffs of foster  care institutions.  While directly benefiting foster children, the  training provision envisioned in this bill should  provide other dividends as well. Providers who  have had  foster parent  training  indicate  that  placement failures are reduced. At the same  time,  recruitment efforts will  likely  be  en hanced by giving added confidence to those  considering becoming foster parents who may  be  inexperienced or hesitant about such a  commitment.  Last,  the bill would make permanent  the  provision  of  law  which  provides  Federal  matching  funds  for children placed  in  foster  care under a voluntary placement agreement.  This option for States, which expires Septem ber 30, 1987, has been used to a very limitei::I  extent-partially because of the hesitancy of  the States to establish mechanisms for such  voluntary  placement agreements given  the  ",1987
715,168,13,Mr. MYERS of Indiana.," Mr. Chair man, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan  [Mr. PURSELL],  who  is  a  new  and  very  valuable  member of this subcommittee.  ",1987
716,168,13,Mr. PURSELL.," Mr. Chairman, on  behalf of our subcommittee I too want  to congratulate  the gentleman from  Alabama [Mr. BEVILL] and the gentle man from  Indiana  [Mr. MYERS]  for  their outstanding leadership this year.  I as a new member of this subcom mittee, although not new  to Appro priations, have moved from the Trans portation Subcommittee to this excit ing  subcommittee which  has  great  staff on both sides. I think that there  has been a bipartisan effort, and truly  I  think that we are going to have a  great bill today.  I think overall when you look at our  future  research,  I  am excited about  our new alternative sources of energy.  I have been interested over the years  in fusion, both ICF fusion and mag netic fusion. We have not had great  progress over  the years in magnetic,  and maybe not even ICF, but it is rela tively a young, new alternative source  of energy for this Nation. I do think  that we are ahead of the Soviet Union  in  that technology. So  I do congra tuate the committee for strongly sup porting  research  at ' Sandia,  Los  Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and Ar gonne, and other  laboratories, KMS  Fusion in my district, and for those  who are turning out the bright young  science researchers who are looking at  new sources of energy for this Nation  and for the free world.  I  think that the supercollider is an  exciting project. The committee is not  making a decision on where it is to be  located. As Mr. BEVILL  indicated,  it  could be anywhere from $4 to $6 bil lion, maybe more, eventually  if the  Congress of the United States, OMB,  and the White House decide on where  to get the funds for that particular  major significant development in split ting the atom.  I do not know for sure whether we  can take money out of other research  projects and pay for this solely out of  the  lateral  transfer  in  the physics  budget within our committee. I think  that  the Defense Department  and  other agencies are going  to have  to  consider some sources of revenues to  help-maybe SDI and others-to help  look at this new supercollider if and  when Congress-both the authorizing  committee  and  the Appropriations  Committee in the House and Senate decide to fund it, because it is such an  expensive program. I would not want  to see funds diverted from other alter native sources of energy solely as a  single major national priority  as  a  super collider. I think that that would  be counterproductive to our energy al ternatives in the future.  So I think that we have a lot of work  to do with the Energy Secretary and  with our OMB officers Jim Miller and  his staff, and  the White House,  to  point out, not so much this year with  our $25 million, legislation and policy  decisions on behalf of all of Congress  how we are going to fund the $360 mil lion next year as the first phase of a  major construction site  if and when  that decision is made to go ahead and  build it.  I do not think that Congress is at  the point to make that final decision. I  am concerned that States like Texas,  who are willing  to put out up-front  money and $1 billion funding mecha nism, are going to compete maybe in  sort of unfair terms with some of the  smaller States who are now considered  not having an opportunity  to  raise  that kind of major capital at the local  level to help finance the super collider  project which I think 49 out of the 50  States would like to have.  So I think in the long term not only  would our own individual States want  to see that project, but I suggest that  maybe we work out a regional consor tium so that we have  the best sites  available that have States sharing in  the spinoff of  that  technology not  only the project itself but the thou sands of jobs involved.  I also want to congratulate the sub committee for their work on the Corps  of Engineers projects. It is only $3.2  billion .. I  think that that is a rather  tight, very conservative number in re spect to the corps simply because we  are trying, as the chairman said, to re build our infrastructure. We have 200some ports. We have 25,000 miles of  coast water and sea water areas that  we need to help attract our export in dustries  through  our  shipping  and  commerce.  I am interested in the St. Lawrence  Seaway, the fourth seacoast. Those of  us  in our particular region are only  asking for, and we put into this bill  through the leadership of the chair man  and  the  ranking  minority  member and myself, $50,000 to contin ue the study to look at the St. Law rence Seaway as a viable export corri dor for getting our products out over seas into the international competitive  world.  So I want to thank the subcommit tee  for keeping  that study open so  that the Corps of Engineers, the envi ronmentalists,  and other  commerce  oriented people can  look at  the St.  Lawrence Seaway as one of the great  opportunities  in  the Midwest  to be  competitive, not only with our south ern and western allies here in the con tinental United States, but the free  world itself.  I want to thank the subcommittee  for a tight budget. There probably will  be some amendments later in the day,  but as a member of the subcommittee,  I want to congratulate the subcommit tee for a fiscal responsible piece of leg islation. I am proud to be a member of  the subcommittee.  ",1987
717,181,13,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of  the amendment offered by Mr. KOLBE  on behalf of the Arizona congressional  delegation.  I would first like to express my ap preciation  to  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania [Mr. COUGHLIN]  for his  cooperation  and  assistance  in  the  preparation of this amendment.  I would  also  like  to  express my  thanks to my friend and chairman of  the Energy and Water Appropriations  Subcommittee,  the  gentleman  from  Alabama [Mr. BEVILL]  for his under standing,  assistance,  and  continued  support for completion of the central  Arizona project. I am grateful for his  cooperation, and that of the ranking  member of the subcommittee, the gen tleman from Indiana [Mr. MYERS]  in  helping the Arizona delegation achieve  a solution to our Cliff Dam problem.  I would further like to extend my  thanks and appreciation  to my col leagues in the Arizona delegation: Sen ators DECONCINI  and McCAIN, Con gressmen STUMP, KOLBE, RHODES, and  KYL. Their collective political  judg ment, conviction, and effort made pos sible the difficult and not altogether  popular  decision  embodied  in  this  amendment and in the June 18 state ment of principles.  Mr.  Chairman,  adoption  of  this  amendment will mark  the first step  toward  implementing  a  settlement  reached by the Arizona delegation and  a coalition of 11 national and local en vironmental organizations-thereinaf ter ""coalition.""  These organizations-Maricopa Au dubon Society, National Wildlife Fed eration, National Audubon  Society,  Sierra Club, Arizona Wildlife Federa tion,  Prescott  Audubon  Society,  Friends of the River, Environmental  Policy Institute, American Rivers Con servation Council, National Parks and  Conservation Association, the Wilder ness  Society,  and  Friends  of  the  Earth-have been united in their ef forts to wage a legal and political war  to stop construction of Cliff Dam on  the Verde River in Arizona.  Adoption of  this  amendment will  begin a process of ending this warfare  before it takes an increasingly greater  toll of time, energy, resources, and po litical capital which the Arizona dele gation needs  to pursue  successfully  other objectives beneficial to Arizona  and the Nation. Chief among these ob jectives  is completion of the central  Arizona project.  Cliff Dam is one of four structures  comprising plan 6, which  the Secre tary of the Interior selected in 1984  from among nine possible alternatives  to Orme Dam. Orme, a huge structure  authorized  by  the Colorado River  Basin Project Act of 1968, was to have  been built at the confluence of  the  Salt and Verde Rivers north of Phoe nix. In 1976, in the face of intense op position by an Indian tribe, environ mentalists, and the Carter administra tion, Orme was shelved, and a  long  process begun to identify a ""suitable  alternative"" authorized by  the 1968  act.  Cliff Dam became an object of con troversy for many reasons, in particu lar because of its potential adverse im pacts on Sonoran desert nesting bald  eagles and  their habitat.  Increasing  opposition from  the coalition  in the  courts and in Congress influenced the  delegation's decision to seek a settle ment that would eliminate the persist ent and serious threat which the coali tion poses  to  the continued funding  needed to complete the central Arizo na project as scheduled.  The essence of the Cliff Dam settle ment agreement is that in return for  the delegation's commitment not  to  seek funding for Cliff,  the coalition  will drop its lawsuit against the dam  and the other features plan 6, as well  as their efforts  in Congress  to limit  funding  for  the  central  Arizona  project.

718,194,13,Mr. WATKINS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words and I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, as a member of the  Appropriations  Subcommittee  on  Energy and Water, I listened for many  hours  to  the  testimony of my col leagues. I rise maybe from a little dif ferent twist on this overall situation  here today. I say to my colleagues I do  not  think we  should be  trying  to  repeal or destroy this particular legis lation before us  today.  I  think we  should be expanding  it across  rural  America.  Ladies and gentlemen,  today rural  America is in decay, just as it occurred  50 years ago in our country. During a  time when in many of the areas like  the Ozarks and the Appalachian area  moved  to  the urban centers  looking  for jobs.  I do not represent the Appalachian  area and I want my colleagues to know  that. But I know that today if they  will look at the facts we are seeing a  large out migration of our people still  leaving and going to the urban areas.  We are losing a value of life in rural  America which is vital to the long-time  existence of our country.  It is meaningful  to me.  I  do not  know if it is meaningful to most of my  colleagues, but I think we are destroy ing  the very  fabric of our country  when we see rural America being de stroyed and  the decay  taking place.  We have massive areas of the country  where we  find main  street  being  boarded up, closed down if you please.  We are seeing the areas abandoned be cause of  this destruction and decay.  We need to do what we can to help  these areas survive.  Mr. Chairman, I am not here just to  help the Appalachian area survive. We  need  to be looking at what I call a  Marshall plan  for  rural America.  I  think  that  is what we  need  to be  thinking  about  today,  just  as my  friend,  the  gentleman  from  New  Jersey [Mr. HOWARD], chairman of the  Committee  on  Public Works  and  Transportation said that his commit tee realizes that we get a return of $13  for each $1 Federal  invested. Ladies  and gentlemen, that is a good invest ment in anybody's book, whether you  are  in  the private sector or  in  the  public sector.  As our friend,  the gentleman from  Mississippi [Mr. WHITTEN], chairman  of the Appropriations Committee has  said many  times, we are seeing our  land destroyed, we are seeing the in frastructure destroyed, and we are not  investing back the very foundation of  the economic opportunities  for our  citizens. The Appalachian area is an  area that has many rural poor. An  area that needs a helping hand be cause a lot of the economic conditions  a  lot of  the economic policies have  been working against them.  I  think we  in this Congress, and I  hope my colleagues. whether they are  in their offices or on the floor, will  stop and  reflect momentarily about  the fact we are losing a vital link of  our  country,  rural America,  those  small communities which make up the  glue that holds our country together.  D 1220  Rural America, is agriculture but it  is more than agriculture? Are we going  to give those sons and daughters, the  people in rural America the opportuni ty  to stay  there and  live  there and  work there? I think it behooves us to  look at the merits of this legislation  and try to expand it into areas of de pressed  rural America  across  this  Nation.  I stand in strong opposition  against this amendment and I ask my  colleagues to vote against the amend ment but begin looking at a way that  we can expand it in the years ahead,  to areas like the Ozarks to give other  people  opportunities  for  economic  growth.  Let us provide a Marshall plan for  rural America.  I was impressed 2 weeks ago when I  realized  that we  invested-listen  to  this, 10 percent of our budget for the  Marshall plan  to rebuild Europe, 10  percent of our budget.  We reached for greatness and vision  in this country then, but today we are  trying to cut the very vital  lines of  support to build rural America.  I ask our people and I ask our col leagues to look to the future. Let us  provide a greater opportunity for our  citizens. Let us def eat this amendment  and let us build a Marshall plan for  rural America.  ",1987
719,194,13,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the requisite number of  words and I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, we hear some new  terms that are created on the House  floor. We have heard golden para chute  being  thrown  around.  Now  today we hear sunset being used rela tive to the Appalachian Regional Com mission.  I would  like to bring about  the concept of another  term,  that  would be the total eclipse of this mad dening defense buildup in this coun try. Every time we talk about dollars  for people we bust  the bank here.  When it  is $100 million for Central  America,  it  is  strategic  emergency  funds.  When  it  is  $200 million  on  the  strength of a 1-hour visit from Mrs.  Aquino, it is statesmanship and diplo macy. But when it is money for Americans who are suffering from the poli cies of this administration it is called  pork barrel.  The  finest  speech  I  heard  as  a  Member of Congress was made by the  chairman of our Committee on Appro priations on an amendment that ev erybody argued about for years,  the  Tombigbee. They are still arguing. He  said,  ""Go ahead and call me pork  barrel, but I didn't send this money all  over the world, I invested it in Amer ica and my children and their children  and our grandchildren are going to get  a job from it.""  Yes, we need a Marshall plan. This is  nothing in this budget; it is tokenism.  I am not from the Appalachian region  but when are you going to give to my  region if you do not deal with those  microcosms  in our society  that are  pained and suffering?  I  cannot  imagine  that  someone  would stand on the floor here and try  to act  like big cutters  to  save  the  American budget.  You take a look at the pork barrel in  that defense budget, it is ridiculous.  We are here today about a matter of  priorities. We must defeat this amend ment. And if we had some sense we  would be putting more money  into  these particular areas and making cuts  in others.  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr.  Chairman, will the gentleman yield?  ",1987
720,194,13,Mr. TRAFICANT.," I would be glad to  yield  to  the  gentleman  from New  Hampshire [Mr. SMITH].  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  I might point out  that in the budget that the gentleman  voted for and passed yesterday you  have $70 billion in proposed defense  cuts. Where are the cuts for these pro grams? Maybe we  could help  those  people in the gentleman's area of the  country if we did not have an Appa lachian Regional Commission which  dealt specifically, specifically, with one  region of the country.  There are poor people in other parts  of the country other than Appalachia  that do not have a  regional commis sion.  ",1987
721,194,13,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Reclaiming my  time and understanding what the gen tleman stated, in the last 6 years we  have doubled the defense budget and  we have basically taken the ""people""  programs in this country and thrown  them out the window.  Further reclaiming my time, the dis tinguished gentleman from  the Sub committee on Economic Development,  Mr. SAVAGE, made an excellent point.  Sometimes we have to look at those  other areas as well.  But what is the answer then? Are we  going to continue to just sent money  all over?  Seventeen billion dollars passed this  House last year for foreign aid on a  I  ",1987
722,207,13,Mr. BARTLETT.," I thank the gentle man for his comment. The gentleman  said it exactly correct. Members will  find plenty of reasons to vote against  this amendment. A Member can find a  reason that, ""Well, I don't like across the-board cuts."" On the next one, a  Member may say, ""Well, I don't like  cuts that make decisions for the Ap propriations Committee."" Others will  talk about the appropriations process  or  committee  jurisdictions. Others  may have a special project in this ap propriations bill.  There is really only one reason to  vote for this, and that is that it is the  only prospect that this House has this  year, this session, for achieving any where close to the deficit targets that  we  set  for ourselves. It is  the only  prospect,  it  is  the last train  that  is  leaving, and we ought  to pass  this  amendment on this appropriations bill  and each subsequent one.  ",1987
723,207,13,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I hope that having  adopted the budget resolution yester day the House will now support the  various appropriation bills which,  in  their sum, will be within the budget.  With all respect to the distinguished  gentlemen  who  are  offering  the  amendment  it  is  very  easy  to  say,  ""What is wrong with cutting another  1 % percent?""  Is there any level of public under taking,  theoretical or otherwise,  at  which somebody could not stand up  and say, ""Well, can't you cut it an other 1 % percent?""  Whether you cut something 10, 20,  30, 40, or 50 percent, someone else  could always stand up and say, ""It's  just another 1 % percent.""  It is appealing, I know,  to suggest  this as being very reasonable. However, we have an Appropriations Com mittee made up of distinguished Mem bers from both sides of the aisle who  have  already  devoted  extraordinary  amounts of time expertise, and effort,  within in the confines of the budget,  coming up with recommendations  to  bring to this floor.  I believe that it does a serious dis service,  to the chairman of this sub committee,  its  ranking  minority  member, the gentleman from Indiana  [Mr. MYERS] and the members and to  the countless hours of work that have  been done by the Appropriations Com mittee  to  suggest  that we  simply  throw away that work by accepting an  across-the-board cut, however small it  may be.  It is appealing, but it is wrong. As  the gentleman  from Wisconsin  [Mr.  OBEY] said earlier on this floor,  it is  destructive of the process. We cannot  expect the members of the Appropria tions Committee to continue perform ing the careful,  long, deliberate, and  hard work they do if they came to this  floor only to be told that they must  meet  another  1or  2-percent  cut  across the board.  It discourages their effort, does not  pay appropriate credit to their work or  knowledge, and is contrary to the kind  of process this House should encour age. I ask Members on both sides of  the aisle  to  show some  respect  for  their colleagues who, having brought  this bill forward, deserve our support.  ",1987
724,207,13,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Washington [Mr. FOLEY], our distin guished majority  leader,  is always a  difficult act to follow, but I think that  at this point in time is also an impor tant act to follow to understand what  we are doing here today.  Let me begin by saying that we are  not in any way, shape, or form attack ing either the Appropriations Commit tee or in particular the Energy and  Water Subcommittee. The gentleman  from Alabama  and  the  gentleman  from Indiana and their subcommittee  did exactly what they were supposed  to do, and I for one would not be in volved in this process if I were up here  simply to criticize this subcommittee.  The reason that the bipartisan task  force, the coalition to deal with spend ing, has occurred is because when you  look at the budget, we want to make  sure that if we do anything in 1987, we  make the decision to live within the  budget that we establish for ourselves.  Anyone who  followed  the  debate  yesterday  understands  that  that  budget assumes that we are going to  raise  revenue by approximately $19  billion, and we are going to cut spend ing by approximately $18 billion, for a  net deficit reduction of $36 billion.  The problem with  that recognized  by Members on both sides of the aisle  is  there is $6  to $7 billion in funny  money, smoke or mirrors, within that  package dealing with REA loan asset  sales.  All we are trying to do and the only  goal that we have set for ourselves is  to  bring  the  budget  appropriation  process back to the budget guidelines  of yesterday in real terms by making  up that $6 billion of smoke and mir rors. To do that we went through the  various 302(b) and came up with what  is necessary to get that $6 billion in  savings.  So this is not an attack on the ap propriations process. They are legiti mately and properly the ones in this  Congress assigned to determine where  to make  the  spending  allocations.  What we  are doing here  is  simply  saying that this Congress will insist in  1987 for fiscal year 1988 that when we  are talking about an honest budget, we  are serious, and when we set guide lines for ourselves, we are going to live  by them.  The chairman of the Appropriations  Committee, the gentleman from Mis sissippi  [Mr. WHITTEN], has said so  often when you get to the appropria tions process,  ""Now we  are  talking  about real dollars."" Well, that is why  we are here. We are not here to attack  the Appropriations Committee. We  are here  to simply make sure  that  through the process we deal with real  dollars.  It  is  indeed  a  tragedy  that  the  Energy and Water Committee is  the  first appropriation bill on this floor,  because it gives the presumption that  we are somehow disputing their work.  We are not, not at all. Everything that  they have done  is honest. You have  not heard one criticism from us of any  appropriation or any accounting used  by this subcommittee. We are simply  trying to come up with the $6 billion  in real savings necessary, and that is  still living by a hope and a prayer that  we are going to pass a $19 billion tax  increase, and I do not think that many  Members of either side believe  that  we are going to do that, but both of  those steps are necessary to have the  $36 billion in real deficit reduction.  This vote is not a vote for or against  the Appropriations Committee. This  vote is the vote on whether we are for  or against real deficit reduction.  ",1987

728,233,13,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  opposition to this appropriations bill. In the guise  of a funding bill for energy and water projects,  this bill comes before us with half of its funding  directed to nuclear defense activities. The larg est single line item in the bill is $3.8 billion for  ""nuclear weapons activities"" -an increase of  $131 million over last year's funding. There is  another $279 million for ""nuclear directed ener gy weapons""  to be used  in  the Star Wars  Program; anotller $4 73 million for nuclear test ing; and another $1.8 billion allocation for nucle ar materials production.  In total, there is over  $7 .8 billion dollars in this bill for military-related  activities. That is more than two-thirds of the  money we appropriate for the Energy Depart ment's entire budget.  The Defense Department gets the lions' share  of the money around here already. I don't see  any reason for us to throw still more money into  nuclear weapons production through the Energy  Department.  I agree that the peaceful use of  nuclear power, however misguided it may be,  should be in the jurisdiction of the Department of  Energy. But that does not mean we should hide  money for more and more nuclear weapons in  the appropriation for energy and water. Are we  trying to fool the American people? Let's at least  fore(.,  the Defense Department to pay its own  bills, so we know how much we are actually  throwing away.  The country should know what we are doing  in  this bill: We are appropriating here  today  the  funds  that will pay  for  the MX missile  system and for the destabilizing D-5 missiles  for the Trident submarines. And those deadly,  destabilizing, and devastating weapons all will  be passed under the benign  title of ""energy  and water  development  appropriations.""  I  think that is a fraud on the American people  and I, for one, will not vote for it.  There are some good things in  this bill as  well. There are a number of useful water  projects and funds for peaceful research in a  number of areas,  particularly projects  that  would enhance energy conservation. But we  should also note, as my colleague from Mas sachusetts tells us, that the committee report  accompanying  this bill endorses  the  recent  proposal by  the Nuclear Regulatory Commis sion to change the regulations on evacuation  plans  for nuclear powerplants. Many of us  are very concerned about what would happen  in the event of a nuclear power accident, and  the evacuation plan requirement is one of the  key safeguards against catastrophe. In practi cal terms, the proposed change would make it  easier to open up the Seabrook nuclear plant  on  the border of Massachusetts, without the  approval or participation of  the Governor of  Massachusetts. I am strongly opposed to such  a change in the regulatory requirements, and I  have  joined my colleagues  from Massachu setts in sponsoring a bill that would codify the  present rule.  Mr. Chairman,  in  the  spirit of open and  honest government,  I urge my colleagues  to  vote against  this bill. The engines of death  that are fueled with this appropriation are bad  enough on their own merits. They are doubly  bad when  they are funded deviously through  the energy and water development appropria tion. There are many worthy energy and water  projects that would be legitimate and valuable  investments in  the  future of our country and  that could be funded if we were to reclaim the  nearly $8 billion squandered in this bill on nu clear weapons and military activities.

BERLIN WALL RESOLUTION  ",1987

732,233,13,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  today, I have introduced a resolution  supporting President Reagan's chal lenge to Mr. Gorbachev to tear down  the Berlin Wall.  I am sure that many of you who  heard the President's recent speech at  the Brandenburg Gate were moved by  his eloquence and his challenge to the  Soviet  leader. Our President  called  this  upon Mr. Gorbachev  to ""open  gate,"" and ""tear down this wall.""  Those  among my  colleagues who  have visited the wall will surely agree  that its presence is an affront to the  dignity of man.  That  long gray barrier  is  a  cruel  monstrosity dividing the East from the  West. It separates families and splits  the German people.  Many brave souls yearning for liber ty lost their lives in vain attempts to  scale that wall to freedom.  More than anything, that structure  has come to represent the dark side of  man. It is a symbol of the mentality of  closed police states that choose to en slave and control men rather than to  trust and serve them.  I  am confident  that someday  the  Berlin Wall will be reduced to rubble.  Someday, that wall of shame will be  no more than a distant memory.  I call upon my colleagues who share  my vision about the wall  to  join in  support of this resolution.

734,246,13,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. President, Olive  Behrendt died on Thursday, May 28th.  Fittingly,  this  renaissance  woman  ended her life in Venice, a city steeped  in historical and artistic riches. Mrs.  Behrendt was a familiar face in classi cal Italy. But then, she was at home  on several continents,  in  the Holly wood Bowl as much as on the Grand  Canal. She counted among her friends  many of the world's most celebrated  musicians, along with movie stars and  other artists of  the first  rank. But,  first and always, Olive Behrendt was a  friend to all Los Angeles.  The daughter of a clothier father  and a Russian immigrant mother, she  was raised in an atmosphere of conti nental refinement. Her family spoke  French at home,  and Olive herself  learned four languages in furtherance  of the promising career as an operatic  soprano which she gave up for mar riage and philanthropy. In 1939, she  wed Los Angeles  insurance executive  George W. Behrendt. Instead of be coming an opera star, she became a  modern Medici, a patron of the arts  who  functined  simultaneously  and  brilliantly as a businesswoman, fund raiser, and philanthropist.  She was a mainstay of the Los Ange les Philharmonic Association, Plaza de  la Raza, the Norton Simon Museum,  and the Founders of the Music Center.  Not content just to promote life's finer  things,  this wonderfully warm  and  caring woman  promoted  life  itself,  both in her early work on behalf of  what were  then  two separate hospi tals, Cedars of Lebanon and Mount  Sinai, and later in her life as a gener ous benefactress  to  a Catholic Or phanage in far-off Salzburg, Austria.  On top of everything else, Mrs. Beh rendt was an accomplished horsewo man, a  jazz accompanist  to no  less  than Jascha Heifetz, and the first and  only woman in Venice to have her own  powerboat license.  Of course, in recalling Olive's many  contributions, we can hardly overlook  the Music Center  of Los Angeles  County  that was  among her  life's  great passions. For 30 years, she pol ished this brightest jewel in the cul- .  tural crown of southern California.  Her achievement ranks second only to  that of Dorothy Chandler, her close  friend.  It came as no surprise that when  Buff Chandler was looking about for  kindred spirits to share her dream of a  cultural hub for the City of Angels,  Olive Behrendt was one of the first  people to which she turned. For Olive  knew that the most sophisticated ar tistry depended in large part on some  pretty basic arithmetic. Because she  gave so much of herself, she was ideal ly  suited  to  solicit  support  from  others.  So many and so great were her con tributions to Los Angeles that she won  recognition by the Los Angeles Times  as Woman of the Year.  Mrs. Behrendt never fully  realized  her early operatic ambitions. But her  place in the artistic community is as sured. Her stage grew  to worldwide  proportions. Through a crowded life,  her virtuoso performance never wa vered, her energy never flagged. Her  enthusiasm and zest for life at 72 was  no less than that of the UCLA voice  major she was just a few quick decades  ago.  She will he remembered deservedly,  by friends and by the city she loved  and gave so much, with pride, with  love and with profound gratitute, for  as long as composers set emotions to  music and musicians play with love in  their hearts.  DIRK  KEMP VISION  FOR  BOISE  MAYOR  THORNE'S NEW  THE FUTURE  ",1987
735,246,13,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President,  it  is  always refreshing and exciting to see  new  leaders  emerge  in  the  public  sector. That is what is happening in  the capitol city of my State, Boise, ID.  Dirk Kempthorne was elected mayor  of Boise in November 1985. Since then,  the people of the ""city of trees"" have  enjoyed  and  admired  their  new  mayor's youthful vigor,  enthusiasm,  dedication,  leadership and unending  vision.  Despite Idaho's economic difficulties  due to its natural resource-based econ omy so heavily reliant on agriculture,  timber, and mining, Boise is a city on  the move with a dynamic mayor lead ing the charge for economic develop ment and prosperity.  An article and interview in a recent  Boise magazine highlights Mayor Dirk  Kempthorne's style and accomplish ments. Mayor Kempthorne  is a  real  credit to my State, and I am pleased to  share this article with my colleagues  and  ask  that  it be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  BOISE'S BIGGEST BOOSTER  <By Larry Munden)  The office of Mayor is an ancient and ven erable one. Even in small towns, it carries a  degree of prestige and is given its rightful  honors in local parades and celebrations even if the Mayor is also the local barber. In  a  city  the  size of Boise,  of course,  the  Mayor's job is a  full-time and very active  one which has considerable impact on the  way the City of Trees operates.  In Boise's case, too, most of us know the  Mayor primarily from brief appearances in  television news coverage or from articles in  the newspaper reporting immdiate events. I  was pleased, therefore, to have an opportu nity to interview Mayor Dirk Kempthorne,  to give him a chance to talk about some of  the larger issues that he feels are important  to Boise, about his hopes and aspirations for  our city, about the way he approaches the  ",1987

741,298,13,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, I yield  myself 2 or 3 minutes.  Mr. President, I enjoy the debate. I  enjoyed the way it builds on the first  speaker we had, the Senator from New  Mexico. He talked about the tax  in crease as the largest tax increase in  the first year. As the debate has pro gressed, it has become the largest tax  increase in history, period.  First in constant dollars, it is not the  largest tax increase in history in the  first year. TEFRA was higher. But if  you want to say that $19.2 billion is  higher in the first year than TEFRA  in dollars, maybe it is. TEFRA was $92  billion over  the  first 3 years. This  budget has $64 billion over the first 3  years. But license and rhetoric is free  around here and that is nice. I have  used it myself. I guess we all have. But  I like the way this progresses, how this  is the greatest and largest tax increase  and all these programs and outlays are  increasing.  Basically,  this budget,  this  resolu tion, has slower growth for spending  than last year's. When you take out  the asset sales,  it  is 0.3 percent  in crease  above  inflation.  Last  year,  spending grew by 1.2 percent above in flation.  The Senator likes to read his figures  and talk about the outlay numbers. It  has nothing to do with the fact that  you have a lot of growth in programs  based on formulas and everything else.  But the rate of growth is 0.3 percent  in this resolution above inflation. Last  year it was 1.2 percent above inflation.  So taxes are not as high as TEFRA;  the rate of spending growth is not as  high; more real spending cuts are in cluded in this bill, basically, than the  President's. But we can cut out and  call it anything we want to.  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to  the Senator from Nebraska.  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

All afternoon I have been listening  to these moans and groans and cries of  irresponsible  budgeting.  I  am  a  member of  the Budget Committee,  and I remember all during those years  when it was customary in the Budget  Committee to have different marks of fered by different Senators, Demo crats or Republicans. We freely debat ed.  Is there any way that the Senator,  as chairman of the Budget Committee,  has prevented the Republican minori ty from offering any kind of a total re duction  in  spending  that we  have  heard so much about on the floor of  the Senate this afternoon? How many  marks  did  the  Republicans  offer  during our deliberations on the budget  to make anywhere near the cuts that  they are  talking about making and  I  criticizing this budget for on the floor  this afternoon?

753,324,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Who  yields time?  ,1987
754,324,13,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I yield  myself such time as I may require.  One of the fundamental elements of  leadership is the willingness to face up  to tough decisions. Another aspect of  honest  leadership  is  the willingness  not to duck sensible if somewhat pain ful solutions. The Budget Committee  has met those requirements of leader ship-courageous  leadership,  honest  leadership.  This country is in a very bad situa tion. We have a public debt that has  more than doubled within the past 5 ¥2  or 6  years. Through 39 administra tions and 192 years, this country accu mulated a national debt of a  little  under $1  trillion. In fiscal year 1982,  the first fiscal year for which Presi dent Reagan was  responsible as our  President, we had  a  budget deficit  which, for the first time, was of triple digit proportions, $128 billion. In the  next year it increased $80 billion to  $208 billion;  the next year, $185 bil lion;  the next year, $212 billion;  the  next year, $221 billion.  We saw the public debt more than  double, so that it stands now well over  trillion. And  it happened on this  President's watch.  This  President  goes  around  the  country and he talks about the ""tax  and  spend Congress."" Well,  I  have  done my part of taxing and spending.  Those of us who have been here on  this Hill for any  length of  time all  have done some taxing and spending.  The American people have asked for  some taxing and ~pending.  Mr. President,' this President  talks  about a constitutional amendment to  balance  the budget. He  talks about  how things were when he was Gover nor of California. I keep hearing all  $2  these Presidents who have previously  been Governors talk about how things  were when  they were Governors of  such and such States. President Carter  talked about how things were in the  State of Georgia when he was Gover nor, and now President Reagan keeps  talking about how the California con stitution requires a balanced budget  and how, as Governor, he saved money  and turned money back to the treas ury.  Well, I was in the State legislature  41 years ago in West Virginia. We also  had  a  requirement  for  a  balanced  budget, but the State of West Virginia  does not have to bear the U.S. consti tutional burden to provide for the na tional defense.  It does not have  to  maintain a Federal postal service. One  reason why West Virginia was able to  balance its budget for a long time-it  is having real troubles right now-was  that the Federal Government provid ed a good many of the moneys that  were needed for our interstate high ways  and other programs,  and  the  same thing is true with California.  But the President goes around with  this old quack nostrum about a consti tutional amendment. I voted for a con stitutional  amendment.  I  probably  would do so again. But I can tell you  one thing, it will not solve this coun try's problems. It will take years for it  to be ratified if it is ever ratified by  three-fourths of the States.  So what we have here is a President  who will not play. And these  triple digit budget deficits have occurred on  his watch.  I voted for the tax cut in 1981, and  been sorry of it ever since. But I voted  for it because the people back home  said,  ""Give him a  chance."" Well,  I  voted to give him a chance. I voted for  that tax cut.  I have also supported his buildup in  defense. We hear our friends on the  other side talk about Democrats, how  weak they are on defense. I will match  my defense record with anybody on  the other side of the aisle, anybody.  As I said to the President the other  day when I was down at the White  House, ""I voted for Midgetman mis sile,  the Trident missile, the Trident  submarine, the MX, SDI. You had two  votes last year and you won by 1 vote  on each of those two votes on SDI. I  voted for SDI."" So I have voted for ev erything in the book when it comes to  national defense, but as I also pointed  out to the President, I am getting a  little tired of reading in the newspa pers where we are wasting all  this  money on national defense.  Look here in the newspaper, a story  that says one-third of our MX missiles  will not fire. One-third of our MX mis siles will not fire.  So  I  am beginning  to have some  questions as to just how wise we are in  judging how patriotic we are simply by  ",1987

In anticipation of such a budget resolution, I  conducted a districtwide poll  in  Iowa's Fifth  Congressional District and asked my constitu tents  if  they approved of a  tax  increase  to  reduce the deficit. They reply was a resound ing  three  to one margin against a  tax  in crease. Iowans in my district and Americans in  every  congressional  district  in  this  country  have demanded  time and again we put  the  skids on Government spending and higher  taxes. And what do we give them. A $64 bil lion tax increase.  Not only is this a bad budget, it shows bad  judgment. What it doesn't take into account is  that the people stand between this Congress  and this budget, and I guarantee you that it is  their judgment that will prevail.  A SALUTE TO DWIGHT E.

759,428,13,Mr. YATES., Very well.  Is the gentleman aware of the fact  that the total bill that we have pre sented to the House is $1 billion less  than the total was in 1981?  ,1987
760,428,13,Mr. UPTON.," Well, Mr. Chairman,  the point that I am trying to raise is  that we have got  to do  something  about this deficit and I think the gen tleman shares my view. I do not accept  $175 billion deficit for next year. We  have got to start somewhere.  ",1987
761,428,13,Mr. YATES.," I respect the intention  of the gentleman and I am not going  to press a number of questions that I  was going to ask.  I just want to say that with respect  to the hearings that I pointed out to  the gentleman, I sat in every one of  those hearings. I  listened to all the  witnesses  and  the  testimony  that  makes up  those pages.  I have  lived  with the Interior bill for 10 years as its  chairman and 10 years before that as a  member of the subcommittee. I have  seen  the gradual deterioration  and  erosion of  the  funding of activities  that make up the bill.  D 1445  In its wisdom, the House has added  units to the National Park Service. In  its wisdom, the House has added wil derness areas and forest areas.  In its wisdom, the House has added  21 new wildlife refuges. We have to  have people to staff those wildlife ref uges.  What I am trying to say is, I know  that these agencies are not overloaded  with employees. If the gentleman will  check the records, the gentleman will  find numbers of employees have di minished. I know they are not over loaded with appropriations.  I know also that the backlogs are in creasing. Deferred maintenance keeps  increasing on the units every year, and  I wonder how long we can continue to  allow the destruction of the physical  properties of the Government without  attacking  the def erred maintenance  backlog.  Usually we add $35 million for the  States' land and water conservation  funds. All of the Members are getting  letters from State land and water con servation agencies saying, ""What hap pened to the Committee on Appropria tions?"" We have no appropriation this  year for the State portion of land and  water conservation fund.  I just got a letter from the Governor  of my State saying: ""What happened  to the money? We need some money  for our State parks.""  I said, ""We do not have the money.  We struck it out this year.""  We have approved  this budget.  I  think it is a responsible bill. I think it  is not only a good bill, but I think it is  a responsible bill.  Take  the first part of the gentle man's  amendment. The  gentleman  wants to cut forest firefighting funds.  The reports that we get are that the  areas throughout the West are drier  than they have been in a number of  years, and that the possibility of the  devastation from forest fires  is even  greater.  I know the gentleman will say that  we could make that up by putting the  money in at a later time in the supple mental.  The  gentleman  from Texas CMr.  STENHOLM], our good friend, says, no  more supplementals; we do not want  any supplementals this next year. We  do not want to put money in for sup plementals either.  The gentleman gave us a  compli ment, because we put the money for  firefighting into this bill where usual ly we take it out of the bill and leave it  for computation at the time that we  have a supplemental.  I hope the gentleman's amendment  will not pass. I think the gentleman's  quarrel is not with our Appropriations  Subcommittee.  I  think  the  gentle man's quarrel is with the Committee  on  the Budget.  I  think you should  have moved to recommit the budget  the day before yesterday when it was  before the House.  ",1987
762,428,13,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1987
763,428,13,Mr. YATES.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  to the gentleman from Michigan.  ",1987
764,428,13,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  I think the gentleman has done a re sponsible  job firefighting and every thing else; and I wish that we had re committed that budget bill back to the  committee.  I wish that we would have had the  votes to do that.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman from  Illinois  [Mr. YATES]  has expired.  (By unanimous consent, Mr. YATES  was allowed to proceed for 2 additional  minutes.)  ",1987
765,428,13,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield further?  ",1987
766,428,13,Mr. YATES.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  to the gentleman from Michigan.  ",1987
767,428,13,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  That was not the case, and it looks  like we are going  to have a pretty  large deficit this next year, $175 bil lion.  ",1987
768,428,13,Mr. YATES., I share the gentleman's  frustration. We have a system in the  House that says that the Committee  on Appropriations is to be governed by  whatever  the  Committee  on  the  Budget does in terms of how high it  can go.  The Committee on the Budget has  acted. I voted against the budget bill. I  did not like what the budget bill had  in it. I do not know whether the gen tleman voted against it or not.  ,1987
769,428,13,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman, if the  gentleman will yield, I did.  ",1987
770,428,13,Mr. YATES.," We are together on it. I  did not think it was a good budget  either, but the fact is that the budget  bill has been accepted by both the  House and by the other body.  The fact is that the 302 allocation in  that bill will be filed by the Commit tee on the Budget by July 1, 1987. The  Committee  on Appropriations will  then divide the allocation among the  subcommittees of the committee, and  we are told that we will be within the  302(b) allocation as it will be finally  distributed.  In our subcommittee, we are  told  that we are within the outlay distribu tion that will ultimately be distribut ed. That is why I say, this is a respon sible bill.  I share the frustration of the gentle man at not being able to deal with the  deficit in another way. We think that  the country's best interests need the  amounts that we have set aside in the  appropriations bill; and I ask that the  gentleman's  amendment  be  voted  down.  ",1987
771,428,13,Mr. REGULA.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman,  I  understand  the  frustration of  the  gentleman  from  Michigan. We all have it.  We are concerned about the budget  deficit, and that is why it is difficult to  meet the responsibilities that are his torically those of the Federal Govern ment.  I do want to emphasize something at  this point, and that is that the activi ties governed by this bill will produce  $8.4 billion in revenue.  This is the sale of forest products,  the sale of minerals produced on Fed eral lands and various other activities.  The net cost of the bill before us  today to the taxpayer is $1 billion.  I want to also point out something  else; and that is, it has been empha sized before, that we are $1.4 billion  under  the 1981 bill  for  the similar  functions. While at  the  same  time  during that period of time, visitor days  to the national parks have increased  from 296 million visitor days  to 358  million, while visitor days to the BLM  facilities have gone up from 8.9 to 12  million.  What I am saying to the Members of  the House is, and in effect the policy  issues before the Members is, the fact  that while visitor days continue to go  up, while the demand on the facilities  at the parks, at the Forest Service, the  recreational  demands  at  the BLM  grow ever larger, we have reduced the  amount expended.  Illustrative of that is the fact that  the Park Service  told us  that  they  have $1.5 billion in construction and  maintenance that needs to be done.  We were  only  able,  because  of  budget constraints, to put in $86 mil lion or roughly about 5 percent of the  ",1987
772,441,13,Mr. STENHOLM.," I thank the gen tleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I concede all of the  valid points that the gentleman made  regarding this appropriations subcom mittee and its effort. I have conceded  it over and over again. The bottom  line remains, though, that the gentle man is asking, and does he concede  this: The $300 million that we propose  to save, we do not have. Agree or dis agree?  Mr. AuCOIN. Well, I would say the  same thing of the defense budget.  ",1987
773,441,13,Mr. STENHOLM., We will get  to  that one later. We are taking them  one at a time.  Mr. AuCOIN. How is the gentleman  going to vote on the defense budget?  ,1987
774,441,13,Mr. STENHOLM., Exactly the same  way  that we  voted  in  the House  before. What we are saying is that we  have to do it straight across the board  or we do not do it at all.  ,1987
775,441,13,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I will speak only a  brief minute. I am going to oppose the  amendment, because I think that the  committee  does  not  spend  enough  money. Last year the committee pro vided $35 million to local municipali ties to buy parkland. The committee  has eliminated all of that money. That  is a tragedy. Our great National Park  System, which  is one of  the  things  that we as Americans ought to be most  proud of in this country, magnificent  parks, are not going  to be able  to  expand because of this committee.  I  think that they have done their  very best, but I want to say that on  April 1-I want to speak to my friends  on this ad hoc Budget Committee-of  this year we had an amendment to re quire senior citizens to pay a  fee of  $10, a one-time-only fee of $10 to visit  the national parks, as opposed to it  being free, and it only got 43 votes.  I voted for it. In fairness to the spon sor of the amendment, the gentleman  from Michigan [Mr. UPTON] voted for  it. My  friend,  the gentleman  from  Minnesota [Mr. PENNY], a member of  this ad hoc committee, voted against  requiring people 62 years or older to  pay a one-time-only $10 fee to visit all  of the national parks. The gentleman  from Iowa [Mr. TAUKE] voted against  that.  I voted for  it. The gentleman  from Texas [Mr. ARMEYJ  I see voted  for it. The gentleman from Pennsylva nia [Mr. WALKER] voted for it.  We talk about requiring these pro grams to be paid for. I think that they  ought  to be paid  for. Here was an  amendment to require people to pay a  $10 one-time fee only for all of their  life to visit all of our national parks,  and members of this ad hoc so-called  Budget Committee voted against it. I  do not think that it is fair to come to  the well, cut these magnificent pro grams, not allow our National Parks  System to grow, and then when we  ought to have the courage to vote for  this one-time fee only $10.  ",1987
776,441,13,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I am part of the bi partisan coalition to work on deficit  reduction, but I am not self-anointed,  nor is any other member of our coali tion  self-anointed. Each  and  every  member of our coalition is elected to  this body by a district of approximate ly the same size as the districts from  which every member of the committee  is elected. I do not know how many  Members ran for office on the promise  that they would work toward deficit  reduction. It has been a very popular  promise on which  to  run for office  lately. I defeated a very popular in cumbent on that promise, and my con stituents took that promise quite liter ally. They expect me to be working for  deficit reduction.  There are two ways in which we can  do that, as we come to this body. We  might try  to effect some change  in  taxes, but I have had very few of my  constituents tell me that they want in creased taxes.  Nevertheless, I recall that last year,  1986, we voted for  the Tax Reform  Act. I consider that the most difficult  vote that I have cast in this body, and  I cast that vote under circumstances  as a person who is not a member of  the committee-and in which case  I  might have been a member of  the  committee, I would have been a minor ity member of the committee, and in  this body that does make a difference  with respect to your participation on  any committee to which you may be  assigned. So I was asked then to vote  on tax reform under a rule in which  no amendments were allowed to me as  a Member of this body.  So that left that side of the body off.  I had one action that I could take. I  am on the Committee on the Budget,  but the simple fact of the matter is  that the work of the Budget Commit tee hardly matters, because we have  something  called  a waiver  of  the  Budget Act, which we get in virtually  every rule that comes out of the Com mittee on Rules. So that really does  not matter.  D 1635  So it turns out that if you take your  promise to cut the deficit seriously for  your constituents, you have only one  place to work and that is on the work  of the Appropriations Committee. I do  want  to  say  to my beleagured col league,  the gentleman  from  Illinois  [Mr. YATES], and my beleagured col league from Ohio [Mr. REGULA]  they  did not ask for this fight. They did  hard work and they  tried. It is not  their fault that they are left within  the system of this legislative body to  really as it were take the heat. And  they have done so, I would say today,  in good nature.  I might mention  this  is  the third  year that I have worked on this appro priation bill. The first year  I  came  down here as a brandnew Member of  this body and I was going to make the  first  of my budget cutting amend ments.  I was  the  slasher. My col leagues will recall we had a very enter taining evening and I came down here  armed with poetry, poetry that was  not to my liking, and I waved it in the  air and I was outrageous. Because I  was so outrageous and because I raised  a stink we cut $22 million that night.  But do we really have to come down  here and make a scene about it, do we  really have  to come down here and  embarrass our colleagues, make them  wish we had not come down here? We  had a difficult night. I learned about  the system and I said we will be more  sophisticated about it and we will try  to be cooperative and work with more  people.  Do my colleagues know that since I  quit being outrageous what has hap pened to my success rate? It is going  down. So I do not want to be outra geous, but I am not going to quit.  We have gotten together, we have  worked and we have planned, and no,  we do not pretend  to duplicate  the  hours of work, the expertise, the expe rience of the members of the commit tee. But my colleagues will admit it is  a privilege to be on the Appropriations  Committee.  I  have  seen  far more  people ask to be put on that than I  have ever seen ask to be taken off that  committee. My colleagues and  I  all  know why it is so much fun to be on  that committee.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman from Texas  [Mr. ARMEY]  has expired.  (By unanimous consent, Mr. ARMEY  was allowed to proceed for 30 addition al seconds.>  ",1987
777,441,13,Mr. ARMEY.," Members ask to be on  that  committee  because  instanta neously when one gets on that com mittee  they  have  a  host  of  new  friends, and we all know why.  So I ask my colleagues to take this  work seriously. It has been explained  thoroughly. This is not the only com mittee  to which we  will  address  amendments. It will be all of the ap propriation bills. We will fulfill our re sponsibility, we will do it good natur edly, and we will do  it with persist ence. But we will ask for cuts here,  now and later.  Vote ""yes"" on the amendment.  ",1987

781,454,13,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentle man from New York [Mr. FISH] is rec ognized for 5 minutes.  ",1987
782,454,13,Mr. FISH.," Mr. Speaker, today I am introduc ing legislation to fill an unintended gap in the  Victims of Crime Act of 1984, a law of which I  was one of the original supporters.  In  that  important  legislation,  the Federal  Government committed itself for the first time  to help States financially in providing compen sation  to  the victims of violent crime. Al though,  there  were  several  requirements  under that law for a State Victim Compensa tion Program  to qualify for Federal matching  funds, we  intentionally kept  the  list short  in  order not to burden States unnecessarily or to  .d.  .  .  h  f  discourage  t em  rom prov1  ing v1ct1m compensation. We were seeking to encourage any  effort on behalf of victims.  One of the requirements in the Federal statute was that a State Compensation Program,  in order to qualify for Federal matching funds,  must  reimburse nonresidents on  the same  basis as it compensates residents for crimes  occurring within  its borders. However,  it was  called to my attention through the experience  of a New York resident with whom I met, that  some victims are essentially left without compensation, even if they are citizens of a State  .th   t   '  'f  th    f    f  w1  a v1c 1ms  program, 1  e1r v1c 1m1za ion  occurred either in a State without a program  or with a program that is unfunded. My proposed  legislation would  require a qualifying  State Compensation Program to follow its citizens in those instances.  Legislation  is already pending  in my State  legislature  to provide  just  this protection  in  homicide cases occuring outside of New York.  Whatever the outcome of that initiative, I think  the idea is a good one which certainly follows  from the original  intent behind the victims of  crime act and which should be made wide  enough to cover other violent offenses.  Mr. Speaker,  this measure deserves  the  d  I  I  support of the  ongress an  urge my co   leagues to join me in ensuring its prompt consideration.  c  EFFORTS TO SECURE RELEASE  OF AMERICAN PILOT  ",1987

784,454,13,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Speaker,  on Saturday,  June 27, I will lead a congressional delegation  to Africa to secure the final release of Joseph  Longo, a 33-year-old American pilot  impris oned  in Luanda, Angola and  to escort him  back  to  the United States. Mr. Longo, who  had been employed by an American  firm  to  ferry a small private plane from Wichita, KS to  South Africa, was detained on April 21 of this  year for violation of Angolan airspace.  Due to the lengthy travel time involved, I will  be  unable  to  return  to Washington  until  Monday evening.

786,454,13,Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  insert  in  the CoNGRESSIONAL  RECORD  for today, a letter from Clarence M.  Pendleton, Jr., Chairman of the Civil Rights  Commission to the chairman of the Judiciary  Subcommittee  on  Civil  and Constitutional  Rights regarding funding for the Commission.  In his letter, he asks the chairman where he  stands regarding  the  future of  the Commis sion. I think we all need to ask that question.  Mr. Chairman, where do you stand?  The text of the letter is as follows:  U.S. COJIOIISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS,  Hon. DON EDWARDS,  Washington DC, June 23, 1987.   House of Representatives,  Washington, DC.  DEAR CoNGREssMAN EDWARDS: In not providing funding for the Commission, Chair man Neal Smith's Appropriations Subcom mittee did not acquiesce  to your request  that the Commission's funding be reduced  to $45 million in FY 88, down from $11.7  million in FY 86 and $7.5 million in FY 87. I  am pleased with  the Chairman's decision  not to endorse your proposal. I suspect that  the reason for this was that he believes that  the Commission should be either adequately  funded, or not funded at all. That was precisely my point  in my  testimony  in  the  House and Senate on the President's FY 88  budget request for the Commission.  As you must know, a $4.5 million budget  for the Commission would make no practi cal sense. Assuming that Congress would  wish to maintain the current level of regional program staff, as well as the number of  those currently engaged in monitoring ac tivities, our budget officer has estimated  that a $4.5 million budget would leave seven  staff members to provide the management  and secretarial support for these functions.  In any case, a reduction-in-force of approxi mately 39 employees would certainly be re quired. One does not have to have indepth  knowledge of  this Commission  to  realize  that such an arrangement would be completely unworkable, and a waste of the taxpayers' dollars.  In realitf, this amount of funding would  be  just enough  to keep  the Commission  doors open, but not enough to produce any  substantive work behind those doors. Per haps this is your plan-to maintain a dor mant Commission throughout the remain der of this Administration.  Don't you think it odd that the President,  whom you accuse of being anti-civil rights,  requested a budget for the Commission of  $9.8 million, with no earmarks or restric tions, while you claim to be pro-civil rights  and have requested a further reduction in  appropriations? Regrettably, I think that it  is you who is anti-civil rights. It is certainly  not the President.  The beginning of the next fiscal year is  rapidly approaching. As Chairman of the  Commission's Oversight Committee, your  position on the Commission's future plays  an important part in these funding deci sions. Since the vote of the Appropriations  Subcommittee and all available facts dem onstrate that a $4.5 million budget is an un realistic  and  unacceptable  position,  two  choices remain.

799,480,13,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, let  me begin by congratulating Senator  BENTSEN on this, the first major legis lation he has brought to the floor as  chairman. Chairman BENTSEN took the  committee through markup promptly  and efficiently on a highly politically  charged  subject. He  skillfully  engi neered several difficult compromises.  He brought the committee closer  to  consensus than I would have thought  possible a few months ago. The 19 to 1  vote for this bill out of committee was  in large measure a recognition of and  compliment to the chairman's leader ship.  Senator BENTSEN's leadership on the  trade issue is not new to this bill. Both  he and Senator DANFORTH-among sev eral other distinguished experts on  the committee-have long been effec tive advocates in bringing to national  attention some of  the serious chal lenges confronting the United States  in the international economic arena.  The United States today does indeed  face major international trade prob lems. Some of our bedrock industries  have lost their edge in international  competition. At the same time, some  of our finest new industries, truly com petitive  businesses,  find  that  they  can't sell overseas. We are running a  trade deficit with more zeros on  it  than anyone could have imagined 10  years ago-or than most economists  would have considered sustainable for  more than a few months.  That huge trade deficit is being fi nanced by massive  borrowing  from  abroad, causing us to stack up debt to  foreigners at the rate of a few billion  dollars a week. This cannot continue  indefinitely. Leaving the next genera tion with a trillion dollars in external  debt is a cruel legacy.  Acknowledging  the existence of a  problem, however, we must not  let  ourselves be panicked into protection ism by grim statistics. On the con trary, it is precisely at this moment  that we should be working hardest to  open world trade, not close it down.  The fact is that, one way or another,  the United States will ultimately have  to pay off its foreign debt with a trade  surplus.  We are already headed in that direc tion. After months of waiting for a  weaker dollar to reduce imports and  increase exports, we  finally  see  the  trade  data  improving. The  figures  show  that,  in  real  terms,  the U.S.  trade deficit peaked in the third quar ter of 1986. Since then, the real mer chandise trade deficit has declined by  more than 15 percent. Measured on a  volume basis, between the third quar ter of 1986 and the first quarter of  1987, exports increased by roughly $15  billion while imports declined by about  $9 billion.  The figures show something else in teresting.  The United  States  has  during this decade experienced explo sive growth in imports; but it is the  flagging exports statistics that tell a  less well-publicized but equally impor tant story. In 1980, imports were 9.4  percent of GNP; in 1986, imports were  9.2 percent of GNP. During the same  period, exports fell from 7 .9 percent of  GNP  to 5.2 percent of GNP. Thus,  while imports have retained a relative ly stable share of GNP, exports have  dropped off dramatically.  So  the challenge  for  the United  States is not to concoct ever-more in genious ways of keeping imports out  of  our markets. Excluding  imports  would  only  lower  our  standard of  living and make our domestic  indus tries less competitive in world markets.  It would also guarantee that our ex ports would find rapidly shrinking op portunities overseas. The U.S.  trade  deficit cannot rationally be solved by  limiting  imports. Rather,  the  chal lenge  for  the United States  is  to  ensure healthy growth in our export  markets.  Can the trade laws achieve that? If  we are  talking about a  fundamental  correction  in  trade  imbalances,  the  honest answer is: No, they cannot. The  enormous U.S. trade deficit is driven  largely by broader factors: high real  interest  rates and  a  strong dollar,  Third World debt,  increased agricul tural self-sufficiency abroad, and so  on. None of these elements can be af fected  significantly by  any  amend ments to any of our trade laws.  But if we are  talking about incre mental  steps  to  expand markets  abroad, to pressure our trading part ners to eliminate unfair trade barriers  and practices, to promote the protec tion of intellectual property rights then  I  believe  the answer  is: Yes,  amending our  trade  laws can help.  That is why I have supported the en actment of trade legislation this year.  The bill we reported out of the Fi nance Committee does contain several  such  positive, market-opening  ele ments. First and foremost, the bill pro vides the President with a mandate for  the recently launched Uruguay round  of multilateral trade talks. Under the  bill,  legislation  implementing  the  fruits of those talks would be consid ered by Congress on a fast-track basis.  Presidents of both parties have con sidered this fast-track authority essen tial for serious negotiations with our  trading partners, who otherwise justi fiably lack confidence that the Presi dent can deliver on any agreements  made at the negotiating table. At the  same time, Congress has an important  constitutionai  role  in  trade  agree ments; so  the bill provides a  ready  mechanism for removal of  the fast track authority should the President  fail  to consult adequately with  the  Congress.  If there is one important step we can  take in this trade legislation, it is to  give a  strong push  to  the Uruguay  round talks. In a host of areas-disci plining agricultural subsidies, promot ing investment, protecting intellectual  property, expanding services  trade these talks hold the best hope for cre ating the kind of international trading  environment  in which  the United  States can prosper again as a great ex porting nation.  Some will say that there is no point  in entering new agreements if the ex isting ones are ignored or ineffective.  There is merit to that point of view.  The issue of how to respond to unfair  foreign  trade  practices-particularly  barriers to U.S. exports-is one with  which the Finance Committee strug gled over  the  last year or more of  hearings and deliberations. We debat ed repeatedly whether it makes sense  to require the President to retaliate  against unfair foreign trade practices.  I must say  I shared the concerns  raised by the administration and most  of our witnesses about truly mandato ry retaliation. It is possible  to con struct many hypotheticals in which re",1987
800,506,13,Mr. GRAMM.," What frightens me so  much about this new war against trade  is not that it is based on complete mis information and pressure from special  interests. What frightens me  is not  just because they want to lower our  living standard and cut our growth  rate. I hate that, but that is not what  frightens me. What frightens me  is  that this movement toward protection ism is a knife aimed at the heart of  America.  The way to lose the cold war is to  engage in a trade war. What we do in  impeding the free flow of goods and  services in this would is going to be a  movement aimed directly at offsetting  and eliminating the progress that we  have made in the postwar period.  I think that while this is a good bill  relative to the House bill,  there are  provisions  in this bill  that are very  protectionist.  What bothers me about changes to  section 201  in this bill is that it has  nothing to do with unfair trade. Sec tion 201 says that if a domestic indus try is losing the battle of competition,  and if the International Trade Com mission finds that domestic industries  are being injured, even if it is not from  unfair competition, U.S. industries can  then, by recommendation of the Inter national Trade Commission, have the  President mandate  relief  for  them,  except for national security or damage  to a downstream industry, and that in dustries can be protected for up to 10  years.  Tell me: Does anyone here really be lieve that granting an industry that is  not competitive, with no unfair trade  practices involved, granting them pro tection from competition for 10 years  is going to make them more competi tive? It is sort of like a football team  that is two and nine and saying ""we  want to call off the football program  for 10 years so we can get competitive  in football."" You become competitive  by competing.  The second problem is that while we  all know what special-interest groups  want these section 201 changes, the  GATT is very clear on this point. If we  come  in and  take a noncompetitive  American industry that is not suffer ing from unfair competition, and re member every time the exchange rate  changes, every time a new product is  born,  every  time  taste changes we  have some industries that are winners  and some that are losers, but if every  time an industry is a loser we come in  and say we are going to protect them  for 10 years against competition, our  competitors get the right of offset be cause under GATT they have a right  to pick an offset and either get a con cession from us in another area, which  they are unlikely to get in this envi ronment,  or more  importantly,  to  impose counterveiling duties.  Think about this: Let us .say we pick  an industry in America that is non competitive, where we are losing jobs,  and we protect them for 10 years. Con sumers will, of course, pay more for  their product. But  it does not end  there. The country that is being dam aged by that has the right of offset.  So they get to impose countervailing  duties against our products of equal  amount.  Now which industries do you think  they are going  to pick?  If we, say,  choose to protect the textile industry  for 10 years because they cannot com pete, and we  are going  to do  that  against Korea and under GATT they  get the right of offset, what industries  do you think they are going to pick of  America's? They are going to pick our  most competitive and our most effi cient  industries. They are going  to  attack the areas where we are com petitive.  So, overall, what do we gain? We  protect  the old,  losing  industries at  the expense of the new industries of  the 1980's and 1990's and we do not  create any new  jobs.  Invariably  the  jobs we are protecting are lower paid  jobs than the jobs we will be losing.  We are responding to the political  pressures of the losers from competi tion but we are doing it at the expense  of the winners. The winners are not  here clamoring because  they do not  know where the offsets are going to  come and many of the industries are  just being created today.  My  concluding  point  in  a  long  speech is this: Ultimately, we have got  to choose in America. Do we want to  move  ahead  in  fierce  competition,  pressuring our  trading partners  to  open markets by going out and ex panding  trade with  those who will?  Taiwan has offered to enter into a free  trade area with the United States. We  have not stepped out  to say,  ""You  lower  your barriers, we will  lower  ours."" In fact, we have never respond ed to that offer.  We have heard all this self-righteous  talk about how free our markets are.  We had more unfair  trade practice  suits filed against us last year than  any of our trading partners.  If we are going to succumb to politi cal pressure and invest the future of  America in trying to rebuild the losers  of the 1950's and 1960's at the expense  of the winners of the 1980's and the  1990's, we are investing the future of  America in the past.

803,519,13,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, Sena tor PACKWOOD and I are today filing an  amendment to the trade bill, which we  intend to off er in the next couple of  days, to add a number of miscellane ous tariff provisions. These provisions,  which were originally  sponsored as  bills by a number of Members of the  Senate, are not thought to be contro versial. As is the normal practice of  the Finance Committee, we  sought  public comments on these provisions  as well as the views of the administra tion and the International Trade Com mission. Only  those provisions  that  passed  this scrutiny and can  legiti mately be considered noncontroversial  are included in this package amend ment.  Also  included are technical amend ments to four tariff sections of the Fi nance Committee's bill. All are intend ed to carry out the intent of the spon sor and the committee. Three provi sions are amended to correct the date  each provision is to be effective. One is  to be made retroactive to July l, 1985;  a second is amended to make it not  retroactive; and the third is amended  to clarify that it will be effective after  the end of 1987, rather than 15 days  after the effective date of the bill. The  last of these provisions, dealing with  the treatment of watches under the  generalized system of preferences, has  a wording change to reflect fully the  compromise language that was worked  out among the sponsor, other Mem bers, and other interested parties.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that descriptions of these provi sions and a copy of the amendment be  printed in the RECORD.

804,532,13,Mr. SPECTER.,"  I  ask unanimous  consent  that a  supplemental  letter  dated June 19, 1987, reaffirming those  opinions and updating them also be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  BRYAN, CAVE, MCPHEETERS  & MCROBERTS,  Washington, DC, June 19, 1987.  Hon. ARLEN SPECTER,  U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR SPECTER: You have asked  me to review letters that I sent to Senator  Abraham Ribicoff on March 13, 1980, and to  you on August 24, 1982, that you inserted in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  in connection  with your proposal to revise the Antidump ing Act of 1916. For ease of reference, I am  enclosing  the relevant pages of the CON GRESSIONAL RECORD for January 22, 1985, at  which my prior letters appear.  After having  reviewed  these  letters, as  well as commentary published since those  letters were prepared, I am pleased to con firm to you that I remain convinced that my  analysis in those letters was correct. Neither  the GATT nor the Antidumping Code pre empt all private remedies. Private remedies,  if fashioned on similar remedies available in  domestic law, do not violate the ""national  treatment"" provisions of the GATT nor the  alleged ""exclusively"" provisions of the Code.  The damages that would be recoverable for  the commercial tort of ""dumping,"" are not  ""duties,"" and therefore are not covered by  the international agreements now in being.  From a policy point of view, I believe a  private cause of action is a desirable direc tion for U.S. trade law. Far too many dump ing cases involve disputes between private  parties that should be resolved by impartial  tribunals, such as courts, without the inter vention of their governments. Both our Ad ministration and foreign governments have  more  important matters  to which  they  should attend than squabbling about dump ing margins on often obscure products. Of  course, the United States faces a risk that  other countries may adopt mirror image leg islation. I believe this is not a risk that has  previously deterred the Congress in adopt ing rules  it  thought were appropriate. It  should not deter you now.  Sincerely,  PETER D. EmtENHAFT.  ",1987
805,532,13,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President,  the  amendments which are being suggest ed here are not protectionistic and I  wish to emphasize that at this point.  Free  trade means  fair  trade. Free  trade means  the cost of production  plus a reasonable profit and that does  not mean a governmental subsidy. A  subsidy by Great Britain, for example,  was found by the International Trade  Commission of $250 a ton. That puts  U.S. industry in a position with which  it cannot realistically compete. U.S. in dustry simply stated cannot compete  with a foreign government.  Similarly, free trade does not permit  dumping,  the selling  in  the United  States at a lower price than sold in a  foreign market. Here again the amend ment will be entirely consistent with  the principles of free trade.  Free  trade again does not counte nance customs fraud but these prac tices are rampant in our country today  and the only effective remedy  is  to  rely upon the injured parties to take  action themselves in court.  And our courts have many illustra tions of the efficacy of private action,  private action enforcing our antitrust  laws, private action enforcing our se curity laws. And there is a realm of ap propriate action for private actions to  enforce our trade laws.  Mr. President,  this  is a  thumbnail  description of  the  import of  these  amendments. I have sought the floor  today to insert them into the CONGRES SIONAL RECORD so that my colleagues  would have these materials available  to them when the amendment is called  up. I have learned that I may be able  to present this amendment early on in  the amendment process, perhaps as  early as  today.  I have  informed my  colleagues of this bill in a variety of  ways since it was first introduced in  1982. I intend to press it on the floor  at the appropriate time.  I  thank the Chair and I yield the  floor.  ",1987

809,532,13,Mr. DIXON.," This bill is a common sense approach to the problem of ille gal dumping in our country. It allows  injured American companies  to  file  suit in the U.S. District Court for the  District of Columbia or the Court of  International Trade for an injunction  against, and damages for, the import  and sale of goods dumped or subsi dized by foreign countries.  The unfair competition amendment  will help the Federal Government in  settling dumping and subsidies cases.  The processing of a complaint by the  Commerce Department and the Inter national Trade Commission  is  time  consuming and expensive. In addition,  Customs is often unable to cope with  the great amount of customs fraud.  This amendment, by providing an al ternative avenue for  injured compa nies, gives relief to an overworked and  sometimes clogged bureaucracy.  However, the heart of this measure  is the ability of these affected Ameri can companies to seek damages. If a  court does rule in favor of the Ameri can company and awards damages, the  off ending importer is taught an eff ec tive lesson. It forces an importer to un derstand unfair trading practices will  not pay by hitting him in his pocket book.  When  the Government's existing  regulatory agencies made a ruling in  favor of a complaint, it often comes  too late and its cure often is ineff ec tive. They infrequently impose retro active duties and usually only restrict  future dumping.  The Unfair Competition Act holds  off ending foreign enterprises, like any  domestic company, directly  responsi ble for their actions.  No one has more incentive than the  companies being hurt by dumping to  prevent this action. If these companies  know that they can possibly receive  damages, they will be the most eff ec tive policemen we can possibly have  against unfair trade practices.  This amendment is not protectionist.  Importing companies will not be af fected if they play fairly. Only those  companies that are found in a court of  law to have engaged in unfair trading  activities will be affected. It is an in dustry specific bill and does not dis criminate unnecessarily against inno cent companies.  Finally, this measure does not inter ! ere with the ability of the administra tion  to conduct  its  trade policy.  It  offers no new tariffs, quotas, or other  types of protectionist barriers. The  ITC's current existing remedies would  not affected.  It,  instead, encourages  affected industries to enforce the cur rent laws on the books and so discour ages unfair trade practices.  I would like to congratulate Senator  SPECTER on his persistence in bringing  this worthy measure to be attention of  the Senate. The Unfair Competition  ",1987
810,545,13,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of S. 490,  the Omnibus  Trade Act of 1987. This legislation rep resents  the culmination of  literally  hundreds of hours of work on the part  of the Committee on Finance. It repre sents the best possible consensus legis lation between two  legitimate points  of view on trade law: those who believe  in free trade and those who believe  our trade laws should be stricter, to  force our Government to retaliate in  unfair trading situations.  Because of the manner in which he  shepharded  this complex  legislation  through  committee,  our  chairman,  Senator LLOYD BENTSEN, has earned  my utmost respect. He managed the  committee's consideration of this legis lation both with fairness and resolve.  Like many of us  in  this Chamber,  Chairman BENTSEN  feels  the time  is  long overdue for substantive, reasona ble changes in our trade law.  There are those in this country who  look at our existing trade law and say,  ""that is how it should be."" The Presi dent should have total discretion  to  determine when, how,  and perhaps  most  importantly,  if  trade sanctions  will be invoked. Those who believe in  so-called free trade maintain that few  restrictions should be placed on Presi dential authority.  Except during the past 20 months,  that clearly was  the position of the  Reagan administration. It has been  said  that  trade was  the administra tion's policy outcast. It was a policy  area which rarely received attention  and  frequently  seemed  incoherent.  Rarely was  trade mentioned  and  seldom did we see Presidential author ity used to address the trade imbal ance  and  barrier  situations  facing  American exports.  Suddenly, some 20 months ago,  it  was as if the Reagan administration  became born again on trade. the tough  trade rhetoric began to flow. We heard  the President and top administration  policymakers begin to take our trade  situation seriously. Like a  tidal wave,  unfair trade practice complaints came  from the White House. All of these ac tions carried the same message: ""We  can get tough when we want to."" Some  of the cynics looked at this new found  trade religion and decided it had more  to do with eminent congressional pas sage of tough trade legislation than  the realization that the United States  was taking a beating in the interna tional trading arena.  Through the pa.st 6 years of  the  Reagan administration, we have seen  both sides of this trade debate demon strated. In the initial years, the ad.min8  istration took the hands off approach  to trade and our trade laws. In the last  year and a half, by nearly all accounts,  this administration has more aggres sively pursued our  trading  interests  and has exercised much of the Presi dential discretionary authority we will  hear discussed during this debate.  Despite the administration realizing  its new-found trade religion, it should  be in the interest of the Senate to ex amine our trade and financial position  has deteriorated over the past 6 years.  The U.S. trade deficit increased nearly  times, from $20 billion in 1980  to  $160 billion in 1986. During this time  period, exports have  remained  rela tively constant.  Imports, however, have increased by  nearly 40 percent in value. This oc cured during a timeframe when world  growth was at extremely low levels.  Since 1985, the United States has re ceived the dubious distinction of being  a debtor nation for the first time in  history. In 1986, U.S. foreign debt hit  a record $264 billion. This means that  U.S. assets abroad were $264 billion  less  than foreign  investment in U.S.  assets, such as corporate stocks and  bonds and U.S. bonds. United States  foreign debt is  twice the size of the  largest  international  Third World  debtor, Brazil.  With these disasterous statistics in  mind we must consider this trade legis lation. Administration  policymakers  tell us that this tough trade legisla tion, as currently written, stands a 5050 chance of being vetoed. We have  just received 31 pages of administra tion objections. This is the same ad ministration that has taken the posi tion that ""the trade deficit should not  cause undue alarm."" I have the utmost  respect for Ambassador Yeutter, the  President's Special Trade Representa tive and the author of this statement.  However, regardless of whatever silver  lining I  look for in our record trade  deficits of the past 6 years, I come up  empty handed.  I could not disagree  more with my good friend, Ambassa dor Yeutter. There is no silver lining  whatsoever in the trade deficit.  I am alarmed when I hear adminis tration policymakers make such state ments. I am alarmed at the tidal wave  of depressing statistics. I am alarmed  when I read list upon list of foreign  trade barriers which seem to go un checked.  I  am alarmed  that absent  this legislation we are without the as surance we need that the next Presi dent will view trade seriously and con sistently and not in the lackadaisical  manner we have seen during the past  5 years.  That is why we are here today. The  legislation before the Senate seeks to  reach a middle ground between protec tionist  trade  law and  totally discre tionary and potentially useless trade  sanctions. It will establish trade law  which ensures that the next adminsitration takes trade as seriously on in auguration day as it does on its third,  fourth, or fifth year.  This  proposal makes  substantive  changes in section 301, the trade law  section used to fight unfair trade bar riers and practices. Even though elimi nation of these trade barriers does not  represent a total solution to the trade  deficit, they are a serious problem for  American trade. Let me share with my  colleagues just a  few of the barriers  our agricultural products encounter in  the international arena:  The European Community inspects  400 United States meat packing plants  and prohibits any of these plants from  shipping meat and pork products to  Europe. The claim: They do not meet  the European inspection requirements.  The result: One South Dakota packing  plant was cited for having a hand op erated drinking fountain and another  chastised for not having a ""fully paved  parking  lot.""  Both  lose  valuable  export markets when they are prohib ited from exporting to the EEC.  American rice farmers are effective ly barred from shipping United States  rice to Japan. In 1985, Japan allowed  only 20,000 tons of rice to be imported.  This represents  less than two-tenths  of 1 percent of its domestic consump tion. These Japanese restrictions are  estimated to cost United States rice  farmers as much as $1.7 billion per  year.  Massive duties levied on agricultural  commodities entering Japan have re sulted in a price differential which has  forced  our  products  out  of  that  market. A New York prime steak cost ing $5.29 per pound  in Washington  costs $30 per pound in Tokyo after all  governmental duties are assessed.  This bill requires the President to  use all available trade powers against  these unfair foreign  trade practices.  Except in cases where a greater na tional interest overrides, it mandates  the President  take action  to break  down unfair foreign trade barriers.  The  administration must  identify  unfair trade barriers and initiate ac tions which  seek  to  eliminate  all  unfair trade barriers. In some cases,  the President  is  required  to  initiate  trade remedies rather than waiting for  a request from the effected industry.  Strict time limits are placed on Presi dential action.  This legislation also makes substan tive changes in the treatment of exces sive but fairly-traded imports. In cases  where fairly traded imports are flood ing the U.S. market, causing harm to a  domestic industry, the President is re quired to provide import relief in cer tain  circumstances. The  action  re quired in this change is  intended to  position the industry to compete with  imports on an even basis after the  import relief is terminated.  9Hl59 0-89-18 (Pt. 13)  ",1987
811,558,13,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, this  amendment essentially provides for a  private right of action to enforce exist ing substantive rules of law governing  trade for this Nation.  This amendment adds no new sub stantive provision. It gives a private  right of action  to enforce  the  law  against customs fraud, against dump ing, and against subsidy, all of which  are currently prohibited under U.S.  law.  There are, Mr. President, major pro cedural deficiencies in existing law at  which  this  amendment  is directed.  This amendment is not protectionism,  ",1987
812,571,13,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, when  we have an administration which  is  unwilling to enforce the current trade  remedy laws, there is a great tempta tion to shift the responsibility to en force these laws to someone else.  This is the temptation which is re flected in this amendment and I un derstand the frustration which leads  to this amendment.  This administration doesn't think we  have a trade problem. just as it doesn't  think we have a deficit and debt prob lem, or an environmental problem or a  poverty problem.  But what we need to do is force this  administration to begin to exercise its  current responsibilities. If we shift re sponsibility  elsewhere, who  can we  hold accountable? Can we call a judge  before the Congress and ask him or  her why the trade remedy laws are not  being enforced?  Can we vote against a  judge who  won't enforce the trade remedy laws?  In 1988, we can vote for new  trade  policies for the Federal Government.  What we need is a change of atti tude, not a change in government or ganization.  What we need . is more understand ing of the trade issue, not more law yers filing lawsuits.  PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION IN DUMPING CASES  ",1987
813,571,13,Mr. DURENBEGER.," Mr. President I  rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by my distinguished colleague  from Pennsylvania that would allow  private  rights of action  in dumping  cases. Although U.S.  law provides a  private right of action under the Anti dumping Act of 1916, I believe any al teration of the standards in that Act  to increase the likelihood of obtaining  a private dumping remedy would put  the United States in violation of its  GA TT commitments.  The GATT provides that the only  remedy for dumping is imposition of a  duty to offset the margin of dumping.  There is no provision for private dam ages.  Mr. President, I believe that if this  amendment is adopted, we will be cre ating a new Lawyer's Relief Act. Court  cases will be drawn out for years and  American  business will waste  even  more resources on lawyers. Moreover,  a mirror  legislation will  surely be  adopted by our trading partners.  Between 1980 and 1984, there were  more administrative actions in foreign  countries brought against American  products  for alleged dumping,  than  against any other country. In 1985, we  were  surpassed by  the Japanese  in  being charged with dumping.  Every mismanaged, inefficient com pany both in the United States and  abroad could be expected to file mil lion and billion dollar damage suits al leging  that unfair  foreign dumping  has cost them market share. In the  past, many American companies have  been subject to antidumping orders.  If we adopt this amendment, I be lieve we will be inviting a host of coun tries to harass American business and  American farmers in damage suits.  ",1987
814,571,13,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, I  have a letter to Senator DoLE, signed  by 14 Cabinet Secretaries or acting  Cabinet Secretaries laying forth  the  administration's views on various parts  of the bill. I ask unanimous consent  that the letter and their accompany ing views be printed in the RECORD.  ",1987
815,571,13,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President,  let  me  ask  those Senators who might  have further amendments they would  like to offer tonight, if they advise the  managers of the bill, I am sure the  ranking member will listen with rea sonable good cheer and the chairman  of the committee with somewhat less  enthusiasm, but we will  listen. That  would be helpful in trying to decide to  provide  information  to  the majority  leader as to the schedule for the rest  of the evening.  ",1987
816,571,13,Mr. PACKWOOD.," I wonder if the  chairman might ask at least of those  on the floor if anybody is planning to  off er an amendment tonight.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE,  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT,  Washington, DC, June 22, 1987.  Hon. ROBERT J. DOLE,  Republican Leader,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC  DEAR MR. LEADER: On February 19, 1987'  President Reagan proposed comprehensive  legislation CS.  539)  to  improve America's  competitiveness.  Since  then,  we  have  worked diligently with nine Senate commit tees  to achieve  this goal. We are pleased  that some of the President's proposals have  provided a basis for Senate action. We are  deeply  concerned,  however,  that many  Senate proposals pose grave dangers to our  economic health and national security.  The authors of the pending trade and re lated legislation have said that they do not  want a protectionist bill, but  the conseless  quences of this legislation are clear. Like  the tariffs of an earlier era, it would pro voke foreign retaliation, increase prices to  U.S. businesses and consumers, cost more  jobs than it would save, and threaten the  continued existence of a  growth-oriented  trading system. This is a high price to pay  for exhibiting frustration with our  trade  deficit-a price  that would make us  competitive, not more. Our Nation's busi ness  leaders, economists, and newspapers  are asking: Do we really want the history  books to identify the 1987 trade bill as the  cause of a recession-or worse?  The overall problem is that each commit tee involved with the bill has proposed inde pendently significant provisions to address  perceived problems. Together, these provi sions will have a severe cumulative impact  on U.S.  trade and the economy. We urge  you to consider their effects: (1) sweeping  procedural changes that would repress trade  and investment; (2) violations of our inter national obligations  that would  trigger a  downward  spiral of  retaliation;  (3)  con straints (some, we believe, unconstitutional)  on the discretion of this and future Presi dents to formulate international economic  policy and conduct negotiations; (4) poten tial disruptions to financial and labor mar kets; <5> special benefits to powerful indus tries; and (6) significant additions  to  the  budget deficit. More detailed objections to  and comments on the pending legislation  are attached.  We continue to pledge our best efforts to  work with you to produce legislation that  will  promote America's  competitiveness.  However, we will not be able to recommend  that the President sign the pending legisla tion  unless  extensive  improvements  are  made on the Senate floor and in conference.  We all want to see the trade deficit come  down. Exchange rate adjustments, aggres sive actions to open foreign markets, and  fiscal discipline are starting to produce the  right  results.  In volume  terms, our net  export deficit on goods and services has de clined at an annual rate of about $15 billion  during the last two quarters. The trade defi cit is starting to shrink in dollar terms as  well, and should continue to do so. Especial ly encouraging is the fact that exports of  goods and services have grown in volume  terms at an annual rate of 14 percent since  the second quarter of 1986.  Legislation can be useful if it strengthens  our competitiveness. The President's pro posals would do so by increasing investment  in human and intellectual capital; promot ing science and technology; protecting intel lectual property; making legal and regula tory reforms; and  improving  the  interna tional economic environment. Conversely,  legislation can create new problems  that  could reverse the economic growth we have  enjoyed for four and one-half years. Now  that American industry is starting to reap  the gains of more competive exchange rates,  it would be self-destructive to trigger unnec essary trade conflicts.  Sincerely.  <Signaturer of 14 Cabinet Secretaries.)  ",1987
817,584,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  The President's message follows:  To the Senate of the United States:  1986.  With a view to receiving the advice  and consent of the Senate to ratifica tion, I transmit herewith the Supple mentary Treaty  to  the Treaty Be tween the United States of America  and the Federal Republic of Germany  Concerning  Extradition  signed  at  Washington on October 21,  I  transmit also, for the information of  the Senate, the report of the Depart ment of State with respect to the Sup plementary Treaty.  The Supplementary Treaty adds to  and amends the Treaty Between the  United States and the Federal Repub lic of Germany Concerning Extradi tion, signed at Bonn on June 20, 1978.  It represents an important step in im proving law enforcement cooperation  and combatting terrorism by excluding  from the scope of the political offense  exception  serious  offenses  typically  committed by terrorists, e.g., murder,  manslaughter, kidnapping, use of a de structive device capable of endanger ing  life or causing grievous bodily  harm, and attempt of conspiracy  to  commit the foregoing offenses.  The Supplementary Treaty also will  help to improve implementation of the  current Extradition Treaty in several  other respects.  I  recommend that the Senate give  early and favorable consideration to  the Supplementary Treaty and give its  advice and consent to ratification.  RONALD REAGAN.  Tm: WHITE HOUSE, June 25, 1987.  BICENTENNIAL MINUTE  JUNE 25, 1930: SENATE TELEPHONE  CONTROVERSY ENDS  25,  450  1930,  ",1987
818,584,13,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, 57 years  ago  today,  on  June  the  Senate resolved a month-long contro versy over the installation of dial-oper ated  telephones. Earlier,  the Chesa peake & Potomac Telephone Co. had  installed  dial  phones  on  the  Senate side of the Capitol and in the  Senate Office Building. Many Mem bers  immediately  took  a  dislike  to  these  instruments, which had been  frustrating users since their invention  several decades earlier, President Her bert Hoover had banned them from  the White House after he took office  in 1929.  Senatorial opponents of dial phones,  often  veiling  their  arguments  in  humor, charged that they were me chanically unreliable,  that they ""re quired Senators to perform the duties  of  telephone operators  in order  to  enjoy the benefits of telephone serv ice;"" that they contributed to the na tional unemployment rate by throwing  telephone operators out of work, and  22,  that they required a good deal of light  to see how to operate.  On May  Virginia's  Senator  Carter Glass called up his resolution  to ""have these abominable dial tele phones taken out of use on the Senate  side.""  Arizona's  Henry  Fountain  Ashurst thanked Glass for his ""moder ate""  language. The  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD, he observed, ""would not be  mailable if it contained in print what  Senators think of the dial-telephone  system.""  Senator Clarence Dill  of  Washington  State  suggested  that  Glass expand his measure to outlaw  dial phones from the District of Co lumbia as well.  The Senate  quickly  adopted  the  Glass resolution, which provided for  restoration  of  operator  assisted  phones within 30 days. Over the next  several weeks, representatives of the  telephone company vigorously lobbied  Senators and staff to reverse this deci sion. Finally, on May 25, the Senate  accepted a compromise measure that  permitted Members to choose the type  of instrument that best suited them.

822,584,13,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, one of  the major publications planned for the  Senate bicentennial is the ""Guide to  Records of the United States Senate  at the National Archives, 1789-1989:  Bicentennial Edition.""  This will be the first inventory ever  published for the 20,000 cubic feet of  official Senate records at the Archives.  It is being prepared by the staff of  that agency's Legislative Archives Di vision. As these records belong to the  Senate, it is appropriate for the guide  to be published as a Senate document.  There will be a companion guide  to  House records, published as a House  document.  Mr. President, in 1982 the Senate Bi centennial Study Group, of which I  was a member, recommended prepara tion of a guide to the Senate's official  records at the National Archives. The  study group was greatly surprised to  learn  that no  such  guide  existed.  Dating from 1789 and amounting to  20,000 cubic feet, these materials are  fundamental sources for studying the  history of  the Senate and of our  Nation. A comprehensive guide would  promote the use of these records and  stimulate wider understanding of the  legislative process.  Since 1982, staff of the National Ar chives  and  the  Senate Historical  Office have worked to ensure that a  guide would be available for publica tion on the occasion of the Senate's  bicentennial.  A  companion  volume  is  being prepared  for  the  records of the House of Representa tives.

827,636,13,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Speaker, on June 23, I  introduced House Concurrent Resolution 145,  which deals with U.S. policy  in  the Persian  Gulf region.  I daresay that this resolution  is  quite different from other legislative initiatives  on  the Persian Gulf in several  important re spects. Most  importantly,  the  resolution  is  clear and unambiguous  in  its  language.  It  seeks, in an honest way, to register congres sional support for the Chief Executive's Per sian Gulf policy.  There is no specific mention in the resolu tion of  reflagged Kuwaiti  tankers or  Iranian  Silkworm missiles.  I do not address  the de tailed rules or engagement for U.S. naval ves sels in the gulf. While these are very important  issues, they are only parts of the larger policy  considerations in the Persian Gulf. In his June  15 report to the Congress, Secretary of De fense Weinberger established the proper con text for evaluating U.S. policy in  the Persian  Gulf:  Important U.S. objectives in the Gulf, en dorsed for over four decades by eight U.S.  Presidents, both Democratic and Republi can,  include: denying Soviet access/influ ence in the region which would  threaten  Free World access to regional oil resources;  stability and security of  the Gulf states  which is critical to ensure Free World access  to oil; and access to Gul oil resources, the  disruption of which would seriously affect  the Free World oil market.  Underlying  these objectives are  the basic  United States interests in the Gulf region: limi tation of Soviet influence; maintenance of the  security and stability of the Gulf States; and  maintenance of the free flow of oil and non belligerent freedom of navigation. No Member  of Congress or Senator has disputed the en during legitimacy of these basic interests.  Disagreements arise over questions of strat egy and tactics in the Persian Gulf. Congress  has demanded and received reams of infor mation about orders of battle, rules of equip ment, consultations with allies, and  the  like.  But in return  there has been no clear policy  endorsement or rejection by the Congress. In  fact, a congressional consensus which differs  from the Commander in Chief's stated policy  is virtually unimaginable. There is only confu sion and uncertainty, accompanied by calls for  delaying  full  implementation of our national  policy.  For its part, the administration has been re luctant to seek a clear congressional mandate  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  for its policy. This is symptomatic of a malaise  that descended upon the White House even  before the  Iran-Contra revelations. There ap pears to be no real appreciation of the Presi dent's constitutional latitude as the Command er in Chief of all Armed Forces. As Alexander  Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers:  The  circumstances  that  endanger  the  safety of nations are infinite, and for this  reason no  consitutional  shackles  can be  wisely imposed on the power to which the  care of it is committed.  For their part, U.S. military commanders are  anxiously seeking  clear,  consistent Persian  Gulf policy guidance from  their civilian mas ters. As Secretary of the Navy James Webb  told a Naval War College audience recently,  ""The Nation must understand why our sailors  and marines are out there on the edges of the  world."" Without policy guidance and public  support, U.S. forces are  left to operate in a  netherworld of detached strategies and  tac tics.  Inevitably,  such  situations  evoke  bitter  memories of Vietnam, The Mayaquez rescue  mission, Desert One, and  the Beirut Marine  barracks  bombing.  Let  us  remember  that  these situations are never deliberately sought  by the United States; they are forced upon us  by others. Military forces are mere instruments  of the civilian policymakers, including the Con gress.  If the civilians in the executive branch  and  the Congress  insist on maintaining their  tight control over the operations of the Armed  Forces,  they must assume  responsibility  for  the policy which drives strategy and  tactics.  This is one of the key assumptions of my res olution.  The  ""Resolved"" clauses of my  resolution  are simple and to the point. First, the resolu tion states  that  the Congress supports  the  President in his determination  to ensure the  free  flow of commercial  traffic  through  the  international waters  of  the  Persian Gulf.  Second, the resolution affirms the President's  obligation to defend U.S. naval forces against  all armed attacks in the Persian Gulf. Finally,  the  resolution endorses  the United States  policy for seeking a peaceful end to the Iran Iraq war.  These clauses are  firmly grounded  in  the  basic U.S. interests in the Gulf, which consti tute  the only  legitimate  foundation  for our  policy in that region. Questions relating to Ku waiti  reftagging,  rules of engagement, allied  support and other similar issues, while undeni ably  important, are  clearly  secondary and  should be recognized as such.  The most open secret in Washington is that,  given  the opportunity, we  in  the Congress  prefer  to  vote  ""maybe""  on  controversial  issues. The Persian Gulf issue is no different  in this regard. But whether we  like it or not,  thousands of young American servicemen are  either on station in the Persian Gulf region or  are steaming  in  that direction. This fact can  no tonger be avoided. The question is whether  Congress can muster ""the courage to support  those whose courage is keeping the lifelines  of freedom open.  June 25, 1987  THE PESTICIDE PRICE  COMPETITION ACT  HON. CHARLES HATCHER  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 24, 1987  ",1987
828,636,13,Mr. HATCHER.," Mr. Speaker,  I have  intro duced H.R. 2569, the Pesticide Price Competi tion Act, which will establish generic pesticide  registration, stimulate increased competition in  the pesticide industry, and tower the price of  pesticides  for  farmers,  ranchers, users, and  consumers across  this country. This  legisla tion is identical to S. 7 46, a companion bill in troduced  in  the Senate by Senators NANCY  KASSEBAUM and AL GORE.  The purpose of this legislation is twofold: to  lower the  farmer's cost of production by re ducing the cost of pesticides, and to reduce  the cost of nonagricultural products that con sumers buy. This measure could save farmers  from $400 million to $500 million per year for  at least the next 5 years on agricultural pesti cides alone. Consumers could save additional  millions on nonagricultural products.  As we look across our land, we discover an  agricultural and rural economy suffering from  problems-increasing  costs  of  production,  growing debts, obtaining adequate credit, de clining prices  for crops-and we  need  to  move forward to address these concerns. One  way  to help  the  farmer meet  the  increasing  costs of production is to amend the pesticide  legislation,  the Federal  Insecticide, Fungicide  and Rodenticide Act [FIFRA]. This would help  the farmer immeasurably, without any cost to  the Government.  According to recent figures in the Economic  Indicators of the Farm Sector, Cost of Produc tion, 1985, prepared by the U.S. Department  of Agriculture [USDA], pesticides average be tween 1 O and 35 percent of  farmers' cash  variable expenses-seed, fertilizer, chemicals,  hired labor, and so forth. Farmers across this  country apply agricultural pesticides  to  their  crops, and these costs clearly comprise a sig nificant percentage of their annual expenses.  In the southeastern United States, farmers  face a tremendous challenge. Cotton farmers  across the Nation spend an average of $45  per acre for chemicals, while these farmers in  the Southeast use $96 of pesticides per acre.  Peanut  farmers average $80 per acre  for  chemicals, but Southeastern peanut  farmers  average close to $95 per acre, and Virginia  and North Carolina farmers average $89 per  acre. Like  the Hawaiian sugarcane growers  and Texan sugar beet producers, Southeast ern  farmers pay a disproportionate share of  their cost of production on agricultural chemi cals.  However, we can  lower the price of pesti cides,  thereby reducing  the  farmer's cost of  production, if we encourage the development  of generic pesticides. In fact, it may be possi ble to reduce the price of pesticides by 1 O to  20 percent or more. One way to reduce these  prices is to eliminate the data compensation  provision of FIFRA. When generic pesticide  producers enter the market following the expi ration of a patent, they generally capture only  1 O to 20 percent of the existing market. Yet,  ",1987

Nearly 10,000 people  responded  to  the  questionnaire, providing  the  results  that are  listed below.

830,662,13,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker,  I am happy  to  share the news about Christ Pilgrim Rest Mis sionary Baptist Church's Silver Anniversary  and Homecoming celebration.  Christ  Pilgrim  Rest  Missionary  Baptist  Church of St. Louis has grown from 30 mem bers to over 1,300 in 25 years. Sunday, July 5,  will mark another milestone for the members  of Pilgrim Rest Missionary Baptist Church  when they move into their new quarters locat ed at 1341 North Kingshighway. The congre gation will be led by their pastor, the Rever end Earl R. Williams, in a 250-car motorcade  starting at 10:30 a.m. from their old location,  Glasgow and Gamble.  June 25, 1987  The church was organized on May 12, 1918  and one of their early places of worship was  815 North Beaumont. The first congregation  was composed of 30 members.  In 1936,  the church called  the Reverend  E.R. Williams to the pastorate and the mem bership has continuously grown to its present  enrollment of over 1,300.  In  1943, Pilgrim Rest Missionary Baptist  Church moved  to 2900 Gamble and  later  added an educational building  to accommo date their many young people. Now after 19  years  they are  taking another giant step  to  keep their membership and many friends com fortable. The new properties at 1341  to 1359  were purchased for worship and educational  purposes. The new church and educational  buildings are completely air-conditioned and  equipped with modern heating facilities. Two  of  the buildings will be used  for residential  quarters.  I congratulate the members of the Christ Pil grim Rest Missionary Baptist Church on  this  very special occasion and I hope their new fa cilities will provide many years of happy serv ice.  INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO  GRANT A FEDERAI., CHARTER  FOR  THE AMERICAN  PHILA TELIC SOCIETY  HON. SID MORRISON  OF WASHINGTON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 25, 1987  ",1987
831,662,13,Mr. MORRISON of Washington.," Mr. Speak er, today I am introducing, along with nine of  my distinguished colleagues.  legislation  that  would grant a Federal charter to the American  Philatelic Society.  The American Philatelic Society  is a non profit corporation headquartered in State Col lege, PA.  It  is  the  largest organization of  stamp collectors in  the United States, with a  current membership of over 55,000 members.  Most importantly, the society is celebrating its  1 OOth anniversary as a national organization.  This has been  the result of the  long hours  spent by many devoted members dedicated to  making  the American Philatelic Society  the  prestigious organization we know today.  I strongly believe that recognizing the Amer ican Philatelic Society by granting it a Federal  charter would be most appropriate in this year  that we are reflecting on America's great his tory founded in our Constitution. Stamps have  played a role all along by opening a window  on America's natural landscape, her great his torical figures, and on the accomplishments of  her citizens in science, commerce, social serv ice, and  the arts. These efforts by our Na tion's stamp collectors have helped the United  States relive its rapidly changing and eventful  history.  I am pleased  to sponsor  this  legislation  which will help us give the appropriate recog nition  to  the many stamp collectors  in our  communities for their accomplishments. I urge  my colleagues  to  join us  in support of  this  measure by adding  their names as cospon sors.  ",1987
832,688,13,Mr. MILLER of Washington.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  to urge  this body  to vote against  this  amendment. The Dornan amendment to the  District of Columbia appropriations bill would  prevent the District from using  locally raised  funds  to provide abortions  to women who  reside in the District of Columbia without ex ception even in cases of rape or life endan germent.  This amendment would deny the District of  Columbia  that which every other citizen  in  America is guaranteed: The right to determine  their local government and its policies.  Congress must uphold the principle of self  determination for the residents of the District  of Columbia. The Supreme Court recently de fined those areas of government that are re served  for State and  local decisionmaking:  Police and  fire protection, sanitation, parks  and  recreation, and public health. By voting  for this amendment. we are again denying the  people of the District of Columbia their consti tutional right to self-determination.  The District is not in violation of the Hyde  amendment which  prohibits Federal  funds  from being used to perform abortions. In fact,  there is a clause in H.R. 2713 that prohibits  Federal funds from being used for such pur poses. That is not the issue here. The issue is  self determination and equal treatment. I urge  you to vote against this amendment.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. Mr. Chair man, I oppose abortions and have voted that  way since coming to Congress. However, I be lieve exceptions must be made for saving the  life of the mother and for incest and rape.  The Dornan amendment does not allow for  these necessary exceptions and  therefore  I  regret  that  I must vote against  the Dornan  amendment.  I repeat,  I am opposed to abor tion and will continue to vote that way, but this  amendment  is  not  supportable because  it  does not protect the life of the mother.  The CHAIRMAN. All time has ex pired.  PREFERENTIAL MOTION OFFERED BY MR. SMITH  OF NEW JERSEY  Mr. SMITH of New  Chairman  I  off er  a  motion.  The Clerk read as follows:  Jersey. Mr.  preferential  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey, moves that the  Committee now rise and report the bill to  the House with the recommendation that  the enacting clause be stricken out.  ",1987
833,688,13,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Chairman, I oppose  striking out the enacting clause.  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman  from California [Mr. DIXON] will be  recognized for 5 minutes at the appro priate time in opposition to the pref er ential motion.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from New Jersey CMr. SMITH].  Mr. SMITH of New  Jersey. Mr.  Chairman, I rise in strong support of  the Doman amendment and commend  my colleague from Calif omia for his  concern and compassion for children  and  their mothers  in offering  this  today.  A  similar amendment was offered  last year and the year before, both  were  adopted  but  regrettably  the  amendment didn't make its way into  law. With the strong backing of the  President this year I hope we will be  more fortunate this time around.  The  issue before  this body  today,  Mr. Chairman, is simply whether or  not abortion on demand will be payed  for with public funds.  Members should know and should be  fully aware that the current language  contained in H.R. 2713 may look good  to some on the surface but has been  totally ineffective and inadequate and  has not stopped public funding for a  single abortion. Not even one!  The so-called antiabortion language  in the bill is so defective that it has  permitted  taxpayer  subsidized  abor tion on demand in the District of Co lumbia. Even D.C. government offi cials admit this point. In an article in  the Philadelphia Inquirer, August 1,  1985, Elizabeth Reveal, the District of  Columbia's budget director at the time  ""confirmed that the District's govern ment has a policy of funding abortion  on demand and does not attempt to  determine  the circumstances of  the  pregnancy.    The Doman  amendment  reforms  that policy Mr. Chairman and brings  the D.C. appropriations bill  in con formance with Federal policy.  I would point out to members of the  committee that in 1985 according to a  D.C. government report, 10,357 abor tions on demand were payed for in the  District  of  Columbia with  public  funds-10,357 children lost their lives  in that year alone and Congress per mitted the taxpayer to foot the bill.  Mr. Chairman. let no one here today  seek  to diminish or gloss over  the  gruesome reality of abortion. Rather  let us allow ourselves to be sensitive to  the excessive and wanton loss of life of  children in the District.  Mr. Chairman.  abortion methods  and their impact on children are un nerving  to contemplate and  include  bodily dismemberment. which  is  the  case in D&C and suction abortions in jection of poisonous  chemicals,  the  crushing of the baby's skull and body,  as is the case in D&E abortions and  ",1987

The assistant legislative clerk read  as follows:  Title VII of  the Tariff Act of 1930  amended by inserting after Section 771A <19  U.S.C. 1677-1> the following new Section:  is  ""Section 7718.  In  the case of an agricultural product  processed from a raw agricultural product in  which (1) the demand for the prior stage  product is substantially dependent on the  demand for the latter stage product, and (2)  the processing operation adds only limited  value to the raw commodity, subsidies found  to be provided to either producers or proces sors of the product shall be deemed to be  provided with respect to the manufacture,  production, or exportation of the processed  product.  ",1987
836,792,13,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that the reading of  the amendment be dispensed with.  ",1987
837,792,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1987
838,792,13,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President,  this  amendment may sound a bit compli cated, but it is frankly very simple in  effect. It is an important amendment  to agricultural processing  industries  and  important  to agricultural com modity producers in America.  Very simply, about 1985,  the hog producing  industry  along with  the  pork-producing industry in our coun try, filed with the International Trade  Commission and,  in effect, with the  Department  of Commerce,  alleging  that the country of Canada was subsi dizing its hog producers to the detri ment of American hog producers.  Fortunately,  the  ITC agreed with  that,  yes, Canada was  subsidizing,  indeed,  the hog producers, but  the  International Trade Commission, in a  separate departure from the hog pro ducers, unfortunately ruled that the  country of Canada was not subsidizing  in a detrimental effect its pork produc ers, so, in effect, it ruled against the  subsidy for pork producers as against  hog producers.  Why is that important? It is impor tant because  the practical effect of  that is that the American hog produc ers lost to the Canadian hog producers  because you can, obviously, begin to  slaughter a  lot more hogs, Canadian  hogs, and  to some degree American  hogs, in Canadian plants. Second, the  processors who make the bacons and  hams out of the hogs, obviously, with  more processing in Canada, the proc essing  industry  in our country was  damaged, lost jobs, and lost.income.  It was through the efforts of Sena tor GRASSLEY of Iowa and also Senator  DANFORTH of Missouri, and other Sen ators, that this Senator and the other  Senators  I mentioned were able  to  change the law in this Finance Com mittee bill which is before us. We are  appreciative of the Senators' eff arts to  get that change.  Unfortunately, all is not as it seems  to be because since the markup of the  bill,  the U.S. Court of International  Trade ruled that the Department of  Commerce in determining the degree  of countervail that should be assessed  against  the  hog  imports  into  the  United States as well as pork ruled  that it is proper for the Department of  Commerce to find the amount of sub sidy that Canada provides for hog pro ducers, but, unfortunately,  improper  for  the processing  industry,  saying  that the U.S. Court of International  Trade simply did not have the statuto ry authority to allow the Department  of Commerce to go ahead and proceed  and find the level of that subsidy.  The court went on to volunteer that  even though it did not have the statu tory authority, perhaps it was a prob lem that the Congress could solve.  That is the point of this amendment.  This amendment is simply that statu tory authority so that the U.S. Court  of International Trade can levy  the  amount of subsidy that Canada pro vides for  its hog producers and also  the amount of subsidy that Canada  provides,  in effect, for its processing  industry, in this case, of pork.  The amendment was agreed to by  the Department of Commerce and by  the USTR, and I believe it is agreed to  on both sides.  Let me just sum up by saying this is  not a small matter. If the law is not  changed, then a foreign country would  be able to get around the U.S. counter vail statutes very simply by, for exam ple,  freezing  raspberries or  freezing  ",1987

891,844,13,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, I have  one further request, if I may.  First, I thank all Members for their  action on the amendment. I have some  additional remarks I would like to put  into the RECORD at this point.  I will just say that the problem, as I  think everybody knows, which we are  addressing is when the President an nounced his voluntary restraint agree ment on steel, as one example, it re quired the cooperation of a number of  countries who were shipping to this  country  to enter  into voluntary  re straint agreements. Many of those vol untary restraint agreements contained  so-called equity provisions. That is to  say that the U.S. agreed that they  would not let any overall voluntary re straint agreement hurt that particular  country's position  relative  to other  countries.  These arrangements were made, but  what has happened since is that be cause  there are,  in  this  instance, a  number of countries  that were not  participants in the President's volun tary  restraint  program,  they  have  been  increasingly achieving windfall  gains at the expense of the cooperat ing countries. As a result, both their  positions is being undercut as is the  President's program.  I would cite one or two to support  that contention.  The VRA countries, that is to say,  those countries that have been cooper ating, had a share of imports into the  U.S. market of approximately 81 per cent at the beginning of the program.  That has declined to 65.6 percent for  the first quarter of 1987. It was about  75 percent in 1986.  Back in 1985 when the President's  program began to take effect, about  23.6  percent  of  our markets were  taken by imports and VRA countries  took 19.1 percent of that. The non VRA countries,  the ones,  that is  to  say, that obviously had not agreed to  cooperate, took 4.5 percent.  By  the first quarter of 1987,  the  share of the non-VRA countries had  gone from 4.5 percent to 7 .2 percent,  and the share of the VRA, that is to  say,  the cooperating countries, had  gone down to 13.7 percent.  Clearly,  shipments  from countries  like Canada, Sweden, Taiwan,  and  Singapore were  increasing,  some  as  much as 40  to 50 percent over this  period. Their share of market was in creasing.  It was  clear  that  these countries  happened to take advantage of the sit uation to increase their share.  It may be noted that other coun tries, such as Japan, Korea, the Euro pean  Community,  had  agreed,  in  effect, when they concurred in their  voluntary  restraints,  to  sacrifice  market share in the interest of help ing our steel industry recover and in  helping President Reagan implement  the steel program.  Now, frankly, they see that the gains  that they have sacrificed are not going  for  the purpose originally  intended  but to Canadian, Turkish, and Singa pore industries instead.  The amendment that we have adopt ed gives discretionary authority to the  U.S. Trade Representative for the pur pose of  implementing equity provi sions to make the VRA effective. It is  not country specific, it is not mandato ry, but it will be helpful.  APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE  PRESIDENT  ",1987

900,857,13,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr.  President,  transporting hazardous cargo-be  it  petroleum products, chemicals, radio active wastes, or other materials-is an  unfortunate but necessary part of this  Nation's daily life. While only about 3  percent of all hazardous shipments in volve radioactive materials, the threat  of harm looms large in this area. Con sequently, Congress must be especially  vigilant with regard to our policies and  procedures related to radioactive ship ments.  I am  introducing  legislation  today  which would amend  the Hazardous  Materials Transportation Act CHMTAl  to require that rail transportation of  high-level radioactive waste and spent  nuclear fuel be done on trains operat ed exclusively  for  that purpose.  In  other words, this legislation would re quire such shipments to be transport ed on dedicated trains.    This is a matter of great interest to  the citizens of Missouri  and  every  State affected by the Department of  Energy's CDOEl shipment of damaged  core materials from  the Three Mile  Island CTMil reactor in Pennsylvania  to DOE's research facility  in Idaho  Falls. Ever since this particular ship ping campaign commenced, TMI spent  nuclear fuel has been hauled on dedi cated trains made up of a locomotive,  a buffer car or idler, a cask car carry ing the specially designed spent nucle ar fuel container, another idler, and a  caboose.  The railroads pref er to move radio active materials from source to desti nation in the safest possible manner.  The  fact  that  radioactive materials  present unique hazards, as well as the  uncertainty of what would occur  in  the event of an accident, justify taking  all reasonable safety precautions  in cluding the use of dedicated trains.  At  this  time, however,  it appears  that the use of mixed trains to trans port high-level radioactive materials is  inevitable unless Congress takes action  to prevent it. First of all, neither DOE  nor DOT require that high-level radio active materials or spent nuclear fuel  be transported in trains moving only  that material. In addition, the Inter state Commerce Commission has ruled  that the railroads cannot unilaterally  decide to ship by dedicated train and  expect  to be compensated  for  that  level of safety.  At the beginning of the TMI cam paign, DOE said that high level radioactive shipments should use routes in volving the least amount of switching  on the best tracks available. Safety,  not economic considerations, was  its  overriding concern. If a railroad pre f erred  to  ship by dedicated  trains,  DOE was willing to pay the premium.  However, DOE now seems unwilling to  provide  reasonable  compensation  to  the railroads for dedicated train serv ice. It seems to want to rely solely  upon the structural integrity of the  casks used to carry nuclear wastes.  This was confirmed during a May 12  hearing before the Senate Subcommit tee on Surface Transportation. DOE  admitted  that mixed  trains, which  may be carrying flammable or explo sive materials in addition to nuclear  materials, will be picking up and drop ping off cars across the country, and  will be subject to the switching and  jolting that DOE originally sought to  avoid.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  would require that all rail shipments  of high-level nuclear wastes and spent  nuclear fuel be on dedicated trains. It  is my hope that the Senate will act on  this legislation soon, either as a free standing bill, or as a part of other leg islation. Perhaps it could be included  in legislation reauthorizing the Haz ardous Materials Transportation Act.  Perhaps an even more attractive legis lative vehicle will present itself. I will  be looking for an appropriate opportu nity to expedite action on this meas ure.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to support this important initiative.e  By Mr. HELMS:  S. 1437. A bill to make certain mem bers of  foreign diplomatic missions  and  consular  posts  in  the United  States subject to the criminal jurisdic tion of the United States with respect  to crimes of violence; to the Commit tee on Foreign Relations.  DIPLOMATIC CRIMES  ",1987
901,857,13,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, I am in troducing  today  legislation which  is  overdue and,  in my  judgment, made  more necessary each day that passes.  The proposal, Mr. President, is de signed to limit the diplomatic immuni ty enjoyed-or should I say frequently  abused-by  the  family  and  support  staff of foreign diplomats. In effect,  the bill would also restore to innocent  American citizens the rights, privileges  and freedoms which were guaranteed  to them 200 years ago in the Constitu tion.  I  bring  to  the  attention  of  the  Senate, Mr. President, the fact that in  the United States today, there reside  over 37 ,000  individuals who are not  citizens of this country and yet enjoy  more  freedom,  liberty and personal  privileges than our own countrymen.  Indeed, there are 37 ,000 individuals in  this country who are free to commit  any crime, no matter how serious, how  violent, how heinous, and remain free  from prosecution.  In their book entitled ""Diplomatic  Crime"" Chuck Ashman and Pamela  Trescott detail in 350 pages the hor rors suffered by innocent Americans  at the hands of foreign residents who  have no regard or remorse for their  victims-our citizens.  Two hundred years ago, Thomas Jef ferson wrote in the Declaration of In dependence:  We hold these truths to be self-evident;  that all men are created equal; that they &re  endowed by their creator with certain unal ienable rights; that among these are life, lib erty, and the pursuit of happiness.  rans  Unfortunately,  for  hundreds  of  Americans,  their unalienable  rights  have been alienated, and continue to  be alienated by foreign criminals who  hide behind cloak of diplomatic immu nity.  For innocent Americans like Carol  Holmes who was brutally raped in her  own home, or ""Holly"" a young Wash ington DC,  teenager who was  raped-there  is no personal  liberty.  For residents  like Dr. Halla Brown,  professor of medicine and chief of the  allergy clinic at George Washington  University, there is no such thing as  freedom. Her professional career, her  contribution to our community, her fi nancial independence and her person al life were all destroyed by a Panama nian diplomat who,  through his cal lous  arrogance  and  disregard  for  simple traffic regulations, has left Dr.  Brown a prisoner in her own quadri plegic body. And for a young man like  Kenneth Skeen, who had honorably  served our country in military service,  his guarantee of a right to life was all  but extinguished by  the  son of  a  South American diplomat who shot  him three times and left him to fight  for his life in an intensive care unit.  In each of these cases, our citizens,  these victims of  international arro gance have not only been denied their  constitutional  rights of  life,  liberty,  and  the pursuit of happiness,  they  have also been denied the right of re dress of grievances, the right of equal  protection under law, and the right,  Mr. President, to expect what every  American is taught to expect and be lieve when they recite the Pledge of  Allegiance-the right of  liberty and  justice for all.  I believe that our colleague, the dis tinguished senior Senator from West  Virginia, Senator BYRD, stated it most  succinctly when,  in reference to the  shooting of Kenneth Skeen, he said it  seemed:  Inconceivable to me that the relative of a  diplomat can carry a gun in this country  and shoot an American citizen and cannot  be arrested; cannot be brought to trial; can  just be turned loose on the street.  I  too  think  it  inconceivable  that  such an outrageous lack of regard for  ",1987
902,896,13,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, I  wish to applaud the commitment of a  group of young citizens of Westchester  County, NY, who are pedaling their  way from their hometowns to our Nation's Capital to raise funds for the  homeless.  Cyclists participating in the 360-mile  Westchester Bike-a-thon hope to raise  greater social awareness of the prob lem of homelessness, and to raise des perately needed funds for three local  organizations that assist homeless in dividuals and families:  the Coalition  for  the Homeless,  the Coalition of  Westchester Food Pantries and Food  Kitchens, and the Have a Heart for  the Homeless Committee.  Most people familiar with this beau tiful  suburban area associate West chester County with great affluence;  indeed, painful social conditions like  poverty  and  homelessness  would  appear to be someone else's problem.  So it may come as a surprise that, on a  per capita basis, Westchester's home less problem is as severe as New York  City's.  In recent testimony before the Fi nance Subcommittee on Social Securi ty and Family Policy, Westchester  County  Executive  Andrew  P.  O'Rourke advised us that ""Westchest er has the bulk of the homeless prob lem in New York State outside of New  York City       . In April of this year,  750 Westchester families, with 1,450  children, were homeless."" This figure  represents a shocking 62-percent  in crease in just 1 year in the number of  homeless  families. This significantly  increases the tax burden on citizens of  Westchester County in the form of ad ditional AFDC payments to those fam ilies, representing the annual 62-per cent  increase, who  find  themselves  homeless. The county expects to spend  over $22 million this year on homeless  AFDC families-and half this amount  will be Federal money. Clearly, Mr.  President, we must take steps to allevi ate this enormous burden.  As my colleagues recall, both Houses  of Congress recently passed H.R. 558,  the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless  Assistance Act, which will  provide  more than $400 million in immediate,  Federal assistance for homeless pro grams.  In  the coming days, we will  vote on the conference agreement for  H.R. 558, and the measure will have  my strongest support. Under this legis lation,  funding will be provided  for  housing-emergency, transitional, and  long term; health care for the home less; education and training services;  and food assistance programs, among  others. Such funding is vital, it comes  not a moment too soon; but, even so, it  is not nearly adequate. In short, our  Nation's homeless crisis will not be  solved-indeed, will barely be amelio rated-by the legislation we pass.  We will not come to grips with the  tragedy of homelessness in our Nation  without the efforts of individuals in  each and every community across the  land. It is a formidable task: to raise  money;  to help feed and clothe our  neighbors who have fallen upon hard  times; to work within the community  providing  short-term  help  for  our  fellow citizens who need but a  little  encouragement,  and  long-term help  for those who might be in need of psy chiatric care or counseling  for sub stance abuse. Homelessness, we know,  is a multifaceted problem which de mands a multifacted response.  The bike-a-thon'ers from Westches ter deserve our admiration and our  thanks. We would all do well to follow  the example they set.  Mr. President,  the participants  in  the Westchester bike-a-thon are: Ross  Pollack, Susan Lauer, Raphael Ri verso, Adam Klotz, Margot Brown,  Larry  Paquette, Michael Molinelli,  Christopher Guglielmo, Bertha Well,  Winston Gonzalez, Russell Roman,  Les Maben,  Hilary  Kao, Martin  Zagari, James Halsey, Richard DiGia como, Chuck Resnick, and county leg islator Paul Feiner.e  ROBERT L.

Bob Loughhead  is  a businessman  who has won the admiration of the  people of the northern panhandle of  West Virginia for helping guide Weir ton Steel to an extraordinary recovery  and great success as the Nation's larg est employee-owned company. At a  time when many steelmills have been  forced  to close  their doors, he has  earned respect in the business commu nity for consistently promoting quality  products and customer service.  Bob has also won my respect and  great  admiration. We  spent many  sleepless nights and anxious moments  together, while  I was Governor of  West Virginia, putting together what  has become known as the ""miracle of  Weirton Steel."" While I've rarely had  a prouder moment than the day that  the final agreement was signed giving  birth  to Weirton Steel,  I  can only  imagine the kind of pride Bob has had  serving as the head of Weirton during  the company's infancy.  Bob Loughhead has led this great  steel company, and its 8,400 workers who are also its owners-to profits and  high  quality  products  that  have  become  industry  standards. He has  helped to demonstrate, through that  ""miracle of Weirton Steel"" and his  unique brand of participatory manage ment, what the American steel indus try is capable of doing-competing in a  world market and providing the best  workers in the world.

906,935,13,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, the more things  seem  to change  in South Korea,  the more  they stay the same.  Earlier  this week,  President Chun  had  agreed to make three important concessions  to the demonstrators in his country calling for  democracy.  He would meet  opposition  leader,  Kim  Young Sam, for the first time ever. He would  release Kim Dae-Jung  from his 53d house  arrest in  the  last 2 years, and he would re lease the hundreds of other protesters impris oned since June 10.  As the clouds of tear gas cleared away from  downtown Seoul, it seemed as if encouraging  signs were  starting  to appear  through  the  haze.  But  today  it  is clear  that President Chun  does not  intend  to move toward democracy  after all.  After only 24 hours of freedom, Kim Dae Jung is under house arrest once more. Two  days after President Chun's meeting with Kim  Young-Sam,  Kim  Young-Sam  himself was  forced  into a police car and placed under  house arrest. And  rather  than  releasing, as  promised,  the  hundreds  of  demonstrators  being held since June 10,  this morning  the  Chun  regime has placed over a  thousand  more people into its jails.  Two days ago, President Chun said that the  future security of South Korea is in a precari ous  situation. President Chun  understands  that much. But President Chun does not seem  to understand  that South Korea will not be  secure  if  its people are not  free. President  Chun does not seem  to understand that de mocracy  is  the best guarantee of security.  President Chun does not seem to understand  how deeply his people want democracy.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is  critical  that President  Chun  allow Democracy  to  grow  in South  Korea.  It is critical that President Chun stop  moving in the opposite direction toward mar tial law.  It is time for some real change after  all in South Korea.  TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM HELLMAN  HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 26, 1987  ",1987

I would  like to thank Bill Hellman  for his years of dedicated public service, and  wish him well in his new life.  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. DAVID E.

909,935,13,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to take this opportunity to call for a renewed  emphasis in Congress for passing  legislation  to end the liability insurance crisis now facing  small businesses and manufacturers across  the country.  The small business sector in our country manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers-are  being crushed under the weight of our current  liability tort system. For too many enterprises  the cost of doing business  in America  is  simply too expensive.  Last year businesses paid out a  total of  $116 billion in liability tort claims. Injured con sumers  received  far  less  than half of  that  amount. Even if you aren't opposed to the ex orbitant amounts being paid out in successful  liability claims, you've got to wonder about the  amounts being paid out for middleman han dling charges.  Very few of us would want to see a system  which made  it difficult for injured consumers  to press their legitimate injury claims against a  liable party. What we should all like to see is a  system which is fair and just without being de bilitating  to our entire nationwide business  community.  17907  We have the framework for such a system  in the form of H.R. 1115, the Uniform Product  Safety Act of 1987. This bill goes right to the  heart of  the  liability crisis  facing America's  businesses while it would actually accelerate  the emphasis on protecting consumers from  dangerous products.  The Uniform Product Safety Act of 1987, as  the title implies, would establish uniform safety  standards for products sold in interstate com merce. By doing so, it would also promote in creased safety in the manufacture and use of  these products.  Also,  insurers would be allowed  to base  their rates for product liability insurance on a  uniform and predictable standard. Rates now  are set against a backdrop of extremely inflat ed tort claim settlements which often collect  from parties  liable only  in  the most remote  sense.  Finally, States would be allowed to develop  alternative methods for settling product liability  disputes  in a way  that will  reduce costs  to  both businesses and consumers. New meth ods could be  instituted without  threatening  consumer power to win just settlements.  Mr. Speaker,  today many businesses face  the worst dilemma; that is the choice between  simply going without any  liability  insurance  coverage at all, or laying off workers, closing  plants, and skimping on efforts toward greater  innovation  just  to afford  insurance-all  the  while hoping that their premiums won't double  or triple again next year.  Of course, we are all very concerned with  finding new ways to help our businesses win  back their competitive edge. Here is a way we  can begin to help; here is a way we can bring  down the cost of doing business in America,  and do so by improving consumer protection  and the consumer's right to seek just compen sation for damages.  Mr. Speaker,  I encourage all of my col leagues to get behind this issue with full force.  Let's give America a tort system that is pro tective for the consumer without bankrupting  our businesses.  TRIBUTE TO PUTNAM COUNTY  HON. HAMILTON FISH, JR.  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 26, 1987  ",1987
910,935,13,Mr. FISH.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise to announce  to  this chamber  the  175th anniversary of  Putnam County, NY. Originally part of Dut chess County, Putnam was separated by the  New York State Legislature on June 12, 1812.  Putnam County  is small  in  size,  the  third  smallest county in the State, but it is favored  by rolling hills, clear lakes and streams and  lush greenery that exists to this day.  It is only 50 miles north of New York City  and is bounded by the Hudson River on the  west and Connecticut  to  the east. Putnam  County is one of the most beautiful sections  of  the Hudson River, where  the majestic  Hudson Highlands rise from the river's edge.  This section of  the Hudson, dominated by  West point on  the east shore, has  long  in spired painters with its scenic beauty.  ",1987
911,961,13,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, today  we are considering final passage of the  conference agreement for the Stewart  B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.  As a conferee on this bill, I wish to ex press my support for the conference  agreement.  Not  long ago, a young man spent  three nights counting homeless people  in Miami. He counted 1,300 on  the  streets and in emergency shelters. The  Florida Department of Health  and  Human Services  took  an  informal  survey and concluded  that at  least  10,000 people are homeless on any  given night iri our State. In Tampa,  about 700 people live on the streets  and another 300  live  in makeshift  housing. This helps to explain why I  support  the  conference  agreement  before us today.  While  the homeless are a  serious  problem in Florida, they are also a na tional problem. A lot of the homeless  are drug abusers. Perhaps as many as  a quarter of  them are mentally  ill.  And now, the most alarming thing is  that we are seeing many families with  children out on the street.  The Federal Government has taken  some steps to help these people. Last  year's antidrug bill included giving the  homeless employment training and al lowing  the use of  food  stamps  for  meals at soup kitchens. The continu ing  resolution passed  for  con tained new  funding  for  emergency  shelters and transitional housing. Ear lier this year, in response to a particu larly severe winter, Congress passed an  emergency  appropriation  for  the  FEMA emergency  food  and shelter  program.  But we need to do more. The confer ence agreement before us today is a  step  in  the right direction. The au thorizations in this bill pave the way  to modify and expand programs  to  serve the housing, health, educational,  job training, and nutritional needs of  the homeless.  As chairman of the Budget Commit tee, I have to say that we will not be  able  to do  everything we want.  In  these days of severe budget pressures,  every  dollar  spent must  be  spent  wisely and delivered efficiently. Since  the inception of this legislation, I have  been supportive of the general efforts  1987  91-059 0-89-31 (Pt. 13)  ",1987

950,974,13,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, what  we have before us now simply is the  addition of  the Baucus amendment,  the addition of the amendment of the  distinguished Senator from Arkansas  [Mr. PRYOR] and the primary amend ment  which  was  the  underlying  amendment under debate.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to  vote for this amendment. It makes it  clear that the deficit in the Federal  budget  is  the primary cause of  the  trade deficit. It also points out that  there are additional problems concern ing protectionism and concerning com petitiveness and it also asks the Presi dent to give us some idea as to what  great evils would befall  the Nation,  what hardship would come about if in  fact we had a balanced budget.  I  remind my colleagues that if in  fact we adopt this amendment, if we  adopt a balanced budget amendment  to the Constitution before October 15,  if that goes to the States, we are look ing at 1990 or 1991 before it would go  into place.

954,987,13,Mr.  LEAHY.," Mr.  President,  last  night,  the  3-week  long  conference  committee on the urgent supplemental  appropriation for fiscal year 1987 fi nally concluded.  As a Senator from a State with im portant farm interests, and as chair man of the Agriculture Committee, I  am relieved that at last Congress will  reauthorize Commodity Credit Cor portation payments. I have been re ceiving calls almost daily from Ver mont farmers suffering because of de layed CCC payments. Senators from  all  farm States have been hearing  from home,  too.  It was outrageous  that the conference lasted so long.  Mr. President, the Senate should be  aware that the supplemental confer ence dragged on not because  there  were time consuming compromises to  be worked out on funding levels. The  delay was deliberate and  it was be cause  the  bill  contained  language  which would have required the United  States to comply once again with key  numerical  limits  in  the  SALT  II  treaty. Opponents of this arms control  provision prolonged  the conference,  using  the pain of  farmers  to build  pressure on SALT supporters to agree  to withdraw  the  SALT  provision.  Knowing that we supporters of restor ing U.S. observance of  these SALT  limits are in a majority in the Senate,  determined  SALT  opponents  used  these tactics to prevent a vote. They  know that if we can just get the SALT  issue to a vote on the floor, we will  win. So they filibuster the defense au thorization bill, deliberately delay the  supplemental conference, and threat en  to  filibuster  any bill where we  might offer our SALT amendment.  Apparently, any tactic is fair game to  prevent  the Senate  from  taking  a  stand on this arms control issue.  Well, Mr. President, this Senator is  just as determined  that the Senate  will vote on whether the United States  should scrap the only limits still on  Soviet strategic missiles and bombers  aimed at our cities and towns. Many  bills are coming up besides the defense  authorization bill, which  the other  side of the aisle is blocking with a fili buster. The Senate  is not going  to  duck this critical arms control issue  this year. Senators are going to have  to stand up and be counted on wheth er they agree with President Reagan's  decision to stop abiding by the SALT  numerical controls.  THE SUPREME COURT  NOMINATION  ",1987
955,987,13,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  there  has been a  lot of discussion  in this  morning's press about  the Supreme  Court nomination about to be made by  the President of the United States. I  would only hold out one suggestion,  based on the realities of the calendar.  If this was this time next year, then  there would be no question that an ap pointment would have to have compe tence  far outweighing  ideology. Be cause we have 1 % years, there may be  some who would be tempted to have  ideology outweigh competence.  I would suggest for the good of the  Presidency,  the good of  the Senate,  both parties, and the good of the Su preme Court, that competence be the  first, second, and third criterias, far  outweighing ideology or political con siderations. With that, then, I  think  we will enhance not only the credibil ity of the Presidency and the Supreme  Court, but certainly make it possible  for this body to carry out its advise  and consent responsibilities in the best  of its 200-year tradition.  BICENTENNIAL MINUTE  JUNE 27, 1789: FIRST CONFERENCE COMMITTEE  ",1987
956,987,13,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, on a Sat urday 198 years ago today, during the  first  session of  the  first Congress,  Members of  the Senate and House  were holding  their  first  conference  committee meeting.  Conference committees had not been  needed in the single-body legislature  that had met under the Article of Con federation. But when the Constitution  created two Houses of Congress, con ferences became necessary to resolve  the differences in the bills passed by  each Chamber.  On May 29, 1789,  the Senate re ceived  from  the House  a  ""tonnage  act,""  imposing  duties  on  imported  goods. The Senate then proceeded to  enact  some 40  amendments  to  the  House bill, changing duties on a varie ty of items ranging from tea and play ing cards to shoes and gunpowder. On  June 15, the House responded by ac cepting half of the Senate's amend ments. The Senate debated again, this  time agreeing to drop most of the dis puted items, but insisting that eight of  its  amendments  be  retained.  The  House was willing to accept two more  ",1987
957,1000,13,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of three pieces of legislation brought  before  the House today: H.R. 2616,  the VA  Health Care Act Amendments of 1987; H.R.  2327, the VA Beneficiary Travel Program; and  H.R.  1504,  the Veterans Employment and  Education amendments.  I want to commend  the gentleman  from Mississippi  [Mr. MONT GOMERY] for his leadership on the committee,  and  the  gentleman  from Mississippi  [Mr.  DOWDY] and my colleague  from New York  [Mr. SOLOMON]  for their dedicated efforts on  behalf of our veterans.  The VA Health Care Act Amendments of  1987 authorizes $6 million for a pilot program  to  provide  community-based  treatment  to  homeless  veterans  suffering  from  chronic  mental illness. The homeless mentally ill have  become one of  the greatest problems of  present-day society. The problem will not be  solved until a comprehensive and  integrated  system of care for the chronically mentally ill  is established. H.R. 2616 requires that the VA  furnish outpatient health care  to category A  veterans seeking care. Extending mandatory  treatment for outpatient care will enable veter ans to predict the likelihood of receiving care  and eliminate  the need  for costlier inpatient  services.  The VA Beneficiary Travel Program requires  the Veterans' Administration to pay travel ben efits to certain eligible veterans. As a cospon sor of this fine legislation, (H.R. 2327), I want  to stress that historically, VA travel benefits in  connection with medical treatment have been  awarded on a discretionary basis. However,  new regulations prescribed in April 1987 have  limited eligibility. Studies have shown that the  veterans applying for travel benefits are more  likely  to be unemployed and have  incomes  below $10,000. Many of our veterans have  been unable  to use VA health care without  travel benefits. These new  regulations have  placed  an  unreasonable  hardship  on  our  needy veterans.  The Veterans Employment and Education  Act amendments (H.R. 1504) authorizes $30  million in fiscal year 1987 and $60 million an nually through fiscal year 1990 for the Veter ans' Job Training Act [VJTA). The VJTA was  enacted in 1983 in response to the high un employment among Vietnam-era and Korean  veterans. Through the program the VA pays  subsidies  to employers providing on-the-job  training in approved programs. This successful  program has helped over 48,000 chronically  unemployed veterans  return  to work. When  the program was enacted in 1983, the unemployment rate  for Vietnam veterans was 9.1  percent. Today, it stands at 4.2 percent, lower  than that of the comparable group of nonvet erans.  Mr. Speaker, these measures help alleviate  many of the burdens faced by our veterans  and the rest of society, such as homelessness  and unemployment. Accordingly,  I urge my  colleagues to join in support of the VA Health  Care Act Amendments of 1987, the VA Bene ficiary Travel Program, and the Veterans Em ployment and Education Act amendments.  These bills which  received  the unanimous  support of  the Veterans' Affairs Committee  deserve our solid support.  Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York. Mr. Speak er, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2616,  the Veterans' Administration Health Care Pro grams Act of 1987. Our veterans have sacri ficed a great deal  for this Nation. We must  now honor the commitment we made to pro vide them with needed health care.  This bill would provide outpatient care  for  veterans disabled in war, former prisoners of  war, and low-income veterans. It would enable  the VA  to provide  incentives to ensure  that  quality nurses, pharmacists, and other needed  professionals are available  to provide  that  care.  Mr. Speaker, while I rise in support of H.R.  2616, it is my strong hope that passage of this  legislation will not be injurious to the Veterans'  Outreach Center, Inc., which is located in my  District in Rochester, NY. The Veterans' Out reach Center  is a not-for-profit, community based organization, which was established in  1973. The center served as a model for the  VA Vet-Center Program which was initiated in  1979. It has helped thousands of Vietnam-era  veterans with readjustment problems, utilizing  contracts with  the Veterans' Administration  and the great State of New York. The Veter ans' Outreach Center receives additional sup port from foundations, businesses, and individ uals in our community.  The Veterans' Outreach Center and the VA  Vet Center have worked cooperatively in our  community  since 1986, when  the VA Vet  Center was first established in our community.  It is my hope that both initiatives can continue  to work together and serve Vietnam-era veter ans under  the  readjustment counseling pro gram.  ",1987

965,1013,13,Mr. GORDON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  thank the chairman of the National Parks and  Public  lands Subcommittee, BRUCE VENTO,  for his guidance and support in bringing H.R.  1994 to the floor today. If it weren't for Chairman VENTO'S recognition of the bill's national  importance, it would never have come to the  floor in such an expeditious manner with such  unanimous support.  Briefly, H.R. 1994 directs the Park Service  to stabilize and historically interpret Fortress  Rosecrans,  the world's  largest earthen  for tress, and construct a trail connecting Stones  River National Battlefield and  the  fortress  while intersecting two outlying parcels of land  already included in the park.  My hometown of Murfreesboro, TN, was the  site of one of the Civil War's major battles.  From December 31, 1862, through January 2,  1863, the Union and Confederate Armies, with  the combined strength of more  than 81,000  men, clashed  in one of  the war's bloodiest  battles. As a result of the Union's victory in  the Battle of Stones River, Union forces were  able to construct Fortress Rosecrans.  The Union Army used the fortress as an ar mament and supply depot  for  their march  south. The  fortress was designed  to house  more than 55,000 troops and maintain a 2to  3-month supply of food and armaments.  Major developments in the battle took place  on the land which lies adjacent to, but is not  currently included, in the national military park.  In order to preserve the historical integrity of  this land and preserve the significance of the  battle which led to the Union's eventual victo ry in the War Between the States, H.R. 1994  expands the boundaries of the existing park  by 53 acres and incorporates Fortress Rose crans into the boundaries of the park.  Mr. Speaker, time is of the essence. Nash ville is one of the fastest growing metropolitan  areas  in  the Southeast. Murfreesboro  is a  suburb of Nashville which is experiencing the  same rate of growth.  Three thousand families move to the Mur freesboro  area  annually. Since  1983,  the  number of  building  permits  for  residential  dwellings has  tripled.  I am  proud of  this  growth. Yet, I am concerned at the same time.  We need controlled growth which preserves  the historical integrity of the Stones River Na tional Battlefield.  Unfortunately, instead of attempting  to ac quire all the land that is necessary to preserve  the historic value of the Stones River Battle, I  am faced with the task of securing land that is  still free from development.  In 1980,  the Park Service's general man agement plan  targeted 284 acres  to be ac quired and  included in  the national park. By  1984 the number of available acres had dimin ished to 84. Last month the Park Service con ducted another  land appraisal and  informed  me that we have lost another 30 acres to de velopment. In all, 231 acres of historically sig nificant  land has been subject  to develop ment.  H.R. 1994  initiates a unique arrangement  between the Park Service and the city of Mur freesboro.  In  return  for  the Park Service's  technical expertise in stabilizing and preserv ing Fortress Rosecrans and constructing the  trail, the city has agreed to take all manage ment, maintenance, and financial responsibil ities after  the Park Service has completed  their work. It is important to point out that the  citizens of Murfreesboro are waking in coordi nation with  the Federal Government to pre serve national history.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1994 is important to pre serving a section of American history. The  more than 200,000 visitors who visit Stones  River annually would not only be exposed to  the historic battlefield, but, additionally, visitors  will be able  to explore one of  the  largest  earthen forts still partially intact in the United  States.

970,1026,13,Mr. LEACH of Iowa.," Mr. Chairman,  first let me compliment the gentleman  from Ohio [Mr. FEIGHAN], whose lead ership in this issue has been so impres sive.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from New York [Mr. SOLO MON], a distinguished Korean war vet eran  and  the  ranking  minority  member  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Human Rights and International Or ganizations.  ",1987
971,1026,13,Mr. SOLOMON.," I thank the gentle man for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, at the outset, in addi tion to all of the other Members who  have been committed, like the gentle man from Iowa [Mr. LEAcH] and our  good chairman and our good ranking  minority member, the gentleman from  Michigan [Mr. BROOMFIELD], and the  gentleman  from  New  York  [Mr.  SOLARZ], we would  like also  to give  great credit  to my counterpart,  the  chairman of the Human Rights Sub committee, the gentleman from Penn sylvania, [Mr. Gus YATRON]. I see him  in the well now. I was looking for him.  Without his efforts I do not think that  we could have crafted the resolution  that we have here today.  Mr. Speaker, let me also say that  Mr. SOLARZ, my good friend, stole my  speech. Again, we could change a few  names, and I  could have given  the  same. I commend him for his remarks  and for the effort that has gone into  this resolution.  Second, let me just break this una nimity of great  friendship  that we  have here for just a moment and criti cize a little bit the previous speaker in  the well, who brought up a lot of old  issues when we really are trying to put  together a unanimous support for this  resolution, and I think that we have it.  But, Mr. Speaker, we  should give  credit  to  the administration for  the  way in which they have diplomatically  handled this issue. They have worked  through diplomatic channels and have  I think brought about a resolve to a  very, very serious problem that exists.  Mr. Speaker, at this point I would  like to make several important obser vations about this resolution.  First, given the new realities of the  political situation in the Republic of  Korea, as announced yesterday in a  dramatic and significant address by  Roh Tae Woo,  this  resolution now  takes  the form of a congratulatory  message.  The  political  leaders  in  South Korea, Government and opposi tion alike, will soon be sitting down to  discuss the very issues raised in this  resolution. We wish them well as they  begin their talks-and we express our  hope and confidence that the outcome  of their talks will be successful.  Second,  it  is very significant  that  this resolution takes full cognizance of  North Korea and the massive threat  to the security of the ROK that the  north poses. Whatever the shortcom ings of  the South Korean political  system may be, they pale in compari son with those in the north. Moreover,  this resolution reaffirms the fidelity of  the United States to our security com mitments with  the ROK-security  commitments rooted in a mutual de fense  treaty  in which  the United  States pledges  to continue  to stand  with South Korea against any and all  foreign invaders: North Koreans, the  Soviets,  the  Chinese  Communists,  whomever.  The Republic of Korea has been one  of our strongest and closest allies. Last  week marked the 37th anniversary of  the North Korean attack that tested  the willingness of the United States  and our other allies to make good the  policy of containing Communist ex pansion. Together we stood with the  South Koreans to meet  that chal lenge. Who knows how the subsequent  history of our world would have been  different had we not done so? In fight ing side by side with the South Kore ans to save their liberties, they were  helping us preserve our liberties.  Another observation that needs to  be made concerns the role of President  Chun  and  the  economic  progress  South Korea has made under his lead ership. He has presided over the great est  period  of  sustained  economic  progress that the ROK has ever seen.  Few, if any countries, have ever seen  such phenomenal progress in so short  a time. It is a measure of that growth  and  the  stature South Korea has  achieved as a nation that Seoul was se lected to host the 1988 Olympics.  And as this resolution makes note,  President Chun has made a vital con tribution to the political life of South  Korea by promoting the concept of a  constitutional  transfer  of  executive  authority.  In any other developing  country, a head of state would be con demning  himself  to  an  intolerable  lameduck  status by announcing,  as  President Chun did, when he would be  stepping down from office. To even  think in terms of such limits on per sonal power  is unthinkable  in most  countries.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, a word about  this weekend's events. I believe that  Roh Tae Woo, as leader of the ruling  party, is to be commended for break ing the logjam in Korean politics. His  leadership, leadership that includes a  willingness to renounce personal ambi tions, has provided the breakthrough  we all have been hoping for. Theim passe  could  only  be  broken when  someone-from either side-was will ing to step back and give moderation a  chance. I trust that the opposition will  respond in kind, and the initial indica tions have been encouraging.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that these com ments will  enable  the Members  to  place this resolution in the proper per spective, particularly in view of the  events this weekend.  0 1500  ",1987
972,1026,13,Mr. F ASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  the balance of my time to the distin guished gentleman from Pennsylvania  [Mr. YATRON],  the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Human Rights and  International Operations.  ",1987
973,1026,13,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I first  want  to  commend  the  sponsor  of  House Concurrent Resolution 141, Mr.  FEIGHAN, for not only taking the lead  on this initiative but for his unwaver ing commitment to human rights and  democracy in Korea.  Needless to say, the chairman of the  Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommit tee, Mr. SOLARZ, has been a major cata lyst in crafting and expediting this res olution. With the exception of some  past and present dictators, his work in  behalf of human rights is always wel comed. I would also note the valuable  contributions of Mr. LEACH and Mr.  SOLOMON with respect to this resolu tion as well as their indepth under standing of United States policy inter ests in Korea.  Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Res olution 141 is a bipartisan expression  of United States support for democra cy and security  in  the Republic of  Korea. This  resolution  is based on  thorough hearings held by  the  two  subcommittees in May as well as ex tensive consultations with the admin istration and principle members from  both sides of the aisle. It is very im portant to note that this resolution is  supported by  the administration. In  fact, this resolution enhances the ef fectiveness of U.S. policy.  Mr. Speaker, this resolution does not  endorse any political party, opposition  group, or platform. And it does not  dictate to Korea how it should run its  Government.  This resolution in a bipartisan and  diplomatic manner reaffirms our com mitment to the security of the Repub",1987
974,1078,13,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Chair . man, reclaiming my time, I might say  in response to my colleague's amend ments that I agree with part of his  amendments, but I am not sure I agree  with the entire block, although if I  had the kind of authority I would wish  for  around here,  I  certainly would  move in the direction of much of that  which the gentleman  is  recommend ing.  In part, our problem is frustration  with a process that is well established.  Much of the expenditure the gentle man has mentioned by way of his  amendments comes  to us by way of  the House Administration Committee  for automatic assumptions of appro priation. That would not suggest, how ever, that the committee as well as the  House has not tried to restrain itself.  The gentleman indicated that from  the day he and I arrived on the floor  in 1979 we began holding back on in creases in numbers of personnel, par ticularly in our personal staffs. Indeed  we may note in the report that the  agencies of the legislative branch re quested funding for 216 new positions  for fiscal year 1988. Five have been al lowed. Further, the recommendations  are included in the bill, and the actions of  the agencies will  result  in  some 55 positions under the staffing  level  currently  authorized  in  fiscal  year 1987.  We are attempting to go in the right  direction. But indeed I share with the  gentleman his frustration about this  process. We started from  the wrong  plateau in 1979. For many, many years  particularly our committee staffs were  at levels that should not in my judg ment have been allowed. Nonetheless,  we should deal with the process where  we find ourselves in the beginning. In  this  case  I  feel  the  subcommittee  chairman has been most diligent in at tempting to hold back  those  in the  House  and outside  the House who  would expand our spending, particu larly our personnel spending.  ",1987
975,1078,13,Mr. BROWN of Colorado.," Mr. Chair man,  I move  to strike  the requisite  number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to com mend the gentleman from New York  [Mr. DIOGUARDI]  for  his  excellent  amendment. I  intend to support it. I  think  it  is  important.  It goes  far  beyond the savings in dollars that he  proposes.  As the gentleman has pointed out,  this House has had an  increase  in  spending over the last several decades  that is of monumental proportions. It  is not  just the personal staffs, but  there has been an explosion in com mittee staffs. At times there has been  some committees where we have seen  a drop in the workload and we have  seen an explosion in personal staffs.  Let us put a label on it. This is not just  legislative work. What this has become  is a patronage function that ill serves  this House and ill serves this country.  The reason this amendment is so im portant is not just that it freezes out lays in the legislative area for these  kinds of salaries; it is because it sets  and example for this Nation. It says to  this country that we are willing to do  our part to hold expeditures in this  area to what they were in the prior  year. As a matter of fact, the proposal  of the gentleman from New York is a  very modest one, because he not only  takes into account what was appropri ated last year but he takes into ac count the supplemental as well.  0  1655  This is not a cut. This simply says  we are going to go 1 year without in creasing spending in this area. To me  that seems  like a  responsible effort,  but understand what it means beyond  that.  It means that this House has the  gumption and the courage to set an  example;  and  that  example,  if we  follow up in the rest of the Federal  budget, can make a major difference  toward  turning  this country around  and toward restoring through progress  and prosperity.  3,000  Mr. DioGUARDI. Mr. Chairman,  will the gentleman yield?  ",1987
976,1078,13,Mr. BROWN of Colorado.," Mr. Chair man, I yield  to the gentleman from  New York [Mr. DIOGUARDI].  Mr. DioGUARDI. Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, we all know that the  budget process does not work in the  House. There have been so many at tempts  to amend  it, and that same  process is creeping into the appropria tions process here.  I spent 22 years in the private sector  dealing with budgets  and  financial  matters, and the only question I hear  asked in the House here when it comes  to budgeting and appropriations  is,  what did we spend last year.  We seem to take a very simplistic,  quantitative approach, not a qualita tive approach,  to what we need. We  seem to build our budgets from the  fifth story down, not the ground up. It  is time that we change that.  A group of my constituents from my  district came down, and  they biked  from Westchester County to raise the  public  awareness  level  about  the  homeless. We  have  homeless  people in my district.  We must set our priorities, so  the  moneys in this body are spent where  they are really needed.  I cannot believe the gentleman from  California [Mr. FAZIO] can resist a re duction of $6 million at a time when  the homeless population is growing, at  a time when, since 1981 housing pro grams have been cut by close  to 65  percent, and yet incredibly, committee  funding has risen by more than 50 per cent. That to me is ridiculous.  We all know what this card is. It  looks  like  an ordinary  credit card.  Many people back home do not know  what this card is.  It is a card that we use in our voting  terminals here in the House to vote.  This has become the most expensive  credit card in the world. This card has  no limit.  If we, or our spouses, get a card from  our vendors,  like American Express,  Diners Club, Master Charge, and they  tell us that we have reached our $2,000  or $5,000 limit, we know that economic  reality has arrived.  But not so with this card. Last year  we reached $2 trillion in national debt;  and what did we do? We kept raising  the limit, the debt ceiling, and said,  pass it on to the kids, let them pay for  it.  There is a credit-card mentality in  this country, and it should stop right  now, because this is the only constitu ency for this bill, the Members of Con gress.  ",1987

979,1091,13,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I am not going to say  that I am not going to take the 5 min utes, because the debate has raised a  number of issues.  One of the things that bothers me is  that we  are  reconstructing history.  There  is  the  suggestion  that  the  Speaker did this in order to protect  Members because Members were being  challenged on the floor as if they were  here when  they were not here  to  defend themselves.  In fact, it is a myth that has been  created. There is not one example that  that did occur.  With respect to the words that were  stated at that time, they were quotes  of Members from the RECORD.  ",1987
980,1091,13,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Chairman,  will the gentleman yield?  ",1987
981,1091,13,Mr. LUNGREN., Not at  this  time.  The gentlewoman had her opportuni ty to speak.  ,1987
982,1091,13,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Well,  the gen tleman has said  that what we are  saying is not true.  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman  from California has the time.  ",1987
983,1091,13,Mr. LUNGREN.," Well, Mr. Chair man, it happened to be a controversial  time dealing with an effort by some  Members of the Congress to present  statements  that had been made by  Members of the other side of the aisle,  articulating  their  overall  foreign  policy. They were quoting words that  other Members had stated at previous  times. I understand that was contro versial. It was upsetting, but that was  the context. It was not an effort in  which Members looked to the other  side as if they were here.  Also  during  that period  of  time  Members had sent  letters  to  those  Members who would be quoted notify ing them ahead of time; but that is  beside the point.  The point here is, what are we going  to do? I, for the life of me, believe that  televising this place is one of the best  things we ever did. Perhaps that is be cause I come from a State that is very  far from here and very few of my con stituents, particularly young people,  have the opportunity to come and see  this place. They have to fly or drive  across the country, go to the Member's  office, pick up a card and then stand  in the galleries or sit in the galleries.  Television allows them to do that.  We do not say when you sit in the  galleries  that  you  cannot  look  at  whether anybody is here, that you can  only look at who is speaking.  My point is that if you are going to  pan in an effort to show people what  happens here, pan during the whole  time, show what happens here, and  then let us explain to our constituents  that many Members happen  to be  meeting constituents, in their offices  watching  this debate,  in committees  and so forth. That is the right thing to  do. That is what this amendment says.  It says that whatever the procedures  are during the regular order of the  House will be  the same procedures  during the special orders. That is all it  says; so that if you think it is impor tant for people to see when you are  speaking on the floor that nobody is  here during special orders, you also  ought to think it important when you  are speaking on the floor during regu lar order and nobody is here.  D 1820  We had eight suspension calendar  bills  this morning. Virtually nobody  was here. If you were watching on tel evision you would not know that, be cause we only allow television to show  the person speaking, the person in the  chair,  the people at  the  leadership  tables. That is only showing part of  the story.  My constituents by and large cannot  be here. The folks in the galleries can  see that nobody is here. Why cannot  people who cannot afford to take the  time to fly here see that same thing?  All that we are saying is, ""Don't make  special rules for special orders; make  the same rule apply so that no matter  who is in the gallery, they're going to  see the same thing they'd see if they  were home watching on television.""  It is honesty. It is showing people  what is happening in this House.  Why do we fear that? It took us long  enough to come to the television era.  Why should we fear to show people  that maybe only  few Members are  here? That is a fact.  ",1987

986,1091,13,Mrs.  SCHROEDER.,"  I  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I  totally agree with  the gentleman.  I am delighted  that  the television era is here. I have no  problem with showing the whole proc ess. Where I have problems with the  gentleman  is  that he really miscon strued how we got here.  ",1987
987,1091,13,Mr. LUNGREN.," No, I did not.  ",1987
988,1091,13,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," He said that a  lot of people were notified. They were  not. I do not know about the gentle men, but the Congresswomen all got  thank  the  mixed up, and  there were Members  down here accusing Congresswomen  who had sons that were trying to pro tect them from the draft that were  not even married, there were people  down here who were doing all sorts of  allegations.  ",1987
989,1091,13,Mr. LUNGREN.," If the gentlewoman  is saying that this House is fallible, I  will stipulate to that. I have yet to  find an infallible Member of Congress,  including myself or the gentlewoman  in the well. Members do make mis takes. But to suggest that Members  were standing down there and point ing  to somebody and saying,  ""Why  aren't you answering?""  is  just a  fic tion. It is a fiction that has been cre ated, and now it is returning here. It is  not the case.  ",1987
990,1091,13,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," The gentleman  is absolutely wrong. It is the case, and  I think the gentleman is trying to mis construe. It did happen, and we have  documentation.  ",1987
991,1091,13,Mr. LUNGREN.," If the gentlewoman  wants to go back and review the tapes,  as some have, she will see that that is  not true. Some people thought that  that was happening; it did not happen.  ",1987

I would like to follow that  by  saying  that  the panning policy  when first instituted in the House was  not discussed by the bipartisan group  which has been instituted to review an  established policy regarding television  in the House. It seems to me that if  the leadership was willing to consider  going back to the table and revisiting  the purpose of this policy and what we  are doing to the institution-I am per sonally convinced  that  the Speaker  wants to help establish the credibility  of this House as much as any Member.  We ought to revisit this policy. Indeed,  if I could get a commitment to do that,  I would seriously consider not taking  this matter to a recorded vote.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman from California [Mr. LUN GREN] has expired.  (By unanimous consent, Mr. LUN GREN was allowed to proceed for 1 addi tional minute.)  ",1987

997,1091,13,Mr. FAZIO.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  I would  be  very  happy to assure my friend, a member  of the leadership, that this question  can be discussed at the next bipartisan  leadership meeting  if  that  is  his  intent.  ",1987

1000,1104,13,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Chair man,  I move  to strike  the requisite  number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise reluctantly to  oppose this amendment.  Frankly, I have a great appreciation  for the work that is being done by the  gentleman and  the gentlewoman  in volved in the review of this subcom mittee's work. Indeed, this has been a  tough year for us as well. In the cate gory we are dealing with here, we did  appropriate some $7 million, not quite  that, but close to $7 million under the  request of the Architect.  We  too, share in the endless com plaints about the work of the Archi tect. We, too, share in the complaints  about the way your offices are being  cared for.  We,  too, are concerned about  the  grounds of the place and, indeed, I am  very concerned about  the  length of  time that has gone by when we failed  to put in appropriate wiring and fire  control devices  in buildings  like  the  Longworth Building.  Indeed, it is time to get tough; but  frankly,  in  this  category,  generally  with the Architect this year and in our  subcommittee  bill,  we  have  been  tough.  I would suggest once again that we  should be reminded that our expendi tures are easy to target. It is very easy  to say, ""Let's put it off until tomor row.""  In this case, I urge the House to rec ognize  that  the  subcommittee  has  tried to do its work. Indeed, we have  drawn a line that reflects that which  we  think is of  the greatest need in  terms of  the Architect's reponsibili ties.  ",1987

1003,1104,13,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Chairman, I appre ciate the gentleman yielding.  I would like to reminded the Mem bers that we brought a freeze budget  out last year. The fact that a  lot of  these architectural improvements are  deferrals from prior years is the result  of the fact that we had brought out  tight budgets year after year. We have  rejected more  than half of  the  re quests made by  the Architect  this  year. Some of these seem to be beyond  the point where it would be responsi ble for us to def er them still another  year, particularly in light of the birthday of the Congress. We thought after  a decade we needed to have the dome  painted, for example.  We still have PCB's in some of our  transformers. We did not add addition al funds for this project because we  are not satisfied that the Architect yet  has a plan to carry out that clean up,  but they must be cleaned up and next  year I hope we can include the funds  that will allow us to be safe from that  problem, all of us, tourists as well as  those who work here.  We  have many problems  in  this  building and the other House build ings that go straight to the mainte nance funds that are being attacked  by this amendment. This amendment  has been described as allowing the Ar chitect to make decisions about where  he spends the money.  Although I will insist the architect  receive the approval of the Committee  in deciding on how to allocate this re duction,  I  agree with  the criticism.  The  gentleman  from  Iowa  [Mr.  TAUKE] indicated that earlier. I would  make sure, though, that we direct ex actly where  these dollars should be  spent and not give him the additional  discretion.  ",1987
1004,1104,13,Mr. LEWIS of California.,"  I men tioned, Mr. Chairman, that in this cat egory in dealing with the Architect's  budget, the subcommittee cut the ar chitectural requests in total across the  board some $18.8 million. We have  been very tough on the Architect.  I must say that within our subcom mittee we battled and eventually came  to a compromise.  I appreciate the gentlewomen's posi tion here.  ",1987

1007,1104,13,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Chairman, the point has been made a  number of times that the gentleman  believes the Architect needs the direc tion of line items control and that our  amendment would cut his budget too  broadly.  I would just remind the gentleman  that in conference and at other times  we have the power to realign those  cuts and make them more specific as  we choose.  ",1987
1008,1104,13,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield on that point?  ",1987

1010,1104,13,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Chairman, we will  not have the ability in conference to  deal with House items. We make final  decisions  right  here  on  the  floor.  There is no further improvement that  could be made, because the Senate will  not  adjust  the  funding  for House  office buildings.  ",1987

1014,1104,13,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words. I  rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to com pliment the chairman and the ranking  member of the Appropriations Com mittee for cutting the Architect's re quest down substantially.  You know, tonight if we were look ing here for a modest increase to buy  some scrubbing brushes and brooms, I  think all of us who have  to live  in  these filthy buildings would support it.  Even the front of the Capitol does not  get hosed down on weekends, it looks  like. There is always mud on the steps  and the place really looks rotten; but I  would suggest that if you look careful ly at that budget that you are going to  find  that  it  is not more  cleaning  people. It is not more scrubbing brush es and it is not more brooms that is  causing the increase.  I think we need only to look out the  front door, where  I  understand we  spent $400,000 on flower pots. Look at  the west side of the Capitol, if we want  to take the word of the Architect.  Now, it is very nice to find that the  Architect is right now coming in $27  million below the budget on the West  Front reconstruction of the Capitol,  but I would like to remind this com mittee that it was the Architect who  came in with such a bloated figure and  he came  in with only one  thing in  mind, and that is so we could create an  extension on the Capitol, which we  soundly defeated and went ahead with  the reconstruction.  We in the Congress have to depend  upon the people in the administration  and the Architect, as they are in man agement and they are in a better posi tion to make judgments; but we also  must remember  the history. In  this  situation, history tells us that the Ar chitect comes  in with a very  large  budget, which I am not sure he even  believes himself.  While I am on this matter, I would  like to ask either the ranking member  or the chairman of the committee ex actly what will happen to the funds  that are saved on the reconstruction  of the west front of the Capitol. Will  they come back to the Treasury or will  they go to other projects on the Cap itol grounds?  ",1987

1019,1130,13,Mr. ATKINS.," Mr. Speaker,  it's my privilege  today to give some well-deserved recognition  to Arthur F. Martins, who recently retired from  the Framingham, MA, Police Department after  serving as  its chief for over 25 years. Chief  Martins has been a public servant in the best  sense of that phrase, and leaves his commu nity with  a  lasting  legacy  of  competent,  modern police protection.  Chief Martins  is a Massachusetts native,  born  in 1922 and moving  to Framingham  in  1930. He attended public schools there, and  after serving in the U.S. Air Force from 1942  to  1945,  returned  to Massachusetts  and  joined  the State police. He  left  the State  police to return to Framingham in 1953, join ing that police force, as a patrolman. By 1961,  Martins had become the police chief-a posi tion he held until his retirement in April of this  year.  How can you measure a police chief's ac complishments? You can look at the detective  bureau that was created, the juvenile bureau,  the fingerprint technology, the continuing inter est in the newest techniques and training for  the  force. You can  look at  the exemplary  record of the police force in Framingham. But  finally, you can recognize that every resident  of the  town rested  just a little bit easier at  night because of Chief Martins.  On  Tuesday,  June  30,  Chief Martins'  friends, admirers, and supporters will pay trib ute to him at a dinner. There will be hundreds  of people  there,  to honor  this extraordinary  man and his wife, Bridget. But the real monu ment  to  his work-to a  life dedicated  to  making his town a safer place to live-are the  streets of Framingham, and every patrolman  who carries with him  the  lessons  in public  service  this man  taught  them. They are all  living  testimony to his accomplishments and  his contributions.  I'm proud  to have this op portunity to bring his exemplary record to the  attention of my colleagues.

IKE SKELTON  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 29, 1987  ",1987
1021,1130,13,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, Monday, on  the historic Summerall Field at Fort Myer, VA,  the stewardship of  the U.S. Army changed  hands. With Secretary of the Army John 0.  Marsh, Jr., presiding, Gen. John A. Wickham,  Jr.,  retired as Chief of Staff and Gen. Carl  Vuono became the new steward of the Army.  The ceremony was a fitting one, paying trib ute to General Wickham and his wife Ann.  In  the new Chief of Staff, our Nation has a man  of great ability and vision.  I know  that all  Members join me in wishing General and Mrs.  Wickham well in the days ahead, and I know  that this body joins me in extending congratu lations and good wishes  to General Vuono  and his wife Pat.  The remarks of the principals are set forth  hereafter:  REMARKS OF SECRETARY OF THE ARMY MARSH  Today the Army changes command. An  exemplary officer with extraordinary ability  steps down.  General Wickham will be succeeded by a  new Chief, also a soldier of talent and dedi cation.  General Wickham, we bid you and each  member of your family a farewell filled with  pride and thanks. Our country is in your  debt.  General Vuono, to you and Pat and your  children we extend good wishes and the sup port of this great Army.  General Wickham, for 37 years you have  dedicated your talents, your intellect to the  service of your country and the Army.  Your personal courage has been demon strated on the battlefield. Your ribbons are  symbols of bravery and suffering.  You shall leave legacies of doctrine, weap ons systems and force structure but your  greatest legacy shall be the stamp of your  character upon the Army. Your character  has been reflected in the quality of your  leadership, and the quality of your leader ship was  reflected  in  the quality of  the  Army and the experience of each soldier.  It has impacted on the way they perform  their duty. Their pursuit of excellence, their  sense of service to our country, and their  goals for the future.  In the ranks of the Army are soldiers who  some day shall lead this Army. Some shall  be  the Army's Sergeants, and Sergeants  Major. Officers who shall be brigade and di vision commanders and some who one day  shall wear the stars of the Chief of Staff.  June 29, 1987  Others shall leave the Army for civilian  pursuits but because of their Army experi ence they leave with pride and purpose. Be cause of your  leadership  they shall  take  with them a set of values that shall enrich  their  lives as craftsmen,  teachers, physi cians, public officials. They are the leaders  of the next century.  Their future service to the Nation, Gener al Wickham, shall be your greatest legacy.  Thank you for your service to our Coun try.  ADDRESS OF GENERAL WICKHAM  Secretary and Mrs. Marsh, General and  Mrs. Vuono, civilian aides to the Secretary  of the Army, distinguished guests, and sol diers of the total Army here today:  There is much symbolism  today in this  ceremony and the soldiers arrayed before  us. The total Army is represented in the for mation. The National Guard and the Army  Reserve, and many Army civilians are in our  midst. Such as Joe Cribbins; we see the role  of the NCO Corps as signified by the com mand sergeant major and  the other fine  NCOs standing before us; and, we see the  continuity of leadership and the role of ci vilian authority in our great country as sig nified by the passing of the colors from me  to Secretary Marsh to General Vuono. We  are truly blessed.  After 41 years in the Army, the time has  come  to hang up my uniform and retire  from active duty. For my beloved wife, Ann,  and me, this is a day of emotions. But also  one of thankfulness for our many blessings.  Truly our cup runneth over.  Secretary Marsh, thank you for your gen erous remarks  today and particularly for  the vibrant leadership you have blessed the  Army with over the past six years. You and  I have travelled a long way since 1973 when  we first served in the Office of the Secre tary of Defense. You are the longest serving  Secretary in the Army's history and, in my  view, are the greatest. Thank you, my very  good friend,  for your unwavering support  and the opportunity to serve at your side.  Thanks also to Jim Ambrose, the Under  Secretary of the Army, Max Thurman, the  Vice Chief of Staff, and Art Brown, the Di rector of the Army staff. They, and  the  entire Army staff, have been superb.  General Vuono, over the many years we  have known each other, you have had my  full  trust and been a source of seasoned  advice. The Army is blessed to have a man  of your character. Breadth of experience,  and capacity for positive leadership. With  Pat at your side, the total Army family will  be led by a very special first family. I am  proud to tum over the Army flag to a man  with the vision necessary to ready the Army  for the next century.  I am thankful for the lifelong support and  love of my best friend, my wife, Ann, and  for  the support of my children. Lindsey,  now married  to  Infantry Captain Bill  Hamer and mother of our first grandson;  my oldest son, John, now in law school; and,  our youngest son, Matthew, who  is a hy drologist with the State of Arizona. Without  their encouragement and love, my service  really would not have been possible, particu larly  after  being wounded  in  Vietnam.  Thanks also to friends and family who have  come long distances for this occasion.  My  family's gift to me continues  to be  their willingness to let me serve. My wife's  gift to the Army has been her commitment  to strengthen  the values and support of  ",1987
1022,1156,13,Mr. DOLE.," In any event, whether  the majority leader sought to bring it  back or not, it would have to be dis posed of before final disposition of the  bill?  ",1987

1024,1156,13,Mr.  BYRD.,"  Therefore,  Senate  amendment No. 350, not having been  disposed of, still has to be disposed of  one way or another before the Senate  passes the bill.  ",1987
1025,1156,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator is correct.  ,1987
1026,1156,13,Mr. CONRAD.," Will  the majority  leader yield for a question?  The majority leader indicated that  on the matter of the supplemental ap propriations there will possibly be a  delay until next week. Is it still the in tention of the majority leader that we  do everything possible to get the sup plemental passed before we leave here  for the Independence Day break, given  the extreme urgency of the need for  the payments to begin flowing since  CCC has been out of money  from  before May 1?  ",1987
1027,1156,13,Mr. BYRD.," I would hope that would  be the case and I would also hope we  could get a  time agreement on that  supplemental  appropriations  confer ence report. Right now my interest is  in getting on with this trade bill, not  letting anything interfere with the de liberations on it. I will endeavor to get  a time agreement on the supplemental  appropriations  conference  report,  before the Senate goes out.  ",1987
1028,1156,13,Mr. DANFORTH., Will the majority  leader yield for a question?  ,1987
1029,1156,13,Mr. BYRD., I am happy to yield.  ,1987
1030,1156,13,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. Leader, I first  want to state my appreciation for your  efforts over a  long period of time to  try to bring this bill to the floor and  try to get it disposed of. I appreciate  the difficulties that the Senate faces  now.  There are a number of major issues  that we have not touched yet and the  bill has been on the floor since  last  Thursday-issues such as plant clos ings, section 201, trade reorganization,  the oil issue, and there may be some  more.  I wonder  if  the  time  is  ap proaching when we could seek  time  agreements on all or some of  those  components?  I think the sooner we get to work on  some of these major issues, the better  the  likelihood  that  the  ice would  break and, somehow, we would be able  to cruise through the situation. So my  inquiry of the majority leader is, could  there be some effort to arrange time  agreements on  these, at  least  these  five major  issues,  and maybe  some  others?  ",1987
1031,1156,13,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, the Sena tor from Missouri makes a very good  suggestion. I shall do everything I pos sibly can to see, working through the  staff and other Senators and working  through the managers, if we can reach  some  time agreements in relation to  these major questions. As both manag ers indicated today, if we can get on to  these major questions, some of  the  smaller staff perhaps will not even be  called up. So let me assure the Senator  it is a good suggestion.  I hope that the leadership on both  sides,  the  distinguished Republican  leader and the managers on both sides,  could all work  together and  try  to  reach some time agreements on these  major pieces of legislation.  ",1987
1032,1156,13,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President, would  the majority leader yield on that?  ",1987
1033,1156,13,Mr. BYRD., Yes.  ,1987
1034,1156,13,Mr. QUAYLE.," I have an amendment  I shall offer to strike the provisions  dealing with mandatory plant closing  authorization.  I  had  the  intention,  after talking to some of the members  of  the committee,  to offer this last  Friday. At the request of some Sena tors, they asked if I would off er it this  week, so I said, OK, I would not offer  it last Friday but I intended to offer it  this week. This week is now here and,  in view of the exchange between the  majority leader and the Senator from  Missouri,  I am prepared to move  to  strike that provision, strike it all out.  It is not in the House bill, it is obvious ly veto bait and should not be in the  bill.  I am willing  to agree  to a 4-hour  time  agreement. That  is  cutting  it  down on this side. I have asked Sena tors on this side to cut it down because  a  lot of people want to speak. I am  willing to agree to 4 hours equally di vided, then vote on the Hatch-Quayle  motion to strike.  I wonder if we might start the proc ess  to  get  that  unanimous-consent  agreement and begin to move on one  of the real major stumbling blocks in  this trade bill. I think the sooner we  go on one of these very sticky issues and there is a major disagreement on  this one-we would be better off.  I say I am ready to go; if the majori ty leader can help us to facilitate the  coordination  of  this,  hopefully, we  could get it up in the next hour and be  ready  to vote on  it  this evening.  I  think one of the best ways to deal with  this kind of situation is have a unani mous-consent  agreement.  I  am pre pared  to work,  I believe some of us  have worked on this side and I would  ask the majority leader to help us get  that up and facilitate that this after noon if that would be appropriate.  ",1987
1035,1156,13,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I would  like to see that done. That is the way I  would like to see us proceed. The Sen ator can proceed anytime he wishes, of  course, with his amendment. That is  his right. That may be one way to get  things moving. Whether we can get a  4-hour time agreement on that today,  I do not know. I certainly have no ob jection to it. But once we get on an  amendment, sometimes it moves and  sometimes a  time agreement can be  gotten on it after a while.  If we do get a time agreement, that  would at least be progress.  The Senator is correct;  I shall at tempt  to do whatever I can.  I have  heard some rumorings that we might  not be able to get a  time agreement  and a vote on that today over here.  ",1987
1036,1156,13,Mr. QUAYLE.," If we cannot vote on  it today, maybe we can vote on it-I  intend to have a vote this week. I put  it off last week at the request of some  Senators. I was told too many people  would be off last week and they said  no, so I said it is going to be this week.  Everybody knows the merits and de merits of this issue. I would say once  we go, we have to go ahead. The chair man and the ranking member have in dicated to me that they have no oppo sition to my moving ahead. I just want  to inform the majority leader that we  are prepared to go.  The majority  leader  is  right, we  could in fact go ahead and move to  strike some of the language in there.  Senator METZENBAUM has indicated he  would want to modify that. I have no  problem with this. He has the right to  modify  it  anyway. Once we move  ahead,  I  could move  to strike  that  modification because I do not think  that would change  the substance of  the  debate. Either  the mandatory  plant closing authorization language is  going to be in the bill or it is not. It is  not a difficult one to wrestle with, but  it is one that is going to take a long  time.  It  is also one of  those sticky  wickets that is attached to this bill.  I thank the majority leader for his  willingness to help me out. I will make  some calls on this and see if we cannot  proceed. Maybe we cannot get a time  agreement, but it is my felling  that  once we are on it, once we get into  debate, maybe the majority leader and  others can work  into some sort of  agreement to vote on this.  ",1987
1037,1156,13,Mr. BYRD.," It often works out that  way. The Senator certainly has  the  right to proceed any time he wants on  his amendment. We cannot allow our selves to fall into a situation where, as  happened last week, we cannot call up  an amendment because somebody  is  absent and we are asked to wait until  he is here. Now we come to a new day  and a new week. Now I hope we do not  meet with the same argument that we  do not want to call it up this week be cause so and so is absent. If we wait, as  I say, until all 100 Senators are here,  the snow may be  flying before  the  Senator ever gets his amendment up.  One thing he does control is his own  decision as to when he wants to call  his amendment up. Sometimes, when  one calls an amendment up,  things  begin to come together.  There are other important amend ments. I understand the Senator from  ",1987

1041,1169,13,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I  rise  today in regard to the incident involv ing Japan's Toshiba Machine Co. and  Norway's Kongsberg Co. Everyone has  heard a great deal of rhetoric regard ing both fair trade and free trade and  how our Nation is to find the proper  combination of  the  two. The recent  disclosures concerning the sale of sen sitive  propeller  technology  to  the  Soviet Union  by  the Toshiba  and  Kongsberg companies add a new di mension to this debate.  To many Americans this situation is  only the latest slap in the face with  regard to foreign trade abuses. Toshi ba Machine and Kongsberg apparently  acted independently from their respec tive  governments. Yet,  Japan  and  Norway can not sidestep allied govern ments  in  enforcing  existing  trade  agreements and regulations.  Several steps should be taken to cor rect this situation and prevent it from  recurring. First, we must demand ret ribution from Toshiba and Kongsberg  for the illegal diversion. Such action is  desperately  needed  if  the United  States expects  to have  its  rhetoric  taken  seriously.  Second,  we must  ensure that the existing Cocom rules  are strictly and vigorously enforced by  other nations and if the rules are inef fective, we must change  them. Our  trading partners  should know  that  they must enforce  these agreements  or face stiff consequences.  While Norway and Japan have initi ated strong measures  in this matter,  one wonders if ultimately, outside of  the official apologies and embarrass ment, there will be little in the way of  more  strict enforcement policies.  this is the case, then the United States  must be prepared to enact harsh meas ures. The United States can no longer  subsidize and provide for the defense  of nations who are willing  to allow  their industries to compromise it for  profit. Certainly this incident was pre ventable. Had Norwegian or Japanese  officials enforced Cocom  regulations  as vigorously as the United States has,  then this incident would have never  If  occurred.  The  necessary  actions  should be taken to impress upon other  Cocom countries and foreign  traders  that the penalties for such behavior in  the future will far outweigh the prof its.  Cocom, the Coordinating Committee  on Multilateral Export Controls, is the  international  coordinating  agency  charged with  seeing  that  sensitive  technology export controls are abided  by. The United States has traditional ly been a far more aggressive enforcer  of  these controls than other Cocom  members. This has been particularly  true during  the Reagan administra tion.  In fact, United States controls  have been so effective that the Soviets  have been forced to forego their pref erence  of  acquiring United States made high-technology defense  tech nology. As a result, the Soviets have  turned to buying defense  technology  from  other Western  nations  that  either  loosely  enforce  or  virtually  ignore Cocom  regulations,  including  Norway and Japan.  It is difficult,  if not impossible, to  believe that Japanese authorities were  not aware  that Japanese firms were  selling  sensitive  technology  to  the  Soviet Union. In fact, Japanese offi cials were warned by Secretary of De fense Weinberger as  early as April  1982 that the diversion of technology  covered by Cocom had to cease. Obvi ously the Japanese did not heed his  warning.  My amendment would prohibit the  importation of any product which is  manufactured by the Toshiba Corp.,  or by any of its direct affiliates or sub sidiaries,  including  the Toshiba Ma chine Co., Inc. and Kongsberg Vaapen fabrik. It would, however, not apply to  any product imported pursuant to a  contract  executed  before April  30,  1987.  My amendment would also prohibit  the Secretary of Defense from enter ing into a contract or subcontract with  the Toshiba Machine Co. and its affili ates  and  subsidiaries or Kongsberg  Vaapenfabrik.  The extent and seriousness of these  violations are evident to everyone.  AUCTION OF MILITARY TECHNOLOGY  As Senators are aware, we previously  enjoyed a critical advantage  in that  our  submarines were  quieter  than  those deployed by  the Soviets. This  vital  edge  has  been  sacrificed  for  profit by a Japanese company, Toshi ba Machine Co., and by a state formed  Norwegian  firm, Kongsberg Vaapen fabrik.  How serious is this damage? We have  lost  a  deterrent  against  a  possible  Soviet  submarine-launched  nuclear  attack.  Previously, we  could detect  Soviet  submarine movement  from  many miles away. The threat of super quiet Soviet subs that can cruise any",1987

1044,1182,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Alabama.  ,1987
1045,1182,13,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President; I rise  to oppose the amendment offered by  the Senator. from Utah, and I do this  because I believe that the amendment  is not strong enough. I  thought sin cerely  that the amendment which I  initially offered to the trade bill was  strong. It did do the thing that some  of us want to do, and that is to send a  message that means something to To shiba and to Kongsberg and tell them  by doing this, that we are not going to  import your products  in the United  States. I think that is the right ex;:i.m ple.  It was said by  the senior Senator  from Arkansas earlier that there are  people in jail in the United States who  have done a lot less damage to them selves, to their commJ}nity, and to this  country than To'shiba and Kongsberg  did by a large degree. What have they  done? I. do not . .want to take the time  of the Senate to go  into detail, but  they have fraudulently sold some of  the highest, most  important subma rine  technology  to  the Soviet Union  knowing what they did. And why did  they do  it? To make money. That is  why they did it-not one time but, as I  was saying earlier,  in five contracts.  And they did it all in a surreptitious  manner. They tried to hide it, but it  came out. And what better way  is  there to send a message topeople, not  just Toshiba,. not just Kongsberg, but  anybody else  trading with the West  that is going to continue to sell our  high technology in the same fraudu lent way,  to undermine our national  security?  I mentioned earlier what the Walker  family did-the spy  ring. You know  this. They did irreparable damage to  the United States. The Soviet Union  learned a  lot by  the spy  ring,  the  Walker family. They learned, as I said  earlier,  that  theii submarines made  too. much noise,  that they could be  easily detected. So  they went .about  looking all over the world to buy tech nology  to produce quiet submarines,  and they found it .. .They found willing  partners in Kc;mgsberg, the .Norwegian  company, and Toshiba, arid they tried  to hide this. The Senator from Utah  has detailed this,  too. They tried to  hide  it, but you can only hide it so  long.  What better way is there to send a  message? Is it going to be by the way  offered in my amendment, that is, to  ban Kongsberg  and Toshiba  from  doing business in this country, other  than to service what they have and for  contracts that have been entered into?  I say yes. That is the things to do be cause they have done this country and  the American taxpayer, those who pay  the defense bills, billions of dollars  worth of damage, not counting what  else could happen.  I want to address some of my re marks  to the amendment offered by  the Senator from Utah.  In this amendment-and I hope that  I do have the basic copy. It is what  was furnished to us by staff earlier the Senator talks about sanctions-not  banning  them,  sanctions of 2  to 5  years. Let m.e share with you what the  Senator says in his amendment-not  mine, not the amendment of the Sena tor from Alabama but the amendment  of  the Senator from Utah.  It says,  ""Mandatory sanctions."" The President  shall impose the sanctions . . . for a  period not less than 2 years and not to  exceed 5 years, and shall notify  the  Congress of such action in any case  where,"" and so forth, ""enforcement ac tions by foreign  authorities,  intelli gence information,"" and so forth.  Five years, 2 to. 5 years it says, man datory sanctions. But does  this also  give the President under section 4(5)  the authority to waive these mandato ry sanctions? I do not know why we  should give discretion to the President  to waive something. You remember re cently when the President said he was  going to impose sanctions on the J apa nese; because of .unfair trade practices.  How  long did  they  last? Not  long.  Were they real substantial? Did they  have. real substance? I submit to you,  no. And then some of the sanctions  were lifted in Venice recently.  I  say  it ought  to be . the United  States  that  sends  the message.  ought  to be the Senate, because we  know it will be carried out if it is in  the law.  .  I believe the amendment offered by  the Senator from Utah to my amend ment gives too much discretion to 'the  President. He has the authority, as I  read it, to waive mandatory sanctions  under section 4(5), and, Jn application  would  only  discretionary  sanctions  come into existence, and if they are  discretionary sanctions  I do not be lieve  they would  last  long and  they .  would have much effect.  But my amendment woiild have a lot  of effect. Should only the President be  allowed  to  impose sanctions? I  leave  that up to you, but I say no. Is the  sanction period of 2 to 5 years long  enough for the deed of Toshiba and  the  .damage . that  has  been  done?  It  Should we be concerned, first of all,  for the security of this country and  the people who do it or should we be  worried about the Toshiba dealers?  I am sure they are all good business  people and work hard in the country,  in my home State and everywhere  else.  I say that we have to put our coun try first. We should not worry about  whether Toshiba does business in this  country, ever. I think they ought to be  banned.  I also believe that section 3 of the  amendment  offered  by  the  distin guished Senator from Utah appears to  be deluding. The coordination between  sections 3 and 4, I believe, is lacking,  as  two different  trigger mechanisms  are present.  I ask the question:  Is ""substantial  enhancement"" the same as ""to serious ly affect the strategic balance""? Two  different phrases, probably two differ ent meanings.  Does section 3.2 here require debar ment and prohibition of imports? I do  not know this.  I raise these questions because the  amendment  I offered,  to which  the  Senator  from Utah has off erect  an  amendment,  is loud and clear and is  unmistakable as to what it would do. I  believe that the amendment should be  adopted at the proper time.  ",1987

The dif ~  ference  is primarily in  two areas, as  the Senator from Alabama has point ed out, in time.  As much as emotionally I would like  to say  let us ban forever or perma nently, that is a long, long time. I sug gest  that  that would probably put  both companies out of business, and  they  could  reform  themselves  into  companies and start doing  the same  thing over again, because we are spe cifically. naming only those companies.  I also repeat that, although I am not  an attorney, let alone a constitutional  attorney,  there are some who claim  that 'retr'oactive bans are unconstitu tional.  If that were  the  case,  the  amendment of the Senator from Ala bama would be null and. void, and we  would have no controls and no penal ties whatsoever,  That is why my cosponsors and I put  in the section that names Kongsberg  an,d Toshiba separately.

1100,1208,13,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to congratulate Allen I. Bildner,  chairman and chief executive officer  of Kings Super Markets, Inc., in West  Caldwell, NJ, who was recently elected  chairman of the Board of Directors of  the Food Marketing Institute [FMI].  FMI is a nonprofit association which  conducts programs in research, educa tion, and public affairs on behalf of its  1,500 members, which include food re tailers and wholesalers and their cus tomers  in  the United  States  and  abroad. The FMI elected Mr. Bildner  during its 50th annual convention in  May.  Mr. Bildner's very successful career  with Kings Super Markets, a  family owned business  for 50 years, makes  him an excellent choice as the FMI  chairman. At  the  age  of  10, Mr.  Bildner started working in the family  business started by his father, Joseph,  in 1936. There are now 15 stores in op eration in northern New Jersey-all of  them known for their excellent serv ice, innovation, high quality, and com mitment  to  the customers. Kings  is  also particularly well known for its ef forts  to use New Jersey grown prod ucts  in all of  its stores. And  for 2  weeks each summer, the parking lots  of many of its stores are turned into a  farmers market, called ""Jersey Fresh,""  which  features  locally grown  fruits  and vegetables.  During  his  career, Mr.  Bildner  served 3 years on the Board of Direc tors of  the Super Market  Institute  [SMil and has served on the board of  the FMI since 1976. He is a founding  director,  past  president,  and  past  chairman of  the New  Jersey Food  Council and  its committee  for good  government. In 1986, Mr. Bildner re ceived  the  first  annual  Fieldmark  Award  sponsored  by  Supermarket  Business for his contributions to the  food industry.  To Mr. Bildner, the most important  aspect  of  business  is  caring  about  people-employees, suppliers, and cus tomers-and this philosophy has been  the path to Kings' success.  I ask my colleagues  to  join me  in  congratulating Mr. Bildner  and  in  wishing him every success as he begins  his new chairmanship at the FMI. I  am sure that he will serve its members  well.  A TRIBUTE TO GEORGE PAGE  ",1987
1101,1208,13,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to off er my congratulations to  George Benson Page  of California,  who will be feted on July 8, 1987, by  the Western Textile Service Associa tion. George is 84 years young and still  an active member of the linen rental  industry.  George's life could be used as an ex ample  of  the  ""American  success  story."" At 18, George rode  the rails  from Tennessee  to Los Angeles and  began work in a laundry plant. Within  9 years he bought his own  laundry  plant  in Santa Barbara, and began  building his company's success based  on  restaurants  increasing needs  for  linen. From  this  inauspicious begin ning in 1920, George has created Mission Linen Supply, a  company  that  employs  over  3,300  people,  services  100,000 customers in the Southwestern  part of the country, and annually gen erates $150 million.  George's success does not rest solely  on Mission Linen Supply. In 1972, he  created a ranch for problem children.  Since its inception, the ranch has de veloped a noteworthy track record of  educating and assisting those children  who might otherwise become part of  the juvenille justice system.  The traits which are commonly ap plied to our entrepreneurs of today innovation, dedication, hard work and  vision could appropriately be used to  describe George Page's life. He has  strived  for, worked  for  and accom plished many  things  that have con tributed so much. George Page is truly  an important asset to any community.  And so I  join with the members of  the Western Textile Service Associa tion in honoring George Page on July  8,  1987.  Congratulations  and  best  wishes for many more years of com munity service.  ARTHUR F. BURNS  ",1987
1102,1208,13,Mr. ST AFFORD.," Mr. President,  I  rise to join my colleagues to note, with  sadness, the passing of Arthur Burns  and to express my condolences to his  wife, Helen, and to their family.  Our Nation has  lost an extraordi nary public servant who served  this  country  from  the administration of  President Eisenhower to the adminis tration of President Reagan, as Chair man of  the Federal Reserve Board,  Ambassador  to West Germany and  counsel to the President.  While all Americans who knew him  mourn his death, we Vermonters feel a  singular loss since he lived among us  in West Fairlee, VT, and came to be  accepted as a Vermonter as much as  anyone not born in our State can be so  honored.  Arthur Burns  had  the Vermont  characteristics of directness,  candor  and integrity. He provided leadership  by performance-when Arthur Burns  was Chairman of the Fed, the Chair man cast the first vote on issues, not  the last one.  No one had to guess where Arthur  Burns stood on issues-all you had to  do was to ask him and then to listen to  his clear words, whether he was Chair man of the Fed, counsel to a President  or Ambassador to West Germany.  We all shall miss Arthur Burns for  his dedication and wisdom as a distin guished public servant. His friends and  neighbors  in West Fairlee shall miss  him as one of their own.  ",1987
1103,1260,13,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, much  has been said recently about Senator  PACKWOOD'S proposed amendment  to  the trade bill. Its supporters hail it as  the replacement of the ""national eco nomic interest"" into S. 1420.  I would like to take this opportunity  to explain while that seems a laudable  goal,  the Packwood amendment  is a  flawed provision.  First,  to put  this debate  into  the  proper perspective, we  should  look  back to the legislative history behind  the ""escape clause"" in American trade  law.  This  passage  is  taken  from  the  House Ways and Means Committee's  Overview and Compilation of Trade  Statutes:  ""From  the outset of  the  trade  agreements program  in  1934,  U.S. policy of seeking liberalization of  trade barriers has been accompanied  by the recognition that difficult eco nomic  adjustment  problems  could  result  for particular  sectors of  the  economy and that the possibility of se rious injury to domestic industries by  increased  import competition should  be minimized.""  The original intention of this provi sion is crystal clear: The escape clause  is central to our national policy of free  trade, not an antithesis to it. In order  to preserve the gains made over the  last 50 years of open markets, we must  preserve and strengthen the function  of our ""escape clause.""  Second, we must cut  through  the  rhetoric and look at the specific lan guage  in the Packwood amendment.  This amendment would delete 2<B> of  section 204 of S. 490 as reported out of  committee, and replace it with this:  ""(2) not be in the national economic  interest of the U.S.,  taking  into ac count such factors as:  ""(A) the effect on any domestic in dustry that consumes a product of the  petitioner;  ""(B) the effect on consumers in gen eral;  ""<C>  the effect of potential retalia tion on U.S. agricultural and other exports.""    The Senator's amendment goes on to  describe certain nontariff, nonquota  measures the President would be re quired  to  impose  if he did  indeed  refuse such relief.  The portion of this amendment that  gives me the most trouble is 2(B)-the  effect of import relief on ""consumers  in general.""  I believe that our trade policy oper ates on  two virtually undeniable as sumptions: <a>  that import relief for  an industry will tend to preserve that  industry and the workers therein, and  (b) the U.S. consumer has to pay for  such import relief, usually in the form  of higher prices for the domestically produced  goods. These  propositions  are inseparable.  My difficulty with Senator PAcK wooD's amendment  is  that  it  looks  only to cost implicit in the second as sumption and not to the benefits of  the first. The President is specifically  directed to look in one direction, that  is, the consumers' interest. The other  side of  the argument  is  left unexa mined.  The Packwood amendment does not  admit the following: it is in the nation al economic interest to keep American  workers working and not on the unem ployment rolls.  It also does not recognize that sec tion 201  is the exception to our trade  policy, not the rule. As it stands, the  U.S. market is  the most open in the  world, and was explicitly designed that  way. Our trade policy was developed,  however, with  the  sage  realization  that certain important U.S. industries  would be  injured. F'airness dictates  that these industries should not carry  the full burden of an open economy.  As I indicated in my statement last  Thursday, bringing a case before the  ITC is not a simple matter. The Cast  Metals Foundation spent $300,000  to  plead their case and though their case  was strong, they were denied relief denied not by  the President, but by  the ITC. We must realize that the ITC  does not hand out affirmative deci sions  like party  favors-half of  all  cases are denied.  I am not in favor of overly restrict ing  the President's ability  to shape  trade policy. The language in S. 1420  still  allows  the President  sufficient  leeway in deciding these cases to take  into  account  those  factors which  should  truly  indicate  to  him  that  import  relief, while  justified, would  not be the correct course of action.  The Packwood amendment claims to  have the monopoly on the ""national  economic  interest."" To the contrary,  based on the fundamental principles  behind our trade policy,  the United  States would be better served by a  stronger section 201.  ALLENS RECEIVE PRESIDENT'S  AWARD  ",1987
1104,1260,13,Mr. HECHT.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to recognize and announce the  outstanding accomplishments  in vol unteer wildlife  conservation of  two  outstanding Nevadans, Wilford  and  Penny Allen. Because of  its accom plishments, their group, the Fraterni ty of the Desert Bighorn, will be re cipients of the prestigous President's  Volunteer Action Award.  This award was established in 1982  and this is the first time that citizens  of the State of Nevada have been its  recipients. The award is given to lead ing volunteer groups which are dedi cated to excellence and public service.  The Allens have been instrumental  in guiding  the  fraternity's construc tion of 21 water supplies for desert  bighorn  sheep. The desert bighorn  sheep is a majestic animal and highly  prized by sportsmen. The fraternity  has raised over 50,000 dollars' worth of  labor, materials and cash donations  which were  used  in  four Nevada  Bureau of Land Management districts.  As a result of their efforts, Nevada is  one of the few Western States with a  thriving desert bighorn population.  It is with great pride  that I con gratulate the Allens for their accom plishments, and their contributions to  Nevada, our Nation, and wildlife con servation. They truly embody the dili gence and desire that this award was  established to recognize.   POLISH AMERICAN HERITAGE  MONTH   ",1987

I intro duced this important resolution with  my good friends and colleagues, Sena tor ALAN DIXON and Senator DONALD  RIEGLE, and with their help and sup port  the many  accomplishments of  Polish Americans are recognized again  this year.  This is the third year I have intro duced  Polish  American  Heritage  Month-the 3 years I have served in  the Senate-and I am proud that it  has passed easily each year. Polish  Americans have distinguished  them selves  in education, government, the  arts and humanities, science, military  service,  and  athletic  competition.  ",1987

1108,1312,13,Mr. DELAY.," We have not evaluated  this situation, Mr. Speaker. This has  been  an  emotional  issue  that our  hearts go out to those who are home less, but  there  is no evidence  that  there is a huge amount of homeless  out there or that we are in a crisis sit uation.  We should be asking questions, like  is this the best way to approach this  problem? Is building more shelters the  best way to approach this problem? Is  national right to shelter the kind of  approach that makes the best sense?  Given the vast number of programs  already  serving  the  homeless  and  giving them at best sketchy evidence  offered by the homeless  lobby, why  should  taxpayers believe  there  is a  homeless crisis?  Evaluate this, I say to the Members.  There is $355 million for seed money.  There is no telling what this program  could cost in the outyears.  ",1987

1110,1312,13,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise to request a colloquy with the dis tinguished subcommittee chairman of  Transportation,  the gentleman  from  Florida [Mr. LEHMAN].  I first want to thank the gentleman  from Florida  [Mr. LEHMAN]  for ad dressing  the  issue  dealing with  56  flight service stations throughout the  country that are going to be closed,  and specifically some technical details  relative to a court case that was held  in one matter, specifically the Youngs town Municipal Airport Flight Service  Station. They had gone to trial there  in the late seventies.  Now,  I notice there has been some  conference language placed in the bill.  The original amendment passed on  the floor has been removed; however, I  would like to ask a  few questions of  the gentleman if I could belabor him  for some time here.  Is it the gentleman's interpretation  of  the  language  in  the  conference  report  that  the Youngstown Flight  Service  Station  cannot  be  closed  unless additional action  is  taken by  Congress authorizing its closure?  ",1987

1112,1312,13,Mr. TRAFICANT.,"  In  addition  to  that, Mr. Speaker,  is it  the gentle man's  interpretation  that Congress  has to this point not taken the action  necessary to close down the Youngs town facility?  ",1987
1113,1312,13,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," Mr. Speak er, if the gentleman will yield further,  that is also my understanding.  ",1987
1114,1312,13,Mr. TRAFICANT.," There are many  Members  throughout  this Chamber  who  are very  concerned about  the  overall and overriding issue of the 56  flight  service  stations, Mr. Speaker.  Would it be in order to ask the gentle man  if  it  is possible he might hold  hearings on this matter in the near  future relative to future bills that are  coming up to address the safety con cerns of those 56 flight service stations  being closed?  ",1987
1115,1312,13,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," It is cer tainly possible that we might do so,  but I think that would be more in the  jurisdiction of the Public Work Com mittee,  on  which  the  gentleman  serves, and especially the Subcommit tee on Aviation, headed by the distin guished  gentleman  from California  [Mr. MINETA].  ",1987
1116,1312,13,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Well, Mr. Speak er, I just want to close and say that I  want to thank the gentleman for being  accommodating and looking into this  matter very carefully, as the gentle man has, and  reviewing  that court  case.  I know the staff does an awful lot of  that, but I know the gentleman from  Florida personally did quite a bit him self. I thank the gentleman very much  and I  thank the distinguished chair man of the overall committee for af fording me this opportunity.  ",1987
1117,1312,13,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2112  minutes to the gentleman from Mis souri [Mr. COLEMAN].  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Massachusetts for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that mem bers of the House and Senate confer ence committee have put to rest the  political shenanigans that tied a knot  in a lifeline of payments to hundreds  of thousands of farmers participating  in  the 1987 Federal farm assistance  programs.  When the Commodity Credit Corpo ration ran out of funds on May 1, Congress should have moved quickly  to  pass  an  emergency  supplemental  spending bill and provide an immedi ate  infusion of  funds  for  this and  other critical programs. Instead, some  Members seized the moment to turn  the supplemental spending bill into a  political show down on the SALT II  nuclear arms control treaty.  So while House and Senate confer ees have been debating arms control,  farmers have been forced to take out  loans and sink deeper into debt.  I have  received  literally dozens of  phone  calls  from Missouri  farmers  who have been waiting for months for  money that is owed to them by the  Federal Government.  The  Federal Government  signed  agreements and contracts with farm ers for cost sharing on the Conserva tion Reserve Program,  for example,  agreeing to pay 50 percent of the cost,  but now has failed to hold up its part  of the agreement. The dairy termina tion program payments have been put  in  limbo, as have payments  to  this  year's  spring wheat  crop  that  is  coming up. Farmers feel it is a breach  of faith, and I agree with them.  The Federal Government owes well  over $1 billion in past due farm pay ments and it is accruing at the rate of  $35 million in new debts everyday.  Consequently, many  farmers have  had to take out additional loans and  visit the bank to borrow more money  just to put seed in the ground that  they originally were told was going to  be half paid for by the Federal Gov ernment. They  thought  they were  taking out short-term loans, but they  have  turned  into  longer and  longer  term loans, as these moneys cannot be  released from the CCC, and they are  now saddled with additional debt and  interest payments.  This is wrong, and I am pleased that  the House and Senate conferees have  stripped the supplemental bill of all  controversial nonspending provisions.  I urge my colleagues in the House to  vote in favor of this bill so the Govern ment can settle its debt with America's  farmers.  ",1987

1119,1312,13,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding this time.  As always with supplemental appro priations when they come to the floor,  we tend to have a love-in out here with  regard to the bills, but I  think it is  worth noting, as was noted during the  time we debated the rule, that this is  in fact a bill with some major prob lems in it. For instance, with this bill,  five subcommittees of appropriations  go over the top with regard to their  302 allocations, so we now have a situ ation where despite all the assurances  we have had throughout the year that  we are going to live within the budget  ",1987

1159,1351,13,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speak er,  I want  to  try  to summarize  the  debate and put into perspective exact ly what we are talking about.  First of all,  there  is a procedural  reason,  if  no  other  reason,  to  be  against  the Hoyer  amendment,  be cause it is legislating permanent legis lation in a supplemental appropriation  bill. They had to waive  the rules of  the House in order to do that.  I would like to read the first clause  of the amendment. It says:  None of the funds appropriated or made  available by this Act or any other Act with  respect to any fiscal year shall be available  to administer or implement any drug testing  pursuant to Executive Order 12564.  So we are not doing something just  for a  short amount of  time.  If we  adopt the Hoyer amendment, we are  doing something forever. The Senate  version does not do that. The Senate  version is until May 1, 1989.  Let us get to some of the substantive  reasons that we should be against the  Hoyer amendment. First of all,  they  talk about uniformity. Well, uniformi ty is not necessarily a good thing, be cause each agency is different. Each  agency has different  sensitive posi tions. Each agency has different obli gations  to  fulfill. Under  the Senate  version, each agency will still have to  have a program  that meets all  the  technical and scientific requirements  of drug testing, but they will not have  to be uniform anemone, but they will  not have to be the same.  Second, let us talk about the issue of  sequencing. Under the Hoyer amend ment, every administrative test has to  be approved and in place before any of  them can be  implemented. That  is  kind of all or none. The gentleman  himself admits that is the case. There  is an excellent chance that because of  the procedural hurdles that you have  to go through in every agency that it  would take years and years and years  before they are all approved.  Under the Senate version you can  implement each program on a case-by case basis. They have to be certified by  HHS, they have to be certified by the  Office of Drug Policy  in  the White  House, but once  they are certified,  they can go into effect.  Third, let us talk about exemptions.  In  the Hoyer amendment we have  some exemptions. We also have some  exemptions  in  the Senate version.  I  am not an attorney, but according to  my conversations with the Justice De partment, there is a doctrine that is  called issue preclusion. Under the doc trine of  issue preclusion,  if any of  these plans are objected to and a judge  issues an injunction against one plan,  then that injunction can be used to  stop every plan, even the plans that  have already been implemented, even  the plans that are specifically exempt ed under the Hoyer amendment.  Fourth, let us talk about reliability.  In the Hoyer amendment there is a  great amount of space taken up that  certifies all  the reliability standards  that have to be met. That is all well  and good, but in the Senate version  and the Presidential Executive order  you also have  to meet the  technical  and scientific requirements that HHS  put out on February 13,  1987. The  American Civil Liberties Union them selves admitted  in  testimony before  the other body that the Senate ver sion and  the Presidential Executive  order meet the reliability test, so that  is  not  a  reason  to be  against  the  Senate version.  Finally, we  talk about the issue of  confidentiality. Under the Senate ver sion and under Presidential Executive  ",1987
1160,1364,13,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  urge that Members vote ""aye"" on the  conference agreement on H.R. 558, the  Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assist ance Act. Title VIII of this conference  agreement is under the jurisdiction of  the Committee on Agriculture. Title  VIII includes important nutrition as sistance to the homeless and families  in danger of becoming homeless.  Not only were we able to include all  of  the nutrition  provisions  in  the  House and Senate bills which will pre vent many  individuals  and  families  from becoming homeless, but we were  able to keep the cost of the conference  agreement $1 million below the House passed level for fiscal year 1988.  The shortage of affordable housing  for  low-income  individuals and fami lies  is a significant factor  in the in crease in the number of homeless in  recent years. Three homeless preven tion  provisions  in  the  conference  agreement provide  significant assist ance to defray the high cost of hous ing and also  to ensure that families  with high housing costs have access to  food stamp benefits.  First, to help defray some of the cost  of housing for low-income persons, the  conference  agreement  increases  the  shelter deduction  for  families with  high housing costs from $149 a month  to $164 a month.  Second, for poor people dependent  upon food stamp benefits to survive,  the current  law effectively prohibits  related families from  living together.  The  conference  agreement  corrects  this inequity.  Third,  the  House  accepted  the  Senate provision in conference to get  food  stamps  to homeless and near homeless  applicants, who meet  all  other requirements for  food  stamps,  within 5 calendar days instead of the  usual 30 calendar days after they first  apply.  Both the House and the Senate bills  institute Federal matching funds for  food stamp informational or outreach  activities to ensure that homeless per sons are aware they may be eligible for  benefits.  The conference agreement includes  the House provision to prevent food  stamp benefits of persons living in so called welfare hotels from being re duced  to  reflect a portion of  room  charges paid by welfare agencies on  their behalf. This  is  an emergency  measure  to correct a problem which  came to light in New York City but ap parently is occurring elsewhere in the  country.  One of the most effective ways to  ensure that homeless and other low income households receive prompt nu trition assistance  is  the Temporary  Emergency Food Assistance Program  [TEFAPJ. The administration sought  to shut 'off administrative funds this  winter for TEFAP through an illegal  diversion of appropriations to help fi nance Federal pay increases. The con ference agreement includes five provi sions related to TEFAP.  First, the authorization for TEFAP  is  extended  through September 30,  1988, to assist States with transporta tion and storage costs at the current  level of $50 million. TEF AP is estimat ed by the Department of Agriculture  to serve nearly 15 million Americans.  Extending this authorization is impor tant to reassure the low-income Ameri cans who depend on the surplus com modities distributed through TEFAP  that the food they depend upon will  not be snatched away from them.  Second,  the conference agreement  requires the distribution of additional  commodities  through TEFAP  if  re quested by the Governor of a State.  The conferees accepted the House pro vision for the distribution of up to 14  million  pounds  of  cheese  a  year  through TEFAP. Subject to appropria tions, the conference agreement man dates the distribution of this addition al cheese. In addition, the conference  agreement adopts the Senate provision  requiring the additional distribution of  flour and cornmeal  to States whose  Governors certify a need.  Third, the conference agreement in cludes a House requirement for Con gress to be notified each time that a  State Governor  requests  additional  commodities.  Fourth, the Department of Agricul ture will be required to distribute a va riety  of  commodities  and  products  which are most useful to the agencies  which distribute the food to the poor.  Fifth, the statement of managers on  the conference agreement includes the  language which I had included in the  House report on the nutrition provi sions of the bill to direct the U.S. De partment  of  Agriculture  to  carry  through on the statutory requirement  in the Temporary Emergency Act that  commodities be made available under  ",1987
1161,1377,13,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in support  of  the conference  report  for  the Stewart B.  McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. The con ferees have put a lot of hard work into this,  and I'd like to thank them for their efforts and  congratulate them on a job well done, espe cially the distinguished chairman and also the  ranking member, who has admirably and ca pably taken up the reins  left by our departed  colleague for whom this bill is named.  While they worked to set up this excellent,  coordinated approach to dealing with our Na tion's homeless,  the Appropriations Commit tee was also hard at work. As you know, the  supplemental appropriations we approved ear lier today contains $355 million for the various  programs  in  the Homeless Assistance Act.  Consider that money a downpayment on  the  structure we are building to house the home less. There  is $180 million  for  the programs  under  the  jurisdiction of  the Department of  Housing and Urban Development. There's $1 O  million for FEMA and $20 million for the Veter ans' Administration. We've got $46 million for  health care and $50.7 million  for substance  abuse and mental health. There is also $36.8  million  for community services block grants,  and $11.5 for education.  What  this runthrough of appropriations re veals is both the wide range of the problem  and the need for a unified approach to solving  it. The Homeless Act sets up the system for  coordinating the agencies and programs that  the appropriations money will  fund. With  this  act we are putting roofs over the heads of the  homeless. We  are  putting  food  into  the  mouths of the hungry. We are creating oppor tunities for those who have had  little,  if any,  chance for decent and healthy lives.  There  is a price we pay for not acting-a  price which far exceeds the amount of money  we consider  today.  It  is  the price of  lives  spent  in an endless struggle  to obtain basic  necessities, which we all, in our own comfort able lives, tend to take for granted. When life  is reduced to scavenging through trash cans,  or sleeping in cardboard boxes, or the humilia tion of begging  for  food,  then  life  is but a  shadow of what it should and could be. The  millions of dollars we're spending over the 2  years is not going to dispel all the shadows,  but it will shine the light where it hasn't been  seen for a long, long time.  If we in Congress refuse to help the home less, who will? State and local resources are  overburdened by  the extent of  the problem.  But we have  the capacity to ease  the prob lems facing  the homeless, and we have  the  responsibility. In this year of celebration of the  Constitution, I think we should all take a close  look at the preamble to that living document.  It  tells us  that  the Constitution was estab lished in order to form a more perfect Union,  and among other things, to promote the gen eral welfare. That is exactly what we are doing  with the Homeless Act. We are promoting the  general welfare and trying to make our Union  a little more perfect.  It can't be  that way while millions of poor  and homeless sleep on concrete each night. It  can't be that way while individuals who suffer  from mental or physical  illness spend  their  lives wandering the streets in search of some  human kindness. It can't be that way while the  unfortunate people in our Nation have no food  to eat and no hope of a job or education.  And  it can't be  that way without people of  vision and action. That is why we are naming  the act after Stewart McKinney.  During initial consideration in the House on  March 5, Stewart stood here in  the well and  asked us all what kind of America we wanted.  Our answer will be in our votes today. I know  he's watching now, so  let's be doubly sure  that we don't disappoint him. His legacy and  his work deserve our support.  ",1987
1162,1377,13,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I support this leg islation  (H.R. 558)  to provide much-needed  help to those individuals who, for a variety of  reasons, find themselves without a permanent  place of residence.  Now  that  the conference committee has  completed its work, we today have the oppor tunity to vote  in  favor of legislation that pro poses a comprehensive solution to the prob lems of the homeless in America.  This critical authorization bill is based on a  great deal of study not only of the causes of  homelessness, but also of the actions we can  take  to give these individuals and  their fami lies the tools they need to break this cycle of  pain and suffering.

On Tuesday, July 7, 1987, Jim will step down  from his tour of office.  Jim Santangelo has worked unselfishly  to  help  the community of Downey  through his  profound dedication to local government and  civic activities. A resident of Downey for over  22 years, Jim taught for 13 years at Downey  Adult School. He is a member of Our Lady of  Perpetual Health Catholic Church,  and  his  sense  for civic affairs  led him  to serve as  president of the Rotary Club of Downey,  the  Downey Board of Realtors,  the South Gate  Jaycees, and UNICO, an  Italian American or ganization.

Currently, Jim  is finishing his third year on  the city council and completing a year term as  mayor. During his term as mayor, Jim initiated  the Keep Downey Beautiful Project. This was  a campaign  to clean-up,  fix-up, and paint-up  Downey during the spring of 1987.  Mr. Speaker,  Jim Santangelo  has  done  much over  the years  in helping make  the  Downey area such a special place to live and  work. His commitment  to his community will  never go unnoticed. My wife, Lee, join8 me in  congratulating Jim on his achievements, and  we wish him, his wife, Rosell, his children,  James, Robert, and Lisa Hanggie, his grand child, Brianne, and his mother, Leona, suc cess and happiness in their future.  COMANDANTE REAGAN  HON. MATTHEW F. McHUGH  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 30, 1987  ",1987
1164,1403,13,Mr. MCHUGH.," Mr. Speaker, in recent weeks  a number of our colleagues have suggested  that those of us who oppose further aid to the  Nicaraguan Contras are advancing the cause  of communism in the Western Hemisphere.  This appeal  to anti-Communist sentiments  always has a populist ring, but it fails to ad dress the basic issues the United States faces  in Central America. We do have legitimate in terests in  that region,  interests that are con sistent with the promotion of democracy, eco nomic  reforms, and human  rights.  It  is also  true  that  the Sandinistas,  like  the Contras,  have violated  the basic human rights of  the  Nicaraguan people. The Sandinista govern ment is not a positive political model for Cen tral America. Yet, it is the Reagan administra tion's flawed policy toward Nicaragua that has  allowed  the Sandinistas  to consolidate  their  power and  to engage  in a variety of abuses  that all of us want to see ended.  18375  If we are serious about advancing U.S.  in terests in Central America and promoting re forms  that will serve our neighbors who  live  there, we need a policy that works, not an in effective one that may be politically appealing  to some at home but is substantially flawed.  This point was made forcefully in a recent  essay by Stephen Rosenfeld that appeared in  the Washington Post on June 26. For the ben efit of our colleagues who may not have seen  it,  I am  inserting a copy into the RECORD at  this point.  [From the Washington Post, June 26, 19871  COMANDANTE REAGAN-SAVIOR OF THE  SANDINISTAS  <By Stephen S. Rosenfeld>  Ronald Reagan is putting the final touch es on what may be, in his own chosen con servative terms, his greatest foreign policy  disgrace. He  is preparing to hand Nicara gua's Sandinistas, whom he loathes with a  passion, an indescribably sweet victory that  they will be tempted to hail as a historic tri umph of  revolution over  imperialism and  that will  leave him as the president who  ""lost Nicaragua."" If Daniel Ortega had any  sense of  irony, he would be planning  to  erect a statue of Ronald Reagan inscribed  ""To Our Favorite Yankee, Who Made the  Revolution Secure.""  Why  the  tribute? Because,  inheriting a  Sandinista regime  that held but had not  consolidated power, Reagan mustered the  sort of resistance that was not enough to  oust the regime but was enough to help it  reach out from its narrow ideological base  and to organize itself successfully around a  broad, patriotic theme.  Because he will be leaving Nicaragua in a  substantially  improved  international posi tion-with the support of the usual friends  of Third World revolution plus the sympa thy of most American allies. On no single  issue is the United States more isolated.  Because having failed to dislodge or tame  the Sandinistas, Reagan further failed  to  exploit the best alternative; weaving them  into an  international web  in which  they  would have  to accept obligations-obliga tions  flowing  to many others besides  the  United States-to move toward pluralism, to  temper the revolution's totalitarian streak  and to loosen its Cuban-Soviet connection.  This last failing comes into stark view now  as a result of the fading out of the peace  plan offered by Costa Rican President Oscar  Arias Sanchez, Reagan found the plan lack ing, since it does not nail down a full Sandi nista passage  to democracy as  the price  Nicaragua would have to pay for being re lieved of an American-sponsored war. Equat ing such a passage with defeat, Ortega re fuses to pay.  The plan is lacking. Arias himself accepts  the idea that, once the pressure of the con tras had been removed by his plan, the San dinistas might prefer  to face exposure as  cheaters rather than the real political opposition that compliance with the plan would  bring.  But the plan was also the last best hope to  avert the worse outcome of a humiliating  legislated end to contra aid and a conclusion  by the Sandinistas that they owe nothing to  anybody and are free  to  impose whatever  political pattern they choose.  The Arias alternative could have at least  allowed and obliged Nicaragua's ambivalent  fellow Latins-all with a direct national in terest in its observance-to oversee Sandi.  ",1987

NICK JOE RAHALL II  OF WEST VIRGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 30, 1987  ",1987
1166,1416,13,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, a provision of  the  supplemental  appropriations  bill would  prohibit  the Minerals Management Service  from  implementing product valuation guide lines before November 1, 1987. This prohibi tion covers valuation regulations for coal, oil,  and natural gas including NTL-5.  Today,  I wish to address the status of, and  outlook  for,  the MMS Royalty Management  Program.  Within the Department of Interior, MMS has  the fiduciary responsibility of managing reve nues from Federal and Indian mineral leases.  Annual revenues amassed from  this program  approach $6 billion. Of this annual total, on shore Federal mineral  leases account for an  income of $1.1 billion collected  through bo nuses, rents, and  royalties. However, MMS'  handling of  royalty payments  from onshore  leases especially have been beset by prob lems and embroiled  in controversy  involving  the States, Indian tribes, the minerals industry,  and agencies of the Department.  Allegations  run  rampant  that MMS  has  failed to collect the full amount of royalty due  to the Federal Government, and subsequently  to  the States and  tribes. These underpay ments by  lessees, usually  industry, can be  traced to the lack of definitive valuation guide lines. Since the royalty is calculated in part by  the value of  the product,  fair and equitable  guidelines on determining  the value of  the  product are essential for full royalty payments.  After several years, MMS finally issued pro posed valuation regulations for coal and oil on  January 15, 1987, and gas on February 13,  1987. Needless to say, this action has raised  a hue and cry from the States and tribes, who  believe  these  regulations will  result  in  lower  royalty payments, and the industry, which be lieves  these  regulations will  result  in higher  royalty payments.  As if this situation were not enough, there is  another saga paralleling and  intersecting  the  valuation  regulations  issue. This  issue con cerns the proposed retroactive cancellation of  Notice to Lessees-No. 5, commonly known  as NTL-5. NTL-5 is a directive issued to gas  lessees during a period of rising gas prices,  1977-82 and  directed  the gas  industry  to  value gas at either the FERG ceiling price or  the contract price. However, gas prices began  to fall  in 1982, and it soon became apparent  that NTL-5 would  require gas producers  to  pay  royalty  on  a  phantom  value.  NTL-5  should have been canceled  then and  there,  but for some esoteric reason known only to  bureaucrats,  it was not until July 25, 1986,  when MMS  issued a final notice stating  that  NTL-5 would be canceled prospectively. MMS  even  included several  reasons why NTL-5  should not be canceled retroactively. This was  all well and good until January 15, 1987, when  MMS again proposed  to retroactively cancel  NTL-5. The upshot of a retroactive cancella tion of NTL-5 would be that industry overpayJune 30, 1987  ments would potentially have to be recouped  from the States and tribes. Somehow, I find it  difficult to picture a company such as Exxon  demanding repayment from ""Mr. Indian Allot tee"" whose very subsistence  is dependent  upon revenue from his lease.  Because these valuation regulations are so  important for all concerned parties,  the Sub committee on Mining and Natural Resources  held oversight hearings on April 28 and 30,  1987. Representatives of State governments,  Indian tribes, and the coal, oil, and gas indus tries presented their views concerning the pro posed valuation regulations and the proposed  retroactive cancellation of NTL-5.  In dealing with MMS' management style  over the years, I have become aware of many  instances of bureaucratic shenanigans, which  seem to be par for the MMS course. But the  agency double bogeyed when  it became ap parent that  it had actually instructed compa nies to ignore NTL-5 and only pay royalty on  the actual price obtained. This smacks of gov ernment disregard of its own Federal regula tion, and succinctly epitomizes  the  level of  confusion and misunderstanding within  this  monetarily important program.  Pursuant to  these  informative and  respon sive hearings,  Interior Committee Chairman  UDALL, Ranking Minority Member DON YOUNG,  Subcommittee  Ranking  Minority  Member  LARRY CRAIG and I sent a joint letter on May  1, 1987,  to Secretary Hodel  requesting  that  final product valuation regulations not be pro mulgated until Congress had had the time to  review the hearing records and complete our  investigations. We requested that implementa tion of  these  regulations be postponed until  September 30, 1987. We also sent a similar  letter on April 30, 1987' to SIDNEY y ATES, the  distinguished chairman of the Committee on  Appropriations' Subcommittee on  Interior. We  requested  that  the supplemental appropria tions bill  for  Interior  include  language which  would postpone until September 30,  1987,  MMS' proposals to retroactively cancel NTL-5  and to implement the proposed product valu ation guidelines.  As  it stands now,  Interior Committee staff  and the General Accounting Office are work ing  to  review and assess th~ status of  the  MMS Royalty Management Program. Subse quent to  input from GAO  field  investigations  and meetings with MMS as well as with  the  States and industry, the staff expects to make  a  letter  report concerning product valuation  with  recommendations  to Chairman  UDALL  and myself by the end of August 1987. A de tailed committee report is expected to be pub lished by November 1987, a date which coin cides with  the moratorium date contained  in  the supplemental appropriation bill.

1167,1416,13,Mr.  DEFAZIO.," Mr.  Speaker,  the United  States is  in  the 37th year of a constitutional  crisis. President Harry Truman precipitated the  crisis  when  he  introduced  United  States  ",1987
1168,1429,13,Mr. MILLER of Washington.," Mr. Speaker, on  August 1, 1987,  the Price-Anderson Act will  expire. Three congressional committees are  now drafting legislation to reauthorize tt;e Na tion's first nuclear regulatory law. This will be  an extraordinarily complex process but  the  key  issue  is  fairly straightforward. The key  issue, Mr. Speaker,  is safety and  it  is ad dressed  in H.R. 2141, a bill  I have cospon sored.  Mr. Speaker, any bill must have at its heart  the goal of making safety the No. 1 priority of  those who operate any nuclear facility. H.R.  2141 does that by removing  the  liability cap  and making the operator responsible for any  damages that might occur in  the event of a  nuclear accident. Under this bill,  if a nuclear  accident were caused by gross neglect or will ful misconduct,  then  those who caused  the  accident would be  fully responsible  for com plete victim compensation.  Those of us from States with Federal nucle ar facilities like those at Hanford want to make  sure that the private contractors who operate  these reactors are held accountable and re sponsible. H.R. 2141 will do that. Any Depart ment of Energy contractor whose negligence  or misconduct causes an accident can't run to  the Federal Government and say,  ""help me  pay for  that accident."" The Federal Govern ment,  like any good  landlord, would pay  for  the damages  to protect  the citizens. After ward, the Federal Government would be enti tled to recover the costs of these losses from  the contractor.  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, current law ex empts Federal  facilities and  the contractors  who run them from any liability, no matter who  is at fault. If we have an accident at a civilian  nuclear power plant, the law says that all elec tric ratepayers who use nuclear power plants  help pay for any accident. Under H.R. 2141,  only the company which caused the accident  because of negligence or willful misconduct is  liable.  Mr. Speaker, the incentive here is to make  safety the number one priority. The vast ma jority of nuclear plant contractors do exactly  that. But nuclear power is an unforgiving tech nology. And it takes only one cut corner, one  dozing operator or one sloppy  logbook  to  jeopardize  the communities and  the  lives of  thousands of citizens. Nuclear accidents can  happen. We have seen that they do happen.  The best safeguards are  caution and  vigi lance. By  removing  the cap on  liability, by  making the contractors responsible for any ac cidents and by removing the deep pocket of  the Federal Treasury as a source for compen sation,  the bill makes safety and  vigilance  something every nuclear plant operator will  have at the top of his agenda.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  I urge my colleagues on the Committees on  Energy and Commerce, Interior and Insular Af fairs, and Science and Technology to support  the concepts in H.R. 2141. They should give  the House a bill which removes the cap on li ability and makes  the operators of nuclear  plants accountable and responsible.  TALKLINE/KIDS LINE OF ELK  GROVE VILLAGE, IL  HON. PHILIP M. CRANE  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 30, 1987  ",1987
1169,1429,13,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased to  call to the attention of my colleagues the fact  that Talkline/Kids Line of Elk Grove Village,  located in the 12th District of Illinois has been  chosen as a winner of the 1987 President's  Volunteer Action Award.  This award  is presented annually  to pro grams which have displayed  the American  spirit of volunteering and citizen involvement.  Talkline/Kids Line is the first 24-hour crisis  hotline for children in the United States. It was  designed to assist latchkey children who are  at home while  their parents work. The pro gram provides over 200  trained  volunteers  who receive calls, raise funds, and speak to  various  groups about  the  program. These  dedicated volunteers counsel lonely and trou bled children, as well as reinforce safety and  urge constructive use of independent time.  I would  like to take this opportunity to ap plaud Talkline/Kids Line  for  the wonderful  contribution they make to the community and  the children who benefit  from  the program.  The volunteers are  to be  commended  for  giving their time to care for the welfare of the  people in the Chicago area.  To be  recognized by  the President  is an  outstanding achievement and those associat ed with Talkline/Kids Line should be justifiably  proud of their accomplishments. I extend my  heartiest congratulations on a job well done.  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION RE GARDING  AMERICANS  MISS ING IN ACTION FROM KOREA  HON. BRIAN J. DONNELLY  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 30, 1987  ",1987
1170,1429,13,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  intro ducing today, along with Congressman MONT GOMERY, a concurrent  resolution expressing  the sense of the Congress concerning action  that should be taken to account for Americans  listed as missing  in action  from  the Korean  conflict.  Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago,  I spoke on  the  floor about the fact that 8, 177 Americans are  still  listed  as missing  in  action  from  the  Korean conflict and of that number, 389 were  prisoners of war, known  to have been alive  but in Korean custody before the 1953 cease fire.  I believe  that  the U.S. Government has a  moral obligation to the families of those 8, 177  Americans. We have a moral obligation to the  18401  soldiers themselves, and should receive a full  accounting of their whereabouts,  just as we  are trying to do for those listed as missing in  action from Southeast Asia.  My  resolution expresses  the sense of the  Congress  that  the President should  formally  request the Republic of Korea to undertake a  search for, and provide an accounting of, the  whereabouts or  fate of  those 8, 177 Ameri cans. Join Mr. MONTGOMERY and myself  in  cosponsoring this resolution, and send a mes sage to those soldiers and their families that  they are not forgotten.  TRIBUTE TO JOHN L. MARTIN  HON. ERNEST L. KONNYU  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 30, 1987  ",1987
1171,1429,13,Mr. KONNYU.," Mr. Speaker,  I take this op portunity  to pay  tribute  to John L. Martin, a  constituent of mine in the 12th District of Cali fornia, who retires today after serving 37 tire less years in California's system of public edu cation.  After being born and educated in the State  of  Iowa, Mr. Martin and his wife and child  drove to Coronado, CA, where John began his  distinguished  teaching career  in 1950. From  1952-60, John worked at Hillview School  in  Menlo Park where he taught for 2 years and  was principal for 6. Mr Martin and his family  settled permanently in Palo Alto in 1963, and  since 1965, in his capacity as assistant super intendent of Palo Alto schools  in charge of  curriculum, John Martin has distinguished him self as an outstanding administrator.  Mr. Martin has  received many awards  for  his selfless service,  including  the 1981 Sally  Siegel Award for Excellence in Education. He  also enjoys  the  respect of his peers  in  the  profession. A superintendent for whom John  served had  this to say about John's abilities:  I know of no one who has a broader un derstanding of the entire area of curricu lum,  including special education ... His  energy seems limitless.  Moreover, a principal who served  Martin stated:  In my nearly twenty-eight years in sec ondary education, I have never known an other person with quite the special combi nation of warmth, energy, and ability which  definitely characterize John Martin.  Mr. Martin's  record of educational excel lence has been matched only by his devotion  to  family and community. He and his wife  have raised six children and supported them  through college.  In addition, Mr. Martin has  been active  in  the  local  little  league, Babe  Ruth, PT A,  and  church organizations. John  Martin  is  truly a fine citizen  in  the Palo Alto  community.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank  John Martin for his services to public educa tion in California and wish him the best in his  years of retirement.  for Mr.  ",1987
1172,6,20,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, one of the  giants  of  American  politics-AU  Landon-passed  away  yesterday  in  Topeka-and today Kansas is mourn ing.  I am proud to say that Alf Landon  was a  friend of mine. He was also a  mentor. When it eame to running for  office in my State, Alf Landon was the  role model. He earned the respect of  Kansans and the rest of America-Re publicans, Democrats, and  independ ents-with a  career whose hallmark  was  integrity: He taught generations  of politicians what common sense and  leadership were all about.  A CENTURY OF ACHIEVEMENT  He was called the ""grand old man of  the Grand Old Party,"" but it was not  just because he lived to be 100 years  old-it was because his life was a solid  century of achievement.  Alf Landon was an outstanding two term Governor, a visionary Presiden tial  candidate,  and  a wellspring of_  wisdom for politicians who re~ognized  that the ""sage of TopP-ka"" was always  way ahead of his times.  THE LANDON I.EGACY LIVES ON  Mr. President, we  are honored  to  have the proud legacy of Alf Landon  continue on in this Chamber in the  person of our exceptional colleague,  Senator NANCY LANDON KASSEBAUM. It  is a personal honor for me to repre sent Kansas with her  in  the U.S.  Senate. I know my colleagues join me  today  in  extending our  sympathies  and prayers  to Senator KASSEBAUM  and the rest of the Landon family.  It was only a  few weeks ago  that  President and Mrs. Reagan traveled to  Topeka  to help  the Governor cele brate  his  100th birthday. Today  I  choose to remember that happy occa sion, a celebration of a man whose re markable life guarantees him a place  in the history of this great land.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have printed in the RECORD a  New York Times and a Washington  Times article on Alf Landon.  ",1987

1174,45,20,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, Senators  will recall that the Soviets also target ed U.S. observation aircraft with laser  light beams as well as electronic coun termeasures that were so powerful as  to destroy the monitoring systems in  one of the aircraft.  While we are on the subject, I found  myself deeply disturbed by a remark  attributed by the Washington Times  to Mr. Bob Linhard, a Director for  Arms Control Policy at the National  Security  Council.  The  news  story  quotes his  reaction  to  the Soviets'  first-strike  test  against  the United  States at Hawaii as follows: ""I hope  this never gets out.""  Mr. Linhard's apparent  desire  to  conceal  from  the American  people  highly provocative Soviet behavior has  no place in this administration or any  other. It is the same sort of desire to  conceal from the American people the  facts about U.S. business and financial  corporations engaging  in  trade with  the Communist countries which char acterizes  the attitude of Mr. Verity  and his associates at the U.S.-U.S.S.R.  Trade and Economic Council.  That is the reason why I proposed  two  reporting  requirements  in 1984  and the year following, included in the  Export Administration Act  revision.  They are  section 14(d) and section  14(e).  The first report requires a listing of  American  corporations,  the  general  type of product they receive an export  license for, and where the product is  going. The second report requires an  assessment of the impact of trading  with Communist countries, the impact  on the U.S. economy, particularly in  the area of production and  job dis placement.  Mr. President, Mr. Verity and his  fellow  lobbyists  have  consistently  sought to deny this information to the  American people, and thus far  they  have been successful. They want  to  keep making money from trading with  the Communist countries, but they do  not want the American people to know  about the magnitude of the trade, for  one simple reason-that the American  people would be aghast if they knew  the truth and had it available.  Unfortunately,  the Department of  Commerce has participated  in what  amounts to a coverup of the trade of  American corporations and banks with  the Communist world. The Depart ment clearly does not want the Ameri can people to have the truth. Rather  than protect  the American  people,  there seems clearly to be an effort to  protect the trade lobby dealing with  the Communists. The Commerce De partment,  for  the better part of 2  years,  flatly refused  to comply with  my repeated requests for this informa tion.  So, one day last week, I went to see  the President of  the United States  about  the Verity nomination.  I  told  him that if I could receive the infor mation that I had been seeking for 2  years, I would have no problem about  letting the process function in terms  of this nomination. I do not favor the  Verity nomination, but I am willing to  let  the process work. The President  apparently acted immediately, because  the same afternoon, within just a few  hours, the information was delivered  to me at my office, and I wish Sena tors could look at it.  This is one printout after another of  dealing with  the Communists. This  happens to be a general list. Here is  one to Bulgaria. Here is one to East  Germany. I will not unroll it all. Here  is another one. Here is another com puter printout-this is to Czechoslova kia, containing all sorts of sophisticat ed technology.  I could go down the list. Here is an other one, a thick one. Here is another  one. And so forth.  When the Department of Commerce  delivered this information to me, the  Department stipulated that one copy  had been delivered  to  the Banking  Committee and that only members of  the Banking Committee could see it. I  could not believe my  ears when  I  heard  that  restriction,  particularly  since, in my judgment, that interpreta tion is a violation of the law.  Here is a cover letter that accompa nied the list of this pile of computer  printouts. It is signed by Mr. Bruce  Smart, who  is  acting Secretary of  Commerce. He said:  I deem this data to be covered by the con fidentiality provisions of Section 12<c> of  the Act.  He goes on to say:  I have, therefore, exercised my discretion  under Section 12(c) and have determined  that it is in the national interest to provide  the data to you subject  to  the condition  that it not be publicly disclosed without the  approval of a Congressional committee of  appropriate jurisdiction.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the entire letter be printed  at this point in the REcoRD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE,  Washington, DC, October 2, 1987.  Hon. JESSE A. HELMS,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR HELMs: In response to your  request, I enclose that portion of the Fiscal  Year  1986  annual  report under Section  14<d> of the Export Administration Act of  1979, as amended, which lists by country the  companies receiving licenses for exports to  controlled countries, and shows the type of  goods or technology exported.  On the basis of legislative history, recent  court  interpretations,  and  the  terms on  which this information was furnished in li cense applications, I deem this data to be  covered by the confidentiality provisions of  Section 12(c) of the Act.  I appreciate that you are the author of  the 1985 amendment that requires the sub mission of this information to the Congress  with each annual report. You have a proper  interest  in seeing how we are complying  with this amendment. I have, therefore, ex ercised my discretion under Section 12<c>  and have determined that it is in the nation al interest to provide the data to you subject  to the condition that it not be publicly dis closed without the approval of a Congres sional  committee of appropriate  jurisdic tion.  Sincerely,  Acting Secretary of Commerce.  BRUCE SMART,  ",1987
1175,45,20,Mr. HELMS.," Here we go again. We  are going to see about that, Mr. Presi dent. The Soviets and other Commu nist countries know what they have  bought from U.S. corporations. They  know of  the financial dealings with  U.S. banks and other financial institu tions. The Department of Commerce  knows as does the U.S. Government.  The only people left out of this little  transaction are the American people  who have the most at stake.  So, Mr. President, that is about all I  am going to say at the moment. I am  going to abide, for the time being, by  the confidentiality restrictions. I am  not even going to show any of this to  the Senator. I am going to put it back  in my safe until we can resolve the  conflict of opinion about whether this  information should be made public as  I stipulated at the time I offered the  amendments  to  the Export Control  Act.

1177,58,20,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, Mr. Ver ity's hostility to the traditional use of  trade as an effective instrument of na tional policy is well known. Indeed, in  an  article  entitled,  ""U.S.-U.S.S.R.  Trade: A Vital Need."" which appeared  in  the Journal of  the U.S.-U.S.S.R.  Trade  and  Economic  Council  he  stated:  Trade a,ll too often was used as a foreign  policy lever: The trade agreement between  the U.S. and U.S.S.R. was never signed be cause of  the  Jackson-Vanik  amendment,  which offended  the Soviets because  they  viewed this as the United States meddling in  their internal affairs.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that this article be printed in the  RECORD at the conclusion of my re marks as exhibit 3.  Mr. Verity's callous disregard  for  fundamental human rights and reli gious freedom with respect to Soviet  minorities  and  particularly  Soviet  Jewry  has  drawn  sharp  criticism.  Indeed,  the White House  felt com pelled  to reaffirm a commitment  to  the  Jackson-Vanik  and  Stevenson  amendments which link United States  trade benefits with Soviet emigration  policies.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that an article by Bill Gertz enti tled, ""Reagan Affirms Links Between  Soviet Trade, Emigration,"" which ap peared in the Washington Times on  September 15, 1987, be printed in the  RECORD at the conclusion of my re marks as exhibit 4.

1179,58,20,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President,  I  am  deeply concerned about the potential  consequences of an expansion of fi nancial and commercial relations with  the Soviet Union. The  transfer of  goods and  technology  to  the Soviet  Union directly and indirectly contrib utes  to Soviet military  capabilities.  The  installation of  turnkey projects  for manufacturing in the Soviet Union  deprives American workers of jobs and  impairs our export markets  in third  countries  for  downstream  finished  goods which these manufacturing fa cilities produce. The Soviet trade impairs  economic development  in  the  Third World and particularly Latin  America.  The Under Secretary of Commerce,  Bruce Smart, gave an address to the  lOth annual members meeting of the  U.S.-U.S.S.R.  Trade  and  Economic  Council in which he drew specific at tention  to such  turnkey projects as  the installation of complete factories  in the Soviet Union. In volume 12, No.  1, 1987, of the council's journal carry ing this address, he is quoted as stat ing to the meeting:  Complete factories can be exported to the  Soviet Union totally comparable to new fac tories  that would be built  in  the United  States with all the most modern equipment  including process controls.  A deeply disturbing aspect of  the  Soviet trade is linked to the interna tional debt crisis which has affected  the developing world and Latin Amer ica in paricular. All too often the fact  that  the Soviet Union and Eastern  Europe are also part of the debt crisis  is overlooked. The Soviet bloc has a  debt of some $112 billion. Given the  global competition for investment cap ital  there  are  fundamental  choices  that are made as to the placement of  this investment capital. These choices  have  long-range  strategic  conse quences which bear directly upon our  national security and the shape of the  world that we live in.  Mr. President,  as we  look at  the  international economic situation today  we find what some economists refer to  as the ""international division of labor""  has resulted in five general categories  of economic status. In the first rank  are  the  United  States, Western  Europe, and Japan. In the second rank  are the newly industrialized countries  such as South Korea, Taiwan,  and  Singapore. We then find a struggle for  the third rank between Latin America  and the Soviet bloc. The loser will be  in the fourth rank. In the fifth and  last rank we find Africa.  Among  the  fundamental  policy  choices that we face within this con text is whether or not we will sacrifice  the economic development and future  well-being of our friends and allies in  Latin America in order to assist Gor bachev hold the Soviet empire togeth er.  Mr. President, the Soviets are quite  frank that the real reason behind Gor bachev's so-called glasnost propaganda  offensive  is  to pave the way for  in creased Western  financing  of  the  Soviet empire and for increased com mercial  relations  in order  to  rescue  and to build communism in the Soviet  empire.  The  Soviets want United  States banks to finance communism. If  this expansion of finance and  trade  with the Soviet bloc does materialize,  it will certainly be at the expense of  Latin American and other parts of the  developing world. The Soviets want a  special relationship.  I  Mr.  President,  so  that  Senators  might better understand  the Soviet  plan to develop permanent financial  relationships with American banks,  ask unanimous consent that an article  entitled  ""Cooperation  with  U.S.  Banks: Prospects for the Future,"" by  Victor Gerashckenko, First Deputy  Chairman of the Board of the Soviet  Bank  for Foreign Trade which ap peared in the nine-page special adver tising  section  carried by  the Wall  Street Journal on August 24, 1987, be  printed in the RECORD at the conclu sion of my remarks as exhibit 5.

1180,58,20,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  <See exhibit 5.)  ",1987
1181,58,20,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, at this  time, there is no new capital for pro ductive investment moving into Latin  America owing to the debt situation  there as well as to the problem of po litical stability and the investment cli mate. Of course,  the State Depart ment by supporting socialist govern ments throughout the hemisphere, as  well as elsewhere  in  the world, has  played a major role in causing the dis integration of political stability and  the investment climate in Latin Amer ica.  The lobby for the Soviet trade-and  Mr. Verity  is a driving force  in it seeks to shift investment capital into  the Soviet bloc and to expand trade  with the Soviet bloc at the expense of  Latin America in particular and the  Third World  generally.  From  the  Kremlin's standpoint, such access  to  Western finance, goods, and technolo gy will be used to prevent the Soviet  bloc from falling below Latin America  in development status while continu ing its unprecedented military build up.  The Kremlin  cannot  allow  the  Soviet  empire  to  fall  below Latin  America in development status for rea sons of not only international prestige  but also of  ideological necessity.  communism is the wave of the future  that Marxist-Leninism would have us  believe then the Soviet bloc must be  perceived as developing economically.  Seven  decades  of  experience  have  demonstrated that communism as an  economic  system  cannot  function  without a bailout from the West. This  is where business leaders such as Mr.  Verity come in. Their role is to assist  in  building  Soviet  communism  through trade and finance.  Mr. President,  instability and eco nomic disintegration in Latin America  is not in the long-term interest of the  United States. To the contrary, eco nomic development in Latin America  based upon productive investment and  trade with the United States is a fun damental interest because it contrib utes to the general peace and prosperi ty of this hemisphere, the New World.  If  ",1987
1182,84,20,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to support the nomination  of William C. Verity, Jr.,  to become  Secretary of Commerce-and raise, at  the  same  time,  some  reservations  about confirming him.  My concerns relate to Mr. Verity's  assertion  that  noneconomic  factors  such as human rights have no legiti mate place in the discussion of trade matters. In Mr. Verity's own words,  taken from an article in the American  Banker in 1980:  Our dated view of the world leads ... to  what  I  call ""moral  imperialism."" This  is  where we try to dictate to other countries  our ideas of what is right and what is wrong.  We have been mixing this trade policy with  human rights and other social and political  objectives  for  far  too  long. We haven't  recast the world. We have only succeeded in  cutting out many trading partners by creat ing  ill will. Our drive  to  reconstruct  the  world in our image has served only, directly,  to make American business less competitive.  According to Mr. Verity, this ""moral  imperialism"" extends to the Jackson Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of  1974. That amendment, linking most favored-nation  status  to  the Soviet  Union's performance on human rights  issues, was characterized by Mr. Verity  as ""one of the terrible mistakes that  was made by American politicians.""  Based on  that assertion, Mr. Verity  also said that he would do away com pletely  with  the  Jackson-Vanik  amendment.  During his  confirmation hearings,  Mr. Verity changed his position. He  stated then that he will abide by the  law, and not try to do away with this  crucial amendment.  Mr. President, I am willing to take  Mr. Verity at his word.  I  have no  reason to doubt his sincerity. At the  same time, I am putting him on notice  that I am depending on him not to go  back on  that promise. The  issue at  stake here-human rights-is a vital  one.  I, too, favor expanded trade for the  United States, and I want to see in creased  opportunities  for American  business. At the same time, however, I  want to know that these opportunities  are not inconsistent with U.S. policies  overall. Trade does not exist  in  a  vacuum. If it did, we wouldn't have  minimum wage or child labor laws and  we wouldn't have laws that protect the  security of the United States. Every thing would be decided on the basis of  dollars and cents-rubles and kopeks marks and pfennigs. And that is not  the kind of world that I  think most  Americans want to live in.  In conclusion, I want to quote from  an article by one of the former chair man of a major U.S. corporation. In  the article, which talks about the con nection between  the business world  and  the  community  at  large,  the  author says the following:  Businesses can't survive for long without  profits, but neither can  they survive  for  long if all around them is crumbling at their  feet. Ignoring the wider world in which we  do business not only brings us profit with out honor, but will in the fullness of time  bring us no profit at all.  I agree with those words. Whether  we  are  talking about  the  rights of  Christians and Jews to practice reli gion or  free  speech  in  the Soviet  Union, or the right  to demand fair  wages and safe working conditions, we  are  talking  about  questions  that  cannot be answered in terms of profit  alone. They are moral considerations,  and, yes, questions of honor.  I hope very sincerely that Mr. Verity  believes  the words  that I have  just  quoted above. He wrote them in 1982,  and I hope, as Secretary of Commerce,  he will be guided by the same words  and noble principles that he has set  out for others.  Thank you, Mr. President.  ",1987
1183,84,20,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, I rise to express my reasons for  voting in support of the nomination of  C. William Verity, Jr., as Secretary of  Commerce. In reaching this decision, I  have carefully considered Mr. Verity's  qualifications and past record as chief  executive  officer  of Armco  Steel,  chairman of President Reagan's Task  Force on Private Sector  Initiatives,  chairman of  the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, as a member of the Presi dent's Export Council, and as member  of the board of directors of the Chase  Manhattan Bank.  Two weeks ago, I met with William  Verity to discuss some of my concerns  about his nomination. Mr. Verity had  served as Armco's CEO during a period  of time that Armco, as co-owner of Re serve Mining of Silver Bay and Babbit  Minnesota, was engaged  in a highly  charged lawsuit brought by the U.S.  Government and the States of Minne sota, Wisconsin,  and Michigan.  In  many ways, this lawsuit reflected how  a  company  that  in  the 1950's and  1960's brought jobs and wealth to Min nesota, ultimately could not cope with  the environmental demands  that we  expect of corporate citizens today.  I believe it is necessary to provide  some background to this contentious  litigation that polarized nearly all of  my  constituents.  In  1922,  Armco,  which had been frozen out of the na tional ore  fields by  the  larger and  more dominant steel companies, en tered  into  a  research  arrangement  with the University of Minnesota to  try to find a way to commercialize tac onite ore. It took nearly 20 years for  Armco and the University to develop  such a process. Finally, Armco devel oped a pelletizing process for the taco nite ore that effectively doubled the  production  of America's blast  fur naces.  Armco worked with  the State of  Minnesota and the Army Corps of En gineers to determine a suitable loca tion for a pelletizing plant. Ultimately,  Silver Bay, MN, was selected as the  site for the plant. One of the key fac tors in reaching this decision was the  economic savings that would result if  the  taconite  tailings from  the plant  were disposed of in a deep trough in  Lake Superior.  In pioneering the commercial proc essing of taconite  in the 1950's, Re serve was seen as ""an economic savior""  of the Minnesota Iron Range. At the  peak  of  its  operations,  Reserve  brought nearly 3,200 jobs to the State  and broadened the tax base of rural  Minnesota.  However, it is clear to me that if in  the 1950's the Federal Government  ",1987

Certain issues  which arose at or after the committee  markup had since been resolved in an  amendment which the committee will  offer on the floor to modify its substi ti.itetOS. 1293._To facilitate under standing of  the  committee  amend ment,  I ask unanimous consent that  an explanation of  its provisions, as  well as  its  text, be  included  in  the  RECORD at this time.  There being no objection, the expla nation was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  EXPLANATION OF COMMITTEE FLOOR  AMENDMENT TO S. 1293  < 1) Sunset provision.-The bill as  intro duced and the Committee substitute would  have made the independent counsel process  a permanent part of our criminal  justice  system. However, because  the bill makes  several changes in the current statute and  the activity by sitting independent counsels  is expected to provide additional informa tion about the statute over the next few  years,  the Committee  floor  amendment  postpones  a  permanent authorization,  in  lieu of a  five-year sunset provision. This  sunset provision, which has been used in  previous  independent  counsel  legislation,  will ensure a comprehensive review of the  statute by the Congress in five years' time  to correct any problems. It also provides, as  does current law, that any cases pending at  the time of expiration will continue without  disruption.  <2) Prosecutorial experience.-In response  to concerns expressed at the markup about  the background of those chosen to be inde pendent  counsels,  the Committee  floor  amendment requires the special court, when  selecting individuals to serve as independent  counsels, to choose attorneys with ""appro priate prosecutorial experience."" In assess ing such experience, the court is expected to  consider the character and extent of an at torneys experience, how recent such experi ence is, and its relationship to the particular  case at issue. Use of the word ""appropriate""  is intended to permit the court to apply the  standard in a flexible manner according to  the type of case before it and the available  pool of candidates. The provision also states  that  the special court's determination on  the adequacy of an individual's prosecute rial experience  is not subject  to  judicial  review, thereby precluding legal challenges  to the appointment of an independent coun sel on the basis of that counsel's prior expe rience.  (3) Audits.-The Committee floor amend ment increases still further the fiscal con trols over independent counsel proceedings  by requiring an audit of the expenditures of  every independent counsel, upon the com pletion of the independent counsel's activi ties. The audit is  to be conducted by the  General Accounting Office. A report con taining the findings and conclusions of the  audit  is  to be filed with  the appropriate  committees of Congress, namely the House  and Senate committees with oversight, au thorization and appropriations responsibil ities for  the independent counsel process.  These audits and reports will permit a more  informed  analysis  on whether Congress  needs to impose additional fiscal controls.  ",1987

1193,331,20,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2969 will ensure  that compaines filing chapter II bankruptcy will continue paying health,  life, and disability benefits to retired  workers. Retired workers who were  promised  these  benefits  by  their  former employers are often complete ly dependent on them. If such benefits  are cut off-as happened when one  major  corporation  filed  bankruptcy  last year-retirees may not be able to  replace them because of high cost or  lack of insurability.  This is the second time this body has  considered legislation to protect retir ee benefits in bankruptcy. Over a year  ago, the Judiciary Committee reported  H.R. 5490 to the floor, and this body  passed  it  unanimously. The  other  body, however, did not act on  the  matter and the Congress passed tem porary, stop-gap legislation. That tem porary  legislation,  though  twice ex tended, will expire  just 2 days from  now. H.R. 2969 will provide retirees  permanent legislation to protect their  benefits. For chapter II bankruptcies  filed after the date of enactment, H.R.  2969  incorporates  title I-the retiree  benefit provisions-of S. 548,  legisla tion passed by  the other body. For  pending  chapter  II  cases,  the  bill  modifies and makes permanent  the  protections in the temporary stop-gap  legislation. H.R. 2969 mandates that  chapter II debtors continue to pay re tiree health, life, and disability bene fits as administrative expenses during  a bankruptcy proceeding. Discretion is  provided  to  the  bankruptcy  court,  though, to order a modification of the  amount paid while the case is pending  if necessary to permit a successful re organization of the debtor. This dis cretion is very important, for it would  serve neither  the  retirees, nor  the  economy as a whole, if a company was  forced  to  liquidate because of fixed,  unalterable retiree benefit costs.  H.R. 2969 as brought up today is not  perfect legislation, but I have no ques tion that it will protect retiree benefits  as much as possible in a bankruptcy.  Retirees, who have made  important  contributions to our economy and our  Nation, deserve this kind of security.  I urge Members to give them this se curity by passing H.R. 2969.  H.R. 2969  is on the floor today be cause the temporary stop-gap legisla tion  passed  by Congress  last  year  <Public Law 99-591), which has been  extended twice, is due to expire on Oc tober 15-just 2 days from now. The  time has come to provide retired work ers with  the security and peace of  mind that comes from permanent leg islation-not with just another exten sion  of  temporary  legislation  that  leaves retirees constantly worried that  they might lose their benefits as soon  as the temporary legislation expires.  The Subcommittee on Monopolies  and Commercial Law of the Judiciary  Committee has held two hearings over  the past 15 months on the issue of re tiree benefits in bankruptcy-most recently in September 10, 1987. The sub committee has received further com ments on this issue from bankruptcy  experts and retiree groups from across  the country. The important thing now  is  to provide a permanent solution.  H.R. 2969, as amended, provides a per manent solution.  The Secretary of Labor, William E.  Brock, has written a  letter endorsing  S. 548. This letter was reprinted in the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  on  July  24,  1987, the day the Senate passed that  bill.  In  its application  to  future cases,  H.R. 2969, as amended, is identical to  S. 548. In its application to pending  cases,  this bill makes the temporary  legislation permanent and modified it  to reflect the same substantive provi sions  regarding payment of  retiree  benefits during  the chapter 11  case  and treatment of retiree benefits in a  plan of confirmation  that apply  to  future cases.  Indications from the Department of  Labor and the Office of Management  and Budget have been  favorable  to  this bill. Representatives of both orga nizations have agreed to do what they  can to ensure that the President signs  this bill by October 15. At this point,  no one anticipates any problem in get ting  the President  to sign  this bill  promptly.  Mr. Speaker, I include a letter from  the United Steelworkers of America,  dated October 13, and a  letter from  the International Union, United Auto mobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Im plement Workers of America [UAWJ,  dated  October  13,  1987,  for  the  RECORD.  The  letters referred  lows:  to are as fol UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA,  Washington, DC, October 13, 1987.  Hon. PETER RODINO,  House of Representatives  Washington, DC.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN RODINO: Retirees must  be assured some degree of stability with  regard to their health care benefits in bank ruptcy. These benefits should not be sus pended upon the filing for Chapter 11 bank ruptcy; should be maintained until modifi cation; and protected in the post-confirma tion period.  USW A is assured that the revised Rodino  bill (amendment in the nature of a substi tute  to H.R. 2969) will accomplish  these  purposes. The union extends its support to  the measure and would anticipate that it  would be an important contribution to per manent law in this area. However, we are  well aware that health care costs for em ployees, in general, and retirees, in particu lar, need a much wider approach than bank ruptcy reform.  Nevertheless, this reform measure is abso lutely necessary. We strongly urge the pas sage of the Rodino bill before October 15,  the cutoff date for  the stopgap measure  now in place. Additionally, we are concerned  that there not be any time gap in protecting  these benefits for those retirees whose com panies are currently in bankruptcy.  ",1987

1195,357,20,Mr. COELHO.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding to me.  First, I would like to thank the gen tleman from California [Mr. LAGOMAR SINO],  the ranking minority member,  for the gentleman's help and coopera tion on this bill, and also thank the  gentleman  from  Minnesota  [Mr.  VENTO], the chairman of the subcom mittee, for his help and cooperation,  and  the gentleman's staff member,  Dale Crane,  for  their extensive  in volvement and assistance in helping us  get  through  this  conflict with  the  other body.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer  my support for the compromise bill we  are considering  today.  I believe  this  legislation will achieve our goal of pre serving a large portion of the Merced  River, while also giving some time to  the residents of Mariposa County to  determine how they might meet their  future water needs.  H.R. 317 will place the entire South  Fork and the Merced River within the  Wild and Scenic Rivers System. We  will also give the same designation to  the main stem from its sources in Yo semite National Park to 300 feet above  the confluence of Bear Creek and the  Merced River.  As part of  this  compromise,  the  main stem  from  approximately  the  town of Briceburg to the point of max imum  flood control storage at Lake  McClure will be made a study river.  The study designation will allow us to  get a  formal  recommendation  from  the Interior Department on whether  or not  this  section of  the Merced  should be preserved. The study period  will also provide some  time for  the  Mariposa County Board of Supervisors  to complete their review of the lower  river to determine if it might be used  to provide future water resources  to  the residents of the county.  '  I want to take notice of a couple of  matters for  the record.  I am aware  that there are existing developments  along  the Merced,  including  the  Merced  River  High  Sierra  camp grounds. I want to reiterate that' the  wild and scenic designation will in no  way  interfere with  the operation of  these campgrounds.  Additionally,  the Merced Irrigation  District was concerned about placing  the last half mile of the Merced before  the 867  elevation point within  the  study designation. MID contends that  this half mile of river  is within  its  project boundary for the New Excheq uer Dam.  Since we are only studying the lower  river, I believe it is appropriate to pre serve as much as the river during the  study period so we can explore all pos sible options  for  the  future of  the  lower river.  However,  I want  to make  it clear  that by placing the lower river within  the study category, we have not made  any determination one way or  the  other on the validity of the concerns  expressed by MID nor on how the last  half mile of the river should be han dled in the future.  I appreciate the support I have re ceived from the chairman of the sub committee, Mr. VENTO, on this legisla tion. I also wish to thank Dale Crane  for the assistance he provided in get ting this compromise together.  I am pleased that we have reached  this  agreement  on  preserving  the  Merced for our children and granchil dren. I ask my colleagues to support  the bill before us today.  ",1987
1196,357,20,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  further reserving the right to object, I  rise in strong support of the compro mise version of H.R. 317 before us  today to designate a segment of the  Merced River in California as a com ponent of the Wild and Scenic Rivers  System.  As Members may recall, the House  originally passed H.R. 317 by a unani mous vote on March 31 of this year.  The bill as passed by the House would  have designated as wild and scenic 74  miles of the main stem and 43 miles of  the south fork of the Merced River.  An additional8 miles of the main stem  would not have been designated as  wild and scenic, but would have been  protected by a 5-year moratorium on  water projects pending further study.  The  Senate  recently  passed  an  amended version of H.R. 317 which in cludes several technical and conform ing amendments, as well as as designa tion of the entire 79 miles of the main  stem of the Merced as wild and scenic.  The version of H.R. 317 we are con sidering today is a compromise worked  out between the sponsor of the bill in  the House, Representative  COELHO,  and sponsors of the Senate bill, S. 275,  Senators WILSON  and CRANSTON.  would designate 71 miles of the main  stem and 43 miles of the south fork of  the Merced as wild and scenic. The  lower 8-mile segment of the main stem  It  would be studied for possible inclusion  as a component of the Wild and Scenic  Rivers System  in  the future. Under  the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, study  rivers are protected during the study  and for a 3-year period following com pletion of the study.  Mr. Speaker, I believe this is a fair  and  reasonable compromise on  this  issue.  It provides  for designation of  those segments of the Merced River  which clearly meet the qualifications  for wild and scenic while protecting an  additional 8-mile segment of the main  stem until a wild and scenic study for  this portion can be conducted. Should  the study determine that this segment  is also qualified for wild and scenic  designation, it is my hope that Con gress will provide such a designation in  the future. Therefore, I urge all of my  colleagues to approve the compromise  embodied in H.R. 317 before us today.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reserva tion of objection.  ",1987

1202,370,20,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker,  recently  the  Industry Council  for Tangible Assets  [ICTA]  has been attacking my conclusions  that the  U.S. mint's establishment of a cartel to distrib ute the American Eagle gold bullion coins is  both illegal and harmful to the program. The  ICT A president, Howard Segermark, believes  that the mint and the members of the cartel  are doing a great job in getting the coins to  the public. Perhaps Mr. Segermark should talk  to Bruce Kaplan, the immediate past chairman  of ICTA. Last year, Mr. Kaplan's firm, A-Mark  Precious Metals, sued the mint over the distri bution network, while Mr. Kaplan was chairman of ICT A. The suit was over the very dis tribution system that the ICT A president now  praises so  lavishly,  the only difference being  that A-Mark is now a member of the cartel as  a result of the suit.  It's instructive to examine what A-Mark told  the U.S. District Court for the District of Co lumbia  regarding  the  mint's  distribution  system. In its court filings A-Mark calls the dis tribution plan: a ""plain violation of the [Ameri can Gold Bullion Coin] Act"", an ""unlawful dis tribution scheme,"" an ""unlawful and ultra vires  marketing and pricing scheme,"" a denial of  ""equal protection of the  laws,  in violation of  the fifth amendment of the U.S. Constitution,""  ""arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discre tion not in accordance with law and excess of  the defendant's authority under the act"" and  ""contrary  to  the express  requirement  in  the  act.""  ICT A's president disputes my description of  the primary marketers as a cartel. Yet his past  chairman's firm denounced  the marketers to  the court as  ""an exclusive cartel of wealthy  distributors.""  The revisionist history by ICT A presents the  distribution system as benefiting consumers  and other dealers. That  is not how A-Mark  viewed  it while not a distributor.  It  told  the  court that it would suffer ""gre~t economic det riment,  irreparable  injury and damage  to  its  business,  including  the  loss of customers,  sales, market share, goodwill, prestige, and  reputation.""  Does  the distribution plan assure  that  the  coins are available to the public at the lowest  possible price,  as Mr. Segermark  implies?  Hardly. The founder of A-Mark, in a sworn affi davit stated  that  the  ""mint's plan  forces A Mark to purchase the coins at prices dictated  by the select group of authorized distributors  and to then cut its margin in order to remain  competitive with them."" The distributors were  not reluctant  to benefit  from  their privileged  position.  In a second affidavit  the  founder  pointed out  that A-Mark was offered gold  coins ""at an exorbitant premium over the dis tributor's cost.""  The harm caused by the distribution system  was not only financial. A-Mark's founder cited  the ""irreparable damage through  the  loss of  goodwill"" that A-Mark would suffer by  its ex clusion  from purchasing  from  the mint. He  pointed out that the firm would ""lose custom ers and sales during""  the  initial peak sales  period. He pointed out  that new customers  would go to the authorized distributors at the  outset of the program and be lost to his firm.  How prudent is the distribution system? Ac cording to A-Mark, the ""distributors have been  chosen pursuant to arbitrary and unconstitu tional criteria"".  Is the mint distribution system  necessary for a successful bullion program, as  ICT A claims? Not so, according to A-Mark, de scribing  the marketing plan  to  the court as  having ""no rational  relationship  to any  legiti mate purpose under the act.""  What was A-Mark's views about  the sup posed  ""fierce competition""  that  ICTA Presi dent Segermark claims exists under the distri bution scheme? The ICT A chairman's firm at tacked  the distribution scheme  for creating  ""unduly restricted competition"" in violation of  the Competition in Contracting Act.  Then Mr. Segermark claims that nobody ex pected the high  initial demand for the coins.  On October 18, 1986, 2 days before the gold  coins went on sale, the founder of A-Mark, in  a sworn affidavit, told the district court:  The  period  immediately  following  the  first offering of the American Eagle coins  will provide a unique opportunity  to  the  gold coin distributors. Historically,  [other  gold coins] experiencd very high sales in the  weeks following introduction of those coins.  A-Mark will lose customers and sales during  this peak period. <Emphasis added.]  Perhaps Mr. Segermark needs  to consult  with his membership about  the demand  for  new issues of gold coins.  In case anyone is wondering why A-Mark is  not disputing the descriptions of the gold bul lion coin program by  the president of  ICTA,  the answer is simple. The mint settled the A Mark lawsuit by making the firm an authorized  distributor. Instead of still criticizing the cartel,  A-Mark is now a member of the cartel. Mr. Se germark can sing safely the praises of the dis tribution system, without running the risk of of fending one of  the  ICTA's most prominent  members, and without being  in conflict with  the position of his past chairman's firm.  A-Mark's put  its candid evaluation of  the  distribution system in the public record when it  challenged the system. ICTA's President can  try  to  ignore  that devastating record, but he  can never erase it. His past chairman's firm's  actions  in  fighting  the unlawful distribution  system,  speak  louder and more eloquently  than his own empty words.  IN HONOR OF DR. MARVIN  EPSTEIN  ",1987
1203,370,20,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from California [Mr. STARK] is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1987
1204,370,20,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, this Thursday the  Walnut Creek, CA, Muir Society appreciation  dinner will honor one of the finest physicians  in northern California, Dr. Marvin A. Epstein.  It is most fitting that this first annual appre ciation be held for Dr. Epstein, since he is one  of  the original, small group of doctors who  helped found the John Muir Hospital in 1965.  This hospital is now a leader in the community  and is considered one of the best hospitals in  California. Dr. Epstein was on  the hospital's  first board of directors and was elected by his  fellow physicians to serve as chief of staff in  1966.  Dr. Epstein is a leader in  the treatment of  heart diseases. He has been awarded silver  and bronze medallions from  the Heart Asso ciation in recognition of his services and was  a leader in organizing the cardiac care unit at  John Muir Hospital, where he served as its di rector for some 18 years.  For nearly 40 years, Dr. Epstein has been  serving the people of northern California. After  completing undergraduate work at Harvard  and his medical degree from the University of  Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in  1948, he moved  to California and became  chief resident in medicine at Oakland's Kaiser  Foundation Hospital.  His work  for  the community has  included  leadership in helping to found and operate the  ",1987
1205,383,20,Mr. ROE.," Mr. Speaker, all  too often  the  contributions of  those who have  taken an  active part  in  the welfare of our  local cities  and  towns go unnoticed, even  though  those  contributions have made their particular locali ty a better place to live. I rise today to salute  just such a person, one who has given of him self to his community in his work as a police man, a township commissioner and mayor.  I speak of Michael V. Marotti,  the  former  mayor of Belleville, a portion of which,  I am  proud to say, lies in my Eighth Congressional  District of New Jersey. During his 34 years in  active service to Belleville, Michael V. Marotti  has served in many capacities and made nu merous contributions to his community. For all  he has done, Mr. Marotti will be honored this  Friday, October 16, with a testimonial dinner  at the Fiesta in Lyndhurst, NJ. Most certainly,  he  is highly deserving of the honor that has  been accorded him.  Mr. Speaker, Michael V. Marotti is a lifelong  resident of Belleville and was educated in the  Belleville school system. He helped defend  his country during World War II, serving in the  U.S. Air Force from 1942 until 1946, attaining  the rank of sergeant.  Mayor Marotti, who attended Rutgers Uni versity  and  the New  Jersey State Police  School, began his  long service to the  town ship of Belleville when he joined in the munici pality's police department in 1953, becoming  a detective in the juvenile bureau.  In this ca pacity, he began a long period of helping the  youth of Belleville, befriending many of  the  township's young people who today remember  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  him with affection and admiration. His out standing work was cited on several occasions  by the people of Belleville, who honored him  with  a  number  of Distinguished Citizens'  awards in recognition of his continued efforts  on behalf of our young people.  Michael V. Marotti was also instrumental in  the building of the Belleville Little League field  on Montgomery Place and he is still affiliated  with the Belleville Little League. Professional ly, he served as president of PBA Local No.  28 for 12 years and also served as president  of the Essex County PBA for 1 year.  His  sights  turned  toward  the  Township  Commission in 1971, when he was elected to  a 4-year term as a Belleville  township com missioner. He was  reelected  in  1975 and  became Belleville's mayor, a post he held for  12 years. Among the honors he has received  for his service to his community are Kiwanian  of the Year in 1974 and UNICO's Man of the  Year in 1975. Mike Marotti is the proud father  of four children, Ceil, Rosemarie, Rocco, and  Michelle,  and  four grandchildren, Billy, Mi chael, Thomas, and Joseph.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I join  the many family and friends who will honor Mi chael V. Marotti this Friday night to salute him  for his long and unselfish service to his com munity. He has not only helped make Belle ville a better place to live, but both the State  of New Jersey and our Nation a better place  to live, as well.  ""MAZEL TOV"" TO CLERGY OF  CONGREGATION BETH SHALOM  HON. SANDER M. LEVIN  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 13, 198 7  ",1987
1206,383,20,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to pay tribute to the clergy of Congrega tion Beth Shalom who are this year observing  34 years of combined service to their congre gation and our community. Congregation Beth  Shalom is an active participant in the vibrant,  ethnically diverse community of Oak Park, MI.  Rabbi David Nelson has been  the spiritual  leader of Congregation Beth Shalom since  1972. In that time he has enthusiastically in volved himself  in many  issues of spiritual,  communal,  and  temporal  concern. He has  been a  leader  in  fostering Christian-Jewish  goodwill  in  the Metropolitan Detroit  area,  having served as the presiding officer of the  Detroit Roundtable of the National Conference  of Christians and Jews.  I can  tell you  from  personal experience-working frequently with  the rabbi-that he is also one of the strongest  voices  in  the community on behalf of Soviet  Jewry, and we owe him our gratitude for those  efforts.  Cantor Samuel Greenbaum, teacher and so loist, and director of Beth Shalom's youth ac tivities, has been a leading light in the educa tion of the congregation's young people. He  also teaches adult education classes and is a  popular speaker and performer  for Jewish  groups in the metropolitan area.  Ritual Director Samuel Semp has enriched  the spiritual life of the congregation by coordi nating the ritual and synagogue services that  27721  so many of us take for granted. His devoted  service has added extra meaning to the spe cial life cycle events as they are observed by  the congregants.  Congregation Beth Shalom and our commu nity  in general are  indeed  fortunate  to have  the leadership of these three outstanding indi viduals. We are all greatly enriched by  their  guidance.  I offer  them  a  hearty  ""yasher  koach"" and  ""mazel  tov""  for  their combined  years of service and accomplishment, with  many more years to come.""  LETTER  FROM  CONSTITUENT  HELPS EXPLAIN WHY HEALTH  COSTS ARE SO HIGH  HON. FORTNEY H. (PETE) STARK  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 13, 1987  ",1987
1207,383,20,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, we have all been  appalled by the large, 37 -percent increase in  Medicare's part B physician service premium  scheduled for this coming January.  These increases in health costs are particu larly disturbing when Canada manages to pro vide quality service to all  its people at about  30-percent  less  than our cost of providing  health care to only five-sixths of our popula tion.  Two months ago,  I received a  letter from  one of my constituents  from Oakland, CA,  who described his experience in trying to get  cataract surgery in northern California, versus  the cost  in Mexico City.  It  is an  interesting  letter and raises  lots of questions about the  costs of our health-care system.  I congratulate my  constituent  in  seeing  through the campaign of the eye surgeons in  asking  their patients  to bombard Congress  with postcards against -any cuts in Medicare  reimbursement for cataract surgery. His letter  is a very effective answer.  By the way, the cost of a cataract operation  in Canada is about the same as the price my  constituents  reports  is  the  going  rate  in  Mexico City.  Portions of his letter follow:  Prior to going south, I had an eye exami nation in San Leanaro for cataracts which I  paid for myself. The examination total cost  was $245, $75 for the regular, and $170 for  what is called an ultrasome scan, and was  set up for surgery 3 days later.  You won't remember, but I am still not  the regular run of the mill 78-year-old senile  citizen. I asked for and had a hell of a time  getting the cost of this surgery. Total cost $5,500 for each eye. I had even more diffi cutly finding out who got what, but did,  Doctor-20 minutes-$2,400. Hospital  3%  hrs  outpatient-$2,300.  Incidentally God  knows what-$800. I cancelled the surgery.  This came as a great shock to both the  surgeon and the hospital who both called  me many  times  to  assure me  that  it  wouldn't cost me one cent.  Although I know damn little about Medi care having never had any dealings with any  type of insurance benefits, it was my under standing that Medicare paid only 80 percent  of allowed medical expenses after the first  $15 which should leave me with $1,100 plus  $75 to pay. I have since checked with four  surgeons in the bay area and they all assure  ",1987
1208,396,20,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with great  pleasure that I rise today to offer my congratu lations to a distinguished member of the Sac ramento community, Mr. Roy Brophy, upon his  induction  into  the Greater Sacramento Busi ness Hall of Fame on October 13, 1987.  Mr. Brophy's career  is a  long and distin guished one. Upon graduating from San Jose  University in 1946 with a degree in journalism,  Mr. Brophy went on to postgraduate study at  the University of California's Hastings School  of Law. Before  this, Mr. Brophy served his  country by enlisting in the U.S. Navy, working  as an  intelligence officer throughout the war  years. In 1952, Mr. Brophy found his true call ing when he began his career as one of Sac ramento's most successful real estate devel opers. He has served the Sacramento area as  a past president of the Sacramento Land De velopers,  as  president of  the Sacramento  Home Builders Association, and among other  honors too numerous to mention, Mr. Brophy  also served as a vice president of the Sacra mento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce.  Since  the  beginning  of  his  career, Mr.  Brophy has been a tireless advocate of better ing  the educational systems of Sacramento  and the entire State of California. From 1972  to 1980, Mr. Brophy was on the board of trust ees for the California State University System  and also served as a member of the California  Postsecondary Education Commission. Mr.  Brophy continued his work in Washington, DC,  serving as a trustee for the Fund For Improve ment Postsecondary Education, Office of the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Secretary of Education  from 1980  to 1984.  For his unflagging devotion to education, Mr.  Brophy has received honors from many insti tutes of higher learning. He has received the  President's Distinguished Award  from Sacra mento State University .and was honored as  one of San Jose State University's 1 o most  distinguished graduates.  Mr. Speaker, it is not possible to adequately  thank Mr. Brophy for all that he had done for  the Sacramento community and for the State  of California.  I know  that  I speak for all  the  people of Sacramento when I offer my sincere  thanks  for a  job well done, and my best  wishes for his continued success.  BOSTON MAYOR  RAY  ON  THE  HOUSING  AND HOMELESSNESS  FLYNN  CRISIS  HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 13, 1987  ",1987
1209,396,20,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  this month's  issue of State Legislatures magazine included  a nationally  significant article authored  by  Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, chairman of the U.S.  Conference of Mayors Task Force on Hunger  and Homelessness. Mayor Flynn has written a  comprehensive  essay which  describes  the  plight of our homeless population and points  out the multiple causes of, and federal reme dies for, this pervasive problem.  Today's homeless, Mr. Speaker, are gener ally drawn  from  the most vulnerable among  us. They are no  longer just the stereotypical  hoboes of American folklore. They are families  unable to locate affordable housing. They are  runaway children. They are  the mentally  ill  men and women released from the institutions  where  they were  abused  into  the  streets  where they have been left neglected to freeze  and die on sidewalk grates. In short, they are  the men, women, and children to whose care  civilized societies have traditionally recognized  a moral  obligation,  but on whom modern  American society is turning its back.  In  the  article  that  follows, Mayor Flynn  offers those of us responsible for federal pol icymaking a challenge to recommit our Nation  to that moral obligation through a restoration  of the housing, health care, and social service  programs which are  the only solution  to  the  homelessness  crisis.  I  commend  Mayor  Flyinn's words to the attention of all of my col leagues in the expectation that greater aware ness will return the United States of America  to  those policies which most clearly distin guish us as a people of compassion.  THE HOUSING CRISIS AND HOMELESSNESS  <By Raymond L. Flynn)  During the past few years, America has  experienced a  rising tide of homelessness,  understandable, perhaps, during periods of  economic distress such as the Great Depres sion, but not during a period of economic re covery and at a time of national prosperity.  It is difficult to obtain precise, reliable fig ures for the total number of homeless per sons in the United States. Nationwide esti mates range from 250,000 to 3 million. What  is clear is that the numbers are growing. For  example, a 1985 survey by the U.S. ConferOctober 13, 1987  ence of Mayors Task Force on Hunger and  Homelessness found that demand for emer gency shelter in cities rose by an average of  25 percent in one year. A follow-up survey  of homelessness among families, released in  May 1987, found that the number of fami lies  seeking  emergency  shelter  had  in creased by 31 percent in two years.  Local studies indicate that today's home less are a diverse group of men, women and  children.  Some  live  alone.  A  growing  number live as members of families. Some  are mentally ill, or alcoholics. Most are not.  As a group, today's homeless population is  younger  than  the  ""skid  row""  homeless  group of the past that was dominated by  men in their 50s and 60s. Some homeless  persons are mobile, reminiscent of the so called ""hobo"" population. Most, however,  are not;  if they move,  it  is because  they  have been displaced.  The growing epidemic of homelessness in  the United States is the result of three basic  causes, each linked to a failure of federal  government policy.  Federal cutbacks have cut huge holes in  the so-called ""safety-net."" Job training pro grams have been slashed from $11.5 billion  in FY 1981 to $2.4 billion in FY 1986. Fur ther,  last year  the percentage of unem ployed persons receiving unemployment in surance benefits hit a record low; it is now  only about half what it was in 1980, when  the unemployment rate was about the same  level as today.  Since 1981, the federal government has all  but dismantled  the nation's housing pro grams. The number of new federally-assist ed units has plummeted from above 200,000  to about 25,000. HUD's housing programs  have been severely cut, from over $33 billion  to under $8 billion-a 75 percent cut.  Federal cutbacks and tax policy changes  make it increasingly difficult to expand the  supply of affordable housing. In addition, a  substantial portion of the two million units  of  federally-subsidized,  privately-owned  apartments constructed  in  the 1960s and  1970s is at risk as a result of expiring subsi dies. In many cities, market forces are push ing up rents, eliminating the stock of low rent houses, and converting apartments to  expensive condominiums.  In  addition,  a  substantial  segment  of  America's homeless comprises mentally ill  persons. They are victims of the policy of  ""deinstitutionalization,"" begun in the 1960s,  which emptied our nation's mental hospitals  without providing adequate  resources  for  community-based facilities. Nationwide, the  number  of  persons  institutionalized  in  mental hospitals declined from 505,000  in  1963 to 138,000 in 1980. The nation's home less shelters are often filled with mentally  ill persons. Many shelters have become, de  facto, America's new mental institutions. In stead, what is needed is adequate funding to  support  community-based  facilities-hous ing as well as social services-for the men tally ill.  During the 1980s, as the homeless popula tion  increased,  state  and  local  govern ments-working with  non-profit  groups,  social service agencies, churches and foun dations-developed many  innovative hous ing initiatives including programs to serve  the homeless.  Both Boston  and Massachusetts  have  been leaders in providing funding for per manent  and  emergency  housing.  The  number  of  emergency  shelter  beds  in  Boston increased from 972 in 1983 to over  2,000  in 1987. The  increase was  accom plished  through  the disposition of  city",1987

1211,409,20,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I see the  distinguished Republican  leader  on  the floor. I wish to address a question  to him.  Is  it possible, now  that  the Bork  nomination is on the Executive Calen dar, that the two leaders might join in  waiving the 2-day rule? I am willing to  do so and eager to do so.  I would like to see this Senate get  started  on  the  Bork  nomination  today-today is Wednesday-and vote  on the nomination as soon as possible,  hopefully today.  Would the distinguished Republican  leader indicate whether or not he is  willing to join with me in waiving the  2-day rule.  ",1987
1212,409,20,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, let me in dicate to the majority leader that we,  as  I  indicated yesterday  afternoon,  had a meeting last night. I thank the  majority leader for permitting us to do  that.  As I understand the rule, the leaders  could waive it, but I think right now I  am not in position to do that because I  have  almost  unanimous  indication  from the membership that they prefer  I not do it.  But let me also suggest that I think  there  is a willingness on both sides,  and I took the liberty of calling Judge  Bork myself last night. It seems to me  that no one has any quarrel with what  the majority leader said. He deserves a  vote. I do not suggest he should dic tate  to  the Senate when  that vote  should come.  But as I understand it, there are a  number of people preparing informa tion that should be used, high-level in formation, not a personal assault on  anybody in the Senate, and that infor mation is not yet available, and so he  was hoping that the vote would come  next week.  I regret that I am not in a position  now to waive the 2-day rule.  I will be glad to check with the ma jority leader later this morning. We  are going to have another meeting.  But if we took it up and we waived  the 2-day rule, it might just prolong  the debate. We might not save  the  time.  I know the schedule before us, and I  know we do have a number of items  cleared on this side, but at this point I  cannot  join  the majority  leader  in  waiving the 2-day rule.  ",1987
1213,409,20,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I regret  that  the  distinguished  Republican  leader is not ready to join with me in  waiving  this  rule.  I  realize  that for  him to give consent to proceed to the  nomination would  require  consent  from other Members on his side of the  aisle but he does not need the consent  of other Members on his side of the  aisle to waive this rule to join with the  majority leader.  I am nonplused. Judge Bork wants a  vote on his nomination. We Democrats  are ready to vote on the nomination.  And as the Republican leader has said,  there should not be any hint  that  Judge Bork  is attempting to dictate  when this nomination will be voted on.  I  think Judge Bork might keep  in  mind that a motion to table this nomi nation once it is up could be made and  that would stop all debate. I do not  want that to happen. I want a vote up  or down on the Bork nomination.  What is it the Republicans want? Do  they want an issue? Or do they want a  judgship?  The  longer we  delay  taking  this  Bork nomination up, the longer we are  going to see delayed the filling of that  vacancy on the Supreme Court. That  does not help the Senate, that does  not help the Court, that does not help  the country.  What is it the Republicans want? If  they want a vote on the Bork nomina tion, they can get it. Or do they want  to string it out and promote divisive ness, contention, and dissension, which  could spill over into the next nomina tion? And that is what we all ought to  want to avoid.  The sooner we get on with the Bork  nomination and vote on it, the better.  The die  is cast on that nomination,  and there is no point in dragging it  out.  I hope that we could get this nomi nation up  today and I will be back  urging the Republican leader to help  me to waive this 2-day rule. We have  much work to do here.  Can we get an agreement to vote on  the Byrd-Warner amendment  to the  Weicker-Hatfield war powers  legisla tion?  ",1987
1214,409,20,Mr. DOLE.," If the majority  leader  will yield,  I did not explore  that.  I  could  if  the majority  leader desires  that.  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.  ",1987
1215,435,20,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  let me  just say  this. The distinguished Re publican whip has  said  that he  is  acting in response to his own stirring.  Mr. President, this is the President's  nomination. It is not mine. This is the  administration's nomination. The ad ministration has an opportunity to fill  this seat, the vacancy, on the Supreme  Court. Who is here trying to fight to  help get this seat filled? The majority  leader of the U.S. Senate, who belongs  to the opposite party. The administra tion ought to be trying to get that seat  filled. We can give Mr. Bork a vote. I  hope we will have an up or down vote  on Mr. Bork.  But remember this, it could be a ta bling motion, which would stop  the  debate. I do not want to resort to that.  I hope I will not have to.  But here I am trying to fight to get  this administration to get a nomina tion up here, get the way cleared, get  all the brush and the briars out of the  way so the administration can send an other nomination up here and get it  acted upon before we go out for sine  die adjournment.  Who is opposed to this? Mr. Presi dent, this does not make sense. Every body knows what is going to happen  on  this nomination of Mr. Bork.  I  think everybody should be apprehen sive concerning the kind of debate, the  invective,  and  the  contumelious  charges that will be made, with a bit terness  that can spill over  into  the  next nomination.  I have not asked one Senator how he  is going to vote in all of this time. I  have not asked one Senator to vote  against the Bork nomination. I have  not once  asked  anybody,  ""What  is  your vote count?""  I have tried to stay above that as  majority leader in this instance. That  is no criticism of  those who might  have done otherwise.  But nobody can charge this Senator  with being unfair. Nobody can charge  this Senator with trying to stack the  deck against Mr. Bork.  I just want to get on with what is my  responsibility. That is my stirring, and  I want to get on with what I see is the  responsibility of this Senate.  It seems to me that if this adminis tration wants something other than  an  issue,  if it really wants  to get a  judgeship confirmed, then it ought to  cut out the temper tantrums and let  the dead past bury  its dead. Let us  have a vote here. There is time to get  another nomination to the Senate and  to get it confirmed. But each day we  dillydally and delay is 1 day later if  not more before the Senate can get to  another nomination.  We will soon be down to Thanksgiv ing, and Senators will want to go home  for Thanksgiving. Then we get  into  December and everybody will want to  go home for Christmas. Then we have  New Year's.  The time is now. I am telling you,  time, precious time, is being wasted.  I want the country to know that this  Democratic  leader wants  to get on  with  the Senate's work.  I have not  treated anybody unfairly. I have not  been charged with  treating anybody  unfairly. But it seems to me we ought  to cut through all this mist and fog  and get on with the vote on this nomi nation. Give  this man his vote and  give the President a vote this week. He  asked for a vote this week. There are  very few people around here who are  going to take a 400-page report home  and really read it, few people. We all  know that.  I will say to the distinguished Re publican leader I intend to ask unani mous  consent-not  right  now,  but  before the day is over and again to morrow if I cannot get it today-that  the Senate proceed  to the consider ation of  this nomination by Friday  and that we vote, in any event, by 6  o'clock p.m. on Tuesday next. We can  come in Saturday and we can stay in  as late as Senators want. We can come  in Monday and we can stay in as late  as Senators want. We can debate this.  But we have other work to do and we  have a Supreme Court vacancy to fill.  This delay, I can see very clearly, is  not working to the good of anyone. It  is not going to be helpful  to Judge  Bork or to his wife and family. It is  not going to be helpful to the Presi dent of the United States or to the  Court, or  to  the Senate, or  to  the  country.  Mr. President, I yield to the distin guished Senator from Ohio.  ",1987
1216,435,20,Mr. METZENBAUM.,"  I  thank  majority leader.  I appreciate what he has been saying  in attempting to move the Bork nomi nation to a vote. I do not want to ad dress myself to that issue. What con cerns me as a member of the Judiciary  Committee is what happens next. I am  concerned that when the next nomi nee is sent up, suddenly the drumbeats  will roll and the bugles will blare and  the  the editorials will be written and the  Judiciary Committee will  be  called  upon to move with dispatch and with out delay to the confirmation of the  second nominee.  I  think  that  is an  unfair burden to place upon the Judi ciary Committee. If we adjourn within  30  days, which  is  the approximate  time we are supposed to adjourn, if we  should vote on  it next Wednesday,  then it is conceivable that we would  not be able to get to the confirmation  of the next nominee.  Nobody is attempting to do that, but  if that is the reality of the situation,  that we cannot conduct our hearing,  we cannot do the necessary investiga tion, we cannot do that which we are  obligated  to do as Members of  this  body and we are crowded  to move  more rapidly than makes good sense,  then it is we who will carry the burden  of blame.  I  think the fact that the majority  leader is attempting to facilitate and  move this matter forward,  indicating  that as of the first of the week he was  ready to schedule the Bork nomina tion for debate, indicates the fact that  there is no desire to come to the situa tion where we might be adjourning  without being able to fulfill the vacan cy on the Supreme Court.  That is a possibility. The longer we  delay I think the more it makes that  possibility into a reality.  ",1987

1219,435,20,Mr. DOLE.," I do not disagree with  anything anybody has said, I guess. I  am not certain. But I do believe that  we are not delaying here. I read the  Sunday Boston Globe, where it said  that ""On July 8, KENNEDY met with  BIDEN  and Senators HOWARD METZ ENBAUM and ALAN CRANSTON  to WOrk  on strategy. The first point was  to  gain time to organize against the nom ination. So a decision was reached that  there be no hearings until after the  August recess.  To me, that was a strategy to delay.  There was a meeting. I do not know  whether all these people attended but  that is what is in the paper. That may  not be accurate.  There  is not any strategy here  to  delay. We are talking about debate, if  it starts on Monday and ends some time Wednesday, we are talking about  2% days to debate this nomination. We  are talking about 2% days to discuss a  nominee who  waited  72  days-72  days-for a hearing in the Senate Ju diciary Committee; 2% days versus 72  days  is quite a  difference.  I would  hope we could just agree on that. I am  willing to try to reach a time certain.

1220,448,20,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, the Low  Income Home Energy Assistance Pro gram [LIHEAPJ is critically important  to some 6.5 million poor households  across the country. And yet we are in  the difficult position of having to vote  for a budget waiver  to prevent pro gram funds from being cut by $585  million, or nearly 33 percent.  This dilemma arises for several rea sons. First, the Senate Appropriations  Subcommittee on Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education, and Re lated Agencies [Labor /HHSJ received  a 302(b) allocation of $930 million less  in budget outlays than its House coun terpa.!.'t.  So,  although,  the  Senate  budget  resolution  assumes  current  services for LIHEAP-$1.823 billionand  the House  appropriated  that  amount,  the Senate Labor /HHS Ap propriations Subcommittee was forced  to consider deep spending cuts in all of  the discretionary programs under  its  jurisdiction. LIHEAP, because of  its  high  ""spend-out""  rate-91 percent was targeted and hit.  Certainly,  the  302(b)  problem  is  partly  responsible  for our dilemma.  But  I would  suggest  our  dilemma  points to a  larger,  far more serious  matter. The hard truth is that we in  Congress are deluding ourselves if we  think we can meet Gramm-Rudman  targets-much  less  balance  the  budget-with further reductions in dis cretionary nondefense  spending. As  Peter G. Peterson points out in an im portant article entitled ""The Morning  After,'' published in the current issue  of  the Atlantic Monthly, we  could  eliminate all discretionary nondefense  spending and still run a sizable budget  deficit. Over the past few years, we  have  cut  discretionary  nondefense  spending to 4.09 percent of GNP-its  lowest level since 1961.  And so we have a Hobson's choice:  we can vote for a budget waiver and be  labeled ""fiscally irresponsible"" by our  opponents. Or we  can vote  for  the  largest single reduction made in any  low-income program in the last 6 fiscal  years. A vote not to waive the Budget  Act is a vote to cut LIHEAP not to the  bone, but through the bone. Make no  mistake:  it's a vote  to eviscerate the  program; to turn off the lights, heat,  and-1 make this point to my South ern colleagues-air-conditioners of mil lions of poor households.  Diane DeVaul of the Northeast-Mid west Institute has authored a report  entitled  ""Narrowing  the Gap: The  Energy Needs of the Poor and Federal  Funding."" She points out that in 1984,  the last year for which exact figures  are available, a gap of $3.6 billion ex isted  between  the  energy  costs  of  LIHEAP-eligible households and  the  amount actually made available. Esti mates based on the U.S. Department  of Health and Human Services data  for  fiscal  year  1986  indicate  that  LIHEAP funds covered  just 9.4 per cent of  the energy costs-for lights,  hot water, cooking, and the like-of  federally  eligible  poor  households.  LIHEAP defrayed under 20 percent of  their basic heating and cooling costs.  Allow me to point out that LIHEAP  is not some big, out-of-control Federal  program. In 1985, Congress appropri ated $2.1 billion for LIHEAP. In fiscal  year 1986,  the appropriation was re duced to $2.009 billion as a result of  the 4.3 percent across-the-board cut  mandated  under  Gramm-Rudman.  Last year, Congress further  reduced  funding for the program, to $1.823 bil lion--an amount some $25 million less  than the fiscal year 1981 appropria tion. Addressing last year's funding re duction, House and Senate conferees  to  the Labor /HHS bill make  that:  clear  . . .  the amount agreed to for LIHEAP  should not be construed as a decline either  in support for the program or in the need  for such assistance. Rather, it is reflective  of the unusual circumstances which exist  this year: lower energy prices in general and  the availability of substantial oil overcharge  funds to the states. <House Report 99-960,  page 20)  Conditions of  lower energy prices  and the widespread availability of oil  overcharge  funds no  longer prevail.  Most of the oil overcharge funds were  allocated to the States last year; addi tional allocations are likely to be in consequential and spread over several  years-! might  add  that a Federal  court ruled that such funds were to be  used  to  supplement,  not  supplant,  energy assistance programs; the funds  were not targeted specifically to the  poor. More  importantly,  residential  energy prices are on the rebound, with  the cost of fuel oil, natural gas, and  electricity all expected to increase this  year and next.  Mr. President, a  June 1986  study  prepared for the National Association  for State Community Services Pro gram <NASCP  study)  demonstrated  the persistent needs of LIHEAP recipi ents:  LIHEAP households had an average  income of $7,373  in 1984-$847 below  the official poverty line for a family of  three.  LIHEAP provides modest but mean ingful assistance to 6.8 million house holds, 39 percent of which contain an  elderly person.  Fourteen percent of LIHEAP house holds contain a handicapped person.  LIHEAP households spend 14 to 15  percent of  their  income on energy  costs-and some 40 percent of these  costs are for basic heating and cool ing-nearly four times the national av erage.  In 1984,  these  costs  totaled  $942; the average LIHEAP benefit was  $213.  LIHEAP funds reach only 34 percent  of all federally eligible households.  Information I obtained today from  the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services indicates that 52 per cent of all LIHEAP-eligible  families  contain children under the age of 18.  So, Mr. President, as  I mentioned  earlier, we face a Hobson's choice. I  urge my colleagues  to support  this  amendment which maintains funding  for this critically important program.  ",1987
1221,448,20,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, I am very  pleased to join with my distinguished  colleague,  the  senior Senator  from  Connecticut [Mr. WEICKER] in this bi partisan effort to restore funding for  the Low Income Home Energy Assist ance Program [LIHEAPJ to the fiscal  year 1987 funding level.  As presently reported to the Senate,  appropriati Jns in H.R. 3058, for low income energy assistance total $1.237  ",1987

1223,461,20,Mr. HEFLIN.," At this point, I would  like  to  inquire of  the Senator from  Florida about the action of the com mittee  regarding  full  funding  for  cancer center core grants in the cancer  centers  program  at  the  National  Cancer Institute.  Is  it my understanding  that  full  funding  for  the cancer center core  grants is included in this bill?  ",1987
1224,461,20,Mr. CHILES.," The Senator is correct.  Allow me to indicate to you why we  decided to take this action. The rather  severe difficulties  facing cancer cen ters across the country were brought  to my attention when I chaired the  hearings of  the  subcommittee. The  data submitted by the witnesses, espe cially  those from  the Association of  American Cancer  Institutes, which  represented the cancer centers of the  country, indicated that figure of $118  million would be  required  for  the  cancer center core grants to be funded  at the peer reviewed level, and to pro vide for the potential of new cancer  centers coming on line-the National  Cancer Institute has already received  excellent applications from proposed  new  cancer  centers  for  funding.  I  would like to make the point strongly  here that this indication of interest on  the part of the committee that the  cancer centers be funded at the full  peer reviewed  level does not in any  way impact on the peer review process  itself.  In summary, then, given all this evi dence, and given  the actions of the  committee over  the  last 3 years,  I  thought that it was prudent to indi cate in the bill report itself the figure  of $118 million as having been includ ed in the NCI budget for this year.  I was very pleased to learn several  weeks ago of the Senator's interest in  this matter, and was delighted to learn  that he fully supported the decisions  that we made at  the subcommittee  and the full committee levels. When  we deliberate on a matter such as this,  given current budget restrictions, it is  always a pleasure to find that our deci sions have been supported by such a  distinguished Senator with such deep  interest in cancer research.  ",1987
1225,461,20,Mr. HEFLIN.," I have heard from Dr.  Albert F. LoBuglio, director of  the  Comprehensive Cancer Center, Uni versity of Alabama at Birmingham  about  this  problem.  That  cancer  center has done extraordinary work  for the people of Alabama. For exam ple: The cancer center at UAB has de veloped some of the most sophisticat ed resources for basic science and clini cal care in the Southeast, and is now a  regional, national  and  international  resource for patient care and research.  A number of remarkable cancer  re search advances have taken place at  UAB. Its scientists were the first  to  identify the human natural killer cell,  thought  to play a key  role  in  the  body's destruction  of  cancer  cells.  They were also  the first  to discover  that about one-fifth of children with  leukemia have a disease or primitive  antibody forming cells, which require  more  aggressive  treatment  to  cure  that patient.  At this point, I would like to insert  my letter of inquiry to the National  Cancer Institute requesting  informa tion about how much would be  re quired to fund the cancer center core  grants at full peer reviewed levels, and  also to insert the response I received  from  the Director of  the National  Cancer Institute,  indicating that the  level of $118 million would be  re quired. It is my understanding that  this  is  an  official  letter,  cleared  through  the  appropriate  agency  review at the National Institutes of  Health.  I thank the Senator from Florida for  his  excellent  leadership  on  this  matter.  The letter follows:  NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,  NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,  Bethesda, MD, July 29, 1987.  Hon. HOWELL HEFLIN,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  of  the  latest  DEAR SENATOR HEFLIN: Thank YOU for your  recent letter expressing interest in the Na tional Cancer Institute <NCI>, particularly  the  Institute's Cancer Centers Program.  The centers are an integral part of the total  NCI program, which I would like to describe  in some detail before answering your specif ic questions.  As you are aware, the NCI has set as a  goal for the year 2000 a 50 percent reduc tion in the cancer mortality rate. Three spe cific areas must be addressed directly  to  meet this objective:  Cancer prevention through smoking pre vention and cessation and dietary modifica tion;  Early cancer detection through effective  screening programs; and  Widespread  application  cancer treatment regimens.  Successful attainment of these three ob jectives  is dependent upon a network of  cancer control resources as mandated by the  National Cancer Act of 1971-resources that  I am pleased to say are in place. Cancer cen ters are a critical component of this net work, together with other programs such as  the Clinical Cooperative Groups and their  outreach  programs  and  the Community  Clinical Oncology Program. Linking these  resources to community practice is the Phy sician Data Query <PDQ) system, a user friendly, computerized database  that pro vides information on the latest cancer treat ment and protocol studies to physicians and  health professionals. Finally, the impact of  this resource network on the nation is meas ured through our Surveillance, Epidemiolo gy,  and End Results  (SEER>  program,  which tracks cancer incidence, survival, and  mortality in the U.S. population. This NCI  network provides the balance between basic  cancer research and the clinical application  of research findings. Support for the Cancer  Centers Program is an important ingredient  in maintaining such a balance.  The specific  information you  requested  concerning funding for the cancer centers is  as follows:  The FY 1988 President's Budget reflects a  budget consistent with FY 1987 levels, with  the exception of  increases  for AIDS  re search and Federal personnel adjustments,  as well as the elimination of the Institute's  construction funds;  The President's Budget for FY 1988 for  centers is $93.2 million. The NCI anticipates  being able  to support competing renewal  centers at approximately 60 percent of the  estimated peer-reviewed approved  level as  well as funding the non-competing continu ation center grants in a manner consistent  with their FY 1987 awards. Although the  mix of cancer centers changes as a result of  peer review, the number of current centers  will not increase under the President's re quest:  To fund the existing competing renewal  centers at the peer-reviewed approved level  would require an additional $11.6 million;  $8.6 million would restore ongoing cancer  center awards that previously have been re duced; and $5.0 million is the projected re quirement  to support five new competing  centers. These components total $25.2 mil lion over the President's request for $93.2  million, for a total of $118.4 million.  I appreciate your support of the Cancer  Centers Program. Please let me know if I  can provide additional information.  Sincerely,  VINCENT T. DEVITA, JR., M.D.,  Director, National Cancer Institute.  U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON AGRI CULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FOREST RY,  Washington, DC, July 14, 1987.  VINCENT DEVITA, M.D.,  Director,  National Cancer Institute,  Bethesda, MD.  DEAR DR. DEVITA: As you know,  I have  been deeply concerned about the low level  of funding for cancer centers for the past  several years.  In the Senate Appropriations Bill report  for  the last several years,  the Appropria tions Committee has called for full funding  at peer  reviewed approved  levels  for all  cancer centers, including new grant applica tions and renewal grant applications.  The Appropriations Committee this year  heard  from  the Association of American  Cancer Institutes (please find Dr. Potter's  testimony attached) which  testimony was  supported by witnesses  representing  the  American Society of Clinical Oncology and  the National Coalition for Cancer Research  which  indicated  their very grave concern  about the small levels of increases given for  cancer center funding over the past five  years.  I intend to attempt to increase appropria tions levels for cancer centers, but in order  to do so in an appropriate fashion I will  need the following information from you:  How much additional  funding  in Fiscal  Year 1988 would be required in the cancer  centers funding line to obtain full funding  at peer reviewed levels for both new and re newal grants?  I need this information not only in numer ical form but additionally would appreciate  any explanatory material you could provide  as to the serious nature of the underfunding  in recent years, and any particular points  that you would like to make about the fund ing that would be required.

1226,474,20,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, on  Friday, October 9, 1987, Clare Boothe  Luce, a powerful,  intelligent, and ac complished woman in American histo ry, died at the age of 84. Ambassador  Luce was one of the most respected  and admired women of the 20th centu ry, and she was also a very dear friend.  Ambassador Luce possessed a unique  combination of brilliance and drive  which enabled her to succeed in posi tions that, during her early years in  public service, were traditionally occu pied by men. She served as Ambassa dor to Italy under President Eisenhow er and as a two term Congresswoman  from Connecticut. Her actions paved  the way  for many of  the advances  women have achieved in the public as  well as the private sector.  Clare Boothe Luce was as charming  as she was unpredictable. She was an  individual in every sense of the word,  one who defined her goals and applied  undaunted determination  to achieve  them. She  lived  life  to  its  fullest,  achieving recognition in a variety of  fields. From her early position as a  young  ""Vanity Fair""  editor  to her  recent position as a Reagan appointee  to  the Foreign Intelligence Advisory  Board and consultant to tl\e National  Security Council, Ambassador Luce  worked hard, served well, and earned  the abiding respect of those who knew  her.  It  is a  source of pride  for many  South Carolinians that Mr. and Mrs.  Henry Luce donated a beautiful estate  in South Carolina to be used as a mon astery. The  town  surrounding  this  area has become known as Moncks  Comer. We are very grateful for her  philanthropy.  She will be remembered as much for  who she was as for what she accom plished. We  are  saddened  by  her  death, and Nancy and I join with my  colleagues in extending deepest sym pathy to her family.  Mr. President, I was pleased to have  the opportunity today to attend a me morial service for Ambassador Luce at  the church of Saint Stephen Martyr.  It was a fitting tribute to a remarkable  woman.

1227,487,20,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President,  the  SDI Program has turned a significant  corner. Last month, Secretary of De fense Weinberger  decided  that  six  technologies  in SDI were  ready  to  move from a  research into a  testing  stage, termed ""validation and demon stration,"" looking toward the deploy ment of a two-tier nationwide ballistic  defense, termed phase 1 by the Star  Wars office. Phase 1 would by design  only be intended to stop less than 20  percent of Soviet strategic missiles. As  a result, it cannot protect our popula tion  should  any nuclear war  take  place, but is merely part of a general  strategy  of  deterring  nuclear war.  Still, even with this limited goal, the  forward movement of phase 1 poten tially represents the most fundamen tal shift in national defense strategy  since the Soviet Union first developed  nuclear weapons.  There  are many  questions  about  phase  1 which must  be  answered  before we hurtle toward deployment  of such systems, including such funda mentals as whether partial defenses  against nuclear missiles could increase  the risk that a nuclear war might take  place. But without reaching such fun damental  issues, we  should be cau tioned by what some of the Nation's  physicists  are  telling us  about  the  limits of  some of  the  technologies  being developed  for  the Star Wars  Program for phase 1.  To be specific, we are being told un equivocally by physicists  from Har vard and Princeton that space based  interceptors, such as are at the heart  of phase 1 development, cannot be  cost effective.  In a paper recently completed by  David Spergel of Princeton's Institute  for Advanced Study and George Field,  of Harvard's Department of Astrono my,  the authors conclude  that  the  United States will have  to spend at  least $3  for space based interceptors  for every $1 the Soviet Union spends  on new missiles. Moreover, the authors  have concluded that it would cost the  United States $8  to $70  to counter  every $1  the Soviet Union spends on  fast-burn  ICBM's,  and  that  space  based  interceptors would be useless  against Soviet missiles with burn times  of less than 60 seconds.  As  the authors note,  this  system  would therefore fail to meet the crite ria,  first enunciated by Ambassador  Paul Nitze,  that phase 1 of SDI be  cost-effective-as well  as  survival before it could be deployed.  These  scientists  noted  that  even  these  unfavorable  results  were  reached through making assumptions  that were favorable to the defense based on assumptions that space-based  interceptors would be 90-percent effec tive  in killing their assigned targets,  and assuming that the Soviets adopted  no countermeasures that would allow  its missile ..  to evade the space-based  interceptors. For example, the model  ignored the possibility that the Soviets  could locate all of their missiles at one  site,  increasing the absentee ratio of  space-based interceptors by a factor of  3,  trebling the cost of the defensive  system by  trebling  the number of  space-based platforms required.  Nevertheless, the scientists conclud ed that the boost-phase defense advo cated for phase 1 would not be cost ef fective against SS-24's or SS-25's, and  would  be  even  less  cost  effective  against fast-burn boosters and totally  ineffective against boosters with burn  times of less than 65 seconds.  As the scientists concluded, deploy ment of space-based interceptors such  as contemplated by phase 1,  ""could  result in an arms race that is economi cally  unfavorable  to  the  United  States.""  I ask that the text of the article by  David Spergel of the School of Natu ral Science,  Institute  for Advanced  Study, Princeton, and George B. Field,  of the Department of Astronomy, Har vard University, be printed in full in  the RECORD.  The material follows:  ARE SPACE .BASED INTERCEPTORS COST  EFFECTIVE?  <David N. Spergel and George B. Field)  ABSTRACT  Space-based interceptors <SBis> advocated  by the Marshall Institute as weapons form ing the first tier of a ballsitic missile defense  system are not cost effective against Soviet  deployment of either  their new missiles  <SS-24 and SS-25) or fast-bum missiles. The  U.S. will have to spend at least $3 for SBis  for every $1 the Soviet Union spends on new  SS-25s. It will cost the U.S. at least $8-$70  to counter every $1 the U.S.S.R. spends on  fast-bum ICBMs. SBis are completely use less against  ICBMs with bum  times  less  than 60 seconds.  There has been growing discussion of the  early deployment of SDI  (""Star Wars"")  weapons based on current technologies. A  recent report by the Marshall Institute <1>  discusses  the near-term deployment of a  three-layered system. The first layer attacks  the ICBMs in their boost phase with space  based kinetic kill vehicles <SBKKVs or more  simply  space  based  interceptors  [SBisJ ).  The SBis would be deployed on satellites in  a 7-year program beginning  in 1994. The  second <ERIS)  layer consists of ground based kinetic energy weapons that attack  warheads at the end of midcourse. The ter",1987

1231,526,20,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Chairman, I  would like to thank the gentleman for  yielding  time  to me  to discuss  this  issue. Many of us, over the past few  weeks and months have been attempt ing to educate the Members of this  body on the dangers of H.R. 162 and  the merits of the Henry-Jeffords sub stitute. I would like to expound two of  these points at this time.  While there are many problems with  H.R. 162, my main concern is the anti competitive  impact  this  bill would  have on small businesses. As a small  businessman, I understand how vital  the small business community is to the  strength and economic well-being of  this Nation. Last year, small business es provided a livelihood for over half  our population and jobs for 45 percent  of our Nation's total nonfarm work force. Simply put, this meant jobs for  45 million Americans. Put another  way,  jobs provided by small business  were 10 times greater than all the jobs  in  the Federal Government  and  3  times greater than the total number of  jobs of the Fortune 500. Last year,  small businesses also produced 39 per cent of our gross national product.  This translated to $1,400 billion  Small business is vital to the well being of our national economy. I think  few Members of this body understand  how vital. Certainly  the authors of  H.R. 162 do not. Let me describe one  provision of the bill.  ",1987

The bill, H.R. 162,  in  its present  form has been under study by  the  committee and these amendments at  the request and following  the usual  procedure, we have been very sensitive  and responsive to requests and these  amendments have already been ap proved by  the committee chairmen  and we would join with the requested  amendments.  One amendent would be to allow in dividual companies to apply for an ex emption from the high risk notifica tion process.  Another amendment would be  to  have  strengthened  requirements  for  the medical removal provisions of the  bill.  Another amendment would provide  legal protection  against malpractice  for doctors who make a good faith de termination that a worker should be  removed or transferred in his job.  Another  amendment  which  we  would submit would be pointed toward  duplicating medical monitoring pro grams that are in existence in other  agencies.  Another amendment would be  the  Risk Assessment Board which would  have the ability to limit notification to  the period of latency associated with  the disease.  There are several technical amend ments. We have two amendments that  are agreed to and would be sponsored  by  the gentlewoman from Maryland  involving exemptions for small busi. nesses with 15 or fewer full-time em ployees from the medical removal pro visions of the bill, and also an amend ment that will be sponsored by  the  gentleman from North Carolina [Mr.  RosE], where  seasonal  agricultural  workers would be exempt from  the  medical removal provisions of the bill  as long as they have not worked for  the same employer continuously for  six months.  Now,  these  amendments  will  strengthen the bill. We feel they are  amendments that the majority would  support.  Mr. Chairman,  let me say  this  in  closing,  if  I may. Many statements  were made on the floor of the House  in what H.R. 162 does or does not do. I  heard one of our colleagues over there  state that one of his employees got re moved from a particular job because  he was exposed to some substance or  process or chemical or an agent, that  he would be losing $40,000 a year, or  $20,000 a year.  .  The bill is very, very specific. If you  are exposed or transferred and you do  not have a  job, your workman's com pensation  is  reduced  and  deducted  from  anything  that you would be  making or not making or changing to  another  job or being removed from  your particular job.  ",1987
1233,539,20,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today to  lend my  full support  for H.R. 162,  the High  Risk Occupational Disease Notification and  Prevention Act of 1987 and  to urge my col leagues  to  reject  the Jeffords-Henry substi tute.  One only has to study the statistics associ ated with occupational mortality and disease  rates  to determine the need  for this  legisla tion. Every year it is estimated that 11 million  American workers  come  into  contact with  known or suspected  toxins  in  their place of  work. Of that number,  it is believed that ap proximately 1 00,000 will die and 350,000 will  become disabled. According  to a Labor De partment study, the cost of these fatalities and  disabilities to the American  taxpayer through  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid  is  $5¥2 billion annually.  However, as is so often the case, statistics  only tell a part of the story because there is  no way to quantify the real life experience of  people. I have received a great deal of materi al  in support and  in opposition of H.R. 162.  Among the statistics, impact studies, opinions  and articles  I have come across real-life ac counts of people who  loved and devoted a  lifetime to their work. These accounts included  teachers, firefighters, and policemen, to name  just a few of the job classifications that were  brought to my attention in support of this bill.  What especially  impressed me was  that  these people did not have regrets about their  chosen occupation nor did  they  feel  ill-will  toward their employers. They were simply sad dened  that  their occupations brought  them  into contact, unbeknownst to them, with mate rials that eventually made them very sick and  they felt that it was time for there to be a co herent national policy to deal with  this prob lem. I agree and that is why I am a cosponsor  of this bill.  I believe  that H.R. 162 goes a  long way  toward realizing this goal. This bill calls for the  creation of a Federal Risk Assessment Board  which would notify workers of the risk of occu pationally related disease and would counsel  and  inform them of medical surveillance pro grams specific to their risk category. H.R. 162  also provides for ongoing monitoring of work ers whose  jobs expose  them  to hazardous  substances. Finally,  this  legislation provides  for a national research and educational effort  to  learn more about the dangerousness and  effects of  the  innumerable substances with  which American workers come into contact.  H.R. 162 is not antibusiness or fiscally irre sponsible. One only has to look at the list of  the corporations who are on record as in favor  of this bill to realize that it is not designed to  blame American  business  for occupational  diseases. In fact, H.R. 162 is totally neutral on  the  issue of  liability. Moreover, at a cost of  only $25 million per annum, it will more than  pay for itself in savings in Medicare, Medicaid,  and Social Security payments.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge the passage of H.R.  162.  ",1987
1234,539,20,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 162, the High Risk Occupa tional Disease Notification and Prevention Act,  and would  like to commend the chairman of  the Committee on Education and Labor  for  bringing  this much needed  legislation before  us today.  While there is much controversy surround ing H.R. 162, in view of the fact that approxi mately  100,000  workers  die  and  some  340,000 more are disabled each year from oc cupational diseases caused by exposure  to  the toxic substances in commercial and indus trial use, I believe that we would be derelict in  our duty to the working men and women of  this country if we did not pass this legislation.  This is especially true because effective treat ment of diseases resulting  from exposure  to  hazardous materials depends on early detec tion and  treatment and because presently,  Federal regulations do not require employers  to inform workers of their risk of disease from  exposure to specific substances.  H.R. 162 provides for the scientific identifi cation of those workers with a high risk of de veloping  fatal or disabling occupational dis eases,  the notification of these workers and  the subsequent monitoring for such diseases.  These procedures will help to ensure the early  detection of occupational diseases and,  in  turn, will permit  the most effective medical  treatment for those affected. Additionally, they  will encourage changes  in affected workers'  lifestyles that might further reduce  the  likeli hood or severity of disabilities. Provisions of  H.R. 162 will also facilitate the establishment  of advanced warning systems for workers and  will encourage workers to avoid exposure to  dangerous levels of hazardous substances.  Many have expressed concerns in regard to  the costs of this legislation which authorizes a  modest $25 million per year for its program.  However, at this point in time, businesses lose  between $1.7 billion and $4.3 billion because  of occupational disease. The Federal Govern ment now spends approximately $5.4 billion  per  year  for  occupational  diseases  under  Social Security Disability Income, Supplemen tal Security Income, Medicaid and Medicare. If  enactment of the bill results in only a small re duction in disease resulting from occupational  hazards, the bill will more than pay for itself.  In regard  to costs that might be incurred by  employers, many of the costs required under  the bill are already  incurred by employers in  complying with existing OSHA requirements.  Finally, opponents of H.R. 162 argue  that  the bill will  result  in huge  litigation costs for  employers because of emotional stress liability  suits brought as a result of the risk notification  program. That is not the case because the bill  specifically prohibits the use of determinations  or actions under the bill as a basis for com pensation, loss or damage claims.  To reiterate, I strongly support enactment of  H.R. 162 and urge my colleagues to support  this worthwhile and much needed legislation.  ",1987
1235,539,20,Mr.  BUNNING.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  strong opposition  to  the risk notification bill,  H.R. 162.  ",1987
1236,552,20,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1987
1237,552,20,Mr. HENRY., I would be pleased to  yield to the gentleman from Texas.  ,1987
1238,552,20,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding to  me.  I do want to make sure that the gen tleman gets on  record  that earlier  during  the debate  of  the Augusta  Chemical notification, and that is the  only notification that has been a Gov ernment notification, although there  have been in the whole country two  other employer-based notifications, we  seem to have lost track of the signifi cance of that.  The significance of that was in the  notification of 800-some-odd workers  and ex-workers, there were 7 that al ready contracted, as I recall, cancer of  the bladder, and 7 more  that were  screened and identified for it.  Of  those 14  actual medical diag noses, though, there is no dispute that  there were 170 cases or lawsuits filed,  and 120 claims actually paid, so the  company actually paid out in this lim ited circumstance, actually paid out  120 claims against only 14 medically  diagnosed cases of that particular oc cupational disease.  ",1987
1239,552,20,Mr. HENRY.," The gentleman is cor rect, and that is also again one of the  failings of the committee bill.  The committee bill precludes consid erations of such things as behaviors  and lifestyles. We found in the case of  the GM patternmakers,  in  that  in stance the final disposition of that co operative effort between Government,  management, and the union was final  conclusion  that  in fact  the diseases  being experienced on that line were  not in fact occupationally related but  behaviorally related.  ",1987
1240,552,20,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr. Chairman, if  the gentleman will continue to yield,  in addition, as I understand the com mittee bill which the gentleman has  an excellent substitute for, in the com mittee bill,  even  though  the actual  notice cannot be used  in a court of  law, all the facts behind that notice  and the fact of the notice not only can  be used but it is  likely it would be  used.  ",1987
1241,552,20,Mr. HENRY.," The gentleman is cor rect, and that is the problem. That is  why the business and insurance, and  even  the  legal community, warn us  about the fact that the liability costs  potentially overwhelm all  the other  aspects and costs of this legislation.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from  Michigan  [Mr.  HENRY] has expired.  ",1987
1242,552,20,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1987
1243,552,20,Mr. HENRY.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.  ",1987
1244,552,20,Mr.  RITTER.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding to  me.  I would like to get back to the Au gusta Chemical situation. That notifi cation situation was based on a very  rigorous set of guidelines; it had guide lines such as  the duration and  the  level of exposures.  There was  an  accepted  screening  process for evaluating the effect of the  exposure once you knew  that there  was such an exposure; also there was a  surgical technique available to reverse  the impact of harmful exposure.  Just think about this. All the Risk  Assessment Board needs  is a  report  saying that there is a statistically valid  difference  between  the  background  level of people who are going to get  cancer of a certain type and those who  have been exposed to a certain type of  chemical for notification to proceed.  It does not say anything about a  screening method  available,  or  the  possibility  of medical  procedure  to  intercept the disease.  If one compares H.R. 162 with a situ ation which was very definite using all  of the criteria mentioned above, it still  resulted  in 171  lawsuits out of 849  cases-20 percent. Say we hold to the  20 percent, and if there are millions  notified,  the 20 percent means hun dreds of thousands of lawsuits. This  country is presently bending beneath  the weight of litigation.  We do not need a major new poten tial for litigation.  ",1987
1245,552,20,Mrs. BYRON.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the substitute.  First of all, let me say if the Jeffords  substitute goes down in defeat, I want  to go on record that I plan to offer an  amendment that I have that would  exempt small businesses of up to 15  employees from the medical removal  provision of H.R. 162, if the company  has made a good-faith effort to pre vent occupational exposure.  The bill as it stands would now re quire employer payment of up to 12  months' pay and benefits to employees  who must be removed from a job when  the transfer cannot be arranged, re gardless of the number of jobs that an  employer is able to provide.  When a business has fewer than 15  employees,  the possibility of an em ployee's transfer is significantly limit ed. How can it be expected that a busi ness with so few employees should be  able to create an extra space to accom modate an employee's transfer?  Fifteen is the number that has been  used in the past as a cutoff for small  businesses. I do not think in this day  and age a 15-employee business is a  small business. I think more in the re alistic area is 50, but 15 is the number  that has been used; and I have been  advised that it has been used already  in existing OSHA regulations, in civil  rights legislation.  There  never  can  be  a  magical  number of what a small business can  be to be protected. I feel that 15 is a  number which the majority can live  with.  I feel that businesses should, under  all  possible  circumstances,  afford  proper notification and medical  re moval opportunities to qualifying em ployees. I do not feel, however, that  this should take place when the busi ness is so small in size as to render the  transfer of an employee to another po sition, comparable in pay and benefits,  an impossibility.  Should an employer transfer an em ployee  in order  to met his or her  health needs? Yes, of course. In the  case of an employer with so few em ployees, such a transfer would threat en the operation of the business, as it  would for a company of 15 and fewer  employees, then I feel that an exemp tion is in order.  Somebody asked me what the com mittee feels on this, and it is my un derstanding  that they feel  this  is a  friendly amendment.  0 1515  I want to go on record stating that if  the  Jeffords  substitute  goes  down,  that amendment will be offered by  this Member.

1249,578,20,Mr. HANSEN.," Mr. Speaker, with the  onset of the 30 degree weather, I am  reminded that the cold and flu season  will soon be upon us. Even though a  cure has not been discovered for the  common cold, we are continually bom barded with advertisements promising  relief. Because we have no other re course, we generally will run to  the  corner drugstore and buy an assort ment of over-the-counter drugs to get  some relief from our aches and pains.  Collectively, we have probably taken  millions of aspirin, swallowed pounds  of throat lozenges, and drunk gallons  of cough syrup.  I would venture to say that most of  us do not have a difficult time follow ing the directive on a bottle of aspirin  or cough syrup that tells us when to  discontinue its use-an indicator that  it is no longer effective or needed.  In this body, we are having a diffi cult time discontinuing the use of the  Davis-Bacon Act, even after 50 years.  Instead of saying enough is enough,  we have increased the dosage.

1253,604,20,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, on July 29 and  August 2-5, a series of articles by John S.  Long appeared in the Cleveland Plain Dealer  entitled,  ""The High Price of Defense."" Mr.  Long's excellent investigative reporting provid ed an eye-opening account of the misuse of  taxpayers' money and points to the need for  long overdue reform.  As reported in the Plain Dealer:  LEGAL FEES  Defense  contractors accused of  criminal  fraud but not convicted have been permitted  to bill the Federal Government for millions of  dollars in  legal  fees and have also been al lowed to add an additional fee for corporate  profits;  these  fees are charged as  indirect  costs  in  the companies' overhead accounts  and amount to tens of millions of dollars.  COST OF DOING BUSINESS  Defense contractors' prices are  raised  to  unrealistic  levels, and are  included as  the  ""costs of doing business."" The Government  pays for all the costs the company incurs sell ing the weapons, the company's research and  development and manufacturing,  and  then  guarantees the company a profit. Even when  companies use Government buildings,  funds,  and  equipment,  the design  plans  become  property of the defense contractor.  CONTRACTOR-PENTAGON COLLUSION  Vague  cost estimates and  collusion be tween the Pentagon and defense contractors  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  could make it very difficult to crack down on  alleged abuses.  Because some Pentagon officials feel  that  . defense projects and new technology are so  important to national security they are willing  to overlook or ignore infractions.  Many of  the weapons systems produced  don't work, yet they are rarely canceled; pay ment for these systems is made 2 days to 1  week after the bill is submitted, even though  the  government's prompt payment act  re quires the United States to pay bills as close  as possible to 30 days after the billing. Early  payment means loss of interest payments that  could have been accrued on that money.  CORPORATE WELFARE  From one-half to nearly all of the salaries of  the  defense  contractors'  top  executives $500,000  to $1,000,000 annual  income-is  paid by the taxpayer. In addition, special sav ings accounts  and  generous pension  pro grams are paid  for by  the Government. Bo nuses  to  top executives are  included  in  the  cost of programs and help  to drive up  the  costs of-future defense projects. Benefits plus  extras are paid on the basis of percentage of  business done with the Government.  Some corporations have come to rely solely  on  the Government as a customer, and al though  the Government has helped  some  companies financially, difficult times could be  ahead due  to  the  flattening out of defense  spending.  Defense contractors are allowed to charge  the Federal Government the cost of State and  local taxes, then deduct the amount, paid by  the Federal Government,  on  their Federal  income tax statements. This allows the corpo ration to operate in a tax free environment.  PROBLEMS IN ENFORCEMENT  The Defense Contract Audit Agency [DCAA]  can only point out improper charges, not stop  them. They are often refused access to com pany documents, and even when they do find  questionable charges, military watchdogs are  left to challenge them, something they rarely  do.  While  the Pentagon provides contractors  with unlimited  funds,  the Justice Department  conducts ""scant"" investigations due to limited  funds (Gramm-Rudman). A Justice Department  source criticized Congress for not providing his  Department with enough  resources  to ade quately handle major cases against  the de fense corporations.  I have  submitted  the  first article of  series and I commend it to your attention:  [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, July 29,  1987]  the  DEFENSE CONTRACTORS BILL U.S. FOR LEGAL  FEES  <By John S. Long)  Defense contractors who are accused of  criminal fraud but not convicted have been  permitted to bill the federal government for  millions of dollars  in legal fees and have  also been allowed to add an additional fee  for corporate profit, The Plain Dealer has  learned.  The reimbursements of defense contractor  legal fees in criminal cases have been going  on for years because of a federal acquisition  regulation that has been a secret to most  people outside of the defense industry.  Because of the large number of defense  fraud cases in recent years, millions of dolOctober 11,., 1987  lars have been paid for legal defense of con tractors, while the Justice Department itself  has  conducted  bare-bones  investigations  into contractor  fraud because of  limited  funds.  While the government's investigators are  strapped for funds, the Pentagon is provid ing contractors with unlimited  funds  for  their defense,  as  long as  the contractor  avoids a guilty verdict.  ""They've cut back so much on us, we're  practically counting paper clips"" said one  Justice Department official disgusted with  the practice of subsidizing the defense con tractors' legal defense funds. ""A year ago  during Gramm-Rudman  everything was  frozen. We had no money  for  travel, no  money to conduct certain litigation, we even  ran out of money for supplies. Things are  now getting a little better,"" he added.  In one instance General Dynamics Corp.  billed the government $21 million, plus an  additional amount for corporate jury inves tigation in New Haven, Conn.  The legal fees were charged to the govern ment as  indirect costs  in  the companies'  overhead accounts. Like other overhead ac count  items permitted under  the govern ment contract regulations, a percentage is  added to the fees for corporate profit.  The investigation concerned allegations of  defrauding  the government on a contract  for  the Triden  submarine,  according  to  sources on the congressional subcommittee  on oversight and investigations headed by  Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.  The government recently dropped two ad ditional criminal fraud cases against Gener al Dynamics and congressional sources said  that as a  result taxpayers will be paying  tens of millions of dollars in legal fees for  the nation's top defense contractor.  In one  investigation  that  lasted  three  years and was dropped by the Justice De partment  last month, General Dynamics  and several company officials were indicted  for defrauding the government of $3 million  on a contract for a prototype of the Ser geant York air defense weapon.  If congressional estimates are accurate on  the amount  the defense contractor could  bill the government for its legal fees,  the  profit General Dynamics would make on  such a billing would nearly exceed the al leged $3 million in overcharges that prompt ed the criminal investigation.  The congressional sources have said Gen eral Dynamics would be refunded their legal  defense costs, plus a profit,  through con tracts the company's Pomona division has  with the Navy. Why the funds are being re imbursed  through a Navy contract, when  the investigation centered on an Army pro gram could not be explained.  A General Dynamics spokesman told The  Plain Dealer earlier  this month  that the  company had not determined the amount of  its legal fees.  In another case, the Justice Department  last year decided not to indict Pratt & Whit ney Group for allegedly overcharging the  government by $22 million on contracts at  its West Palm Beach government products  division. Congressional sources estimate the  government could end up paying millions of  dollars in Pratt & Whitney legal fees in that  case.  ""We won't get into the nitty-gritty of the  fees, but it is nowhere near millions of dol lars,"" said Bob Carroll, a Pratt & Whitney  spokesman. ""As of this time the government  has not paid for any legal expenses associat ed with the grand jury investigation. If, at a  later date, these expenses are deemed ap",1987
1254,630,20,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman,  I offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. DANNEMEYER:  Page 14, after line 18, insert the following  new subsection:  (e) DESIGNATION OF HEALTH AND EMERGEN CY  CARE  WORKERS  REQUIRED,-Notwith standing any other provision of this section,  the Board shall designate as a population at  risk those health care workers and emergen cy care workers who are at risk of occupa tional exposure to the disease known as ac quired immune deficiency syndrome or the  virus known as HTLV-III or LAV virus. The  Board shall develop the form and method of  notification and determine the appropriate  type of medical monitoring or health coun seling with respect to such population in ac cordance with subparagraphs (C) and <D> of  subsection (b)(l). The designation of such  population at risk shall be subject to notice,  comment, and  review  in accordance with  subsection (d).  Mr. DANNEMEYER  (during  the  reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unani mous consent that the amendment be  considered as read and printed in the  RECORD.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  California?  There was no objection.  ",1987
1255,630,20,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman,  the  amendment  that  this Member  from California is offering to H.R. 162  will  provide  some  guidance  to  the  health care workers of America, who  number. some 3 to 4 million, in what  protection they should be taking when  caring for those patients with AIDS in  the public health care system today. It  provides  that health and emergency  care workers be designated a popula tion at risk. This designation would re quire the Labor Board created in H.R.  162 to notify these workers and their  employees about the risk of treating  AIDS patients and how  to protect  themselves from infection.  The amendment enjoys bipartisan  support. The amendment is supported  by the International Fire Chiefs Asso, ciation. The  amendment  covers  all  health care workers  including physi cians, nurses, dentists, dental hygien ists, firefighters, emergency care work ers, and any person giving health care  to an HIV positive person.  I would like to be able to say to my  colleagues  that  the Department of  Labor, OSHA, would do this of their  own accord because they have that re sponsibility under  the  existing  law  now, but I am offering this amend ment in the direct reform that is man dating that the Department of Labor  do this work because, candidly, OSHA  has tragically faulted in their respon sibility in this regard. Earlier this year  the American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees peti tioned OSHA to take the action that I  am talking about, and OSHA has done  nothing. That  is why from a policy  standpoint it is imperative that in this  bill designating hazardous occupations  that we give some  indication to the  health care workers of how to protect  themselves.  This amendment will  ensure  that  health and emergency care workers  and employers are educated about how  to protect themselves from  infection  with the AIDS virus and other oppor tunistic diseases associated with AIDS.  We  should understand  that health  care workers are the first line of de fense in caring for AIDS carriers. Yet  health care workers in many employment settings are being forced to con tinue to care for AIDS carriers with out being permitted to take actions to  protect  themselves against  infection  with this fatal virus.  I would like to give my colleagues a  few  instances of why it is necessary  that we adopt this amendment.  The Virginia funeral directors want  the general assembly to approve legis lation that would require hospitals to  tag the bodies of AIDS victims. Offi cials at Sentara Norfolk General Hos pital, and Chesapeake General Hospi tal said confidentiality laws limit the  information they can disclose on a tag  that would alert funeral directors to  the  fact  that a deceased died  from  AIDS.  According to CDC three female hos pital workers became infected with the  HIV virus after the blood of AIDS pa tients was splashed on them. All three  health care workers experienced only  one exposure to AIDS infected blood.  Two of  the  three workers were not  wearing protective garments because  they did not know that the patients  were infected.  The Washington Post reported that  a CDC official expressed concern that  many health care workers have been  exposed  to  the AIDS virus without  knowing it.  On April 11, the CDC recommended  that dental,  surgical,  and  obstetric  health care workers use extraordinary  care to avoid becoming infected with  the AIDS virus. Gloves, masks, and  gowns were among the suggested pre cautions.  I would like to pause for a moment  here to talk about the distinction be tween guidelines and notification. A  guideline comes out from CDC  to a  hospital and it is posted on the wall.  Sometimes those are seen and some times those are not seen.  The notification that we are talking  about in this bill would go from the  agency, the Department of Labor, and  it would be mailed to the employees so  the employee would have the advan tage of getting the advice themselves.  I believe that is a big  improvement  over the idea of just sponsoring or is suing some guidelines.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from California has  ex pired.  (By unanimous consent, Mr. DANNE MEYER was allowed to proceed for 3 ad ditional minutes.)  ",1987
1256,630,20,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Chuck Fallis, a  CDC spokesman, admits that nurses  who care for AIDS patients on a long term basis are at risk of contracting  the disease.

1257,643,20,Mr. SHUMWAY.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise in op position  to H.R. 162,  the High Risk Disease  Notification and Prevention Act of 1987. If en acted, this measure would have a devastating  effect on small business.  H.R. 162 would  increase  liability exposure  and litigation, increase health insurance costs  and  raise  the cost of  labor  for small  firms.  Specifically,  it would encourage  litigation be tween employees and employers, which would  in turn increase the costs of liability insurance  and workers' compensation. The bill would  force  small  businesses  to  provide  testing,  evaluation and medical monitoring regardless  of the employer's liability for the potential ill ness. Further, the benefit reduction protection  provision would increase costs to businesses  unable to provide alternate positions for their  workers. As a result, those businesses would  be forced to provide severance pay for a full  year.  Conservative estimates  show  that  imple mention of H.R. 162 would add between 4  and 8 percent to a small company's operating  costs. Considering  that  the average  profit  margin  for a small company  is estimated at  only 2 to 3 percent, it is obvious that the bill  will have a very negative  impact on  those  companies.  According to the latest report on the state  of small business,  there are over 15 million  small businesses in the country. Over the past  6 years more than 90 percent of the new jobs  created have been  in companies with  fewer  than 20 employees. The enactment of H. R.  162 would  undoubtedly  end  that  positive  trend.  Strengthening ongoing occupational disease  prevention  programs  under  existing  laws,  rather  than creating new Federal programs  seems to me a more reasonable solution. The  existing Hazard Communication Standard es tablishes a comprehensive program of notifi cation and training of workers by their employ ers concerning chemical hazards in the work place. The regulation provides hazard informa tion  on  575,000  substances  to 32 million  workers. A separate regulation  requires em ployers to maintain records of exposure and  medical surveillance and provide this informa tion  to  their  employees.  I  believe  that  strengthening  these existing  programs and  other Occupational Safety and Health Admin istration standards provide the protection nec essary for workers, and constitute a more ap propriate, cost effective remedy.  There seems  little point  in  resolving  the  hazard problem by eradicating the jobs. Unfor tunately, in the case of small businesses, that  is exactly what H.R. 162 would do. I urge my  colleagues  to vote against this  inappropriate  measure.  ",1987
1258,643,20,Mr. FOGLIETIA.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  strong support of H.R. 162, the High Risk Oc cupational Disease Notification and Prevention  Act. This bill establishes a much needed pro gram  to  inform workers aware of the health  risks which may  result  from certain occupa tions and will provide these workers with as sistance  in preventing  these diseases  from  developing.  H.R.  162  is one of  the most  important  pieces of  legislation  that we examine  this  term. This bill will establish a Risk Assess ment Board, which will  identify groups of  workers who are at high risk of disease be cause of previous occupational exposure. The  study will isolate those groups where the inci dence of disease  is 30 percent greater than  the general work force. The program will then  notify those workers in  these occupations. It  will provide these workers with information on  the types of disease for which they are at risk,  and  the necessary actions which must be  taken. The Risk Assessment Board will also  provide this information to the family physician  of the worker.  The opponents of this bill argue that it will  set up another bureaucracy which will  further  strain our resources. This could not be farther  from  the  truth. The  fact  is  that  this bill will  save money. The annual cost of occupational  disease  to  the Federal Government  from  its  disability and health benefit programs is $5.4  billion. The annual cost to administer this pro gram is $25 million. The annual cost of occu pational disease  to business  is estimated at  between $2 and $4 billion. The cost to busi ness to administer this program  is estimated  at between $3 and $38 million. If this program  allows us to prevent even 1 percent of occu pational diseases,  it will more  than pay  for  itself.  H.R. 162 expressly prohibits the use of de terminations by  the Risk Assessment Board  as a basis for, or evidence in, compensation,  loss, or damage claims, so the argument that  this bill will cause a flood of new litigation by  workers who have been  informed  that  they  are at risk  is  false. The General Accounting  Office reviewed this bill and found no basis to  conclude that it would contribute to increased  liability or litigation.  In my opinion this is a hypocritical argument  anyway  because  if  increased  litigation  is  needed to force managers to act responsibly  in protecting the health and safety of their em ployees, and to prevent plant operators from  knowingly exposing  their workers  to hazard ous substances, then so be it.  This  legislation is long overdue.  It ensures  that our Nation's workers no  longer will be  kept in the dark but will receive the informa tion  they need to make knowledgeable deci sions about the hazards they face in the work place every day. It is a very important piece of  legislation, and I commend Chairman GA voos  and his committee on their work.  ",1987
1259,643,20,Mr. BONKER.," Mr. Chairman, as an original  cosponsor of H.R. 162, the High Risk Occupa tional Disease Notification and Prevention Act,  I  rise  in  strong  support of  the bill.  I am  pleased by the work that the Education and  Labor Committee has done in bringing this bill  to the floor.  I am aware of the considerable objections  that many businesses have to this legislation  and their concerns that this bill will cause an  epidemic of lawsuits. Certainly, it is not the in tention of Congress to cripple businesses that  involve the use of hazardous materials in their  manufacturing processes and  I believe  that  the bill has  included safeguards  to prevent  that from happening.  The most important issue, however,  is the  long-term health of workers engaged  in  jobs  that put  their health at  risk. Approximately  1 00,000 workers die and 340,000 more are  disabled each year by health problems attrib utable to exposure  to hazardous substances  at  the workplace. The subsequent costs  to  business and the Federal Government to treat  and care for these exposed workers is enor mous. I believe that the legislation drafted by  the committee-and not the substitute amend ment-takes significant steps toward reducing  the risks and limiting the problems associated  with exposure to toxic chemicals.  The bill  takes aggressive steps to  identify,  monitor, and treat the health effects associat ed with occupational exposure  to hazardous  materials. Health hazards would be  identified  by a newly created Risk Assessment Board  which will review clinical and epidemiological  studies for significant evidence of health risks.  Notification  would  be  given  to  worker  groups by  the National  Institute for Occupa tional Safety and Health  [NIOSH). Through  NIOSH, high-risk workers would be given  in formation about  the nature of the risk, what  diseases are associated with exposure, and  be given advice for how their health should be  monitored for early detection of any illness.  At the present time, current workers benefit  from  information about  toxic materials sup plied  under  the Occupational  Safety  and  Health Administration's  [OSHA]  recently  im plemented Hazard Communication  [HazCom]  Standard. HazCom requires employers to train  workers in safe handling of hazardous materi als,  label hazardous materials as such, and  provide so-called material safety data sheets  outlining  permissible  exposure  levels  and  health effects.  This  is an  important but  incomplete step.  Unlike H.R. 162,  it makes no contribution to  ensuring the  long-term health of the employ ee.  If we are sincere in our efforts to protect  workers  from chronic health problems which  ",1987

1262,656,20,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, today,  October 15, 1987, has been designated  by  the President as National Safety  Belt Use Day. It is a very special day  for  thousands of  individuals whose  lives have been saved, or who have  avoided substantial  injuries,  through  the prudent use of safety belts. It also  is a very special day for the many law  enforcement, safety, automotive, edu cation,  insurance and public interest  organizations who have supported nu merous efforts to promote safety belt  use and to increase the public's aware ness of the advantages of ""buckling  up.""  I wish to thank Congressman DYM ALLY,  Congressman  FORD,  and  the  House leadership for helping to expe dite the passage on September 15 of  House Joint Resolution 338, the reso lution my good friend and colleague,  Congressman Bun SHUSTER and I  in troduced requesting the President to  designate October  15  as  ""National  Safety Belt Use Day."" I also want to  thank  all  of my  friends  and  col leagues-some 254 Members-who co sponsored and supported House Joint  Resolution 338, which was a  signifi cant factor in enabling the President  to sign this important resolution.  Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues,  including myself, have been involved  in automobile accidents were safety  belts have proven the difference be tween life and death. According to the  National Highway Traffic Safety Ad ministration, the probability of being  involved in a motor vehicle injury acci dent during a 75-year lifetime is better  than 86 percent. NHTSA also has pro vided some startling facts about auto mobile related fatalities and injuries:  Approximately 3,528,000 people were  injured in traffic injuries in 1985;  There were 23,192 passenger car fa talities and 5,763 light truck fatalities  in 1985;  On average one life is lost every 12  minutes in traffic accidents;  In 1985, 91 percent of the occupants  killed in auto accidents were not wear ing their safety belts;  Unrestrained automobile occupants  were 40 percent more likely to be in jured in an auto accident and twice as  likely to require hospitalization as re strained occupants;  Mr. Speaker, the facts on the record  demonstrate  that  safety belts  save  lives and prevent injuries. In the past  few years more than half our Nation's  State legislatures have made substan tial progress  in enacting mandatory  seatbelt use laws. Since 1984, 29 States  and the District of Columbia have en acted mandatory safety belt use laws.  Each of these laws has the objective  of  reducing deaths  and  injuries  in  motor vehicle crashes. The fact is that  virtually every study produced on the  effects of increased belt use indicates  that lap and shoulder safety belts can  reduce  the  risk of  fatal or  serious  injury by between 45 and 55 percent.  These laws work. Safety belt use has  dramatically  increased.  Currently,  safety belt use in States that have en acted belt use laws averages about 45  percent,  ranging from 78 percent  in  North  Carolina  to  23  percent  in  Kansas.  The U.S. Department of Transporta tion's Center for Statistics and Analy sis has documented the success of in creased safety belt use  in  terms of  lives saved and injuries prevented:  Among front seat passenger vehicle  occupants,  safety belts  saved  about  2,200  lives  in 1986-1,750  in States  with belt use laws;  Among front seat passenger vehicle  occupants,  safety  belts  prevented  about 25,000 moderate to critical inju ries in 1986, 20,000 in States with belt  use laws;  At the current use level in belt law  States-45 percent-belts would have  saved 3,100 lives if all States had belt  laws in 1986;  At the high use  levels achieved in  some  other  countries-85  percent belts could have saved 10,000 lives if  all States had belt laws in 1986.  The  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety Administration also  indicates  that safety belt use has dramatically  increased since 1982. NHTSA's yearly  national safety belt use survey of 19  cities has documented a safety belt use  rate increase from 11 percent in 1982  to 42 percent in the first half of 1987.  An  interesting fact  in  this survey  was that among the seven cities with out belt laws, belt use was only 27 per cent. Among  the 12 cities with belt  laws in effect, belt use was 51 percent.  An impqrtant aspect of safety belt  use that cannot be overlooked is child  safety  seats  in  passenger  vehicles.  These statistics are worth looking at.

1270,695,20,Mr. BURDICK.," Mr. President, I rise  in strong support of this amendment,  to  set  the  records  straight on  an  aspect of the clean water bill passed  earlier this year. There seems to be  some confusion in the administration  regarding  the State Revolving Fund  Program.  This  program  provides  States with funds to assist communi ties in construction of sewage  treat ment works. The program was enacted  as part of the Clean Water Act amend ments with  overwhelming  support  from Congress and over the objections  of the President.  The Administrator announced  last  month that, in lieu of cash payments  for State capitalization grants, letters  of credit will be issued to States. This  is a clear misinterpretation of the stat ute. The effect of  this policy  is  to  withhold funds from the States that  otherwise would be building interest  and  adding  strength  to  their  pro grams. I remind my colleagues of the  importance  of  the State Revolving  Fund Program. With enactment of the  Water Quality Act amendments, Con gress began  the process of  turning  total  responsibility  for  the  sewage  treatment program over to the States.  By 1995, States will have to rely on  their own funding mechanisms to pay  for sewage treatment rather than con tinued grants from the Federal Gov ernment. The Revolving Loan Fund  Program was set up to give States the  resource they need to carry out that  responsibility.  The administration's policy seriously  undermines  the  intent and letter of  the law. By one estimate the letter of  credit policy could cost lost earnings  equal  to 20 percent of each State's  Federal capitalization. I attempted to  redress  this problem  in  report  lan guage I offered to the bill during com mittee consideration. This amendment  goes one step further in making it ab solutely clear that any payments made  after September 30, 1988, shall be in  cash. I understand that the manager  of the bill is aware of the problem and  willing to accept the amendment.  ",1987
1271,695,20,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, al though  I do not  intend  to ask  the  Senate  for  a  rollcall  vote  on  the  amendment, the Senate should know  that over the next 10 years this will  cost the Federal Government an extra  $3 billion. It is nothing this year, but  over the next 10 years, $3 billion. This  is because a quarterly cash payment  schedule would  require  the Federal  Government  to  disburse  the  funds  much earlier than they would under  the Federal credit arrangement pres ently being followed.  There  is  an enormous amount of  money involved here and the interest  lost to the Federal Government under  our best calculations would be $3 bil lion. Nevertheless, I know there is a  great sentiment for it.  We just had an amendment which I  opposed which went to a rollcall vote.  There were exactly two votes against  it. I am willing to accept the amend ment, Mr. President.  ",1987
1272,695,20,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to support the amendment of fered by my good  friend  from New  York. Like him, I am concerned about  the method of payments to State re volving  fund programs  for pollution  control  construction  grants. While  report language in this bill calls for  these payments to be made in cash, ef forts are being made to change these  payments to letters of credit.  My colleagues will  recall  that  the  Water Quality Act of 1987 created the  State water pollution control revolving  funds. These  funds are designed  to  provide grants for the construction of  municipal wastewater treatment facili ties and water quality management  programs. These grants help to elimi nate the discharge of untreated or in adequately treated waste into our wa terways.  I believe all my colleagues  will agree that this program addresses  a pressing need.  Mr. President, these grants are made  at the State level with funds provided  to the State from the Environmental  Protection Agency. Payments to  the  States were  intended  to be made  in  cash, allowing States to accrue interest  on their revolving funds. This interest  could be used  to provide additional  support for construction grants. How ever,  the Office of Management and  Budget has  recommended  that  the  EPA provide letters of credit in lieu of  cash payments. Mr. President, I ada mantly oppose this policy.  The Water Quality Act of 1987 did  not  intend  for  the EPA  to extend  credit to the States for construction  grants. I sight section 601(b) of the act  which establishes:  The Administrator of the EPA and each  State shall jointly establish a schedule of  payments under which  the Administrator  will pay to the State the amount of each  grant to be made to the State.  I do not believe, and again I think  my colleagues will agree, that this lan guage intends for letters of credit as a  payment method. To my home State  of Tennessee,  this schedule of pay ments means cash payments.  Tennessee has been one of the first  States  to apply  for  these  revolving  funds. I understand that Connecticut,  Texas, and Virginia have also made  initial applications for these funds. It  seems  to me  that  these States, by  being ahead of the curve on implemen tation of the new guidelines, are being  unfairly penalized. They have recog nized their pollution sources and have  found a means of addressing  them.  However, they are now being told they  may only receive letters of credit. Mr.  President, this is not the direction in  which we should be moving to address  our water quality problems.  In Tennessee,  these problems have  become  increasingly worse over  the  past several years. Water pollution is  affecting the fishing industry, recrea tion on our  lakes and streams, and  most importantly our drinking water  supplies. The revolving fund makes it  possible for Tennessee, as well as all  other States,  to  immediately address  these water problems through munici pal grants for pollution control.  Mr. President,  for  the country  to  adequately address the water quality  problems which we face, it is impera tive that payments to these revolving  funds be made in cash. This is the cur rent recommendation in the bill lan guage, and I feel that we must show  ",1987

1275,708,20,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President,  I cer tainly associate myself with  the  re marks of  the distinguished Senator  from Alabama  and  other  remarks  made on the floor with regard to the  attempt to take money away from the  space station to provide money for vet erans medical care.  I oppose it not because I am against  the vete:r:ans. I am a veteran myself, as  many Members of  this body are.  I  think I have an absolute, impeccable,  first-rate, record regarding support for  veteran rights activities and support  for veterans hospitals. We have sever al major installations in my State that  do an amazingly good job even when  faced with a lack of funding in taking  care of  those who have borne  the  burden of war and to whom we owe a  debt of gratitude.  We  try to carry that out through  the money we have  in Veterans' Af fairs and I have supported that abso lutely and unequivocally through my  years  in  the Senate, not because  I  think it is something that is nice to  have in the budget for political rea sons, but because I absolutely and un equivocally believe  in it with all my  heart.  I know what some of our veterans  have sacrificed and accomplished. The  least we can do is take care of their  problems when  they  reach  a  time  when they too need help.  But to see the space station as the  only source of funding for  increased  funding for veteran's medical care is  just flat wrong.  This country became what it is for a  couple of very good reasons. One, we  decided  to educate our people more  than any other nation in history. And  we said that education in this country  was not to be just for the kids from  the castle. It was not to be just for the  rich kids. It was not to be just for the  politically  well-educated.  Education  was to be for everyone. And I  think  even to this day we have an education  system that gives a better education  than any nation in this world.  And second, what has helped  this  Nation  to develop better  than any  nation in the history of this world has  been our willingness to put more of  our gross national product back into  basic, fundamental, breakthrough re search  to conquer  the unknown,  to  push back those frontiers, and to exer cise the curiosity that came out of our  educated citizenry.  Now, our support for this research  expresses itself in many ways. Some of  our companies put money  into-and  bless  them  for doing  it-the basic,  long-term research. Not only the basic,  but the long term, the 5-, 8-, 15-year  projects that Bell Labs, Monsanto, 3M,  AT&T, DuPont, and some other com panies undertake.  But basic research in this country  has not come from  just the private  sector, which  the President would  have us believe. He has said  in  the  past that if research is worth doing,  private  research will do  it. Unfortu nately, that has not been the histori cal pattern that built this Nation of  ours into what we are today.  Most of the basic, fundamental re search in our country has come from  Government-sponsored  research.  There are a dozen or so major national  labs that are the envy of the rest of  the free world. And the basic research  we have supported as a Federal Gov ernment, representing all of our States  together, and at the various colleges  and universities around our country,  that combination  of  education and  basic research has been what has led  us to be the No. 1 nation in this world.  And what does being No.1 do for us?  It does not mean we wave our finger in  the air and say: ""We're No. 1. We're  No.  1,""  like we do after a  football  game. We are proud of being No.1 be cause it gives us the option of control ling our own future.  We are the ones that create new jobs  and business and industry. We are the  ones that have different areas of re search come  together  in a coherent  pattern.  Now, we are talking today about the  space station. Will we support it or  not?  Research done  in space  is  in  the  forefront of technological innovation.  There  are  those who  rise  in  this  Chamber on occasion-too often, by  my way of thinking-and decry any thing that has  to do with research.  They  ridicule  it. They  lambaste  it.  They try to cut its funding. And yet it  is the fountain from which has come  much of what this country is all about  today.  Now,  I would agree that every re search dollar that has been spent has  ",1987

1288,721,20,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1987
1289,721,20,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr.  President,  while the Parliamentarian is checking  the figures  to ensure  that  they are  consistent with  the Budget Act,  I  thought I would put the time to good  use and cite for Senators who may not  have heard earlier some of the exam ples  of  flagrant  corporate welfare  which the UDAG Program funds.  May I say on the point of compli ance with  the Budget Act  that we  checked the figures in the amendment  with  the staff on  this  side of  the  Budget Committee, and on their word  we have  it  that no point of order  would be in order on that score.  In any event, while we are awaiting  the Chair's examination of that point,  let me cite some of these abuses.  In fiscal year 1987, the UDAG Pro gram provided $5.5 million to finance  part of an 800-room flagship Hilton  Hotel in Minneapolis. We are asked to  believe  that, somehow, Hilton Hotel  would not otherwise have entered into  a  business  proposition. That  is  a  pretty absurd contention. The Hilton  Hotel,  I guess  is one of the  largest  to  hotel chains in the country. It is not a  charitable firm. It does things that are  in the interests of the stockholders of  that firm, as you would expect it to do.  If Hilton decided that a hotel would be  profitable over many years in Minne apolis,  you  can be  sure  that  they  would build one, without the taxpay ers being asked to sweeten the pot to  the  tune of $5.5 million under  this  UDAG project. That is the way they  work.  Not to be outdone, other major hotel  chains have benefited by  the same  kind of subsidy-Sheraton, Ramada,  Holiday Inn, for example. Indeed, over  the past 3 fiscal years, 10 to 15 percent  of UDAG grants have been awarded to  hotel-related projects.  ",1987
1290,721,20,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  will the Senator yield for a moment?  ",1987
1291,721,20,Mr. HUMPHREY.,"  I  am happy  to  yield to the Senator from Colorado.  Before I do, Mr. President, may we  have order?  ",1987
1292,721,20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senate will be in order.  ,1987
1293,721,20,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, if  the Senator will yield, I would like to  take  just a moment  to discuss with  him three matters.  First of  all,  if  I  understand  this  amendment,  it  reduces  substantially  the funding for UDAG.  ",1987
1294,721,20,Mr. HUMPHREY., That is correct.  ,1987
1295,721,20,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," And the point  he  is making,  I  think,  is one which  should be seriously and earnestly con sidered by every Senator, that some of  the largest corporations, some of the  most  affluent  corporations  in  the  Nation, in effect have become recipi ents of corporate welfare. This is an  outrage. My outrage, however, is not  directed  toward  these  corporations,  and I  judge the Senator's concern is  not, either.  All of these companies and others  are obligated to comply with all sorts  of laws that are to their disadvantage,  and I personally have no objection to  a company taking advantage of a law  which happens to be to their advan tage.  The blame is not with the companies  involved, but with  the Congress  for  permitting such an unwise expendi ture of public funds.  So I  just want to congratulate him  for drawing this to  the attention of  the Senate.  Second,  I would  like  to point out  that the Senate on one recent occasion  very  nearly  voted  to  abolish  the  UDAG  Program  altogether, which  from my viewpoint would be the pre ferred solution, which brings me  to  the  third matter  I wanted  to  raise  which is, Would the Senator consent  that I be added as a cosponsor of the  amendment?  ",1987
1296,721,20,Mr.  HUMPHREY.,"  course.  Gladly.  Of  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the Senator from Colorado  be added as a cosponsor.  ",1987
1297,721,20,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1987
1298,721,20,Mr. HUMPHREY.," I  thank him for  his valuable addition to the debate.  He put his finger on the essence of  it. This question of corporate welfare.  I  find  it obnoxious, frankly, as now  who is a staunch defender of a free en terprise system, whenever there is any  element, much less an outrageous ele ment of corporate welfare.  I  am a  staunch defender of  the free enter prise system, a staunch defender of  profits fairly and  lawfully won, and  likewise  a  staunch defender of  the  concept  that unwise business  firms,  unwise business decisions must accept  their  lumps when  it comes  to  the  bottom line, including losses.  Subsidies are pernicious. They dis tort the economy. At any given time,  there is a measurable pool of capital,  constantly fluid, of course, and it is  impossible  to measure  in any given  moment, but  in  the abstract at any  given moment, there is a quantity of  capital  available  for  financing  the  most worthy projects, and when politi cians keep their fingers out of it gener ally  the most worthy and  the most  sensible projects draw  that captial,  and  that  is good because  the most  worthy and the most sensible are usu ally the most efficient, and efficiency  has the benefit of raising the standard  of living in this country because when  assets are put to the best possible use,  productivity is increased and all Amer icans share to one degree or another  in that increased productivity.  Increased  productivity  means  a  higher standard of living. That is how  the system works when politicians will  keep their fingers off it.  But when instead they cannot resist  the temptation of channeling capital  to this enterprise and that enterprise,  they have the effect of distorting the  marketplace and as a consequence of  that politician-induced distortion, cap ital flows  to those projects that are  less than efficient and make a smaller  contribution  to  increasing American  productivity and a  smaller contribu tion to raising the standard of living  for each American citizen.  That is what is wrong with subsidies.  That is what is wrong with politicians  allocating capital.  This UDAG Program  is  nothing  more or less than political allocation  of scarce resources. And what is politi cal allocation?  While I am warm into the subject  and we have some time to kill, what is  political allocation of scarce resources,  Mr. President? Socialism. That is what  it is.  You look at countries with a socialist  government. Politicians decide where  ",1987
1299,760,20,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I have  the  floor and  I yield  to  the distin guished Senator further.  ",1987
1300,760,20,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  the majority leader is, of course, cor rect.  On one other matter, I do agree. It  would be a great pity if, out of zeal or  emotion or anger or pique or for any  reason, if Senators let their own emo tions get away with them. This is a  matter about which feelings run very  strong, particularly among those who  feel Judge Bork has been done a great  injustice and who  feel,  in addition,  that  something  precious  has  been  compromised  in  the uncharacteristi cally rough handling of Judge Bork.  It would be easy on our side to take  so much offense that we would lose  sight of the traditions of which the  Senator has spoken. And I think all of  us would be well advised to remember  what he has said about that. I wish it  had been observed at all times prior to  today. But, if that is not the case, and  I believe it has not always been the  case, it nonetheless is the correct rule,  the right tradition, and I think all of  us would do well to heed his words in  that respect.  I thank the majority leader.  ",1987
1301,760,20,Mr. BIDEN., Will the Senator yield. I  will use 2 minutes and I promise I will  not take longer.  ,1987
1302,760,20,Mr. BYRD., I yield to the Senator.  ,1987
1303,760,20,Mr. BIDEN.," The point I would make  is not whether or not anyone spoke  with any outside  interest or outside  group. In every single piece of legisla tion on every single matter that comes  before us, we  speak  to people who  have been lobbying and have an inter est.  The point I was making is that none  of us control the words that any out side group uses. None of us control  what they say. And what seems to be  at issue here is what was said by vari ous groups, whether it is the advertise ment referred to here today or the ad vertisement that was referred to earli er prior to the Bork hearing starting.  The second point I was making  is  that it seems to me that we are really  indicting ourselves as a body if, in fact,  we conclude that Senators who have  spoken at length for and against  in  detail on the record have done so as a  consequence  of  advertisements  that  they have read in the newspaper and/  or as a consequence of television ads  that they have seen. Those are  the  only two points I make.  ",1987
1304,760,20,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I do not  want to hold the floor longer. Our two  managers are here and ready to pro ceed.  I think all of this that we hear today  simply goes  to prove my point that  this debate promises to be divisive. It  is not going to be helpful. I will be  pleasantly surprised  if  it  turns out  otherwise. But it seems to me that we  ought to start the process of healing  instead of the process of etching the  wounds deeper.  I  told the White House what they  could expect if this particular nominee  came up here. I said that I might vote  for him. I might vote against him. In  my opinion, at that time, he would  probably  be  confirmed,  but  there  would be a big fight and I did not  think that could be avoided. But the  White House did not listen.  There is nobody here to whom I take  a back seat in wanting to see a con servative Court. I think a court should  be conservative. The legislative branch  is the liberal branch.  But be that as it may, we need to get  on with the process of voting on the  nomination and heeding our responsi bilities to consider the qualifications  of  the  subsequent  nominee whose  name will be sent to the Senate by the  White House. We ought to avoid all  the divisiveness and charges of McCarthyism and lynching. I want to know  what Senators participated in a lynch mob. That is the charge. I would like  to know who those Senators are who  participated in the lynching.  I have not asked a single Senator:  ""How are you going to vote?"" I have  not asked any Senator to vote against  Mr. Bork. I have not asked any Sena tor about nose counts.  That is the responsibility of our re spective whips, not mine. I have not  asked for a count and nobody has vol unteered to show me o11e.  I have said in my caucus, however, at  least twice, beginning when this nomi nation was  first sent  to  the Senate,  that we should avoid making this vote  a  test of party loyalty; avoid making  this the litmus test of party loyalty.  ""Let us not politicize  this nomina tion,"" I said. We are not electing a Re publican Court. We are not electing a  Democratic Court. We are filling a va cancy on the Supreme Court of the  United States.  That has been my position.  I think of the Scriptures which say:  No man,  having put his hand  to  the  plough, and looking back, is fit for the king dom of God.  It is about time we put our hands to  the plow and looked ahead and quit  looking backward, give Mr. Bork his  vote, and get on, before the wounds  become deeper, with the next nomina tion.  After all,  I am going  to be  impor tuned, beseeched, adjured, and urged  to get  the next nomination  to  the  floor, get it voted on, and I am going  to be urged to support it. Those who  advise delay today will then want to  rush the next nomination through.  I hope we will  look ahead  to  the  time when we will be asked to give our  attention to another nominee. Let us  act in the interests of the Court and  the interests of the country.  Mr. President, I apologize to the two  managers. They were making good  headway on their bill and I hope that  they will be able to continue.  I  thank the distinguished Republi can leader and I thank all Senators.

1310,773,20,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  direct a  request to the distinguished  floor managers of the bill, relating to  the  relocation of  the Tiburon, CA,  Laboratory of  the National Marine  Fisheries Service to the University of  California's Bodega Marine Laborato ry at Bodega Bay.  Both NMFS and the University of  California agree on the wisdom of the  move. As  the committee knows,  the  major emphasis of Tiburon Laborato ry research is the groundfish resources  of the Pacific Ocean. The groundfish  resources of the Pacific coast are of  major importance to commercial and  recreational fisheries  in Oregon and  Washington. Dockside landing values  are worth over $60 million annually.  At the consumer level they are worth  over $300 million. The Tiburon Labo ratory has recently been collaborating  extensively with  researchers at  the  Bodega Marine Laboratory, stemming  from the fact that both facilities pres ently conduct research on 30 different  species of groundfish and on salmon  and steelhead reproduction and migra tion. Relocation of the Tiburon Labo ratory would allow for more efficient  information sharing and research col laboration and would also, through co operative arrangements, prevent dupli cation of research facilities.  The physical condition of  the Ti buron Laboratory is deteriorating. It is  also  inland,  far  away  from  coastal  groundfish  landings  and  research  areas. Those two factors make it very  desirable  to move  that  laboratory's  programs to a more effective, suitable  oceanside  location. A  relocation  to  Bodega Bay would put the laboratory  closer  to  the  fishery  resource  it re searches, it would increase collabora tive  research  in  areas  including  groundfish management and the im pacts of offshore oil programs on fish eries, and would develop a sound and  extensive base for groundfish manage ment. These  reasons, among others,  are why the move is so strongly sup ported by the scientific and university  communities, and is supported by the  National Marine Fisheries Service.  Funding in the amount of $100,000 is  needed to develop conceptual designs,  site surveys, and preliminary specifica tions for construction of a laboratory  building at  the university's Bodega  Marine Laboratory site. The Universi ty of California is prepared to provide  an appropriate ground lease.  I  have  considered  offering  an  amendment to the pending bill to pro vide the needed funds. I am persuaded,  however, that the distinguished floor  managers would look favorably on this  issue when the bill reaches conference  with the House and do what can be  done to provide the needed funds.  I wonder if the Senator from South  Carolina would confirm that my un derstanding is correct.  ",1987
1311,773,20,Mr. HOLLINGS.,"  I understand  the  Senator from California's concern, and  I appreciate his forebearance in with holding his amendment. He has my as surance that the relocation matter will  be raised  in conference, and we will  make every effort to see that the nec essary funds are provided.  SALARIES OF UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY  JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES  ",1987
1312,773,20,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased that the Appropriations Com mittee added, as section 408 of  this  measure, the text of my bill, S. 696, to  raise the salaries of bankruptcy judges  and magistrates to 92 percent of the  salaries  received  by  district  judges.  This language is designed to correct  an inequity resulting from the trans mittal implementing the Quadrennial  Pay  Commission's  recommendation  earlier this year. The increase will be  effective January 1, 1988, or the date  of enactment, whichever is later.  u.s.  The estimated cost of the provision  is  $4,800,000  and will  be  absorbed  within judiciary appropriations.  Historically,  the  salary  levels  for  bankruptcy  judges  and magistrates  have been scaled at approximately 90  percent of the salary level for U.S. dis trict  judges. The Quadrennial Pay  Commission in its recommendation to  the President proposed a level of pay  for bankruptcy judges and magistrates  that was in keeping with that scale. In  fact, the Commission's proposal would  have  provided  a  level of pay  that  would be 92.3 percent of the rate pro posed for U.S. district judges.  However, the recommendations sub mitted to the Congress by the Presi dent  provided  salary  increases  in  excess of 10 percent for district judges,  but provided only a 2.9 percent  in crease for bankruptcy judges and mag istrates. When the President's pay rec ommendations  took effect on Febru ary 5, the parity level of approximate ly 90 percent was reduced to approxi mately 81 percent.  The current salary  level of bank ruptcy  judges  and magistrates  is  $72,500. The salary levels for U.S. at torneys and U.S.  trustees are set by  statute or regulation at $77,500. Thus,  these Government attorneys can be  paid $5,000 more annually  than the  bankruptcy  judges  and magistrates  before whom they regularly appear.  Chapter 11  filings  alone have  in creased about 550 percent during the  period of 1980 through 1986, including  a growing number of petitions from  giant corporations  involving complex  financial matters.  In  the Northern  District  of Mississippi,  bankruptcy  case filings in 1986 exceeded the previ ous year by approximately 40 percent.  These numbers may continue  to  in crease.  Bankruptcy courts have become the  general business courts of the country.  The  importance and volume of  the  cases before them requires that were cruit and retain qualified and experi enced men and women for these judge ships.  The effects of inadequate compensa tion has resulted in 70 percent of the  bankruptcy  judgeships being vacated  over the past 7 years. Those who have  filled  these vacancies  are  relatively  young and inexperienced. The private  sector offers career opportunities far  more lucrative.  The U.S.  Judicial Conference and  the American Bar Association have en dorsed this salary adjustment, and I  appreciate the support of the manag ers of the bill in including it in this  bill.  ",1987
1313,773,20,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I hope as  these agencies spend this large sum of  money,  some  attention  is  paid  to  whether American companies are ben efiting, or whether it is going to for eign countries that do not reciprocate  ",1987

1348,799,20,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to honor James Isenogle, an  individual whose outstanding service  and dedication to the U.S. Park Serv ice has earned him the Department of  the  Interior's Distinguished Service  Award. I would like to take this oppor tunity to commend him for his efforts,  especially  in  regard  to  his  distin guished  tenure as Administrator of  the Jean Lafitte National Historical  Park in New Orleans.  Jim  Isenogle  joined  the National  Park Service at Philadelphia in 1957,  having served with the U.S. Navy as a  gunnery officer for the 2 years previ ous. He subsequently served with the  Park Service  in numerous capacities  nationwide,  including assignments at  the Canaveral National Seashore, FL,  and the Lake Clark, Katmai and An iakchak areas in Alaska, all of which  later became units of the Park Service.  He also served with distinction as as sistant to the Regional Director for  Utah from 1974 to 1979.  Shortly before his arrival in New Or leans in 1979, legislation officially cre ating the Jean Lafitte National Histor ical Park and Preserve, which had  been in the works for a decade, was  passed by the Congress. This legisla tion provided for a unique concept,  one which held great promise for an  exciting park based on a new principle.  To be a success, it required an individ ual with  a  creative  foresight  and  strong ability in management. Jim was  possessing of these skills and literally  took  the  ideas on paper, nurtured  them and made them a success.  From ground zero, he oversaw the  acquisition of over 7,000 acres of the  natural  Barataria  Basin  Preserve  which now plays host to over half a  million  visitors  a  year. A  visitor's  center has been constructed and there  are plans for an environmental educa tion center as well. These accomplish ments have come about in no small  part due  to Jim's excellent skills at  gaining community support by forging  a variety of cooperative agreements  throughout  the delta  region. These  agreements were  designed  to  help  meet the mandate in the legislation es tablishing the park that called for an  interpretation of the cultural contri butions of  the delta region's people  and their histories. In the Islenos in terpretation of the Portuguese settle ments, he has been adept in reaching  many other groups  through his ef forts,  including the establishment of  three Acadian cultural centers in the  last 3 years. Jim's contributions are  far too many to list individually. But it  is clear that without his skills at lead ership and his creativity, the Jean La fitte National Historical Park would  not be, in reality, a park.  I commend him for his many efforts  in dealing with very complex and diffi cult, and in some cases, not so pleas ant, problems. Even though Jim is re tiring, the ideas and the projects he  has put  into place will  remain  the  foundation of this park and the base  upon which we can continue to build  far into the future.  Mr. President,  I  ask  that  the at tached article from the New Orleans  Times-Picayune which thoroughly de scribes all that Jim has encountered  and  accomplished  in his  tenure at  Jean Lafitte National Historical Park  be printed in the REcORD.  The article follows:  RETIRING JEAN LAFITTE DIRECTOR LEAVING  IMPROVED PARK BEHIND  <By Cindy Hebert>  When  James  Isenogle became  superin tendent of Jean Lafitte National Historical  Park, dumping trash by the truckload was  almost a community sport, but he put a stop  to that.  He had the staff tack up no dumping signs  and issued warnings and citations to viola tors. It worked, residents told him, because  somebody was finally enforcing the dump ing laws. But not every project Isenogle has  undertaken has been that easy.  lsenogle, 55, will retire Saturday after a  32-year career with the park service. He was  tapped for the superintendent's job at Jean  Lafitte in 1979 and has spent the past eight  years setting up programs and leaving his  mark on the park system.  The 7 ,000-acre wetlands preserve, called  the Barataria Unit, is on Louisiana 45 south  of Marrero. The park-Louisiana's only na tional park-includes the Chalmette Battle field, the French Quarter and the Barataria  Unit.  Cleaning up the park was just one prob lem Isenogle tackled.

1370,825,20,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with great  pleasure that I rise today to point out an out standing article which recently appeared in the  Catholic Sentinel of Portland, OR. The article,  written by Rosalyn Borg, deals with the intern ment of Japanese-Americans during World  War II, as well as the redress legislation, H.R.  442, which the House passed on September  17, and  I wanted each of my colleagues  to  have the opportunity to review this article.  [From The Catholic Sentinel, Aug. 28, 1987]  INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE-AMERICANS NEEDS  REDRESS  <By Rosalyn Borg)  Americans  take pride  in  the concept of  ""fairness"" as a basic value. Expressions such  as ""be fair,"" ""play fair,"" ""second chance,""  ""benefit of the doubt,"" and ""make it right""  are part of our daily vocabulary.  Today, as a nation and as Oregonians, we  have  the opportunity  to give ourselves a  second chance to be ""fair"" to those Ameri can citizens and permanent alien residents  of Japanese ancestry who were forced from  their home and held  in detention camps  during World War II.  In 1942,  under Executive Order  9066,  120,000 Japanese-Americans,  two-thirds of  whom were American citizens, were uproot ed from their West Coast homes and sent to  prison camps in the belief that they posed a  threat to national security. Manzanar, Tule  Lake and Heart Mountain were some of the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  racial:  camp locations. These are names that few  Americans ever heard or bothered  to re member.  The underlying reason for the imprison ment was  ethnic  and  economic  racism. No fairness was  involved. No  trial  was held. No recourse to the basic protec tion of the law was allowed. Had the coun try been concerned with being fair,  those  Americans of German and Italian ancestry,  as well  as  Japanese-Americans  living  in  Hawaii, also would have been incarcerated.  The victims were not strangers living in  Alabama or  Illinois or New Hampshire.  They were our friends, neighbors. and busi ness associates who suffered severe losses freedom, dignity,  income, careers, mental  anguish-some of it lasting a  lifetime. No  one gave them time to get a ""fair price"" for  their homes or businesses. A few courageous  individuals publicly protested this blatant  act  of  discrimination-men  like  Bishop  Gerald Shaughnessy of Seattle and Judge  Gus Solomon of Portland. Remarkably, so  few others stood with them. Silently Amer ica looked the other way; silently the vic tims suffered.  A national commission established in the  1980s to address the issue found that not a  single person of Japanese ancestry, either in  Hawaii or on  the U.S. mainland, was ac cused of espionage or sabotage on behalf of  Japan. The fact was that several thousand  Japanese-Americans volunteered to serve in  the U.S. armed forces where their heroism  was ""outstanding.""  The commission report concluded that the  ""broad historical causes which shaped these  decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria  and a failure of political leadership ... A  grave injustice was done . . . without indi vidual  review or  any probative  evidence  against them ... ""  Forty-five years have passed, and  today  we are engaged  in the observance of  the  200th anniversary of the Constitution of the  United States. The Fifth Amendment of  that document states that ""No person shall  ... be deprived of life. liberty or property  without due process of law ... ""The experi ence of Japanese-Americans during World  War II is a harsh reminder of the frailties  of our constitutional guarantees. When civil  liberties can be taken away from one group,  they can be taken from any group.  The American Jewish Committee, Ameri ca's oldest human  relations organization,  has called this event in the history of our  country a  ""national disgrace."" We, along  with other organizations, support the pro posed redress legislation as an opportunity  to do  justice to all those who suffered so  much and as the only way to redeem the  conscience of America.  The redress legislation which is expected  to reach the floor of the House and Senate  in mid-September includes recognition of a  grave injustice and an apology for that in justice, pardon to those who were convicted  of violating the evacuation and curfew laws,  financial compensation to the 60,000 survi vors, and the establishment of an education al trust fund.  Catholic readers of the Sentinel can show  their support and understanding of  this  moral issue by encouraging the Oregon con gressional delegation to lead the nation in  the passage of Senate BillS 1099 and House  of Representatives Bill 442.  It is  the fair  way. It is the American way. It is the honor able way.  28163  A TRIBUTE TO ST. VINCENT  CHURCH IN AKRON, OH  HON. TOM SAWYER  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 15, 1987  ",1987
1371,825,20,Mr. SAWYER.," Mr. Speaker, St. Vincent de  Paul Church  in Akron, OH will celebrate  its  150th anniversary on Sunday, October 18,  1987. I would like to pay tribute to this church  and its parishoners on this very special occa sion, and I want to share with my colleagues  some of the history of this church which has  played such an important role in the history of  Akron.  St. Vincent began as a mission of St. Fran cis Xavier Church  in Chippewa, OH. For the  more than 20 years before the mission of St.  Vincent was established, Catholics  from  Ire land, Germany, France, and other parts of  Europe  were  without  the  consolation  of  priests. Originally, these immigrants had come  to this country to work on the Ohio Canal. The  church became a community center for immi grants, a school for their children, and helped  provide a  recorded history of  their  lives  in  Akron: the city's  first baptism December 11,  1837,  first marriage January 11, 1838, and  first funeral January 27, 1838, were all record ed by the parish's original pastor, Father Basil  A. Shorb.  As the community of Akron grew, so did St.  Vincent Church. And by the end of 1847, St.  Francis Xavier Church  in Chippewa became  the mission of St. Vincent. This is quite a testi mony to  the growth and spiritual strength of  the Akron community when one considers that  St. Vincent Church was  the mission of St.  Francis Xavier  little more  than  10  years  before. More important, this course of events  shows how people dedicated to their faith can  improve their lives, the lives of their children,  and the spirit of their community.  Back in 1941, St. Vincent's pastor, Father  Conry, helped establish  the St. Vincent High  School. Since  then,  the  high  school  has  always been coeducational because,  in  the  words of father Conry, ""These young people  will marry and they will live together and they  must know how to get along with each other.""  Through the years, St. Vincent Church has  been  renovated many  times.  In a very  real  sense, these renovations have symbolized the  church's ever changing parish. As elder pari sioners send  their children  to  the church's  school, these children return to help the Akron  community  as  teachers,  public  servants,  priests and nuns, social workers, et cetera. By  combining  church  and  school, St. Vincent  Church  has historically committed  itself  to  Akron's youth. It is through its commitment to  youth that the church has laid the groundwork  for both a stronger Akron and a better future.  St. Vincent Church stands now as both an  architectural and spiritual landmark in the his tory of Akron.  Its continued strength, and the  constant dedication of its parishioners, are a  vital part of the city. Whether attending serv ices,  sending  their  children  to  school,  or  cheering at a football game,  the  faith of the  people of St. Vincent Church  is  the  true  strength of this great institution. It will ensure  ",1987
1372,838,20,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  in 1959 a  husky young graduate of the Baltimore County  Police Academy was  issued a badge, a gun,  and assigned  to  the Dundalk Police Station.  This station was responsible at  the time  for  patrolling the whole southeastern area of the  county, yet  it possessed only seven squad  cars  and  one  shotgun.  The$e  certainly  seemed  to put things at a disadvantage for  those who were sworn to uphold the laws of  both a county and a State, yet young Patrol man Frank Messina approached his duties  with a degree of vim and vigor which more  than made up for the limited resources.  Twenty-eight years  later, Col. Frank Mes sina retired from the Baltimore County Police  Force as chief of field operations. That very  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  same station where he started his career now  possesses 18 patrol cars, each carrying  its  own shotgun, and the Baltimore County Police  Force has increased from 400 officers to over  1 ,400 officers supported by nearly 200 civil ians.  It is also recognized as one of the best  police forces in the entire Nation as a result of  Colonel Messina's efforts as the No. 2 man in  the force.  On October 20 Colonel Messina's com rades, colleagues, and  friends will gather to  pay due homage to the man who, for over a  quarter of a century, contributed so much to  the safety and well-being of his community.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize on the  floor of this great body the accomplishments  of this truly special person. His story should  serve as an example to all who wish to make  a mark in the field of public service, whether it  be on the national, State, or local level.  Colonel Messina is the first Italian-American  in his  force  to become a captain and  to  achieve his present rank. His beginnings were  humble, yet he climbed  the  ladder until he  eventually  reached  the pinnacle of success.  These facts, however, do not by  themselves  tell  the  full story of Colonel Messina's suc cess. His sense of vision and his willingness  to innovate were his tickets to fame. It was his  ability to expand  the goals of a police  force  from one which focused on  law enforcement  into one which strived to serve its community  as well which make his so worthy of praise.  Colonel Messina made  a  difference,  and  that's what is of supreme importance.  His experience in all areas of police work al lowed him to develop new ideas, to increase  efficiency and provide more benefits  to  the  community. He entered a police  force which  employed almost no  blacks and  very  few  women.  It now has 92 black officers as well  as over 1 00 women.  Colonel Messina is indeed a very rare breed  of man-a ""man of vision.""  I am proud that  my district contains one of  the most ad vanced, sophisticated, and dedicated police  forces  in  the United States-because  this  man pursued his vision.  Colonel Messina  is  indeed  a doer,  and  America needs more doers like him. All who  salute him on his day of recognition should  strive to meet the level of excellence he has  established. Colonel Messina has  remained  until now largely an unsung hero, one whose  achievements were of course recognized and  appreciated yet never viewed in the total pic ture.  Today I am proud to have the opportunity to  sing his song of praise.  WE NEED A COORDINATED  NATIONAL DRUG POLICY  HON. JOSEPH J. DioGUARDI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 15, 1987  ",1987
1373,838,20,Mr. DIOGUARDI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to call my colleagues' attention  to a recent  letter to the editor of the New York Times by  Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, director of the Phoenix  House, a drug  rehabilitation center  in New  York City. This facility has a national reputaOctober 15, 1987  tion  for unparallelled dedication to  the prob lems before our young people with substance  abuse. The success the Phoenix House has  enjoyed with thousands of our young people  struggling with  the horror of drug abuse can  be directly attributed  to  the efforts of Dr.  Rosenthal.  Through Dr. Rosenthal's unequaled work in  the field of drug rehabilitation, he has become  a valuable resource for this Congress and this  administration  to call upon  for  input  in  the  ""war on drugs."" Dr. Rosenthal's  immediate  concern, expressed  in his  letter to  the New  York Times editor,  is that the supply side of  the war on drugs has been overemphasized to  the exclusion of our attention to the demand  side of  this menace. He astutely points out  that  ""attacking  the  demand  side  aims  at  shrinking the drug market, cutting profits and  making the risks of the drug trade less afford able.""  It seems to me Dr. Rosenthal has hit  the goals of our war on drugs right on  the  head.  He closes with  the plainly evident assess ment of our country's war on drugs ""together  we can win a war against drugs. Divided,  drugs will conquer us.""  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the entirety of Dr. Rosenthal's  letter  to  the  editor be included in the RECORD  immediately  following my comments.  [From the New York Times, Sept. 18, 19871  WE NEED A COORDINATED NATIONAL DRUG  POLICY-TOGETHER WE CAN WIN  <By MitchellS. Rosenthal)  To the Editor: Some very bright people  can be awfully dumb when  it comes  to  drugs. Take ""Which War on Drugs?"" <Aug.  31>. You  propose  solutions  to America's  drug problems  that are shockingly naive  and also astonishing  in a newspaper that  has covered drug abuse so thoughtfully and  well.  All  the  ""obvious""  solutions,  including  yours, put responsibility every place else but  on the abuser. No solution Will work that  does not start by demanding that drug users  stop using drugs. Then we must impose that  demand and deal with  the complications  that arise from it.  Your notion of dividing the problem drug  by drug is even less practical now than in  the past. Today, new drugs are constantly  being  introduced,  including  ""designer  drugs,"" synthetics that mimic the pharma ceutical action of natural drugs or semi synthetics. Were we ever to succeed in cut ting off foreign sources of natural cocaine,  domestically  produced  synthetic  cocaine  would almost immediately hit the street.  Focusing on what drugs were being used  and not why drugs were used is what many  parents did in the late 1960's and early 70's.  They  figured a  little pot was O.K., but  didn't know what  to  do  about PCP or  ""ludes,"" ""uppers,"" ""downers"" or hallucino gens. The point is not to worry about how  late we  can wait  to  stop youthful drug  abuse, but how soon we must move to pre vent it.  Your easy answers to heroin, marijuana  and cocaine contain disturbing misinforma tion. Most distressing to me, as the head of  a  drug-free  treatment program  that has  treated more than 35,000 young drug abus ers in New York over the last 20 years, is  your assumption  that methadone mainte nance  is  the only  affordable  answer  to  heroin addiction.

The Senate proceeded  to consider  the bill which had been reported from  the Committee on Veterans' Affairs,  with an amendment to strike all after  the enacting clause and insert in lieu  thereof, the following:  SECTION I. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCE TO TITLE 38,  UNITED STATES CODE.

1386,916,20,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, the  V A's chief benefits director has deter mined that maintaining 2 separate of fices to administer the VA's life insur ance program-one office in St. Paul  with  approximately  163  positions  during fiscal year 1987 and one office  in Philadelphia with  approximately  427 positions during fiscal year 1987runs counter  to sound management  principles  and practice. Specifically,  the V A's chief benefits director has  made  the determination, which has  been endorsed by the head of the VA,  that maintaining the two offices; first,  creates a dual management structure  and unnecessary organizational layer ing; second, diffuses authority and re sponsibility, thus making it more diffi cult to fix managerial accountability;  third unnecessarily broadens the chief  benefits directors'. span-of-supervisory control thus jeopardizing effective or ganizational  communication  and  re sponsiveness; and fourth,  is counter productive because  the workload  in  the insurance program is declining and  it would be administratively undesir able  to maintain-and  justify-two  separate offices.  Mr. President, the proposal to con solidate  the St. Paul VA  insurance  office into the Philadelphia office  is  not new. In separate 1962 and 1969 re ports, the General Accounting Office  recommended that VA consolidate the  St. Paul office into the Philadelphia  office in order to achieve greater econ omy of operations.  Moreover,  the recent GAO  report,  which follows a 16-month GAO analy sis of the VA cost-benefit study of this  issue-in which an  independent VA  office of program analysis and evalua tion  found  that during  the  first 5  years of  the  consolidation  the VA  would save $3.94 million-did not ad dress  the basic question of whether  the VA should consolidate the Philadelphia and St. Paul offices. Instead,  GAO took a much more indirect ap proach and concluded that the V A's  estimated  5-year  savings would  be  greatly reduced or could be eliminated  if first the Philadelphia office's future  productivity  is similar to  its current  productivity; and second, office space  was  included. The Administrator of  Veterans' Affairs  strongly disagreed  with this conclusion-as acknowledged  by  the GAO  in  its September  16  report-and the Administrator in a de tailed July 30, 1987,  response to the  GAO draft  report provided data  in  support of his position.  Finally, Mr. President,  I note  the  GAO's statement on page 7 of  its  report that GAO ""agrees that consoli dation <of  the two offices) offers op portunities  for  reducing  overhead  costs as the direct workload declines.""  Moreover, GAO's  report  ""does  not  question VA's estimated 5 years' sav ings of $1.63 million in personnel costs,  that is 24 supervisory and clerical posi tions."" It is this savings that is the es sence of the V A's argument.  Mr.  President,  nevertheless,  this  matter is not at all free from doubt.  The GAO has raised some good points,  and so has the VA in response. In light  of the fiscal year 1988 prohibition on  the consolidation  in  the HUD-Inde pendent Agencies Appropriations Act,  1988, already passed by the House and  approved in the bill reported by our  Senate Appropriations Committee, the  VA  is going  to have ample  time  to  rethink, review, and restudy this issue.  Mr. President, there is surely little  value  in  false  economies,  especially  when disruption and  relocation may  well adversely affect  the quality of  service provided to veterans for a con siderable length of time. On the other  hand,  long-term  cost  savings  could  well more than offset immediate costs.  There seem to be more questions than  answers here. Therefore,  I would be  pleased  to  join my colleagues  in a  letter to the VA urging that no action  be  taken on the consolidation while  the Congress studies it further, and di recting that a careful reexamination  of this proposed consolidation be un dertaken-preferably  by  an  outside  consultant.  MURKOWSKI AMENDMENT NO. 1007  ",1987
1387,916,20,Mr.  CRANSTON.," Mr.  President,  before we vote on Senator MuRKOW SKI's amendment, I would like to re spond to some of the points made in  his  October  13  ""Dear  Colleague""  letter.  First, Senator MURKOWSKI  stated  that the provisions of title III of S.  1464 would ""dramatically expand the  nature and scope of the [V A's read justment counseling program].""  is  correct  that  the  legislation  would permit the VA to provide read justment counseling services  to new  categories of veterans <World War II  and Korean  conflict  veterans)  and  It  active-duty  service  personnel <those  who served during the Vietnam era or  since in combat situations). However,  because of the discretionary nature of  these changes, I do not believe that it  is fair to characterize this as a dramat ic expansion.  The only new category of veterans  that the legislation would entitle tore adjustment  counseling  services  are  those who have served since the end of  the Vietnam era in combat situations.  Both Senator MURKOWSKI and the ad ministration have expressed support  for this provision.  The only other basis for asserting  that the legislation ""dramatically"" ex pands the existing program is a provi sion that would permit the VA to fur nish other VA benefits and services at  vet centers using employees who are  currently employed elsewhere in the  agency. Again, this is a discretionary  authority and the VA can already do  this and has in some cases.  It seems somewhat ironic for Sena tor MURKOWSKI  to  raise  concerns  about program expansion  in view of  his authorship of the pilot program of  Vietnam veteran resource centers en acted in 1985 to require the transfor mation of 10 regular vet centers into  multiservice centers to furnish, in ad dition  to  readjustment  counseling  services.  expanded  assistance  with  other VA benefits and services.  Second, Senator MURKOWSKI stated  that  the measure would  ""in effect,  freeze  in place the 189 separate cen ters, without regard to workload or ef fectiveness.""  In  lieu of current  law, which  re quires eliminating more than half, at  least 95, of  the existing community based centers over an arbitrary 2-year  time period, title III of S. 1464 would  establish a process through which the  VA could relocate or close an existing  vet center after evaluating such an  action according to a series of specified  criteria-which are based directly on  criteria the VA developed-and giving  the two Veterans' Affairs Committees  60-days advance notice of the propos al, including the results of the applica tion of the specified criteria. If the VA  proposed  to close or relocate a  sub stantial number of centers in a par ticular year, the bill requires that 8months notice be provided so as  to  permit legislative consideration of the  import of the changes.  The only way  that  this approach  could be construed as freezing in place  the existing number of centers  is  if  one believes that it would not be possi ble to justify any proposed relocations  or closures. I do not hold that view  and indeed have already agreed to a  relocation of a vet center in California.  Where good justification exists, I feel  sure other of our colleagues would do  the same.  ",1987
1388,955,20,Mr. HECHT.," Mr. President, today I  am filing an amendment I will offer  during the debate on the War Powers  Act. Most of  the debate concerning  the War Powers Act centers around  military activities taking place in the  Persian Gulf. But the countries sur rounding the gulf also represent the  vast majority of the Western World's  oil supplies. Once again, our lack of a  national energy policy  leaves us  in  danger of being caught off guard.  A recent analysis of the effects of a  cutoff in the oil supply through the  Straits of Hormuz indicates that the  world would lose 6 million barrels per  day of oil production. Within 90 days,  about half of the world's strategic pe troleum  reserves would be depleted.  Oil prices would skyrocket to roughly  $50 per barrel immediately following  the cutoff, and gradually level out at  around $30.  In America, we  could  expect gas  lines  to  reappear.  Inflation,  interest  rates, and unemployment would  in crease. Our balance-of-payments defi cit would worsen,  and our Nation's  economic  growth would  be  endan gered.  Clearly, we can't afford to rely ex clusively on our strategic petroleum  reserves  to get us  through such  a  crisis. Nor can we  assume  that  renewed exploration will  rapidly solve  the problem, because it normally takes  the industry about 15 years to turn a  newly discovered oil deposit into a reli ably producing oil field.  We must  have  some  contingency  plan to make fuller use of our domes tic oil production potential. We must  have a plan to quickly draw on our  proven but presently  untapped  re serves of oil. What we need  in  this  country, Mr. President,  is a compre hensive national energy policy to pro tect against these dangers.  Mr. President, my amendment would  require the Secretaries of Energy and  the Interior to submit to the Congress  within 90 days a report which shall in dicate how  the United States could  rapidly  increase domestic petroleum  production  in  response  to  a major  world oil supply shortfall caused by  hostilities  in  the Middle East. We  simply  cannot  trust  our  economic  future and our energy supplies to con tinued good fortune. Too much is on  the line.  I encourage my colleagues  to sup port this. amendment, and to join me  in pressing for a comprehensive na tional energy policy, so we can better  prepare  for  our  Nation's  energy  future.

1399,968,20,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, everyone,  certainly  including myself,  is  very  pleased that Nancy Reagan is doing so  well; doctors say that she has a 95to  100-percent  chance  of  survival  and  that the prognosis is excellent. We are  all thrilled about that.  One of the reasons she is doing so  well and her cancer is probably cured  is because she had a mammogram in  her annual checkup.  Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago 1 out of 20  women acquired breast cancer. Today  the figure is 1 out of 9.  In Medicare, it does not include pre vention.  It does not  include a  free  mammogram or screening for women,  but  it will  include  coverage  to  an  extent for the surgery.  We could save an awful lot of lives if  we would only  include a prevention  mammogram  in  the Medicare  Pro gram.  Mr. Speaker, we had  in  the cata strophic bill a minimum program re lated to mammograms. It was  taken  out.  I  really urge  this Congress  to  either put that provision back  in or  pass the bill that I have introduced for  the  last 6  years, H.R.  2935, which  would  include  in Medicare coverage  this type of situation.  Nancy  Reagan  is  not  the  only  woman who should have this kind of  coverage. Every older woman should  have this and certainly older men as  well with  respect  to  screening  and  other kinds of cancer screening; so I  am hoping that this killer of women  will be arrested by an ounce of preven tion and Congress has the opportunity  to do something about this dreadful  disease.

1402,981,20,Mr. MYERS of Indiana.," Mr. Speak er, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewom an  from Ohio  [Ms. OAKAR]  for  the  very kind words that she has just ex pressed, and I want to thank her for  the fine  job she always does on the  committee.  Mr. Speaker, last year the Congress  passed the Federal Employees' Retire ment System Act of 1986. The act es tablished a new retirement system for  those Federal employees hired after  January  1,  1984,  and  now  covered  under Social Security. As might be ex pected with legislation as complicated  as FERSA,  the need  for numerous  technical corrections has become ap parent as implementation of FERSA  proceeds. For the last 8 months the  committee staff has worked with the  Office of Personnel Management and  other agencies to develop provisions to  correct any technical defects.  H.R. 3395 makes numerous technical  amendments concerning  the Federal  employees' retirement system and the  civil service retirement system. Some  minor substantive amendments made  by the bill include:  The elimination of the FERSA re quirement that a law enforcement of ficer or firefighter who transfers to a  supervisory or administrative position  must have completed at least 10 years  of law enforcement or firefigher serv ice  in  order  to  continue  coverage  under the law enforcement officer and  firefigher retirement provisions;  Providing retirement credit for cer tain service by Foreign Service nation al employees which prior  to a 1982  OPM policy change had been deemed  creditable;  Exclusion of Foreign Service nation als from FERS and from  the thrift  savings plan;  Providing that the expenses of the  thrift savings plan shall be paid from  the earnings on all contributions held  in the fund, not just from earnings on  matching Government contributions;  and  Extending the application deadline  for certain former spouses to apply for  survivor benefits from May 7, 1987, to  May 7, 1989.  Mr. Speaker, the Federal Employees'  Retirement System Act  represented  historic  legislation by  bringing  the  Government pension system closer in  line with comparable private sector  plans. It is an excellent system and  Congress should facilitate all means to  make it an even better system. These  technical amendments represent  just  one area where Congress can further  fine tune a system which benefits all  Federal employees. I urge all my col leagues to support this legislation.

Section 126 of the bill clarifies that spe cial pay for VA dentists and physicians will be  treated  in  the same manner  for both  retire ment plans [FERS and CSRS]. Our committee  believes that special pay is essential in order  to  retain  the services of qualified doctors  in  the VA's Department of Medicine and Surgery.

1409,994,20,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of House Concurrent Resolution 197, United  States policy toward Panama.  The Committee on Foreign Affairs has been  following with deep concern developments in  Panama.  In July the committee considered a  resolution regarding the  lack of human rights  and political democracy, but did not bring the  resolution before  the  full House because of  suggestions from various quarters that, given  a  little more  time,  the  powers-that-be  in  Panama would commence a return to real de mocracy.  That has not happened, and it is now time  for the House to state its view loud and clear  that the continued deprivation of basic human  liberties and democracy by the Government of  Panama will affect United States policy and  our relations with that government.  Panama is an old and trusted friend, and it  pains us  to see  its people deprived of their  natural  rights of  freedom of expression and  freedom to chose their own government.  I commend  the gentleman  from California  [Mr. LEVINE] for introducing what I consider to  be a tempered and appropriate response  to  the deplorable situation in Panama.  I urge support for the resolution.  ",1987
1410,994,20,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of House Concurrent Resolution 197,  legisla tion expressing a sense of Congress that the  United States should cease all economic and  military assistance to Panama except for as sistance required  for  immediate humanitarian  concern.  I believe  that recent events  in  this  country justify such an action.  It has become apparent that the executive,  judicial, and  legislative branches of the Gov ernment of Panama are now under the influ ence and control of the Panamanian military.  A broad coalition of church,  labor, business,  civic, and political groups have called  for in vestigations into the allegations of serious vio lations of laws by certain officials of the gov ernment and military in Panama. Many have  demanded  that General Noriega and others  involved resign their positions until an investi gation has been completed.  It  is  indeed  tragic  that  the Panamanian  people are denied the basic rights guaranteed  by their constitution. Arrests without due proc ess, censorship and even closure of the inde pendent media and use of excessive force by  the  Panamanian  Defense  Forces  have  become  common  occurences.  Panama's  problems  can  only be  resolved  through a  return to the rule of law.  When basic human rights are denied  to a  people it is inappropriate for the United States  to offer military or economic aid to that peo ple's government. It is my hope that when this  message is received in Panama, some change  will be  forthcoming. Accordingly,  I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to sup port this timely and sensible resolution.  ",1987

1432,1020,20,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, it gives me great  pleasure to recognize Mrs. Vera Smith as the  recipient of the 5th Congressional Community  Advisory Committee's Ray McDonald Commu nity Achievement Award for the Month of July  1987. The outstanding contributions she has  made to her community through the Chicago  area public libraries are truly deserving of rec ognition.  Mrs. Smith was  initially employed by  the  Stickney/Forest View Library District in Febru ary of 1961 as a library cataloger. She was  later promoted  to  the assistant  librarianship  under Helena Kysela and became the  library  administrator in 1969, a position she retained  until her retirement on January 4, 1986. As  the  library administrator, she assisted  in  the  development of summer programs  for chil dren, preschool story hours, and the teaching  of  library skills  to public and private school  students  from  kindergarten  through  eighth  grade. For  the adults,  she developed pro grams  in  crafts,  travelogs,  insurance,  and  speed  reading. For  those  interested  in  the  arts, she coordinated  local artists with avail able space  for artistic showings  through  the  Cicero-Berwyn Fine Arts Council.  Perhaps most importantly, Mrs. Smith was  instrumental  in changing  the Stickney/Forest  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  View Library  from  its strict  library  form  to a  media concept library by making audio visual  materials-filmstrips, cassettes, 8 mm films, et  cetera-and all equipment necessary for their  use available  to  the public at  the  library.  In  1980, she expanded this concept by introduc ing video cassettes and recorders into the col lection  for patrons use. This new program  alone has  received a  tremendous  response  from  the community. Mrs. Smith also served  her community in other ways. She helped re catalog  the  library  collection  at Nazareth  Academy and  has  served on  the advisory  boards  for  the Suburban Library System and  on various advisory boards at Morton College  in Chicago.  Consistent with her  interest  in  library sci ences, Vera  is an active member and has  chaired and served committees of the Ameri can Library Association, Illinois Library Associ lion, LACONI-Library Administrators Confer ence of Northern Illinois-South Suburban Li brarians Association, Reading Round Table,  and other  library and media associations. In  her years with  the public library she also as sisted in the development of the Suburban Li brary System and the Suburban Library Trust ee Association, an organization she was  in volved with for many years.  I am sure  that my colleagues  join me  in  congratulating Mrs. Smith upon receiving  this  award and thanking her for her dedication to  the public and to knowledge, the most impor tant object libraries contain.  THE PESTICIDE MONITORING  IMPROVEMENTS ACT  HON. JOHN D. DINGELL  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 19, 1987  ",1987
1433,1020,20,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, currently there  is a high level of public concern about pesti cide  residues  in  food, and a February 1987  report of the Environmental Protection Agency  entitled  ""Unfinished Business""  ranked pesti cide residues  in  food as one of the Nation's  most serious health and environmental issues.  Over  the past decade, however, various  re ports have  found serious deficiencies  in  the  Federal Government's program for monitoring  pesticide residues in the food supply.  Today, I plan to introduce, with a number of  distinguished colleagues from the Energy and  Commerce, Agriculture, Appropriations, Gov ernment Operations, and Foreign Affairs Com mittees,  the  ""Pesticide Monitoring  Improve ments Act"" -legislation which would signifi cantly strengthen the Food and Drug Adminis tration's  [FDA] ability  to protect  the public  against unsafe pesticide residues. This legisla tion would address several major problems in  the  FDA's  pesticide monitoring  program,  which were highlighted by an April 30, 1987,  hearing of  the Subcommittee on Oversight  and Investigations.  According  to the testimony of the General  Accounting Office, the Food and Drug Admin istration annually tests less than 1 percent of  domestic and imported food for pesticide resi dues. In view of the small percentage of foods  tested  for pesticides,  it  is crucial  that FDA    October 19, 1987  target  its  testing  resources effectively. The  subcommittee's  hearing,  however,  revealed  large gaps  in  the Agency's testing program.  For example,  the  testimony  indicated  that,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that a category of  pesticides called the EBDC's (ethylenebisdith iocarbamates)  constitutes  the most widely  used fungicides in the world and the fact that  the primary breakdown product of the EBDC's  called ETU (ethylene thiourea) is an acknowl edged carcinogen and teratogen, FDA had not  tested a single sample of  imported  food  for  EBDC's or ETU from fiscal year 1979 through  the first 6 months of fiscal year 1987.  The hearing record established  that FDA's  ability to focus its testing resources effectively  has been seriously  impaired by  inadequate  computerization of  the Agency's data man agement systems, by  insufficient data about  pesticides used on  imported  food,  and by  gaps in the coverage of testing methods gen erally applied by FDA  to determine compli ance with pesticide residue limits. The ""Pesti cide Monitoring  Improvements Act""  responds  to  these problems by requiring FDA to auto mate the summarization of results of its pesti cide monitoring and enforcement program, by  requiring  import documents  to  identify  those  pesticides used on  imported  food during  its  production, by requiring FDA to develop long range research plans for the development and  validation of pesticide analytical methods, and  by requiring FDA to review the potential use of  rapid pesticide analytical methods in its moni toring and enforcement program.  In addition,  the legislation requires FDA to issue laboratory audit guidelines to assure the validity and  reliability of pesticide  residue monitoring  re sults submitted by private laboratories, and it  contains provisions designed to facilitate com munication between FDA and other Federal  and  international agencies and  foreign coun tries exporting  food products  to  the United  States.  The proposed  legislation  is  focused exclu sively on  the pesticide monitoring and en forcement activities of the Food and Drug Ad ministration under  the Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act.  It  is  intended  to comple ment parallel efforts, such as proposals  to  amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act, which would strengthen  the  pesticide  registration authorities of  the Envi ronmental Protection Agency.  A section-by-section analysis of the legisla tion follows.   ~:>  SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS ""PESTICIDE  MONITORING IMPROVEMENTS AcT""  SECTION !-SHORT TITLE  This section names the Act the ""Pesticide  Monitoring Improvements Act.""  SEC. 2-PESTICIDE MONITORING AND  ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION  Summary  This section requires the Food and Drug  Administration <FDA) to establish comput erized data management systems  to track  and evaluate the results of its program for  monitoring  imported  and  domestic  food  products for pesticide residues. The infor mation  summarized under  this provision  must be compiled annually and made avail able  to Federal and State  agencies  and  other interested persons.  ",1987
1434,1033,20,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I yield  4 minutes  to the Senator from Con necticut, who I understand is  in sup port of the cloture motion.  ",1987
1435,1033,20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Connecticut.  ,1987
1436,1033,20,Mr. WEICKER.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of  the cloture motion.  I  have my reservations about the Byrd Warner  amendment;  those  reserva tions are based on the fact that the  amendment still avoids the law of the  land, the War Powers Act.  Let us understand  there  are  two  issues that are involved here-the War  Powers Act and our policy in the gulf.  They are separate and distinct.  Only if the War Powers Act is en acted will the Senate and the Ameri can people have the information nec essary upon which to base their deci sions  relative  to our policies  in  the  Persian Gulf.  In 1982,  the President reported he  sent 1,200 marines  into Lebanon. A  little less than a year later this body  voted to extend that period of time to  18 months.  And only shortly after that, 240 ma rines were killed on the tarmac at Leb anon.  And then people asked the question  that should have been asked before  the Marines were  sent  in  the  first  place. What were  they doirig on the  tarmac? Wasn't that a vulnerable mili tary position? Et cetera, et cetera, et  cetera.  Did it occur to anybody that when  that reflagged Kuwaiti tanker was hit,  for example, that our commitment as  enunciated by the Secretary of State  was only to protect it in international  waters? Well, as soon as you restrict  yourself  to  that extent, that tanker  becomes a sitting duck when it is  in  the harbor and yet  it still flies  the  American  flag. What  is  the United  States going  to do about  it at that  point? Somebody ought  to  ask  the  question as to whether or not it is re sponsible policy  to commit ourselves  only  to  the protection of  that ship  under the American flag while it is in  international waters.  Do you think somebody should have  asked, why did we send arms to Iran?  Why did we send military information  to Iraq? Do you think these are ques tions that are deserving of an answer  before we  commit  as  a matter of  policy?  Nobody is going to argue against the  retaliation against Iranian platforms  in the Persian Gulf. It was an appro priate response. To some of my Demo cratic  friends who are worried with  the President,  let me assure them I  will stand side by side with them to  those who accuse that in any way in vocation of  the War Powers Act  is  being soft on Iran. Nobody is condon ing Iran. Indeed, I  think most of us  would agree  that  the United States  should have a presence in the gulf to  protect the free passage of commerce  in that part of the world. I believe we  all agree on that point.  But I don't know if we did agree on  the policy of reflagging? A policy that  restricts U.S.  protection  to  certain  ships and not others? Those are ques tions that should be asked.  Underlying all of this, the argument  is  that  to continue  to use  the War  Powers Act  is  unconstitutional. We  cannot go running around this country  on our own hook deciding which laws  we are going to obey and which we will  not obey, and saying to ourselves, ""I  do not think this law is constitution al.""  We  have  a  process,  and,  indeed,  when  the Supreme Court declares a  law unconstitutional only  then  is  it  unconstitutional. Constitutionality  is  not based on what Senator WEICKER  thinks  or what  President Reagan  thinks or what Senator WARNER  or  what Senator BYRD thinks.  Lastly, the War Powers Act does ex actly what  the  amendment  does,  except it is currently the law of the  land. The law gives us the information  necessary  to make our decisions and  those decisions of war and peace are  decisions of life and death. Indeed, if  you think we have a commitment to  those who are in the gulf now, I also  would suggest that we have a commit ment to those who will go to the gulf  and we better have  the  facts upon  which to make our decisions.  I yield the floor.  ",1987

1441,1033,20,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President, I rise  in opposition to the cloture motion at  this time.  Let me make a  couple of  statements to begin with.  One, we have not debated the Byrd Warner  amendment. There  has,  in  effect,  been  absolutely  no  debate  whatsoever. The amendment was filed  on October 9 without any debate. We  debated  it very briefly on a  tabling  motion last Friday, about 20 minutes.  Now, we are seeing the cloture motion  being filed on this amendment.  factual  ",1987
1442,1046,20,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, if the ma jority  leader will yield,  if  in  fact  I  could state it is the majority leader's  intention to go  to the Bork nomina tion if we can obtain a time agreement  on this it might be of some help to the  Republican leader.  ",1987
1443,1046,20,Mr. BYRD., That is my intention.  ,1987
1444,1046,20,Mr. DOLE.," I am not certain I can ac commodate the majority leader on a  time agreement on the Bork nomina tion, but I will explore that.  My own view is that after a reasona ble amount of debate  it  is going  to  end. I do not know of anybody on this  side who wants to extend it.  I  think  the point is I want to make the record.  ",1987
1445,1046,20,Mr. BYRD., The question is what is a  reasonable amount of debate?  ,1987

1448,1046,20,Mr. BYRD., Yes.  ,1987
1449,1046,20,Mr. QUAYLE., The majority leader  said disposition of this matter. He is  talking  about  the  pending  Byrd Warner amendment; is that correct?  ,1987

1451,1046,20,Mr. BYRD., I yield.  ,1987
1452,1046,20,Mr. WARNER.," Mr.  President,  it  seems to me we are disposing of the  entire matter which is the pending bill  which would be the underlying amend ment  as well  as  the Byrd-Warner  amendment. The whole thrust of the  debate  today was  to express, and  I  think the vote reflects that, the urgen cy that this body consider these issues.  ",1987
1453,1046,20,Mr. BYRD.," Well, the Senator makes  a very appropriate pertinent point.  The question before  the Senate  is  the Warner-Byrd amendment  in  the  first degree. That is what has been clo tured and not the resolution itself.  But I have authority after consulta tion with  the Republican  leader  to  bring  that matter back before  the  Senate at any  time.  I  think at that  point if we could dispose of the pend ing  question,  then we  can  discuss  where we go from there.  ",1987
1454,1046,20,Mr. QUAYLE., I thank the majority  leader.  ,1987
1455,1046,20,Mr. WARNER.," Mr.  President,  it  would be my hope that the leadership  can reach an understanding as  to a  time agreement on  the  two amend ments, Byrd-Warner, as well as  the  Weicker-Hatfield amendment, so that  we can dispose of these issues and pro ceed to other matters that are of ur gency before this body.  That is entirely a leadership prerog ative and I am confident they will ad dress it.  ",1987

1473,1046,20,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President,  in the  early part of the afternoon, it would  be my desire to read into the RECORD,  if not myself, one of our colleagues in  the Senate, the  transcript of a  tele computer conversation which is being  called to thousands and thousands of  homes across America relative to the  Bork nomination. Because I do not see  one of the parties in the Chamber at  this time, I will refrain from attempt ing to read  this  transcript, which  is  supported by four affidavits, into the  RECORD at this moment.  But I am hopeful that the distin guished Senator from New Hampshire,  Senator HUMPHREY, might be notified  that his name may be used in connec tion with this transcript supported by  four affidavits. I will not now take the  time of the Senate, but merely notify  the parties necessary  to be on  the  floor at that time.  I yield the floor.

1480,1046,20,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I wonder  if I might inquire of the distinguished  majority leader if he has plans on the  schedule of this or whether each Sena tor who wished  to speak should just  seek  recognition  at  an  appropriate  time to be able to speak on the overall  question of the War Powers Act and of  course the pending amendment.  ",1987
1481,1046,20,Mr. BYRD.," Mr.  President,  in  re sponse, first of all, I should say this:  debate must be germane under the clo ture rule to the question that is pend ing. Second, unless we can achieve a  time  agreement,  each Senator may  simply get recognition and utilize his  time under the cloture rule.  I had earlier hoped and still hope  that we might be able  to achieve a  time agreement, which would allow for  a balanced approach on both sides, of  evenly divided time, in which case the  Senate would operate as  it normally  does under any time agreement.  But, absent such a  time agreement,  any Senator may get recognition with out being yielded time by either of the  leaders.  ",1987

I  know of nobody who is proposing to do  that. But once we establish a prece dent, as the Senator knows far better  than I do, it is there.  It seems  to me that the modifica tion, itself, is nongermane to the un derlying amendment, under rule XXII.  It is not a  limitation but a grant of  power, and hence it is nongermane.  I think we can work this thing out. I  do not want the Parliamentarian  to  rule on it until we  think about it a  little. I am concerned about the effect  this may have in the future. I have no  problem with what the Senator wants  to do on this particular legislation. So  I withdraw my point of order tempo rarily.  ",1987

Let me emphasize that the last thing  I want to do is to even appear to be de nying  the  distinguished  majority  leader, Mr.  BYRD,  and  the  distin guished Senator  from Virginia, Mr.  WARNER, an opportunity for a vote on  the second-degree amendment to the  underlying motion to strike and insert.  raise  it  I sug I ask unanimous consent that not withstanding  the provisions of  rule  XXII  the  pending  second-degree  amendment be in order.

1508,1059,20,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  today I  have sent  the following  telegram  to  the President of the United States:  THE PRESIDENT,  The White House,  Washington, DC.  Dear Mr. President: The continuing tur moil in financial markets around the world  requires a reassertion of American financial  leadership. The turmoil began here and we  need to bring it under control here. I urge  that action be taken immediately to restore  confidence in this nation's financial markets  and  in  the  economic  leadership  of  the  United States.  The financial problems confronting this  nation and the world now are too important  to be relegated to rhetorical recriminations.  The double deficits in trade and the budget  are within our power to resolve, if we act co operatively. The leadership in Congress is  prepared to sit down with you to work out  solutions to these problems that are in best  interest of the people. Continued confronta tion is not in the national interest.  I suggest that you convene a meeting of  the bipartisan Congressional Leadership to  reach an agreement on a course of action to  lower our budget and trade deficits.  A clear statement that you will join with  the Congress in moving to reduce the huge  budget and trade deficits is needed. Interna tionally, we need policies  that fulfill  the  earlier pledge that the world's key econo mies will work together to stimulate growth,  reduce  trade  imbalances,  and  stabilize  currencies.  Mr. President, it is  time for all of us to  join together and work toward constructive  solutions for the good of the country.  Sincerely,  RoBERT C. BYRD,  Majority Leader,  U.S. Senate.  Mr. President,  the Speaker and  I,  and others in the Democratic leader ship of the House and Senate, have re peatedly stated to the President that  we want to cooperate, that we do not  want  confrontation. The  time  has  come when that cooperation is going  to be absolutely necessary. I think it  would be a breakthrough that would  renew hope in the money markets in  this country and around the world if  the President would indicate that he is  ready, at last, to sit down with the bi partisan  leadership of both Houses  and work together to lower the budget  deficits and work  together  to enact  reconciliation  legislation  that would  indicate beyond any peradventure of a  doubt that we are determined to bring  the budget deficits down.  It seems to me that this is in order,  it is appropriate, and it is imperative. I  hope the President will join us.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum and I ask that the time be  equally charged.  ",1987

1513,1085,20,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, I wish  to bring to the attention of the Senate  and to the press an incident that is on going right now, which very severely  threatens the southern coast of North  America,  particularly  the States of  Texas and Louisiana.  The incident I point to is an October  10 blowout of a major oil installation  in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of  Mexico.  That  very  large  blowout,  which is currently spewing forth oil,  does  so  in an uncontrolled  fashion,  throwing into the Gulf of Mexico oil  at the rate of 30,000 barrels per day.  As we do business here on the floor  of the Senate, that blowout is continu ing. It has not been stopped. It rivals a  similar type of accident that occurred  off the Bay of Campeche several years  ago, which was a major environmental  disaster, with certainly the potential  for long-term, lasting, negative effects.  That well took several months to cap,  and this well is blowing out at an even  greater rate than the one off the Bay  of Campeche.  As I have indicated, the well contin ues  to discharge oil at  the  rate of  30,000 barrels per day. It has present ed a situation where the spill can now  be measured by an oil slick in the Gulf  of Mexico that is some 250 yards wide  by 55 miles  long,  stretching  in  the  gulf.  The slick is headed in a westerly di rection; and the spill,  if it continues  with the current in the Gulf of Mexico  the way  it happens  to be  in  this  season,  is  likely  to enter  into U.S.  waters, posing a grave potential  for  damage to natural resources and wild life habitat, in addition to the beaches  along the coast of Texas and Louisi ana. And who knows where it might  end up?  We spent a lot of time discussing the  so-called  famous  Ixtoc spill off  the  coast of Mexico in 1977, which spilled  oil into the gulf at the rate of 28,000  barrels per day.  This  incident, by all estimates,  is  even more severe than the situation  that occurred back in 1977. Members  may  remember  that  that spill cost  over $10 million to clean up, with some  of  the damages being damages  that  could  never  be  assessed  by  dollar  figure; damages that occured that can  never be replaced because of the loss  of natural resources in that area.  It is also important to note that ef forts to cap this well that is spewing  oil daily has repeatedly failed over the  last 9 to 10 days, indicating that this is  a situation that has presented some  very special problems.  It  is  interesting  to note  that  the  Mexican Government has  indicated  that they should have it capped within  3 more weeks, they said at least 3 more  weeks.  It is interesting to note that is what  they said the last time a major blow out occurred and we were still talking  about it 9 months later after they said  that they would have it under control.  The second point that I bring this  up for this afternoon is to point out  the critical need for some type of legis lative approach to these types of spills.  ",1987
1514,1098,20,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President,  like  many of my fellow citizens, and my  colleagues on the floor of the Senate, I  am stunned by the sudden and spec tacular decline in the world's financial  markets yesterday-a decline which  measured by the Dow Jones averages  has seen the market decline by some  35 percent since August of this year. A  decline which even  the Wall Street  Journal headlines as ""The Crash of  1987.""  Stunned as we are should this de cline surprise us? Or put differently,  are we surprised that the market has  reversed it's long bull run-or is it the  sudden  timing,  the global scale, and  the  intensity  of  the  reaction  that  shocks us? Speaking as just one Sena tor-but  as  one who  has  followed  American economic policy with great  interest  for many years-! can  say  that I am not surprised to see finan cial markets reacting  to  the persist ence of  two  twin deficits caused by  mismanagement  of U.S.  fiscal  and  trade policy. On the contrary, I only  wonder why it took so long.  For 7 years now the conduct of our  national economic policymaking has  been a lot like the fable about the em peror's new clothes. Enchanted by fan ciful descriptions of wealth and finery  conjured up by a small coterie of unor thodox economic advisors,  the Presi dent has  repeatedly paraded before  the Congress asking us to admire his  commitment to deficit reduction while  all the time the deficit has grown and  grown. Similarly on trade and industri al policy-until yesterday, Wall Street  has pretended that the President-like  the emperor-was wearing a superb set  of new clothes.  There  are many  complex  factors  contributing to the current meltdown  in the stock market. And there is no  consensus on how long, how deep, and  how damaging to our economy this un precedented plunge will be.  Indeed,  there are a great many factors about  which we are not clear. But while the  experts debate  these matters  in the  days and weeks ahead,  let us move  ahead  promptly  on  those matters  about which there is an overwhelming  consensus.  It is absolutely clear that the borrow  and spend policies of the Reagan ad ministration produced the largest Fed eral budget deficit in our history. And  it is clear that this deficit is a funda mental cause of  the conditions  that  produced today's grave economic news.  It is also clear that the world economic  community has lost any confidence it  may have had that this administration  is going to take the steps necessary to  clean up its deficit mess. The White  House and Republican Congressional  ""budget boycott,"" as evidenced most  recently by the Republican walkout of  the Finance  and Ways  and Means  Committee, had a chilling effect in the  world's money markets.  In hearings  before  this Congress  economists from both liberal and con servative  think  tanks  have  under scored the connection between budget  and  trade deficits. Early  this  year  while chairing the Subcommittee on  International Economic Policy of the  Foreign Relations Committee I heard  eloquent  testimony  from economists  from Wall Street, The Brookings Insti tution, the American Enterprise Insti tute, and the Institute for Internation al Economics. Their message was clear.  Budget deficits  induced  increases  in  real interest rates which attracted for eign capital to the United States and  raised the value of the dollar. The in crease in the value of the dollar led to  our  trade  imbalance  as  the  rising  dollar made our exports expensive to  foreigners and their imports cheap to  us.  To reverse the process required are duction in budget deficits which would  lead to a fall in real interest rates and  ultimately a fall  in the dollar and a  correction in our trade imbalance.  But economists also warned that if  the budget deficit were not reduced  the dollar would fall not because inter est rates fell but because foreigners  lost  confidence  in  our  ability  to  manage the U.S. budget deficit. This  free fall in the dollar-as opposed to a  more orderly decline-could result in a  so-called hard landing of a steep reces sion  and/or  upheavals  in  financial  markets.  This analysis has not been seriously  challenged by this administration. Yet  the administration has never seriously  followed  through with a budget pro gram that would result in an orderly  decline in real interest rates and ex change rate value of the dollar and  therefore  a  so-called  recession  free  soft landing.  It is also absolutely clear that the  massive U.S.  trade deficit,  in  large  measure a  reflection of  the Federal  budget deficit, has resulted in a dete riorating dollar and higher  interest  rates. These in turn raise the specter  of both increased inflation and reces sion-or  to  resurrect  the  favored  shorthand of the 1970's ""stagflation.""  The borrow and spend budget profli gacy of  this administration has  re quired an unprecedented foreign cap ital infusion in order to support Amer ican consumption.  In  fact, America,  which was the largest creditor nation  in the world when President Reagan  entered the White House,  is now, as  we all know, the world's greatest inter national debtor.  Two other aspects of our trade defi cit that are clear to all and fundamen tals requiring attention are the failure  to coordinate macroeconomic policies  with our allies and the debt crises of  the Third World. These  are  basic  causes of our current world economic  crisis and must finally be dealt with  seriously and without political postur ing.  One more important item on which  there is consensus is that the current  stock market crisis is not 1929 revisit ed. Most  importantly, all agree that  the  safety  net  established  largely  under Democratic leadership after or  ",1987
1515,1111,20,Mr. SCHULZE.," Mr. Speaker, it re mains to be seen what factors played  the major  role  in yesterday's stock  market tumble. Certainly our retalia tion in the Persian Gulf didn't cause  it. Economic  indicators  alone  could  not, and, do not, indicate a downturn  of any magnitude  related  to yesterday's crash. In fact, more people than  ever are working and America has en joyed 59 months of sustained growth.  While certainly tax increases poised  in Congress may be a major factor, es pecially those provisions in the House  tax bill targeted toward Wall Street, I  doubt  that  even  these  could  have  shaken the foundations of our busi ness community so soundly.  No, Mr. Speaker, it appears that per haps those utilizing program trading  techniques have learned how to dra matically  manipulate  the  stock  market. What better way than to initi ate a panic than to start a selling spree  in a certain blue chip stock, and then  to buy another at a huge discount  after prices drop. Perhaps a large pro gram trader could involve other such  brokers in a massive sell out, knowing  profits would be there for the taking  the next day.  I urge a sustained halt to program  trading, an investigation of those who  utilize this technique, and a close ex amination of who profits  the most  should  today's market rebound dra matically.  PRESIDENT SHOULD  JOIN CON GRESS TO  PUT OUR  FINAN CIAL HOUSE IN ORDER  <Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)  ",1987
1516,1111,20,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, yester day's  record  drop  on Wall Street  points up what so many of us have  been  talking about  for months,  the  huge, soft underbelly in our economy,  bloated by borrowed money, much of  it from foreign creditors. That self-in dulgence could not go on without a  drop  in our standard of  living. The  shot across the bow yesterday was fur ther warning.  The President of our country should  not acquiesce to all of this. He should  not  let  the  roulette of  the market  place attack the problem. He should  accept the responsibility for his own  economic program that has produced  the largest Federal deficits in history  by cutting taxes for the wealthy, bor rowing to the hilt to pay for an enor mous defense build up, and importing  vast amounts of foreign-made goods,  displacing U.S. production. There  is  still  time, Mr. President, for you  to  join Congress at the table and put our  financial house in order, both the red  ink of the Federal budget deficit and  the spiraling trade deficit. It is time to  stop the borrowing. It is time to sign a  trade bill.

Thus, President Ortega and the rev olutionaries of Nicaragua have already  shown their arrogant disregard for the  peace process he had pledged  to re spect.  How long did it take the Soviet-in spired Sandinistas to get a belly full of  freedom of  information? Exactly 14  days. What did the Sandinistas choose  not to have the people hear? An inter view with Lino Hernandez, director of  the independent Permanent Commis sion on Human Rights.

DEFICIT REDUCTION-THE BEST  WAY  TO  CALM  FINANCIAL  MARKETS  <Mr. PEASE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1987
1518,1111,20,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise to  once  again express alarm over  the  panic in financial markets. As I stated  yesterday, the best way to calm the fi nancial markets  is  for  the White  Hom.e to announce that it will negoti ate directly with Congress on a pro gram of significant budget deficit re duction, and I was glad to hear our  Speaker call for that today.  I had always thought of Secretary  Baker as the one competent economic  policymaker in the administration. My  faith in him is shaken by his inexplica ble statement blaming the Democratic  tax  legislation  for  the crash.  If he  really believes that, we are in deeper  trouble than I  thought. The markets  are reacting to U.S.  fiscal policy all  right; they're reacting to the continu ing stalemate on the budget and the  higher interest rates it has created.  It is bad enough that the Reagan ad ministration has mismanaged econom ic policy on a  scale  that leads  to a  stock market crash. I hope that it is  not also failing to actively manage and  contain the crisis.  Mr. Speaker, a stock market crash is  not a spectator sport.

It has  from  the  time it arose back when we were con sidering  the State Department bill,  back even to the time when in fact the  discoveries were made in Moscow.  There is nobody on this floor that  does not believe that the Russians, the  Soviet Union has taken advantage of  the United States and has done it cold bloodedly, deliberately, and probably  effectively.  The problem is always, for us on this  floor,  framing  an  appropriate  re sponse.  It seems to me that with the work  that has been done over the last 6 or 8  months  since  the  revelations  took  place by  the Committee on Foreign  Affairs, by both the chairman of the  Subcommittee on International Oper ations and  its  ranking member, Mr.  MICA, and Ms. SNOWE,  that we could  probably  frame  an  appropriate  re sponse and in fact have done so.

1527,1124,20,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  I, too, have been studying this agree ment and  the  ensuing  construction  practices of the two nations for some  time.  The agreement on Embassies negoti ated by the State Department is a case  of  incomprehensible diplomatic bun gling. Even though the Soviets were  and remain notorious for ignoring the  recognized norms of diplomatic rela tions, virtually no attempt was made  to prevent Soviet espionage activities  against our facility in Moscow, or from  their facility here. The result is a na tional security disaster.  In Washington, the Soviets were al lowed to build their Embassy on the  second highest point in the District of  Columbia.  From  that  location  on  Mount Alto,  the Soviets are able  to  eavesdrop on 70 percent of the private  telephone calls  in  the entire region,  intercept sensitive military communi cations, and train listening devices on  almost every  important Government  facility in this town. Mount Alto offers  them an intelligence bonanza. There  simply is no other real estate in the  Nation's Capital that  is more suited  for spying against American interests.  As  far as  the KGB  is concerned,  if  Washington were a monopoly board,  our State Department has  handed  them Park Place.  In Moscow, by sharp contrast, the  State Department agreed  to  let  the  Soviets prefabricate our Embassy for  us-with little or no supervision from  United States security personnel. The  Soviets built entire walls offsite. As a  distinguished Member of  the other  body put it, ""the KGB was the general  contractor  of  our  Embassy  in  Moscow."" Naturally, it is full of bugs.  We're not talking about a few dozen  microphones hidden in the walls; the  building  is honeycombed with hundred of interconnected; miniature elec tronic devices.  It is nothing but an  eight-story microphone plugged  into  the Politburo.  Now we all understand that mistakes  are sometimes made. Even if the di mensions of  the State Department's  naivete over  the  last 15  years  are  almost incomprehensible, our concerns  may have been allayed if we had some  indication that current State Depart ment officials are committed  to ad dressing the problem effectively.  Mr. Speaker, let me talk about that  point for a moment. Back in February,  a year ago, I had a briefing from State  Department people. Prior to the Mica Snowe trip, they assured me there was  nothing to be concerned about in the  Moscow Embassy. Certainly, they said,  the Soviets are not as good contractors  and builders as  the Americans, and  they pooh-poohed from beginning to  end any allegation of Soviet espionage  in that Embassy. And look what MicA  and SNOWE on their trip found and re ported back  to the American people  after our briefing.  Furthermore, the State Department  official  that was  supposed  to have  been  responsible  for oversight, even  after all we have discovered about the  failure in oversight and the total pre empting of our Moscow Embassy for  espionage purposes, was given a spe cial meritorious security award and a  check for $5,000.  Now, does that tell you or me or any body here that our State Department  all of a sudden has a newborn dili gence in being concerned about the se curity of our Nation? No, we have no  indication of that. Quite the contrary.  Their chief concern today seems to be  to try to deny or minimize the serious  errors  that were made. They have  given an award to the State Depart ment  official  who  supervised  the  fiasco  in Moscow, and they have re cently announced that they will take  an entire year to even decide what-if  anything-to do about the total com promise of our new Moscow facility.  Clearly it is time for us to exercise our  oversight  responsibility and demand  that the State Department take firm  action on this matter.  Mr. Speaker, I must ask the Mem bers, if you are like I am and if you  have been traveling across this coun try, going back home and talking to  the citizens of America, you know the  question has been asked, ""Who wants  the Soviets off Mount Alto?"" And the  answer that I have heard resoundingly  clear from everybody,  including taxi cab drivers in this town who will take  any of us up there with disdain and  disgust and point out the deplorable  circumstance, the answer is this: You  ask any American citizen you want,  and you will be  told, ""We want the  Russians off Mount Alto."" So it is time  that the decision be made and taken  ",1987

It seems to me  on  this  issue,  as  on other human  rights  issues,  it  is crystal clear and  critical  that we  in  the Government,  executive and legislative, must speak  with one voice,  that we must speak  with a  firm voice,  indeed we must  speak with a  loud voice because it is  absolutely  clear only pressure may  work.

There is  almost unanimity of thought here in  the Congress and among the American  people that we must do something to  redress the Soviet invasion there. But  unfortunately, it has, because there is  too little controversy, become the for gotten war.  Many of the important points sur rounding this issue have been brought  to  the forefront. My California col league, Mr. LAGOMARSINO, made a very  important  statement when  he  said  that one picture is worth a thousand  words, and there are some very graph ic pictures which have come from this.  I think if we look at the report that  was done by Charles Norchi of  the  Committee for a Free Afghanistan on  the human  rights violations  in Af ghanistan, the people in the Congress  and the American people will be very,  very distressed. That full report is due  to come out within the next couple of  weeks.  But I have a picture which I have  shown  on  the House  floor  several  times, but I think it needs to be shown  again. What I have in my mind, Mr.  Speaker, is a part of a butterfly bomb,  a cluster bomb, which is used by the  Soviets when they fire off of the MI24, the Hind D attack helicopter. We  all know the tremendous capability of  that, what is known as the most pow erful helicopter around. What hap pens here is that this little butterfly  bomb is part of about 200 in a cluster  which shoots as a cartridge off  the  MI-24. It then floats  to the ground,  and there are just enough explosives  in here, just enough power not to kill  someone, but  to maim a  child, and  many  young  children  have  picked  these up.  We know very well that throughout  history, tragically children have been  the victims of war. The unfortunate  fact of life in Afghanistan is that with  these kinds of devices the Soviets have  made children the targets of war.  That  is a  sad commentary.  I con gratulate my colleagues for introduc ing this resolution, and I urge every  Member of the House to vote in behalf  of it.  ",1987
1533,1137,20,Mr.  TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of House Resolution 277, con demning Soviet human  rights abuses  in Af ghanistan. Mr. Speaker, despite the new lead ership of Mikail Gorbachev and his glasnost  policies,  the Soviet Union continues to main tain a huge military presence  in Afghanistan  and the Soviet Army continues to oppress the  Afghan people. Contrary to recent Soviet pro nouncements, an estimated 120,000 Soviet  troops  remain  in Afghanistan  and  another  30,000 are posed on  the border  ready  to  attack. Despite  these overwhelming military  odds,  the mujaheddin  continue  to  struggle  against their Communist oppressors.  As a nation dedicated to  freedom and  the  protection of basic human  rights,  it  is vitally  important for the United States to continue to  speak out against human  rights abuses-no  matter where they occur. To  turn a deaf ear  on  the plight of  the people of Afghanistan  would be a great crime. This  is one  reason  why  this  resolution  is so  important.  It states  clearly to the world how the American people  feel about human rights and  it further shows  the  resolve of Congress and  the Nation  to  continue to support the struggle for freedom.  Equally  important, Mr. Speaker,  is  the  fact  that  this  resolution urges  the State Depart ment to take steps aimed at encouraging the  Soviet Union  to withdraw  its  troops entirely  from Afghanistan and allow the people of that  war-torn country  to establish a nonaligned,  democratic  government.  House Resolution  277 also urges the Soviet Union to present a  timetable  for  the complete withdrawal of  its  troops. This  timetable  is not  to exceed 4  months.  In the Gorbachev era of glasnost I believe it  is crucial  that  the United States seize  this  window of opportunity  to not only negotiate  with the Soviets on issues such as arms con trol, Soviet Jewry, and conventional force re ductions-but also discuss other apsects of  Soviet behavior around  the world. Glasnost  may be just a cosmetic change, but the fact is  the Soviets are talking. Mr. Grobachev may be  growing weary of the war in Afghanistan. As a  result, he may, in fact, pull out of Afghanistan.  But, as  far as we here  in  this Chamber are  concerned, our policy should not concentrate  on what  the Soviets may or may not do,  rather, it should continue to stress and call for  the withdrawal of all Soviet troops on a timely  fashion, and  the establishment of an  inde",1987

1537,1163,20,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  want to talk about the bear market we  have seen in the last few days, how it  happened and what it means.    It is fascinating that on August 23  on a page 1 of New York Times story,  the Western White House announced  that it no longer had enough power on  Capitol Hill to stop a trade bill which  would start a protectionist trade war,  to stop a catastrophic  insurance bill  that was written in such a way that it  was a massive tax increase, and that in  fact Reaganism would have to compro mise with Carterism, and the White  House can no  longer  stop  the  left  which now dominated the House and  the other body.  Two  days  after  that New York  Times article was the peak of the bull  market,  and  as  investors  began  to  watch and realize that the left was se rious, the left wanted to raise taxes on  those who  save and  invest,  and on  those who work.  The left wanted to risk a trade war  with the protectionist bill that risked  German and Japanese investors pull ing out and risk breaking up the world  market. The  left wanted  to pass a  bigger welfare  system putting more  burden on  those who want  to work,  and less incentive for those on welfare,  that the  left was passing already a  dozen bills in the House and the other  body increasing new Government pro grams, new power in Washington, new  redtape.  Then with the debate and the fight  over the nomination of Judge Bork to  the Supreme Court, it became increas ingly obvious that the Reagan White  House and Reaganism had lost power  in the National Capital, that the left  was increasingly in charge, increasing ly arrogant, and increasingly willing to  dominate.  In that setting,  it  is  little wonder  that people who had  lived  through  Jimmy Carter's years of 22-percent in terest rates, 13-percent inflation, mas sive unemployment,  the collapse of  the American economy, as they looked  at the left in both the House and the  other body, offered to re-create Jimmy  Carter's disaster, and as they looked at  the constant drumbeat of ""Let's raise  taxes,"" more taxes from those on the  left, and as they looked at the increas ingly confident threat of a trade war,  that savers, people who worried about  the  future,  came  to  the conclusion  that  we  are  drifting  away  from  Reagan and Reaganism and back into  the policies of  the  left which had  made America so sick in the 1970's.  Monday's 500-point drop in the stock  market  shocked  everyone,  and we  ought to be honest about how severe a  challenge it is.  The Speaker today offered a biparti san response, and let me suggest to night, there is a very easy bipartisan  response.  Take  the Reconciliation  Program  which has so far been written only in a  narrow partisan way by  the Demo crats, open it up, allow the Republi cans to be involved in writing the rec onciliation bill. Take out the welfare  increase which has been added to rec onciliation, and  recognize we cannot  afford it.  Take out all the new programs we  cannot afford. Get serious about defi cit reduction and cutting spending.  If the gentleman from Texas  [Mr.  WRIGHT],  the Speaker  is  sincere,  to morrow the Speaker has a very easy,  very simple job.  All the gentleman has to do is pull  back all of the partisan parts of the  reconciliation that have already been  written,  pull  back  the Democratic  Ways and Means package, pull back  the Democratic packages  from each  committee,  offer  to  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  [Mr. MICHEL]  and  the  House Republicans a  truly bipartisan  task force, and within 2 or 3 days in a  bipartisan way, we can write a debt-re duction package for reconciliation that  is  real,  that cuts spending  for  real,  that achieves the goal we want, that  increases revenue by offering a 15-per cent capital gain, so  that there are  more jobs created, so more money is  invested in the stock market, so we re build confidence on the part of those  interested in America's future.  That kind of a  true bipartisan ap proach by  the Speaker would mean  something; but  if in fact  the Demo crats  intend  to  ram  through a one sided leftwing tax increase, bigger-wel fare-system bill, then they should not  get up here and talk about partisan ship.  If they are determined to dominate  the House with a machine, they ought  to be honest with the country, and  they ought  to be honest about  the  degree  to which  it is  the Gephardt Wright bear market theory, the Gep hardt-Wright sector of the liberal wel fare state, a tax increase which is scar ing those who would invest in Ameri ca's future.  INTRODUCTION  OF  LEGISLA TION  TO DELAY  90-PERCENT  THRESHOLD ESTABLISHED  IN  TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986  ",1987
1538,1163,20,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from California [Mr. McCAND LEss] is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. McCANDLESS. Mr.  Speaker,  our constituents should not be penal ized for  the mistakes of the Federal  Government. We should not pass a  law; make  it extremely difficult  for  people to comply with  that law; and  then  fine people  for not complying.  Yet that is exactly what we have done.  For good or for bad, the Tax Reform  Act of 1986 made major changes in our  tax laws. Many of these changes will  not be recognized or understood until  taxpayers prepare  their  returns  for  1987. One of those changes is the re quirement that workers have at least  90 percent of their total tax liability  withheld.  To assist taxpayers with that obliga tion, the IRS was to design a new W-4  form. The IRS got off to a late start.  There was a series of proposed forms,  and many provisions. Finally the IRS  issued a new W-4. That led to a deluge  of questions and complaints  to  the  IRS and congressional offices. With  congressional pressure, the IRS went  back  to  the drawing board and pro duced yet another form, Form W -4A.  Workers had until October 1 to file a  new W-4 with their employer.  As  a  result of  IRS  foot-dragging,  many Americans who acted  in good  faith and who complied fully with the  law, will not meet the new 90 percent  withholding threshold. Consequently,  they will be subjected to tax penalties  next year.  Today, I am introducing legislation  to correct that injustice. My bill would  simply delay the 90 percent threshold  for 1 year. This would give our con stituents  an  opportunity  to  under stand and to comply with the new law  without being subjected to penalties.  My colleagues, if you are concerned  about  this  injustice,  I  invite you  to  join me  in cosponsoring  this  legisla tion.  THE PARTY IS OVER  ",1987

Howard and  I came to the Congress about  the same time in the mid-fifties, and we soon  become good  friends. We sat on  the same  side of the political aisle, and we worked to gether as Members of this great body for 17  years until Howard's retirement in 1975. Out side of our assocation in the House, we lived  in  the same neighborhood with our children  growing up together and our families becom ing close.  As a  legislator and  in his personal  life,  Howard was always a kind and considerate  person. He was never affected by the atmos phere of Washington, and always remained a  down-to-earth person in his relations with ev eryone he met,  from his colleagues  in  the  Congress,  to his staff, his constituents, and  his neighbors.  *  Howard was a conscientious and dedicated  Member of the Congress who brought honor  to  this body.  I remember his fine work as a  member of the House Appropriations Commit tee,  and  how  carefully  he  considered  the  many issues of those years.  I particularly re member  the  difficult  internal  debate  that  Howard went  through as his disillusionment  with our military involvement in Southeast Asia  grew, and again over  the question of Presi dent Nixon's involvement in the Watergate in cident.  Howard was a public servant  in  the  finest  sense of  the  term, as he  looked after  the  needs and  concerns of his constituents  in  New York's 27th District, which  included  the  Binghamton, Elmira,  and  Ithaca areas. He  worked late into the evenings on behalf of his  constituents, and his concerns voiced  their  approval time and again by sending him back  to Washington as their representative.  Mr. Speaker, my wife, Jane, and  I mourn  the death of our close  friend, Howard Robi son, and we join my colleagues in the House in  extending our deepest sympathies to his wife,  Trudy, and their children. May their deep feel ings of loss be lessened through the support  of  their  friends  in  the Congress and around  the country.  Mr. McHUGH. I thank my colleague  for his remarks.

1543,1176,20,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to take a little bit of time this evening  to discuss the roller coaster perform ance of the stock market the last few  days and entitle my  remarks some thing that was written in a Wall Street  Journal editorial within the last day  or two, ""Tax Increases Are Bearish.""  0 1935  I  think  it  is  important to  look at  what has brought about the current  problems  for  the stock market. We  have heard a number of  interpreta tions on this floor in the course of the  day about what has gone wrong. We  have heard Reaganomics blamed; we  have heard deficits blamed; we have  heard trade deficits blamed. We have  heard all kinds of interpretations of  what went wrong.  The fact  is, probably all of  them  have  some validity. Some of  these  issues have each played a part in what  took place. But the fact is that there is  something  that  caused  the  stock  market to take a particular plunge at a  particular time. The budget deficit has  been with us for some years. The last  time we balanced the budget in this  country goes back to fiscal year 1969,  so certainly  the stock market's per formance has lived with budget defi cits for some time.  The trade deficit is very worrisome,  but  in fact  it has been with us for  many months, and the stock market  has risen dramatically during many of  those months when the trade deficit  was going up, not coming down, as it is  now.  The  conditions  that others  have  mentioned about the economy, such as  the liquidity and Federal Reserve per formance,  sure,  they  could  have  played a  role. But  the  fact  is  that  some of those things have also been  obvious in the economy over a period  of some weeks and months.  But there is something which took  place which parallels the plunge in the  stock market, and  that  is  that  the  plunge  in  the stock market started  when Congress appeared to be really  serious about raising taxes.  Some will say that the idea of tax in creases  has been  around  for  some  time. The stock market certainly  is  discounting for that. I think it is fair  to believe that some people not direct ly associated with Washington and not  necessarily attuned to all of the things  that we do in Disneyland on the Poto mac would believe that we just could  not have been serious about those tax  increases. There are certainly  some  people who would interpret it as being  so ludicrous to talk about tax increases  that it certainly could not have been  real even in Washington.  So when the Speaker of the House  some months ago  suggested  to  the  stock market that the way to get taxes  was to tax stock transfers, many inves tors thought well, you know, that is so  silly that it just cannot be real. They  cannot really be contemplating at a  time when investments are going up,  when capital is being created in the  country of  taxing  the  formation of  that capital. It cannot be real.  Then, when other proposals have  come forth for the taxation of capital  and  of  investments, many  people  seeing the performance of the econo my and understanding that we have  had 59 months of growth could have  certainly  told  themselves  they  just  cannot be serious about it.

It  has been  featured  in every  travel magazine  and  in numerous other publications because  of its great natural beauty and its many cultur al offerings.  It is widely considered to be the  cultural heart of the region and among the art  capitals of the country.  The natural attributes of Santa Fe, its ethnic  and cultural diversity, and  its  low-key atmos phere have attracted generations of artists, in cluding such well-known  figures as Georgia  O'Keeffe, Ansel Adams, and D.H. Lawrence,  as well as many other lesser known but equal ly gifted individuals.  Last week, I was pleased to learn of an ex hibition  recognizing  the contributions of Wil liam Lumpkins to Santa Fe's artistic develop ment. Mr. Lumpkins' works  in watercolor are  the subject of a new retrospective exhibit at  the Jonson Gallery of the University of New  Mexico. I have long enjoyed and admired Mr.  Lumpkins' paintings and  I am glad  that  they  are being brought  to  the attention of more  New Mexicans.  It is time that this pioneer in  New Mexico's art world be honored.  The  following article from  the Albuquerque  Journal  traces Mr.  Lumpkins' upbringing  in  one of New Mexico's pioneer families and the  influence of that experience on his career as  an architect and painter.  I am proud to have such a gifted and distin guished gentleman among my  constituents  and I hope you enjoy reading about his work.  [From the Albuquerque Journal, Oct. 11,  1987]  PIONEER UPBRINGING SPARKS LUMPKINS'  DESIGNS, PAINTINGS  <By William Clark)  William Lumpkins is a dapper, gray-haired  man, with a kindly, softspoken manner that  masks a prolific energy.  At 78, he is known primarily as an archi tect, as an early proponent of solar design  and  a  champion  of  adobe  construction,  about which he has written  three books.  Lumpkins  has  planned  everything  from  shopping malls  to award-winning historic  renovations-some 1,800 buildings in all.  But there  is another side  to  this man.  Throughout his distinguished career, he has  also been an innovative artist. Thirty-nine  works, primarily watercolors, are in a retro spective exhibit at the University of New  Mexico's Jonson Gallery.  Seated in the living room of his home in  the  hills  north  of  Santa  Fe, wearing  stitched cowboy boots, a plum-colored shirt  with a gray bandana knotted at his throat,  Lumpkins describes roots that run deep in  New Mexico's frontier past.  ""My father came west from Kentucky in  1880 as a hunter for a wagon train, and then  worked  for  the Matador Ranch  in west  Texas,"" Lumpkins says. ""It was all open  range then, and he saw that all you had to  do was register a brand and go to work rais ing cattle.""  The elder Lumpkins chose  the SS Bar  marking and moved to New Mexico around  1883 where, on the Rabbit Ears Ranch west  of Clayton, William Lumpkins was born in  1909.  Growing up there, then on a ranch in Ari zona, and finally on another New Mexico  ranch on  the south side of  the Capitan  Mountains, Lumpkins experienced a kind of  pioneer upbringing that would influence the  rest of his life, spark his own explorations  and experiments in his chosen fields of ar chitecture and art.  ""My main asset has  always been my curiosity,"" he says with a  grin.  Living at  the Capitan  ranch, attending  Roswell High School and already beginning  to draw, Lumpkins established  two  impor tant  friendships-with  artist Peter Hurd  and writer Paul Horgan-that helped shape  his nascent artistic  impulse. ""I met Pete  Hurd when  I was  a  sophomore  in high  school, and he had a lot of influence on me  early on Lumpkins says. ""He'd already been  back east' to study with N.C. Wyeth, and I  though the wiltiest, most romantic thing I  could  think of was  to be an artist. He'd  come up  to  the  ranch at Thanksgiving,  Christmas, spring break, and we'd hit for  the hills and he'd do India ink drawings,""  Lumpkins remembers.  ""Pete was doing watercolors,  too. Paul  Horgan, who was the librarian at the New  Mexico Military Institute, got him started  on those,"" Lumpkins says. Horgan, himself  a watercolorist as well as writer, also broad ened the horizons of the two young artists  by loaning them art books from the insti tute's  library.  ""There were  about  seven  members of the intelligentsia in Roswell at  that time, and Paul was the leading light,""  Lumpkins says.  In 1929, Lumpkins moved on  the UNM,  where he took mostly classes in art, includ ing a watercolor course. ""It fascinated me,""  Lumpkins says, ""and I knew I'd found my  medium.""  Over the last half century, Lumpkins has  experimented with a variety of media,  in cluding acrylics, printmaking, collage, and  clay sculpture, but water color has remained  his medium of choice. ""It does marvelous  things on  its own,"" Lumpkins says, ""The  color runs, mixes, and if you work with it,  don't try to control it, it will help you. You  can't control water color unless you're a  complete master.''  Lumpkins did achieve that mastery as one  painting in the Jonson Gallery retrospective  demonstrates.  ""Untitled,""  is  drawn  with an architect's precision <it was in fact  at about this time that Lumpkin's designed  his first solar building). But another water color, ""Dancing Trees,"" 1930, with  its vi brant,  quivering movement,  its  sense  of  barely contained energy, is more indicative  of the direction Lumpkins' art would take.  ""I started fooling with abstraction while I  was at UNM, and by 1930-31 I was pretty  well into it, there was a bit of the rebel in  me,"" Lumpkins says. An encounter with the  landscape painting of John Marin in 1931  reinforced Lumpkins' instinct  for abstrac tion.  ""I saw his work in Taos and it just blew  me wide open,"" Lumpkins remembers. ""The  pictures were leaning against the wall and I  was reading them as abstracts it turned out  they were upside down,"" he says with a  chuckle. ""But they were based on abstrac tions, and they worked either way.""  In 1935, Lumpkins' interest in abstraction  led  to another  influential friendship,  this  time  in Santa Fe, with painter Raymond  1935,  17  ""Des Architecture de  Jonson,  for whom  the Jonson Gallery  is  named. Learning that Lumpkins was an ab stract painter,  Jonson  asked  to  see  the  young artist's work and then, in 1938, invit ed him to join the Transcendental Painting  Group founded in Santa Fe.  ""The group was organized primarily to try  and generate shows,"" Lumpkins says. ""If  you did abstracts, you were pretty much ex cluded  from  local exhibitions-the whole  thrust at  that  time was American  land scapes or pictures of the working man. The  group was founded on the idea of abstrac tion, it was 'transcendental' in the diction ary meaning of 'to go beyond' reality. We  thought that, as a group, we could kick open  a few doors, and we did-we were shown at  the San Francisco World Fair,  the New  York World Fair, the museum in New York  that became the Guggenheim.""  The Transcendental Painting Group split  up with the coming of World War II and  Lumpkins, a pilot, was commissioned as a  flight instructor in the U.S. Navy, ultimate ly becoming chief of flight operations  in  Memphis, Tenn. He returned to Santa Fe  after the war, and then moved to La Jolla,  Calif., where he lived and worked as an ar chitect  for  years before  returning  to  Santa Fe in 1967.  Lumpkins' architectural work has brought  honor-a National Historic  Preservation  Award;  inclusion  in  Terre,"" a landmark exhibition on earth ar chitecture at the Centre Georges Pompidou  in Paris; and a Governor's Award for Excel lence and Achievement in New Mexico for  painting as well as architecture.  Through the years, Lumpkins has always  painted. ""There's an urge you can't stop,""  he says simply. ""I work very fast and I don't  start with a preconceived idea. I  just face  the paper or canvas, start with a bit of  color, a squiggle or two, and feel it out from  that-you're working with it, you're moving  it, and it just happens. That's what a water color should be-a happening.""  Lumpkins also describes a long fascination  with Asian philosophy, with Zen Buddhism  in particular, and its influence is evident in  his work, seen in his deft, quick, bold brush  strokes.  Many of the works  in the Jonson show  echo the shapes of Asian calligraphy;  the  use of the white field of paper in Lumpkins'  abstract landscapes evokes the subtle, feath ery brush strokes of Japanese sumi  (ink)  work or Chinese landscape painting.  Lumpkins has written many ""koans,"" the  brief riddles or statements used by Zen mas ters to provoke thought, and in these writ ings he speaks of "". . . a oneness with the  instant without habit, conditioned attitudes,  learned behavior patterns, attachments or  revulsions.""  ""Architecture and painting are two differ ent worlds,"" Lumpkins muses. ""Architecture  is about 5 percent creativity and 95 percent  work, while painting can be completely cre ative.  ""Architecture  is  discipline-painting  freedom,"" he says. ""I need both.""  is  ",1987

Mae Della Wilkerson was honored this past  August at a banquet sponsored by  the Mis souri Departmt;!nt of Elementary and Second ary Education as a Pioneer in Education. The  award signifies this woman's outstanding serv ice and contribution to public education.  Mrs. Wilkerson  began  her  professional  career as a teacher at Neosho in 1942. Over  the years she has  taught math, home eco nomics, English, and special education. She  has also been a principal.  In 1955, she received certification to teach  mentally  retarded  children. After  teaching  briefly in Odessa, she returned  to Lexington,  where she  taught handicapped students  for  20 years.  To  recognize  her exemplary accomplish ments over  the years, Mrs. Wilkerson was  honored by the Lexington Community Teach ers Association when she was voted ""Teach er of  the Year""  for 1982. She also received  the Central Missouri Teachers Association  ""Outstanding Educator Award.""  Mr. Speaker, Lexington was certainly fortu nate to have had such a fine educator in  its  school system. Let me take this opportunity to  commend Mae Della Wilkerson  for all her  years of service and  to congratulate her on  her recent award.  CLEVELAND CITY CLUB'S 75TH  ANNIVERSARY  HON. MARY ROSE OAKAR  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 20, 1987  ",1987
1546,1202,20,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, on October 28,  the City Club in Cleveland will be celebrating  its 75th anniversary with an anniversary dinner  that will be held at  the Stouffer Tower City  Plaza Hotel in Cleveland, OH. The Cleveland  City Club was founded on October 28, 1912.  One hundred eleven people attended the first  meeting. The main  speaker was Cleveland  Mayor Newton D. Baker, who went on  to  serve as Secretary of War from 1916 to 1921.  Since that time, the City Club has had an un interrupted schedule of distinguished speakers  from all parts of  the United States and  the  world, offering a  forum  for  their  ideas and  views. This outstanding record has earned the  City Club  the reputation as a citadel of free  speech.  Fittingly, the theme of the City Club's 75th  anniversary dinner will  be  ""The Power of  Ideas."" Eight outstanding and articulate AmerEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  icans will give a  focused,  concentrated 5minute talk during which they will develop and  address themselves to a single idea related to  their  respective  fields. The  speakers come  from  a wide  variety of professions: Mario  Cuomo, Governor of New York; John Kenneth  Galbraith, the economist and Presidential ad visor; Jeanne Kirkpartick, former U.S. Ambas sador  to  the United Nations; Dr. C. Everett  Koop, Surgeon General of the United States;  Eleanor Holmes Norton, lawyer and educator;  T. Boone Pickens, chairman of Mesa Petrole um Co.; Felix G. Rohatyn, Wall Street finan cier; and Gloria Steinem, publisher of Ms.  Magazine.  ""We feel this is a most appropriate way to  observe  75  years  of  'America's soapbox,'  where people  from many walks of  life have  been able to use the City Club as a vehicle to  express a wide variety of views to the public,''  said David T. Sindell, president of  the City  Club.  Cleveland commentator Rena Blumberg  is  chairperson of the banquet advisory commit tee. She expects more  than 1,000 guests to  attend the anniversary dinner.  Over the past 75 years, the City Club has  been host to  literally  thousands of speakers  who presented their ideas and tested them in  the  invariably  lively discussion  that  followed.  The City Club has an admirable record  that  exemplifies  our  country's  tradition  of  free  speech and our national propensity to debate  issues.  I want to add my voice of congratula tions  to the City Club on  its diamond jubilee  and wish  this venerable  institution continued  success in promoting the ""Power of Ideas.""  I am proud to represent Greater Cleveland  and proud of the Cleveland City Club, truly a  citadel of free speech.  THE  25TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE PLUMB BEACH CIVIC AS SOCIATION  HON. CHARLES E. SCHUMER  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 20, 1987  ",1987
1547,1202,20,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  recognize  today  the 25th anniversary of  the  Plumb Beach Civic Association  from my dis trict in Brooklyn. Their motto ""For the Better ment of  the Community"" only hints at  the  dedication of  this  fine group of citizens who  have freely given their time and effort over 25  years and brought great changes and  im provements to their neighborhood.  Plumb Beach Civic has worked  for better  parks, streets, and other public areas, making  them beautiful and safe. They constantly mon itor the quality of government services, striving  to improve the lives of those in the communi ty. They sponsor public events such as  the  annual Memorial Day parade and ceremonies.  They are involved in  local government, acting  as an important link between the people and  their  elected  officials.  Plumb  Beach Civic  touches every aspect of community  life and  serves as testament to the strength of people  willing  to give of  themselves  to  improve  the  neighborhood they live in.  On Sunday, October 24, the group is hold ing a ceremony marking  this anniversary.  I  October 20, 1987  take this occasion to offer Plumb Beach Civic  Association  and  their  President Margaret  McCord congratulations on 25 successful and  productive years and my best wishes  for 25  more.  A TRIBUTE TO DR. FREDERICK  C. ROBBINS  HON. EDWARD F. FEIGHAN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 20, 1987  ",1987
1548,1202,20,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  today  like to recognize the very important work and  many achievements of one of America's lead ing physicians, Frederick C. Robbins, who has  not only won a Nobel Prize for research that  led ultimately to the elimination of polio as a  threat to the lives of our children and young  people, but who also has been one of  the  country's foremost medical educators.  In recognition of his distinguished contribu tions to the field, Dr. Robbins, who is universi ty professor emeritus of the School of Medi cine of Case Western Reserve University  in  Cleveland, will on November 8  receive  the  1987 Abraham Flexner Award  in a ceremony  at  the Washington Hilton Hotel. This award,  which is given annually by the Association of  American Medical Colleges,  is  the highest  honor in the field of medical education.  As a  testament  to  the quality and  impor tance of the academic program at Case West ern Reserve's medical school, Dr. Robbins is  the  fourth  faculty member  to win a Flexner  Medal since  the award was established  in  1958. Case Western Reserve medical faculty  have won more Flexner Medals  than  any  other medical school in the United States.  Dr. Frederick Robbins  shared  the Nobel  Prize for physiology and medicine in 1954 for  his studies of the polio virus  in an era when  the crippling disease afflicted  thousands of  children and young people across the country  and around the world. He was part of a medi cal team that developed a reliable method for  cultivating viruses  in  test  tubes,  introducing  the modern tissue culture era of virus discov ery. Dr. Robbins and his colleagues were re sponsible  for a major breakthrough  in  the  method  of producing  viruses  for  vaccines,  and,  indeed,  they paved  the way with  these  landmark achievements  for  the development  of the two polio vaccines.  Dr. Robbins  joined  the Case Western Re serve medical faculty and became head of the  pediatrics department at Cleveland Metropoli tan General Hospital-known  then as City  Hospital-in  1952,  at  a  time  when  the  school's new curriculum was  revolutionizing  medical education and  focusing  international  attention on Cleveland.  He was dean of  the school of medicine  from 1966 to 1980, during which time student  enrollment nearly doubled and many physi cians and scientists of national and  interna tional eminence joined the faculty. In 1980, he  became president of the Institute of Medicine  of  the National Academy  of Sciences  in  Washington, an important and prestigious po sition he held until March 1986, when he re turned to Case Western Reserve as university  ",1987
1549,1215,20,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. Speaker, I support  the concept of a  summit because  I  think it is time that we do something  about the deficit. But in order for us  to have any chance of success, we  must go into it, as has been suggested  by the Speaker, with no preconditions,  including no preconditions that we ad dress the problem by raising taxes.  There must be spending cuts. We  must agree  that we will  look at  it  across the board. If you are talking  about a summit where the Democrats  walk in and say, Mr. President, you are  going to take taxes and that is how we  are going to address the problem, we,  the Republicans, are not buying it. It  has to be across the board, and that is  the way we should approach it.  But I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that  if this body is serious about really ad dressing the economic problems of the  country and the deficit, the first thing  you should do is to pull the ridiculous  reconciliation, tax increase, and spend ing bill on welfare  that you have  scheduled for next week. Then we will  see if you are serious. Then we can get  on with the serious business of the  country.  THE EFFECTS OF SEQUESTRA TION ON AGRICULTURE  <Mr. THOMAS of Georgia asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1987
1550,1215,20,Mr.  THOMAS  of  Georgia.," Mr.  Speaker, in the simplest terms, seques tration will mean the removal of 8.5  percent from each of our farmers' in comes. That  reduction will  literally  come out of the hides of our farmers  at a time when they have shown the  first signs of recovery from a financial  crisis equal to the days of the Great  Depression.  It is unanimously agreed that the  farm bill is bearing the fruits of suc cess planned on by the Congress when  it was drafted in 1985. This is clearly  illustrated by the fact that farm prices  are rising and exports are increasing.  The cost to the taxpayers for the  U.S. farm program is expected to drop  37 percent-to $16.2 billion-in fiscal  year 1988 compared with 1986 levels,  according to the revised budget esti mates of the Office of Management  and Budget. In large part, that reduc tion is due to the fact that the 1988  price support figures, which have al ready been announced, fall significant ly below 1987  levels with an 8.5 per cent cut under Gramm-Rudman-Hol lings,  these  payments  to  farmers  would decline even further.  The  Agriculture  Committee  has  carefully drafted its recommendations  to reach the $1.3 billion cut needed to  meet its budget reconciliation. Those  cuts were designed to provide the most  painless impact possible on our agri cultural  community. Defeat of  the  budget reconciliation and allowing se questration to  take effect will mean  that we are opening a Pandora's box  of across-the-board problems for U.S.  farmers and this could easily mean the  difference between a farmer staying in  business or simply becoming another  statistic as a foreclosure.  Therefore,  I would urge my  col leagues to work in a bipartisan effort  to avoid sequestration.  REAGAN POLICIES NOT RESPON SIBLE  FOR  STOCK MARKET  CRASH  <Mr. GEKAS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1987
1551,1215,20,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, who did  not know  that  the Reagan baiters  would seize  the platform as soon as  possible after the Wall Street aberra tion  to blame  the President of  the  United States for what happened.  They have forgotten completely or  refused  to  acknowledge  that  the  lowest unemployment rate in a genera tion is also the President's. The steady  growth for 60 months of the economy  is also  the President's. The keeping  down of  inflation  is also  the Presi dent's. The gross national product up surge of the last 60 months is also the  President's.  The President of the United States  is correct. This economy, so long as we  do not blast it away, is in good shape.  All we need to do as a people and as a  Congress  is  to have confidence  that  the strongest Nation in the world will  remain strong in every arena.  TO  AD STOCK  0 1015  BIPARTISAN  SUMMIT  DRESS  CAUSES  OF  MARKET CRASH  <Mr. ALEXANDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1987
1552,1215,20,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  take this time to publicly thank the  President for accepting your invitation  to meet at a bipartisan summit to ad dress the causes of the stock market  crash this week. Most Americans al ready know that one of the reasons for  the crash is that we as a nation are  living  too high,  spending  too much  money, accumulating  too much pri vate and public debt.  Mr. Speaker, I propose for consider ation at the summit the establishment  of a national energy policy, the result  of which would reduce the trade defi cit. We cannot afford to spend $40 bil lion a year for foreign oil. This would  also  reduce  the trade deficit,  reduce  the budget deficit, by cutting the cost  of maintaining the farm programs and  make us energy independent, provide a  clean environment because air would  be cleaner for us.  Mr. Speaker, proposing a national  energy policy at the economic summit  will be an important step toward fiscal  sanity.  BIG SOUTH FORK NATIONAL  FOREST IS TRULY BEAUTIFUL  <Mr. BURTON of Indiana asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1987
1553,1215,20,Mr.  BURTON  of  Indiana.," Mr.  Speaker, this past weekend I had the  opportunity to go down to Kentucky  at  the  invitation  of  Congressman  ""HAL"" ROGERS of the Fifth Congres sional District. ""HAL"" has been a good  friend and I really appreciated the in vitation to come down and see what  his district was  like.  I  tpok my  two  children and my wife down there.  He took us on a trip through the Big  South Fork National Forest. Now we  hear all about Yellowstone National  Park and the Grand Canyon and ev erything but we do not hear much  about the beauty of the central part of  the United States. I want to tell you,  my colleagues and people of this coun try, that the Big South Fork National  Forest is one of our hidden treasures.  We had one of the finest times, my  family and I, that we have ever had.  We went on a canoe trip through that  beautiful forest and we saw sights I  had never seen before. The foliage was  absolutely fantastic. I do not think my  children ever had a better time.

There have been statements made  for  that  transition. The  judgment  on the floor that there have been two  made in 1983 was that the original act  convictions under plea bargains. There  have been, but not of covered individ uals, not the individuals that this leg islation focuses upon.  The reason that individuals such as  myself are so uncomfortable not only  with the current law, but a new law  that even broadens the scope, has to  do with a very fundamental law in this  country, the supreme law of the land,  the Constitution.  An individual whom I admire great ly, an individual who served very capa bly in the office of Attorney General  under former President Jimmy Carter,  a member of a party different from  my own, Griffin Bell, testified before  our subcommittee and made a number  of points which I would like to share  with this body.  The points that he made with re spect to the unconstitutionality of this  statute was, and I quote:  First, in my view, the statute is unconsti tutional in that it intrudes on the duty and  right of the President to faithfully execute  the law as is provided in our Constitution.  The Independent Counsel, in essence, is an other attorney general-pro tanto-and in  part displaces the Attorney General and the  Department of Justice. The  Independent  Counsel is not an agent of the President but  of the courts and reports to the courts and  the Congress. In no way can an Independent  Counsel be classified as an ""inferior officer""  subject to being appointed under Article II  of the Constitution. This ""inferior officer""  has the unfettered discretion to prosecute  the  President  himself. An  Independent  Counsel is part and parcel of the federal law  enforcement function which is reserved to  the President under our Constitution.  It may be said that the question of consti tutionality  is  something  reserved  to  the  courts, but I am of the President Andrew  Jackson school which is that it is the duty  of every member of the government, wheth er the President or individual members of  Congress or  the courts,  to  interpret and  uphold our Constitution. We should not act  if we have a doubt as to the constitutional ity of a proposed law.  Second,  the  Independent Counsel oper ation seems to me to be contrary to our pre cept of equal protection of the laws. It sets  aside a small group of public officials to be  treated differently  from other American  citizens. They are handled by a special in vestigator. The investigation is announced  under great notoriety, and any conclusion  reached is likewise notorious. Other citizens  are  investigated without announcement indeed usually under great confidentiality  given  the secrecy of the grand  jury rule,  Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 6(e),  and the practice of the Department of Jus tice in not commenting on ongoing investi gations. Usually the fact of an investigation  is never known if there is no indictment.  This is completely contrary to the practice  in the Independent Counsel cases to date.  Third, the Independent Counsel provision  and operation seems to me to be against the  public interest. It is an operation from be ginning to end which is fraught with great  publicity and seems almost to be set up to  create publicity. It indicates to the rest of  the world, when the contrary is true, that  our government is in a state of disarray and  operated by people so unworthy of trust as  to be under investigation in a much publi cized manner.

1565,1241,20,Mr. FRANK.," The question is, do we  let the Attorney General say, yes, the  facts are the crime was committed, the  law was violated, but this pattern of  behavior which appears to violate the  law took place, but the person did not  mean it? What we are saying is that is  far beyond the threshold which the  Attorney General ought to be asked to  make a decision on with regard to the  individuals with whom he had worked  so closely.  As a matter of fact, I do not believe  what we have in the bill was meant to  be a change until the current Attorney  General said with regard to several ap pointees that there was possibly a vio lation of the law, but they did not  mean it. No one, I believe, though the  Attorney General had  that power.  That is an effort by us, frankly,  to  bring the law back to where it should  have been, because if we put this in  the law, we render the prosecution, I  think, a service.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr.  HEFNER). The time of the gentleman  from Massachusetts [Mr. FRANK] has  expired.  ",1987
1566,1241,20,Mr. SWINDALL.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1987
1567,1241,20,Mr. FRANK.," I yield to the gentle man from Georgia, who asked me once  before to yield.  ",1987
1568,1241,20,Mr. SWINDALL.," Mr. Chairman, as  long as we are talking about bringing  the law back where it ought to be, I  would like to ask the gentleman from  Massachusetts how he can reconcile  the provisions of the Constitution that  guarantee equal protection under the  law with this particular provision of  the bill, as well as the bill in general.  Certainly we have here targeted indi viduals in saying, ""As to you individ uals, you will not have the same pro tection under the law that is afforded  any other individual except those that  chose to work in the executive branch  of Government at the pleasure of the  President.""  ",1987
1569,1241,20,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Chairman,  the  gentleman has asked a question, and I  will respond to it.  As he pointed out, he is one of the  lucky ones on the Republican side. He  did not get here until 1983. Most of  those who were here  in  1982  got  caught voting for this bill before they  decided retroactively it was unconsti tutional. I do not refer to the gentle man from Illinois. I do not put him in  that category. But many of the oppo nents today were for it in 1982 and  later came out against it. The gentle man got here  late enough  to avoid  that fate.  I congratulate him on his  timing. He is against the whole bill, so,  of course, he is against this particular  piece of it. If you do not want the in dependent counsel,  then, of course,  you do not want it to work.  The obverse does not hold. You can  be for the bill and against this piece.  ",1987
1570,1241,20,Mr. SWINDALL.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1987
1571,1241,20,Mr. FRANK., No;  I will not yield.  The gentleman asked a question.  ,1987
1572,1241,20,Mr. SWINDALL.," Well,  the gentle man has not answered it.  ",1987
1573,1241,20,Mr. FRANK.," I am going to get to  the answer. I ask the gentleman to be  patient and work hard, and maybe he  will understand it.  The point is that part of my answer  is that when the gentleman is opposed  to the whole bill, I am not surprised  that he wants to make it less effective.  That means as a piece the denial of  equal protection is not a very sensible  argument.  I  understand  the gentle man's new-found attachment  to  the  Attorney General of  the Carter ad ministration, Mr. Bell. Mr. Bell  is  being asked to do more work by the  Republicans these days,  in the Bork  nomination, on this bill, and the E.F.  Hutton investigation, not for them but  for others. I think he is entitled to a  second pension for all the extra work  they are laying on the poor fellow and  in whom lately they have found vir tues they never saw before.  ",1987
1574,1241,20,Mr. HYDE.," And  let us not forget  Lloyd Cutler, too.  ",1987
1575,1241,20,Mr. FRANK.," No. Lloyd Cutler testi fied, I say to the gentleman-and I say  this to the gentleman to whom I did  not yield, but I will overlook that.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  time of the gentleman from Massachu setts [Mr. FRANKl has again expired.  <By unanimous consent, Mr. FRANK  was allowed to proceed for 2 additior..al  minutes.>  ",1987
1576,1241,20,Mr. FRANK.," Lloyd Cutler testified  in favor of this bill. The point that I  would make is this: It is not denial of  equal protection, because what we are  saying is this: The Independent Coun sel is the one who should take into ac count state of mind. We are not saying  you should be prosecuted regardless of  your state of mind; we are not saying  you should be indicted regardless of  your state of mind. We are saying that  if  the Attorney General  finds  you  committed these acts, it is not him but  the  independent  counsel who  then  ought to make that conceptual inquiry  about the state of mind. The inquiry  the  gentleman  from  Illinois made  about state of mind is a valid one to be  made, but by the independent counsel,  not the Attorney General.  ",1987
1577,1241,20,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1987
1578,1241,20,Mr. FRANK., I yield to the gentle man from Illinois.  ,1987
1579,1241,20,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  just  hope that historians in the future will  take note of the interesting fact that  civil  liberties are being protected by  the Republican side and the avenging  angels are on the Democratic side.  ",1987
1580,1241,20,Mr. FRANK.,"  I  think events  that  happen so rarely often do come to the  attention of historians, and they prob ably will. But I do not regard it as in  any way a violation of civil liberties,  because we are not in any way, shape,  or form diminishing  for  the person  who might be accused, the availability  of the defense that he or she lacked  the requisite state of mind, because all  we  are  saying  is  that  the decision  about state of mind ought to be made  not by the Attorney General but by  the independent counsel, and that is  the position all of us thought was the  case until we had the situation with  Mr. Meese where his public integrity  section  and  his Assistant Attorney  General  in  one  case  recommended  prosecution,  and  the  independent  counsel asked  for  that prosecution.  But when the public integrity section  and  the Assistant Attorney General  recommended  the  prosecution, Mr.  Meese said, ""Oh, no, my former col league here didn't have the requisite  state of mind, so I won't go forward  with it."" That is the situation we are  trying to remedy.  ",1987
1581,1241,20,Mr. SWINDALL.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to make  a couple of comments with respect to  the  argument  that  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts made. First of all,  his  reference  to  the bill  that was  passed in 1978 and renewed in 1982 is  ",1987
1582,1254,20,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1987
1583,1254,20,Mr. SWINDALL.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield  to the gentleman from Massa chusetts.  ",1987
1584,1254,20,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Chairman, I say to  the  gentleman  that  if Mr. Meese  thinks there is an impropriety there,  he could dismiss for cause.  Second, when the gentleman talked  about the distinction between convict ing covered and non-covered  individ uals, I was referring to the gentleman  from New  Jersey's  [Mr.  CouRTER]  amendment. That distinction  is not  part of this amendment.  Under the amendment, a conviction  of anybody, whether covered or not  covered, would end the period. So the  distinction the gentleman from Geor gia [Mr. SwiNDALL] believes is impor tant, may be important in other con texts but it is not for purposes of this  amendment.  .  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from New Jersey [Mr. CoURTER].  The question was  taken; and  the  Chairman announced  that  the noes  appeared to have it.  RECORDED VOTE  ",1987

1586,1267,20,Mr.  SWINDALL.," Mr.  Chairman,  there is an inherent conflict of inter est, one of those being that the Attor ney General of the United States must  come to this Congress for appropria tion to proceed with any prosecution.  The same logic that leads us to the  conclusion that this is bad legislation,  as  it  is applied  to  the Congress,  is  equally applicable.  Returning to my initial point, it is  time to strip all the veneer off of this  argument and focus at the reality of  what we are dealing with here.  We are not talking about conflicts of  interest or about public perception,  public confidence, because if we are,  this body ought to be arguing in favor  of this amendment, because if there is  a  shaking of  public  confidence,  it  exists when Members of this body are  brought  before  the Committee  on  Standards of Official Conduct, and we  can list at least eight cases in this Con gress where that exact situation has  occurred and  individuals have been  asked to g;ive restitution.  One that comes to mind is the gen tlewoman from Ohio who has admit ted that the gentlewoman was paying  an individual who was not even on her  staff in Washington.  The woman was in New York, which  is outside of the gentlewoman's con gressional district. She paid $47,000.  The point  is,  the Committee  on  Standards of Official Conduct obvious ly thought it was wrong, because they  said,  repay  the $47,000. The gentle woman did repay the $47,000, and no  indictment has been forthcoming.  I suspect that if there is a situation  where pubiic confidence is shattered,  it is that type of situation, the point  being, this is bad law.  I do not deny it for a moment. It is  bad law for all of the constitutional  flaws, equal protection, due process.  The public confidence is not going to  be strengthened any by targeting out  59 people.  We have already established today  that there has not been a single con viction of any covered member during  the several years going back to 1978,  never a single conviction, and millions  of dollars spent.  Mr. Walsh has now spent $2.9 mil lion, and he has yet to bring forth a  single  indictment of covered  individ-.  uals.  We see all types of arguments here  that are being made with straight  faces, because they apply to Members  of Congress; but then they can turn  right around and be applied  to  the  statute at large.  No one makes the same points. We  simply say, well, that does not quite  apply here because of this inherent  conflict. What we are really saying is,  it is a constitutional conflict, because  we are in reality rewriting here today  the Constitution, throwing out all of  the constitutional standards to which  the gentleman from Florida just paid  lipservice.  The point  is, we are  ignoring  the  most  fundamental  right;  the  14th  amendment right to equal protection  under the law is totally ignored.  We are in fact passing a bill of at tainder, which is outlawed by the Con stitution; and it says, you target spe cial  individuals or classes of individ uals, and you treat them differently  before any type of procedure or due  process.  We are saying that if one accepts an  appointment  in  any  administration,  that necessarily that ought to subject  that individual to that special  treat ment.  The gentleman  from Kansas  sug gests that the flaw here is that Mem bers of Congress ought not to be ele vated to this special position, because  it would make them more difficult to  prosecute. If it would, why do we want  to make it more difficult to prosecute  members of the administration?  I would go back to a point, though,  that I made early on this morning; and  that is,  if  the Members  look at the  entire history, the Members will find  that we have handled these types of  problems very well.  Watergate, the greatest constitution al crisis of this country's history, we  prosecuted all of the President's men  without having  this statute on  the  books.  Since this statute has been placed on  the books, none of the President's men  have  been  successfully  prosecuted  under this provision.  Borrowing from  the works of  the  gentleman from Massachusetts, a for tiori, this is totally unnecessary.  ",1987
1587,1267,20,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1987
1588,1267,20,Mr. SWINDALL., I yield to the gen tleman from Massachusetts.  ,1987
1589,1267,20,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding to me.  I have to disclaim authorship of the  phrase, a fortiori, I read it in a book.  We are here creating a bill of attain der, and so forth, and that is not his torically accurate.  Partisan motivation, it is indisputed,  the original bill for a special prosecu tor then called with a much lower trig ger easily brought  into being which  passed by a Democratic Congress with  a Democratic President.  It was reenacted in the form we are  now talking about, applying mandator ily to members of the administration  but with discretion  to Members of  Congress.  It was  reenacted  in  that  form, this violation of the 14th amend ment by the Democratic House and  the Republican Senate, voted for by  all of the Republican members of the  Committee  on  the  Judiciary  and  signed by the Republicans.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  time of the gentleman from Georgia  has again expired.  ",1987
1590,1267,20,Mr. SWINDALL.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield to the gentleman from California  [Mr. LUNGREN].  ",1987
1591,1267,20,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding to  me.  Not only does the bill as we have it  before the House talk about members  in the executive branch being under  the mandatory coverage,  it also  in cludes the chairman and treasurer of  the principal national campaign com mittee seeking election or reelection of  the President, and any officer of a  campaign for the election or reelection  of the President who exercises author ity at the national level, such as the  campaign manager or director, during  the incumbency of the President.  If we accept  the argument of the  gentleman  from Missouri  that  this  makes  it more difficult  to prosecute  people, we do not want to put Con gress under it, then we have made it  more difficult to prosecute the chair man and treasurer of the principal na tional campaign committee. However,  those  candidates  for  President  are  trying to find supporters in the House  of Representatives and in  the other  body. That is an indication of strength  in the campaign, and we are not going  to be involved, because there is no con flict.  We know there are relationships be tween Members of Congress, both in  the House and in the other body, and  with an administration.  We know those conflicts exist, and  they  exist  in  the  real world,  and  maybe not here in this ephemeral at mosphere which we are dealing with  now, but in the real world they do.  This bill ought  to be  in  the  world.  ",1987
1592,1267,20,Mr. SWINDALL.," Mr. Chairman, the  statute at large, we continue to hear  various arguments as to why this stat ute is necessary.  Suddenly we  are  reversing  all of  those arguments that have been made;  and we said, however, when it comes  to Members of Congress, all of these  things are suddenly bad. Now as soon  as  this amendment  is defeated, as I  predicted it would be at 12:10 today, I  made that prediction because of the  partisanship of this particular statute,  I can predict that with total safety,  and listen very carefully to those of  the Members who have not made up  their minds, listen to all of the argu ments that are going to be made when  we close debate on this important stat ute, and then ask yourself very candid ly and honestly on each of the argu ments, is that not equally true of Con gress. Is that not equally true of Con gress, is that not equally true of Con gress; and if it is flawed with respect  to Members of Congress, it is flawed  with respect to each and every one of  the  individuals,  the  59  individuals  whom we seek here to set aside and  real  ",1987

1624,1293,20,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Under such a plan,  the United States could stay in the  Persian Gulf and, there could still be  reflagged tankers. But in addition to  that, there would be a U.N. marine  force which would actually be respon sible for maintaining peace, and ensur ing  the  safe  passage  of  all  ships  through the gulf. I do not know if that  is a good idea for doing it. I do not  know if that is the best idea for keep ing the navigational waters open. I am  not sure what is the best way to bring  about deescalation of the conflict.  But while we are looking at our own  military presence, we need  to make  sure that we are pursuing all other  tools-diplomatic  and  multilateral.  That is why we need discussion. That  is why we need debate and a careful  examination of this.  The idea of U.N. marine force might  be a great idea. It also might be an  idea  that  is unworkable, unfeasible,  and undesirable.  But what  the Senate needs  to be  doing at this time is pursuing a legisla tive framework for discussion, debate,  and decisionmaking to occur, in part nership with our U.S. President, where  we have clear objectives, a clear policy,  and a clearly agreed upon set of tools  to pursue that.

1628,1293,20,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I urge  all Senators to make note of the re marks of  the distinguished Senator  from Maryland. That was a very fine  framework and analysis of where the  Senate finds itself at this hour under  the various courses of actions under  war powers.  I strongly concur in the observation  of the Senator from Maryland with re spect  to  the need  for allowing  the  United Nations Security Council to ad dress  this  second  resolution. Great  credit is owed to our President for aug menting our military forces in the Per sian Gulf, putting aside  the  thorny  issue of  reflagging for  the moment,  and then persuading other nations to  likewise augment their military forces  and other nations to introduce for the  first time forces in that region in sup port of a coordinated foreign policy  objective of many nations  to bring  about in the Security Council a uni fied  framework within which  to  try  and achieve a more peaceful situation  in the gulf and to hopefully terminate  the land war.  That is why this Senator, along with  many others, has continuously urged  this body to go on record, first as sup porting  the President-and,  indeed,  the Byrd-Warner resolution unequivo cally states that-and then to set out a  reasonable framework of time within  which  further  deliberation  should  take place in this body. As I under stand it, the proponents of the under lying amendment will  shortly bring  forth an amendment which will pro vide for the shortening of that time. I  intend  to  strongly  endorse  that  amendment  because,  throughout,  I  have urged that the quicker Congress  acts, the less indecision, the less doubt  is injected in that arena.  I  think we have an obligation,  in  view of  the uncertainty around  the  War Powers Act, to put that act to one  side for the moment, chart a course of  action  as  the Byrd-Warner  amend ment does, and to state the intention  of this body to support the President  now, to require that report which will  establish the framework for a debate  and then announce our decision at the  earliest possible date.  The distinguished majority  leader,  in the drafting of this amendment-!  was privileged working with him on  that-1  think  has  established  that  framework.  I am also hopeful this morning that  after the amendments of the Senator  from Connecticut are considered, that  there is a consensus among the leader ship  in the Senate that perhaps we  can conclude this matter today, that is  conclude a policy so that for the time  being we will set the War Powers Act  to one side, proceed under a legislative  framework  to meet the goals-and I  stress meet  the goals  of  the War  Powers Act-and do  it in a manner  that  is  clear,  timely,  and  the U.S.  Senate and the U.S. House of Repre sentatives stand up and be counted for  or against the policy as determined by  our President in the Persian Gulf.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",1987

Will  the distinguished Republican  leader tell the Senate: He has pointed  to what he perceives as a weakness in  the  Byrd-Warner  amendment namely, we do not know what will be  in the future resolution. Will the dis tinguished Republican leader state to  the Senate what would be in the con current resolution that would be intro duced and referred to the Committee  on Foreign Relations of  the Senate  and reported out within 15 calendar  days, as provided in section 7(a) of the  War Powers Resolution? What would  be in that resolution?  ",1987

Congress passed  the act over  the  President's veto, and it does not set  forth the language that would be in  the resolution provided for in the War  Powers Act. Additionally,  it requires  that this House should vote on any  resolution that is reported under the  War Powers Act within 3  calendar  days-within 3 calendar days.

This  joint resolution may be  cited as the ""War Powers Resolution"".  PURPOSE AND POLICY  Sec. 2. (a) It is the purpose of this joint  resolution to fulfill the intent of the fram ers of the Constitution of the United States  and insure that the collective judgment of  both the Congress and the President will  apply to the introduction of United States  Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situa tions where imminent involvement in hostil ities  is  clearly  indicated by  the circum stances, and to the continued use of such  forces in hostilities or in such situations.  (b) Under article I, section 8, of the Con stitution, it is specifically provided that the  Congress shall have the power to make all  laws necessary and proper for carrying into  execution, not only its own powers but also  all other powers vested by the Constitution  in the Government of the United States, or  in any department or officer thereof.  <c> The constitutional powers of the Presi dent as Commander-in-Chief  to  introduce  United States Armed Forces into hostilities,  or into situations where imminent involve ment in hostilities is clearly indicated by the  circumstances, are exercised only pursuant  to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statu tory authorization, or (3) a national emer gency created by attack upon the United  States, its territories or possessions, or its  armed forces.  CONSULTATION  Sec. 3. The President in every possible in stance shall consult with Congress before  introducing United States Armed Forces  into hostilities or into situations whre immi nent involvement in hostilities is clearly in dicated by  the  circumstances,  and  after  every such introduction shall consult regu larly with the Congress until United States  Armed Forces are no longer engaged in hos tilities or have been removed from such situ ations.  REPORTING  Sec. 4. <a> In the absence of a declaration  of war, in any case in which United States  Armed Forces are introduced< 1> into hostilities or into situations where  imminent involvement in hostilities is clear ly indicated by the circumstances;  <2> into the territory, airspace or waters of  a foreign nation, while equipped for combat,  except for deployments which relate solely  to supply, replacement, repair, or training  of such forces; or  (3)  in numbers which substantially en large United States Armed Forces equipped  for  combat already  locatei  in a  foreign  nation;  the President shall submit v;ithin 48 hours  to the Speaker of the House of Representa tives and to the President pro tempore of  the Senate  a  report,  in writing,  setting  forth(A) the circumstances necessitating the in troduction of United States Armed Forces;  (B) the constitutional and legislative au thority under which such introduction took  place; and  <C>  the estimated scope and duration of  the hostilities or involvement.

1648,1319,20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator  from South Carolina  [Mr.  THURMOND] is recognized.  ,1987
1649,1319,20,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise in support of President Reagan's  nomination of Robert H. Bork to be an  Associate  Justice  of  the  Supreme  Court.  Judge Bork is one of the most emi nently qualified individuals to be nom inated to the Supreme Court in recent  history. Mr. President, let me take just  a moment  to review  those qualifica tions. Robert Bork distinguished him self in both his undergraduate studies  and in law school. He received a bache lor of arts degree from the University  of Chicago in 1948. He was elected to  Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated from  the University of Chicago Law School  in 1953, receiving a J.D. Degree. While  attending law school he was the man aging editor of the Law Review and  was elected to Order of the Coif, a na tional law honor society.  He volunteered for military service  in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1945 and  served until 1946. He served another  tour of duty with the Marine Corps  from 1950 to 1952, and was then hon orably discharged.  Following his education and service  in the Marine Corps, he was employed  as a research associate with the Law  and Economics project of the Universi ty of Chicago. Subsequently, he joined  the New York  law  firm of Willkie,  Owen, Farr, Gallagher & Walton. In  1955, he became associated with the  firm of Kirkland, Ellis, Hodson, Chaf fety & Masters. In 1962 shortly, after  becoming a partner, he left that firm  to teach at Yale Law School. He was  nominated to be Solicitor General of  the United States in 1973 and served  in that position until 1977, when he  again returned  to  teach at Yale. In  1981, he again practiced law as a part ner with the firm of Kirkland & Ellis.  He was nominated to the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit in 1982, and was unanimously  confirmed by the Senate. Judge Bork  has rendered distinguished service on  the court of appeals since that time.  Judge Bork was nominated on July  7, 1987  to be an Associate Justice of  the Supreme Court. After a 70-day  delay, hearings began on September  15, 1987 and the Judiciary Committee  held 12 days of hearings on his nomi nation. These hearings were the most  exhaustive and comprehensive into a   judicial nominee's qualifications that I  can remember in my 35 years in the  Senate.  However, Mr. President, I have been  disturbed over  the methods used by  some of Judge Bork's opponents. Ad verse publicity about the nominee has  been  unsurpassed.  Advertising  on  radio, television, and in the press has  distorted the true character and the  exceptional qualities of Judge Bork.  There were those, however, who felt  compelled  to  counter  this  lobbying  campaign against Judge Bork. Gerald  Ford, former President of the United  States  introduced  Judge Bork  and  urged favorable action by the commit tee  and  confirmation  by  the  full  Senate. During the hearings we also  heard  testimony  from  former Chief  Justice Warren Burger who stated:  I was so concerned about the disinforma tion in some of these full-page ads-that I  felt as a member of the Bar, as a citizen, I  had an obligation really to say what I be lieve.

Senator ExoN  told me he had a  meeting in his office and to go ahead.  So I think that is what I will do.  Mr. President,  there  is  something  that is unprecedented that I want to  bring  to  the attention of  the U.S.  Senate at this time.

1654,1345,20,Mr. HATCH.," Despite the lessons of  the Constitution and Senate prece dent the Bork nomination has become  a b;uising political wrestling match,  ultimately decided by political muscle  in  the  form  of  lobbying  strength,  media attacks, fundraising, and maj<;>r ity  party  solidarity. The  damage to the independence and In tegrity of the judiciary is a cost yet to  be fully counted.  The tragedy is that this ""deft blend""  of ridicule, rumor, and racis_m is politi cizing a sensitive constitutiOnal proc ess  which  carries  implications  far  beyond  the career of Judge Robert  Bork. The seriousness of the Sen~te'_s  task and the independence of the JUdi ciary are jeopardized by this crass po litical trickery.  For  two  centuries,  the  Federal  courts have fortunately  remained as  the one nonpolitical branch of Gov ernment.

If  THE REAL ROBERT H. BORK  In my final moments today, I would  like to set aside for a moment the la'Y  the politics, and the dangers of th1s  precedent-shattering  and  precedent setting event. Instead I would like to  look past the distortion and ridicu~e t?  the real Judge Bork-the capable mdi vidual, the caring individual, the con siderate individual. It is hard to con ceive  of  finding  another  more qualified in terms of ab1llty and  compassion.  After all, this is the individual who,  as  a  junior  associate,  stood up  to  senior partners to prevent ~nt_i-Semi­ tism from claiming another VIctim.  This is the individual who stood up  to colleagues at  the Department of  Justice on behalf of a black woman to  prevent  subtle  discrimination  from  claiming another victim.  This is the individual who stood by  l1is former wife and made great peri~~ividual  91-059 0-89-43 <Pt. 20!  sonal  sacrifices  as her health was  drained by a debilitating and eventual ly fatal disease.  This is the individual who, after ful filling an active-duty assignment, le~t  school and willingly returned to h1s  country's service as a Marine in the  Korean war.  This  is  the  individual who  gave  nearly half of his 60 years to teaching  and public service, eschewing the enor mous  financial  rewards  his  talents  might have brought in favor of educat ing our children and assisting our Gov ernment.  This is the individual who won sig nificant advances for civil rights as So licitor General and never advocated a  position less sympathetic than the Su preme Court to minorities or less sym pathetic to minorities than that adopt ed by the Supreme Court itself.  This is the individual who took no  position on civil rights cases in 5 rear:s  as a judge less favorable to the mmon ties  and women  than  the position  adopted by the Supreme Court.  This  is  the  individual whom Con gress twice confirmed. unanimous~y ~o  significant posts in th1s country withm  our Government.  This is the individual who served for  4 years as our Nation's leading trial at torney.  This is the individual who served for  5 years on our Nation's second most  important court-without a single re versal.  This  is  the  individual who  states  that Congress should be allowed  to  make policy and that he, as a  judge,  will not impose his own agenda on the  Nation.  This  list might go on  indefinitely,  but  the point  is evident. The most  tragic final chapter does not concern  politics, nor  lobbying pressures, nor  issues of marital privacy or homosex ual privacy or  abortion privacy  or  prostitution privacy or  any  of  the  other issues which may interest one or  another Senator.  The most  tragic final chapter is a  chapter about an  individual-one of  the most qualified  individuals  ever  nominated to the most important judi cial post in the Nation. The Supreme  Court and  the Nation has  lost  the  services of one of its finest individuals.  That  is  the most  tragic,  and most  final, chapter.  .  What does it mean for our NatiOn  and our independent Federal judiciary  that an individual of this caliber can  suffer what he has suffered? I genu inely hope that this will never happen  again in our history and that my col leagues will reconsider Judge Robert  Bork, the real Judge Bork not the dis torted political accounts, and vote to  confirm him as an Associate Justice of  the Supreme Court.  Mr. President, I have read the co~­ mittee report and it is filled with In consistencies, and  I  am highly disturbed by the way it is written. I think  it is a very, very poor job. As I have  said before, I  think the Senate Judi cary report is the grossly slanted and  biased distortion of all that really oc curred before the committee and what  was really at stake in this nomination.  I do not have time to list all of the  flaws and the inaccuracies of the staff  report and I have done it rather hur riedly. But I ask unanimous consent  that my remarks concerning that, and  the work that I have done concerning  that chronicle of a few of the errors  and  inconsistencies be placed in the  RECORD at this point.

1665,1410,20,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join my good friend and col league from Delaware, Mr. RoTH,  in  introducing a bill to protect the fragile  and spectacular Arctic National Wild life Refuge in Alaska.  Those of us who were active in the  1980 debate on the Alaska Lands Act  remember all too well that just about  any proposal  that will affect  these  magnificent lands is going to be con troversial. The debate is also likely to  be highly emotional.  Given our experience with this issue,  no one should have been surprised by  the outcry that followed the Depart ment of Interior's proposal  to open  this fragile ecosystem to oil and gas  development. Fortunately, it will take  congressional action  to approve  this  proposal. If we do nothing, the area  remains protected.  In recent months, through hearings,  press briefings, and numerous other  avenues,  those who like the Interior  Department's  proposal  have  been  mounting a campaign to gain the nec essary congressional approval. Several  bills have already been introduced to  clear the way for oil and gas explora tion in the Article National Wildlife  Refuge [ANWRJ.  Today, by introducing a bill to desig nate  the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge as a wilderness area, we are  sending a signal that there are  two  sides to this issue. There are many of  us who do not believe  the case has  been made to justify the environmen tal risks that go with oil and gas devel opment.  For example, an independent geolog ical report prepared by the State of  Alaska concludes that ANWR has ap proximately 50 percent less oil than  the amount claimed by  the Depart ment of Interior report.  How important is it to exploit this  area? Consider the fact that ANWR  has only a 19 percent chance of pro ducing 440 million barrels of economi cally recoverable oil. Compare that to  the over 100 billion barrels that are  projected to lie in other areas of the  United States-and  that  figure  ex cludes areas designated or potentially  designated as wilderness.  We should also not forget that 94  percent of all the potential oil bearing  land in Alaska-as well as 90 percent  of the arctic coast-are already open  for oil and gas development. These  areas should be explored fully before  we go after protected, ecologically rich  and fragile areas such as ANWR.  Finally,  a Congressional Research  Service study has criticized the Interi or Department's report citing  three  main problems: an obscurance of possi ble impacts on the Arctic ecosystem as  a whole; a failure to clarify available  intermediate options which Congress  may wish to consider; and an ambigui ty between  the  long-term  and  the  short-term effects of development.  Mr.  President.  I  understand  and  share some of the concerns of those  who say we can not afford to lock up  this potentially oil rich area forever.  But, at the same time, I am not con vinced that the case has been made to  open it up at this time. I advise a cau tious  approach  to  this  complicated  problem and look forward to hearings  and continuing to explore the matter  with all of my colleagues.  ",1987
1666,1410,20,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to add my support to this effort  to protect the Artie National Wildlife  the Energy Committee,  there has been much discussion and  interest in the topic of oil development  in ANWR. Indeed, the committee is in  the midst of a battery of hearings on  legislation which would  open  the  entire coastal region to oil leasing and  development.  I  intend  to participate  fully  in these and subsequent hear ings. But I cannot conclude that the  best future for ANWR is to mirror the  industrialization  of  Prudhoe  Bay.  ANWR should be preserved intact, as  wilderness, for this and future genera tions.  The Arctic Refuge is a unique area.  The Interior Department clearly rec ognized this in its draft report on the  region when it stated:  Refug~. In  ",1987
1667,1423,20,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  rise today to pay tribute to my State's  oldest  statewide  newspaper-the  Tundra Times-on its 25th anniversa ry. This paper truly deserves recogni tion because  it serves an  important  purpose  in my State of Alaska. The  Tundra Times reflects the interests of  a significant population group in my  State-the Alaska Native people. The  paper's news stories, features and edi torials reflect the concerns and ideals  of Alaska Natives who live in approxi mately 200 villages scattered through out some 580,000 square miles.  The birth of the Tundra Times is an  interesting one.  In the early 1960's,  the Alaska Native people in northwest  Alaska were concerned about the ef fects of proposed atomic testing near  their villages, particularly how  that  testing would affect their subsistence  lifestyle. Native leaders met to discuss  how their villages could ban together  to voice their objections. That unified  voice became the voice of the Tundra  Times. The paper started in 1962 and  Howard Rock, one of the Native lead ers, was chosen as its editor and pub lisher.  Over the years,  the Tundra Times  has meant a lot of things to a lot of  people in my State-Native and non Native alike.  In the late 1960's and  1970's, it meant getting detailed cover age of probably  the single greatest  news event  for Alaska Natives-the  debate of the 1971 law which created  the Alaska Native Claims Settlement  Act. Many Alaskans  followed  the  paper to read about what was going on  back in Washington, DC, and what Na tives in the State thought about enact ing this legislation.  The  Settlement  Act  established  Native, regional, and village corpora tions as an alternative to choosing the  traditional method  of  establishing  Indian reservations, as in the lower 48.  The corporations manage Native land  throughout the State of Alaska, and  presently prohibit the sale of Native  stock in those corporations until 1991.  It's interesting to note that as we  pay tribute to this great paper, Con gress is now considering amendments  to  the Settlement Act. The Alaska  Native people feel that as time rolls on  and 1991 fast approaches, the Natives  must be prepared to deal with that  day, under current  law, when  their  stock can be sold. The Tundra Times  has been  consistently  covering  the  progress of amendments  to ANCSA,  and I commend them for  their fair  and thorough reporting.  The Tundra Times has meant educa tion on alcoholism, a disease which is  unfortunately and tragically prevalent  in Alaska and among our Native popu lation. The paper has championed the  cause to combat alcoholism by careful ly reporting on the problem in Alas ka's Native villages, small communities  and cities, and by covering events and  individuals who are seeking a solution  to the problem.  The paper has explored other criti cal social problems for Native people.  It has successfully brought State at tention to the need for quality educa tion for Native youth in the villages.  Education is what the paper has also  meant to non-Natives in my State. The  Tundra Times has been a great re source  for  individuals who want  to  better understand where Alaska Na tives are coming from on many differ ent issues. It gives a perspective that  should not be overlooked.  Since the days of Howard Rock, the  Tundra Times has meant an active  communications  link  for Native vil lages throughout rural Alaska. For 25  years,  it has brought villages  and  small communities together to speak  with one voice.  Alaska  is  currently  experiencing  some rough economic times, and some  small  businesses  have  fared  better  than others. The Tundra Times be cause of its dedication to the Native  people has weathered a bumpy road  for 25 years. That's something worth  recognizing.  I salute the Times and its small staff  and all the individuals who have con tributed stories to the paper over the  years. Although it may not be me, it is  my hope  that another U.S. Senator  from Alaska will be standing here in  the year  2012  to  congratulate  the  paper on  its 50th anniversary. The  paper is that important to our State.e  TRIBUTE TO PAUL GANN  e ",1987
1668,1423,20,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. President, I stand  before you today to offer a brief, but  well deserved  testimonial  to a dear  friend and statesman from my home  State of California, Mr. Paul Gann.  Mr. Gann is the founder and president  of People's Advocate. He was the coau thor of the most revolutionary tax ini tiative in modern political history in  1978, proposition 13. The success of  Mr. Gann's initiative in that year sent  shock waves through the statehouses  from coast to coast, and changed the  way legislators approach tax policy.  Since the 1960's, Mr. Gann has been  the  impetus behind numerous grass roots  campaign  efforts  aimed  at  making State government more  re sponsive and responsible. He has been  an outspoken opponent of the repeat ed attempts of the California Legisla ture  to expand  its powers and has  fought  individual attempts of members to increase their own salaries and  benefits.  Mr. Gann has, in the truest sense of  our constitutional  liberties, been an  active participant  in  the democratic  process. By his word and deed, he em bodies all of the principles and charac teristics of a free and open society and  he  has  demonstrated  that we  do  indeed have a system that works and  works well when people care enough  to stand up and make  their voices  heard.  Mr. President, I know I am joined by  hundreds of  thousands of others  in  honoring Mr. Gann; he  is  a major  leader of our time and a deeply com passionate human being.e  LOUISVILLE ORCHESTRA'S  SOUND CELEBRATION  e Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President  I  rise today to draw my colleagues' ~t­ tention to an article that appeared in  yesterday's New York Times. The arti cle, written by Ms. Heidi Waleson de tails  the  unique  atmosphere  that  marked  the  Louisville  Orchestra's  Sound Celebration Festival.  The stated policy of glasnost,  the  openness that the Soviet Union has at te~?pted to infuse into its society, was  evidenced at the Louisville event by  the  appearance  of  a  distinguished  Soviet composer, Ms. Sofia Gubaidu lina. It is fitting that Ms. Gubaidulina  brought glasnost to Louisville in that  she was reciprocating a visit from the  Louisville Orchestra's noted music di rector, Mr. Lawrence Leighton Smith,  who recently became the first Ameri can to travel to the Soviet Union to  record with the Moscow philharmonic.  Louisville has displayed its commit ment to international philanthropy in  many ways,  including the University  of Louisville's administering of  the  Grawemeyer  Award.  That  honor  which is the largest cash prize for th~  humanities, is annually awarded to an  outstanding composer  for a  specific  compo~ition. Charles Grawemeyer, a  LoUisville  resident who  founded  the  award, has announced that there will  be two additional categories of awards  granted  this spring-improvement of  the world order and education.  I have inserted this entry into the  RECORD  so  that other Senators may  learn of the remarkable cultural ac complishments of the city of Louisville  and its residents.

1669,1436,20,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker,  last week,  the  United States Trade Representative was pre sented with extensive  testimony about  the  widespread use of exploited child  labor  in  Thailand. A petition has been presented as  part of  this  year's GSP annual  review  to  revoke duty-free trade benefits from Thailand  because of the child  labor situation existing  there.  Following is another installment in  the six part series entitled  ""Stolen Childhood""  that  appeared  in  the Cox Newspapers over  the  summer.  It details  the bleak circumstances  confronting many Thai children sent to Bang kok to help support their families.  [From the Atlanta <GA> Constitution, June  23, 1987]  FoR THAI CHILDREN, TRAIN STATION OFFERS  ONE-WAY TRIP TO EXPLOITATION  <My Marcia KunsteD  BANGKOK,  Thailand-For  thousands  of  Thai children, the Hua Lampong train sta tion has been a gateway  to exploitation.  Once a year, it is a gateway out.  The happy time is the Chinese New Year,  when ethnic Chinese Owners of shops and  factories give a holiday  to  their workers,  many of whom are migrants  from debt ridden farms or landless families in the im poverished northeast.  Seven girls clustered on a bench were  going home last January after working at a  tiny Bangkok garment factory.  Not m1ly was it their first trip back, this  was their first full day off in a year.  Ladda Pimwan, 15, leaned against a girl friend. The seven had arrived early and had  yet to endure a nine-hour train ride and an  hour's bus drive to their village of Baan As  Kaew. It would be a wearying trip, but yes,  Ladda nodded shyly before turning her face  into her friend's shoulder, she couldn't wait  to see her family at the end of the line.  The girls came to the city, they said, be cause their families need the money. Their  wages were about $24  a month-a  little  more than 7 cents an hour for working 74hour weeks-but one girl said she managed  to send half of it home.  The outbound  trains were  filled with  youngsters such as Ladda last Chinese New  Year's. The  rest of  the year,  especially  during the dry season, when northeastern  October 21, 1987  families become desperate for even meager  earnings, children  travel  inbound  to  jobs  that sap their strength for pennies an hour.  The Hua Lampong train station often is the  interchange that gets them from the farm  to the factory.  That is when it becomes the gateway to  exploitation. Bangkok's main train station is  haunted  by  ""fisherwomen""  and  ""fisher men,""  the  job brokers who cast about in  streams of migrants for naive children look ing for work in the city. These agents prowl  the platform when the dawn train pulls in  from the northeast.  CHILDREN COMMITTED TO YEAR'S WORK IN  FACTORY  Fisherwomen are kind to the new arrivals,  offering to help them find work. Too often,  they find them jobs with 15-hour workdays.  They and Bangkok employers know these  kids will be cheap hires.  The brokers may be independent agents,  but more likely they represent one of the  dozen job agencies that line nearby streets streets that smell of urine and rotting gar bage.  Newspapers here periodically report sto ries such as the rescue by police last year of  18 girls working in a  textile factory. The  girls, most ages 12 to 14, said they worked 15  hours a day for food scraps and a few cents  pay and were locked in a room to sleep.  The owner, arrested on charges of child  slavery and false imprisonment, told police  that he got most of the children from a job  agency near the Hua Lampong station.  A year earlier, 64 children ages 13  to 15  were rescued from a mosquito-net factory  where they had labored from 6 a.m. to mid night every day. The train station agencies  were reported to have paid the parents $80  to $160 for each child, which committed the  children to a year's work in the factory.  The few job agency bosses who agreed to  talk claimed they place people 16 or older in  factories, in compliance with Thai law.  Thongma Sonboonom, wife of the head of  Swai Job Agency, said her biggest problems  are with the girls she places, not the em ployers. ""A  lot of  times girls don't keep  their contracts,""  she complained,  so. the  agency must replace them at no charge to  the employer.  She said her agents do find young workers  among  the migrants at the  train station,  just around  the corner from her second story office at the top of a filthy, unlighted  stairway.  Her agency was cited in a human rights  newsletter as placing a 10-year-old girl in a  factory where she worked for seven months.  Then she became a domestic servant and  was raped by her boss.  Asked  about  her  age  policies,  Ms.  Thongma said: ""I never place anyone in a  factory who is under 16.""  EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES CHECKED ONLY FOR  PERMITS  She does send younger children to domes tic work, Ms. Thongma said,  then volun teered  that  employers  sometime make  sexual advances toward the girls. She main tained that the bosses never do anything  too serious.  ""Nobody  I've ever sent has  raped,"" she said.  The Center of Concern for Child Labor in  Bangkok has found that independent bro kers make $11 to $15 for every child they  bring from rural villages  to Bangkok  job  placement agency.

Many this evening are focusing on  what the bill does not do. I would like  to just focus a minute on what the bill  does do.  First of all,  it closes a number of  loopholes.  It closes  the number of  preferences that are unwarranted in  both  personal  tax  and  corporate  income  tax.  discourages  hostile  takeovers through special tax changes  that make  those  less  advantageous,  and finally and most importantly, it  virtually closes one of the most egre gious abuses in the tax code; namely,  the so-called completed contract <abuse  whereby contractors, particularly de fense contractors, can virtually avoid  all  tax payments by  simply  rolling  over the length of the contract. That  is virtually eliminated now.  It  I hope my colleagues will vote for  this bill.  ",1987

1675,211,26,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, I voted  against H.R.  3545  in  committee.  I  voted against  it when  it passed the  House. Notwithstanding obvious  im provements, I shall vote against the  conference report tonight.  The tax portion is an ugly, mean spirited bill, hatched in the darkness  of a closed Democrat Caucus of Ways  and Means members. It was not im proved when  it was brought  to  the  House. In fact, it was so unpopular it  had  to be handled under  restricted  debate and  a  no-amendment proce dure. When it arrived at the Senate, it  had been subjected to little debate and  no amendments.  Small  wonder  that  the  Senate  chewed it up, and spit it out. And be cause  the Senate got as much as  it  gave  in conference, H.R. 3545  is  im measurably improved. But, it is still fa tally flawed both in concept, and in  detail.  The flawed concept is that the taxes  in  this  bill were  supposed  to buy  spending cuts. The bitter truth is that  for the next 2 years, the deficit reduc tion achieved by new taxes, fees and  premiums far outweigh the miniscule  spending cuts in this bill and in the  continuing resolution.  I am not a supporter of new taxes.  New taxes are not necessary. The re quired  deficit  reduction  can  be  achieved  purely  through  spending  cuts. As long as the majority in this  House insists on more taxes, I would  be willing to surrender some taxes for  substantial, permanent spending cuts.  For instance, a  ratio of 2 or 3 to 1,  where  $10  billion of new  taxes  is  matched by $20 to $30 billion in spend ing cuts would make sense. This bill  contains a  less  than 1-1  ratio, and,  therefore, is merely a  tax bill in the  guise of deficit reduction.  A second conceptual flaw is the al leged $30 billion total in deficit reduc tion. That is grossly inadequate. After  the floating baseline was raised by the  retriggering of Gramm-Rudman-Hol lings, the $30 billion reduction won't  reduce anything. If it can be achieved,  the deficit will actually rise.  The net, net, net of the economic  summit, and of this bill and its com panion continuing resolution,  is that  huge new taxes were traded off for a  few billion in extra defense spending.  The  administration  sold  its  no-tax  policy too cheap. It got a mess of pot tage, but almost no spending cuts.  In detail, the bill retains some bad  policy.  Two  very  special  interests:  First, 2 large chicken-producing fami lies; and second, the power consumers  of Long Island received enormous tax  preferences simply because they had  ",1987

1698,562,26,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President,  it has  come to my attention that a Chinese  student named Yang Wei, who had at tended the University of Arizona, was  convicted in a secret trial yesterday in  Shanghai. He was sentenced to 2 years  in a labor camp for distributing leaf lets and putting up posters. I rise to  express my deep concern about  this  matter and to support my Republican  colleage, Senator HELMS, in urging the  Chinese Government to release Yang  Wei and to permit greater freedom of  expression  for  students  and others  seeking democratic reforms in China.  I ask unanimous consent that an ar ticle from the New York Times of De cember 21,  1987, be printed  in  the  RECORD, at this point.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, Dec. 21, 19871  CHINESE STUDENTS ACROSS U.S. PROTEST AN  ARREST IN SHANGHAI  <By Wolfgang Saxon)  Chinese students at many colleges and  universities across the United States have  signed a petition to their Government on  behalf of an American-educated molecular  biologist who was arrested nearly a year ago  in Shanghai during a crackdown on political  dissent.  The petition, dated Dec. 18,  is addressed  to Zhao Ziyang, the Chinese party leader. It  cites recent reports that the prisoner, Yang  Wei, was about to go on trial in Shanghai  ""on charges of promoting and  instigating  counter-revolutionary propaganda.""  The charges refer  to articles Mr. Yang  had written for the journal ""China Spring,""  published in New York City since 1982 by a  Chinese emigrant physician, Wang Bingz hang, founder of the Chinese Alliance for  Democracy. In addition, Mr. Yang was ac cused of  joining Dr. Wang's organization  and of handing out leaflets during student  demonstrations for freer speech and democ racy in December 1986.  He was arrested at his parents' home last  Jan. 11.  The petition noted  that  some  signers  might not see eye to eye with Mr. Yang on  his politics and that many did not belong to  any political organization. Nevertheless,  it  declared, prosecuting Mr. Yang for joining  an organization and expressing ideas were  violations of China's Constitution.  ""Human rights situation  in China,""  the  open  letter said,  ""is a major concern of  many Chinese students and scholars abroad  and has drawn a  lot of attention of the  international  community.""  said Mr.  Yang's case was entirely political and belied  Mr. Zhao's recent assertion that there were  not political prisoners in China.  Detaining Mr. Yang for 11 months with out formal charges or trial was also con trary to the country's law on criminal proce dure, the signers said.  The petition demanded that the detention  of Mr. Yang be explained and that he and  his family be given the right to choose their  own defense lawyers. It further asked that  Mr. Yang be tried in public, and that his  rights to a proper defense be fully assured.  Finally, the petition requested that repre sentatives of Chinese students abroad be al lowed to attend the trial or testify for Mr.  Yang and that they be guaranteed freedom  to return overseas to resume their studies.

1700,562,26,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  The Senator from North Carolina.  ",1987
1701,575,26,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of  the housing amendment  before us this evening.  This legislation is the result of a lot  of dedicated hard work, to achieve a  responsible and rational housing au thorization bill this year.  Compromises have been reached in  many areas of the bill. Direct spending  programs have been cut from the bill,  and very objectionable provisions have  been made less objectionable.  This legislation is not perfect. How ever,  the bill has one provision of  paramount importance, it gives perma nent insurance authority to the FHA  mortgage programs. By making FHA  permanent, first time homebuyers can  achieve their American dream.  It was our intention to craft a bill  that could pass  the Senate and  the  House and ultimately be signed into  law by President Reagan. In my opin ion we've achieved that goal.  ",1987
1702,575,26,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. President, I rise to  congratulate the subcommittee chair man, Mr. CRANSTON,  for his distin guished leadership on this important  piece of legislation and to offer my  special thanks for his efforts to deal  with  the provisions  that would  im prove the energy efficiency of manu factured housing built in this country.  This is an extremely important issue  in the Pacific Northwest where these  structures account for approximately  30  to 40 percent of new electricity  heated homes built in this region. The  standards that we epxect to come out  of  this  legislation  should  save my  region alone approximately $500 mil lion over the next 20 years.  I want to take this opportunity to  clarify my support of the important  features related to section 569 of S.  825.  It is my understanding that the De partment of Housing and Urban De velopment will conduct a life cycle cost  analysis, taking into consideration the  cost of energy efficient measures and  energy savings from  those measures  over the effective physical life of the  structure  and  that  this  important  analysis  is  to be completed within 1  year of this legislation.  ",1987
1703,575,26,Mr. CRANSTON., I thank the Sena tor from Washington for his support  and assistance on this important legis lation. The Senator is correct that the  purpose of this section 569 of S. 825 is  to require the Department of Housing  and Urban Development to complete a  life cycle cost analysis to develop na tional standards for the energy efficiency of new manufactured housing.  This important analysis is to be com pleted in 1 year.  ,1987
1704,575,26,Mr. ADAMS.,"  I  thank  the distin guished subcommittee chairman from  California. This  is a very  important  effort and we need to begin moving as  quickly as possible.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President,  let  me take a moment in outlining some  of  the provisions of  this  legislative  effort before I yield  to Senator Do MENICI for the purpose of making re marks.  Let me  tell you,  first,  this bill  is  unique in that it is $300 million under  the appropriated levels for this year,  $300 million under, and yet in terms of  what it accomplishes, it provides per manent  insurance authority  for  the  FHA programming; permanent insur ance authority, and would that not be  a pleasure instead of having us turn  the spigot down and close off  that  stream of available housing insurance?  And without FHA  insurance, why,  those loans that are made, $1.3 million  annually  for working  families,  just  would not be.  It raises the level of the mortgage  limits  from $90,000  to $101,250,  to  more accurately reflect the increase in  housing costs and to make housing op portunities  available  for  working  middle-class Americans.  Second, what about homeownership  opportunities for working families, for  low-income  families  living  in public  housing? Section 122 of the housing  bill provides housing opportunities for  lowand moderate-income  families  living  in public housing projects  to  manage their own projects. That is im portant.  Further, section 123 provides  that  after a group of tenants have orga nized  to manage  their  own  public  housing projects, they may choose to  organize and buy the project, thus be coming home owners. That is one of  the strong points of  this bill-giving  people an opportunity to be homeown ers in this great society.  In  addition  to providing manage ment opportunities in public housing,  the bill allows the Secretary of HUD  to  waive  existing  regulations  for  tenant-management  corporations,  to  allow public housing tenants to pur chase their projects, to become home owners. This provision alone, I believe,  is  the most  significant  first  step  toward providing home ownership op portunities  for  public housing  resi dents.  Mr. President, let me concentrate on  one other provision, and that is  the  one called the Nehmiah Housing Op portunity Grant Program. It provides  home  ownership  opportunities  for  working families. It provides grants to  nonprofit corporations. It provides for  working families  in distressed neigh borhoods to purchase newly construct ed  or  substantially  rehabilitated  homes. The maximum amount of the  Nehemiah  second  mortagage  is  $15,000. It is  the difference between  giving a working family the opportuni ty to own a stake in their community  and simply just pay rent, with never  having a hope of being part of the  community. This, I believe, will be par ticularly valuable  in our  inner core  cities.  Mr. President, there are many other  provisions of this very substantial leg islative  effort  that go  a  long way  toward making  the housing  laws of  our Nation make better sense.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the name of Senator KARNES  be added as a cosponsor.  ",1987
1705,575,26,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr.  President,  I  have enjoyed the vital work of Frank  Burk, the legislative counsel, and com mend him for having brought us  to  this point.  I yield the floor.  ",1987
1706,575,26,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President, will  the Senator yield?  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield.  ",1987
1707,575,26,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President,  I  simply  say  to  the Senator  that  I  strongly support his comments about  the Nehemiah program,  a  program  which I think is extremely significant  in offering a push toward home owner ship for lower income people.  I recognize the effort which he and  Senator CRANSTON, the able chairman  of  the Housing Subcommittee  and  others have made to come up with a  housing bill which is acceptable and  which can pass; they have made a very  significant contribution to the legisla tive process.  I commend the Senator for his state ment in terms of what we are trying to  do in this legislation. I agree complete ly with his observation that the Nehe miah program offers hope to create  home ownership that did not previous ly exist, and I think this program will  make an important contribution to the  stability and strength of our neighbor hoods across the country.  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Senator.  ",1987
1708,575,26,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join my colleagues in intro ducing this amendment to the housing  bill, S. 825. I enthusiastically support  the  amendment  and  urge my  col leagues to do the same.  When the Senate voted not to waive  the Budget Act on  the conference  report to accompany S. 825, it was not  a vote against housing.  It was a vote for fiscal responsibility.  It was a vote to uphold the rules of  the Senate.  It was a vote against objectionable  House provisions adopted in the con ference report.  But it was not a vote against hous ing.  ",1987
1709,588,26,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  bill is before the Senate and open to  amendment.  If there be no amend ment to be proposed, the question is  on the engrossment and third reading  of the bill.  The bill was ordered to be engrossed  for a third reading, was read the third  time, and passeci, as follows:  S. 1994  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION  1. PREVENTING FRAUD AND ABUSE  IN  HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAMS.  <a> IN GENERAL.-As a condition of initial  or continuing eligibility for participation in  any program of the Department of Housing  and Urban Development  involving  .loans,  grants, interest or rental assistance of any  kind, or mortgage or loan insurance, and to  assure that the level of benefits provided  under these programs is' correct, the Secre tary may require that an applicant or par ticipant  (including members of an appli cant's or participant's household) disclose  his or her social security number or employ er identification number to the Secretary.  (b) APPLICANT AND PARTICIPANT CONSENT.

(3) The  term  ""public housing agency""  means  any  agency  described  in  section  3(b)(6) of the United States Housing Act of  1937.  (d)  ACCESS  RECORDS.(1) AMENDMENT TO SOCIAL SECURITY ACT. Section 303 of  the Social Security Act  is  amended by adding at the end thereof the  following new subsection:  ""(h)(l) The State agency charged with the  administration of the State law""(A) shall disclose, upon request and on a  reimbursable basis, to officers and employ ees of  the Department of Housing  and  Urban Development any of the following in formation contained in the records of such  State agency with respect to individuals ap plying for or participating in any housing  assistance program administered by the De partment""(i) wage information, and  ""(ii) whether an  individual is  receiving,  has received, or has made application for,  unemployment  compensation,  and  the  amount of any such compensation being re ceived (or to be received) by such individual,  and  ""(B) shall establish such safeguards as are  necessary <as determined by the Secretary  of Labor in regulations) to insure that infor mation disclosed under subparagraph <A> is  used only for purposes of determining an in dividual's eligibility  for  benefits, or  the  amount of benefits, under a housing assist ance program of the Department of Hous ing and Urban Development.

1710,601,26,Mr. CHILES.," Yes, that is true. It is  very important that NBS and NSA ac tivities complement each other, rather  than spark confusion through incon sistency.  ",1987
1711,601,26,Mr. HUMPHREY.," I say to the chair man that our Judiciary Subcommittee  on Technology and the Law has juris diction over the Freedom of Informa tion Act, computer security and Gov ernment  information policy, does  it  not?  ",1987
1712,601,26,Mr. LEAHY., That is correct.  ,1987
1713,601,26,Mr. HUMPHREY., There has been  some concern that the language of sec tion 8<2> of the pending bill could be  construed to support the expansion of  existing Government disclosure obliga tions. And I appreciate the Senator's  willingness to work with me to address  these concerns.  ,1987
1714,601,26,Mr. LEAHY.," Concerns  have  also  been raised that the Computer Securi ty Act might be misconstrued to re strict existing Government disclosure  obligations.  It is not the intent of this bill  to  expand or to restrict the Federal Gov ernment's disclosure obligations under  the Freedom of Information Act with  respect to any category or medium of  information.  Section 8 of H.R. 145 provides that  the bill shall not be construed to au thorize the withholding of any agency  records or information which are dis closable under the Freedom of Infor mation Act.  At the same time, section 8 does not  require the disclosure of any records,  information,  electronically  stored  data, software, data processing infor mation, or computer programs which  could be withheld under the Freedom  of Information Act. Nor does the bill  authorize  the withholding  of  any  records,  information,  electronically  stored data, software, data processing  information,  or  computer  programs  which would be disclosed under the  Freedom of Information Act.  ",1987
1715,601,26,Mr. HUMPHREY.," I thank the Sena tor for the clarification. Let me ad dress a  second  issue  that has been  raised.  U.S. commercial computer technolo gy vendors have invested heavily in re search efforts to meet the unique se curity  requirements  of  intelligence  and defense agencies with commercial  products. This spurs development of  data security technology while ensur ing that its costs do not fall principally  on the Government. We are mindful  of the potential negative  impact on  technology companies, and the Gov ernment as well, should this  legisla tion give rise to two separate and dis tinct  regimens of computer security  technology-one for civilian agencies  and another for  intelligence and de fense  agencies. Will  this  legislation  adequately safeguard the commercial  interests of these companies?  ",1987
1716,601,26,Mr. LEAHY.," The  legislation does  not mandate or even urge the estab lishment of two sets of data security  standards or systems. Instead, it pro vides a framework for recognizing and  reconciling the sometimes differing se curity needs of these distinct commu nities.  Mr. President, today we are consider ing  the Computer Security Act  of  1987. The House sent this bill over to  the Senate on June 23. Since  that  time, I have been working with Sena tors CHILES, GLENN, HOLLINGS,  and  ROTH,  Congressmen GLICKMAN  and  BROOKS,  the  National  Security  Agency, the National Bureau of Stand ards, and the Office of Management  and Budget to assure the adoption of  this important legislation.  This legislation will restore civilian  control over all Federal computer sys tems except those excluded under the  Brooks Act <10 U.S.C. 2315) and the  Paperwork Reduction Act <44 U.S.C.  3502(2)). The Computer Security Act  is a significant act of Congress that re jects the promulgation of information  policy by executive fiat.  The central purpose of this legisla tion is to reject the Federal computer  security plan set forth in NSDD-145.  National Security Decision Directive  145 signaled a dramatic shift in the  management of Government informa tion protection from civilian authority  to military authority. It has set the  Government on  a  course  that has  served neither the needs of national  security nor the interests of the Amer ican people. Since the issuance of that  directive we have watched a Govern ment attempt to:  Limit the availability of unclassified  data in Government data bases;  Place selective  limits on who may  access Government data bases;  Intimidate private data base firms  and public libraries to limit access to  their electronic files-files which con tain information published in newspa pers everyday;  Impose unnecessary restrictions on  the nearly 500 U.S. firms that sell in formation abroad.  These efforts have been widely op posed by the leaders of our informa tion  industry  and  those  concerned  with the public's right to know. The  president of Mead Data Central told a  Congressional hearing that ""Such new  restrictive  and unwarranted policies  under the unilateral control of the De fense Community  threaten  to bring  this  industry  to  a halt and would  negate  the  significant  productivity  gains being made in many sectors of  our economy .... ""The Computer Se curity Act of 1987: Hearings before the  Subcommittee on Science, Research  and Technoiogy and the Subcommit tee on Transportation, Aviation and  Materials of the House Committee on  Science, Space and Technology, lOOth  Cong., 1st Sess. 112 <1987) (statement  of Jack Simpson). Counsel for dialog  has warned that these controls could  have a devastating impact, noting that  ""the  information  industry  is one of  the few areas of commerce in which  the United States has a favorable bal ance of  trade."" The Boston Globe,  April 20, 1987, at 35.  Moreover, such efforts obstruct the  free flow of information in our society.  Information is the cornerstone of our  democracy. As a comprehensive report  from People for the American Way re leased last week warns, a government  of secrecy produces ""Decisions without  Democracy.""  The Computer Security Ac.t estab lishes a  comprehensive program  for  Federal computer systems security. A  civilian agency-the National Bureau  of Standards  [NBSJ-will  implement  that program. As H.R. 145 states in  the first specific purpose outlined in  section 2(b)(l), the act assigns to the  National Bureau of Standards respon sibility for developing standards and  guidelines for Federal computer sys tems,  including responsibility for de veloping  standards  and  guidelines  needed to assure the cost-effective se curity and privacy of sensitive infor mation in Federal computer systems,  drawing on the technical advice and  assistance of  the National Security  Agency, where appropriate.  The Computer Security Act assigns  to NBS responsibility for developing  standards and guidelines for the secu rity of Federal computer systems. It  provides for a Computer Systems Ad visory Board to identify emerging Fed eral computer  security  and privacy  issues. It requires the development of  security plans by the heads of all Fed eral agencies. And it will establish a  training program for all persons  in volved  in Federal computer systems.  These are sound and comprehensive  objectives for a Federal computer se curity policy.  There is no question that properly  classified information requires special ized  security measures  to safeguard  against unauthorized acquisition,  al teration, or destruction. That is why  the Computer Security Act  leaves  NSA's authority over computer sys tems containing such information un changed.  OMB Director Jim Miller has also  outlined this relationship between the  agencies:  ... it is the Administration's position that  NBS,  in developing Federal standards for  the security o~ computers, shall draw upon  technical security guidelines developed by  NSA in so far as they are available and con sistent with  the requirements of civil de partments and  agencies  to protect data  processed  in  their systems. When devel oping technical security guidelines, NSA will  consult with NBS to determine how its ef forts can best support such requirements.  ",1987
1717,614,26,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President, the  conferees on the budget reconciliation  bill have reached an agreement that  will redirect the Nation's program for  the management  of  nuclear waste  along the lines set out in S. 1668, the  bill  reported by  the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources on Sep tember 1, 1987. Although this redirec tion is being enacted as part of title V  of H.R. 3545, the budget reconciliation  legislation for fiscal year 1988, the leg islative history of the nuclear waste  provisions is that of S. 1668.  This redirection will move the pro gram forward, so that its goal of safe,  permanent isolation of nuclear waste  under  Federal  auspices  can  be  achieved. There will be significant cost  reductions-at least $4 billion.  The bulk of these savings will result  from concentrating our efforts to de velop a deep geologic repository on a  single site, rather than on three sites  as required under the Nuclear Waste  Policy Act of 1982. S. 1668 provided for  a selection of a preferred repository  site by  the Secretary of Energy by  January 1, 1989 and a phasing out of  site characterization activities at the  remaining  two sites. The conference  agreement selects the Yucca Mountain  site in Nevada as the preferred site  and directs  that siting activities  in  Texas  and Washington  State  be  phased out in an orderly manner and  terminated within 90 days. While it is  not specifically required by the agree ment,  it  is my hope  that DOE will  report to Congress at the end of the  90-day period and provide an invento ry of the work and contracts phased  out at each of these sites and any non site specific activities that are planned  to continue.  The House conferees insisted on the  selection of the Nevada site by Con gress in the compromise legislation. In  the Senate, we had retained the proc ess of selection by the Secretary of  Energy based on scientific information  gathered and analyzed by the Depart ment of Energy [DOE] under the scru tiny of the Nuclear Regulatory Com mission and the National Academy of  Sciences. The House approach greatly  simplifies this process. I believe that  this simplification should render moot  the  litigation  that  currently  chal lenges DOE's siting decisions  in the  Repository Program. S. 1668 contained  a provision explicitly preserving pend ing  litigation.  This  provision  was  dropped out by the conferees, howev er. Now that Congress has made the  decisions to proceed with characteriza tion of the Yucca Mountain site and to  terminate the second repository pro gram, I believe that the judicial review  of the siting decisions in the first and  second repository programs should no  longer be necessary or appropriate.  The conference agreement also fol lows the policy set forth in S. 1668 in  authorizing  a monitored  retrievable  storage facility as an integral part of  the Nation's nuclear waste manage ment  system. The MRS can be of  great value to the system as a packag ing and handling  facility  and as  a  source of backup storage capacity in  the event that the first-of-a-kind proc ess of developing a deep geologic re- .  pository takes longer than DOE antici pates in current planning documents.  As a packaging and handling facility,  the MRS allows the collection of spent  fuel in the Eastern United States near  the center of gravity of spent fuel pro duction and shipment to  the reposi tory  in Nevada by unit train. Spent  nuclear fuel shipment miles will be re duced by about two-thirds in compari son with a no-MRS waste management  system under which  individual ship ments from each reactor site in the  East go directly to the repository.  As a source of backup storage capac ity, the inclusion of the MRS in the  national nuclear waste management  system will  result  in a much more  flexible system and will permit early  hands-on experience with spent fuel  management. Accepting spent fuel at  an MRS will also mean that staff at  DOE responsible for repository devel opment will be able to concentrate on  repository work in a way that is un complicated  by  waste  acceptance  issues.  The House conferees, it is fair to say,  do not share the Senate's view of the  value of the MRS to the Nation's nu clear  waste  management  system.  House conferees expressed deep con cern that an MRS could become a sub stitute for the deep geologic repository  itself. This has never been the intent  of the Senate, as we have said many,  many  times. The MRS  is a part-a  very  important part-of the Reposi tory Program.  At the insistence of the House con ferees, the compromise legislation con tains several unfortunate and unneed ed restrictions on the MRS. These re strictions will necessarily reduce some what the contribution to the program  that the MRS will be permitted  to  make. I expect that the effect of these  restrictions will be studied and evalu ated objectively by the MRS Commis sion that is  retained  in the compro mise from the Senate bill. The Com mission should examine how the MRS  can contribute to the waste manage ment system both with and without  the restrictions, so Congress will more  fully appreciate the value of the MRS.  In  determining whether  an MRS  should be a part of the Nation's nucle ar waste management  system,  the  Commission should look at both the  constrained  and  an  unconstrained  MRS. The expenditures of the MRS  Commission will be paid for out of the  nuclear waste fund.  One of the restrictions added at the  insistence  of  the House  conferees  makes it so that DOE may not formal ly select an MRS site until after com pletion of site characterization of the  Nevada site, at the time at which the  Secretary of Energy  recommends  to  the President a site for development  as a  repository. According  to DOE's  current schedule,  that will  result  in  formal site selection in 1994.  It  is  unfortunate,  in my opinion,  that  the House  conferees  insisted  upon delaying formal MRS site selec tion until the mid-1990's. However, the  provisions of  the conference  agree ment will allow  the site survey and  evaluation  to proceed after June 1,  1989, the date for submission of the  MRS Commission report. As part of  that site survey and evaluation, DOE  will be able to gain access to any of  the sites surveyed in order to obtain  data and information sufficient to sup port an MRS license application to the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This  provision of the agreeement will allow  DOE to conduct the necessary site-spe cific work and to gather the essential  site data prior to the formal selection  and designation of an MRS site and,  hence, minimize the time between the  selection of a site and submission of a  license application to NRC. Therefore,  there should be no significant time lag  between these two milestones.  One of the other restrictions added  at the insistence of the House confer ees, would  prohibit  continued  con struction of an MRS or acceptance of  spent fuel at such a facility if a reposi tory license is revoked by NRC or if  construction of the repository is termi nated. It should be understood, howev",1987
1718,627,26,Mr. JOHNSTON.," It is not the intent  of the conferees that this prohibition  restrict the authority of the Secretary  of the Interior which he may enjoy  under current  law. The Distribution  System Loans Act authorizes the Sec retary of the Interior to require, as  conditions to any such loan, that the  borrower transfer certain lands or in terests in lands as well as distribution  works constructed in whole or in part  with moneys lent under the act. The  act provides that when full repayment  has been made to the United States  the Secretary shall retransfer to the  borrower  title  to  the works and all  lands and interests in land which were  transferred by it to the United States.  I would  advise  the  distinguished  ranking member of the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources  that  the authority of the Secretary to re transfer title pursuant to the Distribu tion System Loans Act is not affected  by enactment of the conferee's recom mendation. It is in fact a  transfer of  title which is authorized by a specific  act of Congress as required in the con ference agreement.  Mr. McCLURE. I  man.  thank the chair conference  thank the chair In regard to the conference agree ment and the Rehabilitation and Bet terment Act,  I would note  for  the  record that the conference report on  the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982  recognized that rehabilitation and bet terment loans are considered as oper ation and maintenance costs and that  the conferees did not intend to imply  that either existing or future rehabili tation  and betterment  loans would  subject districts to the extensions of  the application of the acreage limita tions after repayment of contruction  charges. Does  the conference agree ment to H.R. 3545 alter in any way the  determination made by the committee  of  conference  on  the Reclamation  Reform Act regarding the applicabil ity of acreage  limitations and  loans  made pursuant to the Rehabilitation  and Betterment Act?  ",1987
1719,627,26,Mr.  JOHNSTON.," The  agreement does not.  Mr. McCLURE.  I  man.  Mr. President, I would first like to  speak to the provisions of the reconcil iation  package  that deal with  the  future course of this Nation's Nuclear  Waste Disposal Program. These provi sions are found in subtitle A of title V  of the budget reconciliation bill.  The progression of events leading to  these  final provisions  are  truly  re markable. At times, even I questioned  the likelihood for survival of this piece  of legislation throughout this wrench ing  legislative process.  I would not  have placed much hope in the bill's  survival even as recently as the middle  of last week. But thanks to the relent less staying power of the many players  in this process-not the least of whom  is the distinguished chairman on the  Energy and Natural Resources Com mittee, without whose vision and de termination we would  have  never  reached this point-we can each take  pride  in the fact that we have pro duced a surprisingly good end product.  While the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources cannot claim total  victory nor take total credit for this  product, we  can  nevertheless  take  heart in the fact that the bulk of the  legislative  events  that have yielded  this result originated from our com mittee's intensive labors.  I remind my colleagues of the fact  that  the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources did not  take  the  nuclear waste issues lightly over this  past year. We faced  the issues head  on, starting very early in the session.  We scheduled so many hearings on  this issue that at times I thought we  would be  accused  of  overkill. And  then, as  the fruits of  those endless  hours of hearings were finally trans lated into legislative initiatives, I was  very  proud  of  the  outcome.

1726,783,26,Mr. SAWYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  recognize Roadway Express, a corporation lo cated in my congressional district and the re cipient of  the 1986 President's Trophy,  the  trucking  industry's most  prestigious  safety  award.  At a time when  the American public  is in creasingly  expressing  concerns  over  the  safety of our transportation system, it is with  great pride  that  I share with you  the distin guished recognition Roadway Express has re ceived  for  its safety efforts and accomplish ments in the trucking industry.  The President's Trophy was presented  to  Roadway Express at the recently held Ameri can Trucking Association's annual convention.  Roadway was chosen on the basis of its over all safety record, which for the fourth consec utive year remains the best in the Nation and  for its safety program activities. In that Road way provides service to all 50 States and  its  operation covers nearly 500 million miles a  year, the company's achievement in this area  represents an enormous commitment  toward  providing the safest possible service and one  that certainly benefits not 0nly its customers  but also the motoring public in general.  The President's Trophy  is well deserved  recognition for Roadway's longstanding com mitment to safety on our highways. More than  20 years ago, I worked for Roadway Express  to save enough money to go back to school.  It was a valuable experience  for many  rea sons, but among the clearest lessons I recall  was the enormous pride taken throughout the  company at every  level  for  its  industrywide  safety  leadership.  I  remain  proud  of  that  achievement today.  The judges for this year's award were Rich ard P.  Landis, Associate Administrator  for  Motor Carriers at the Federal Highway Admin istration; Chuck Hurley, execution director for  the National Safety Council's Washington, DC,  office; and Chuch Livingston, coordinator of  safety programs for the Highway Users Feder ation.  The President's Trophy is a tribute to Road way's drivers, dock workers, and mechanics,  as well as its management personnel. I extend  my thanks to them all for the ongoing effort to  keep safety a major priority and the exemplary  standards they continue to set for the industry  to follow.  THE SUPERCONDUCTING SUPER  COLLIDER  HON.CARLOSJ.MOORHEAD  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 21, 1987  Mr. MOO,RHEAD. Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to praise the efforts of several dtverse, ener getic groups to locate the proposed supercon ducting super collider in  the State of California. These groups-comprised of numerous  chambers of commerce, city councils, boards  of supervisors, newspapers, and large groups  of citizens-are convinced, as I am, of the im portance  of  this  project  to  the  economic  growth of California. The sse would add con siderably to local and State funding and per sonal income, and it would provide more jobs  for California residents. The excitement of this  project has spread  to  the general public; 69  percent of northern Californians who are famil iar with the SSG support California as its loca tion.  The State of California is ready and willing  to commit $1 billion in an effort to place the  SSG within  its borders. California, enriched  with  a wealth  of scientists  and  academic  talent, has  the resources and  technology  to  fully support and maintain this great scientific  project.  Recent  studies  have  shown  that  present designs of the sse make it impervi ous  to  earthquake  damage,  particularly at  either of the proposed sites in Stockton and  Davis. Communities throughout northern Cali fornia  have  expressed  the  need  for  this  project and, just as importantly, the State itself  is committed to making its wishes become re ality.  In addition, all 47 members of the Cali fornia congressional delegation are in full sup port of having this  important research  facility  located in the Golden State.  TRIBUTE TO RAY A.

1727,783,26,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor a distinguished and very able  gentleman, Mr. Ray A. Barnhart, who is retir ing from his position as Federal Highway Ad ministrator at  the end of this year. Ray has  headed  the Federal Highway Administration  for the last 7 years.  In my opinion, there has  been no more able or forthright administrator  at the Department of Transportation during his  tenure.  In my capacity as chairman of the Transpor tation Appropriations Subcommittee,  I have  dealt with Ray on many occasions. Some times we have been on the same side, some times not. But no matter what  the circum stances,  the  things  I could always count on  from Ray were professio11alism and straight  talk. Those are valued commodities in Washington.  Mr. Speaker, the Federal Highway Adminis tration  rarely makes  the  front pages. But,  if  you  talk  to  the executives and policymakers  around  town, you will  find  that  the Federal  Highway Administration has a  reputation as  one of the better managed and more effective  Federal agencies anywhere  in Government.  They have built a transportation network that  is by far the best in the world. This is a tribute  to the men and women of the Federal High way  Administration,  and  to Ray  Barnhart  whose stewardship has been exemplary.  I extend my congratulations to Ray for a job  well done. And, as long as he is not running  tor office,  I wish him  the very best  for  the  future.  ~  ",1987

And I want  to  thank the distinguished Senator from  North Carolina. I think this will expe dite the process of the hearings and  maybe get the treaties to the floor a  bit earlier.

I am one  who believes  that the action of  the  Senate on this treaty will have a great  deal to do with the progress of negoti ations on the second group of issues  before our negotiators at Geneva. The  strategic arms reduction talks and the  START talks ought to go forward as  rapidly as possible. I believe this is a  good time, and I would have preferred  to have them sooner, but I understand  the problem which the chairman has  encountered.

1749,809,26,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  Congress finally has passed a housing  authorization bill. It's about time.  I first want to commend the Senator  from  California,  chairman  of  the  Housing Subcommittee, for his hard  work on  this  legislation.  I  am not  pleased with every provision of  the  bill, but it should provide a stable en vironment in which housing and com munity development programs can be  effectively administered over the next  2 years.  The  people  of New  Jersey need  housing programs. Affordable housing  is scarce in New Jersey, where land  and development prices are skyrocket ing. The urban poor, the young family,  the elderly are all struggling to find  decent housing at an affordable price.  New  Jersey's cities also need  this  bill. They have endured the loss of  revenue sharing and a steep reduction  in State urban aid. They have been hit  by cuts in the UDAG and CDBG pro grams. One by one,  they have seen  sources of Federal and State commit ment shrink. New Jersey's mayors are  faced with raising taxes to maintain  vital  services. Aging  infrastructures  also will require significant capital in vestment.  It has been far too long since Con gress passed legislation to reauthorize  our housing and community develop ment  programs. Communities  have  struggled  to  administer  programs  whose continuation has been subject  to the uncertainties of continuing res olutions and supplemental appropria tions bills. Long-term planning has  been severely hampered.  This bill would  authorize  several  housing and community development  programs at current levels. These in clude  important  programs  such  as  Community  Development  Block  Grants [CDBG'sl, and Urban Develop ment Action Grants  [UDAG's]. New  Jersey  has  received many  benefits  from  these programs. In fiscal year  1987, the State received about $95 mil lion through the CDBG program and  about $10 million  in UDAG grants.  This has helped to revitalize our urban  areas,  increase  the  availability  of  housing,  and strengthen  the econo mies of several communities around  the State.  The bill also includes a provision I  introduced to help ensure that com munities in New Jersey and elsewhere  are treated fairly under the Urban De velopment, Action Grant  Program.  The UDAG statute bars  the use of  UDAG's to facilitate business reloca tion. There has been controversy over  the application of this provision, espe cially in New Jesey where many busi nesses are relocating due to the many  economic  benefits  offered  by  our  State.  The amendment  I, offered, which  has been included in the conference  committee's report, would give an ap plicant community 90-day notice of  intent to withhold, deny or cancel as sistance. During that time,  the com munity would be able to appeal the de cision  to  the  Secretary. This will  ensure that communities will not have  to worry that an arbitrary and dis criminatory decision may cost them a  legitimate grant award.  Another provision in the bill I want  to note would extend the entitlement  status of certain metropolitan cities  and urban counties under the CDBG  program. Because of the urgent need  for this provision, and the chance that  the housing authorization bill would  not be approved this year, I successful ly sought its inclusion as an amend ment  to  the  continuing  resolution  passed by the Senate last week.  In New Jersey, Hudson County, and  the city of Hoboken have historically  received funding under urban county  status. As Hoboken has grown, the city  reached  the point at which it could  break with  the county and  receive  CDBG funds on its own as a metropol itan city. This bill will give them the  option of deferring metropolitan city  status and continuing the current ar rangement.  In  fact,  Hoboken  and  Hudson County have agreed to contin ue  this arrangement, but the agree ment  is contingent on enactment of  this legislation. I am pleased that the  extension of  the entitlement status  will allow the decision to be made at  the local level.  I have also supported another provi sion in the bill which would address a  serious problem that has developed in  Gloucester Township, NJ, and several  other areas. In Gloucester Township,  there is a high rate of delinquency on  property  tax  payments  by  holders  of  Farmers  Home  Administration  [FmHAl mortgages. This means that  other taxpayers must bear the burden  of these unpaid taxes. To remedy this  type of problem the bill requires the  FmHA to establish escrow procedures  to collect property tax payments with  monthly mortgage payments. This will  help municipalities collect their prop erty tax revenues a-:td will help FmHA  borrowers better budget their tax re sponsibilities.  I also want to note a provision in the  bill which will  raise  the ceiling on  FHA-insured mortgages  in high-cost  areas. This provision is very important  to New Jersey, where the current ceil ing is too low to service a significant  number of aspiring home-buyers.  There  is one provision  in  the bill  about which  I am particularly con cernedthe provision that would ter minate  the  Housing  Development  Grant [HoDAG] Program at the end  of fiscal yar 1989. This is a new provi sion that was not included in the bill  as passed originally by the Senate, but  which has been forced on us by those  who have opposed this legislation.  This indeed is a bitter pill to swal low. The HoDAG Program is an im portant one  that has expanded  the  supply  of  housing  in many  areas  around  the country. Terminating a  vital housing program like HoDAG is  bad policy, very bad policy, especially  given the severity of the housing crisis  in America.  Mr. President, you hear a lot of talk  these days about getting down to fun damentals. Well, housing is a funda mental.  It's a  fundamental  human  need. And it's a need that's increasing ly going unmet in this country. That's  why this Nation must make housing a  priority.  Housing  and  community  develop ment programs have been neglected  for too long. This bill isn't perfect. But  it's an important step toward giving  these programs the priority they de serve.e  ",1987

Mr.  Speaker, when  the  football  season  started for district 5-AAAA, no one expected  the Yellowjackets to do more than put up a  good  fight against other high-ranked district  and northeast Texas  teams, such as McKin ney  (State champion, 1979), Denison  (State  champion, 1984), Paris (ranked in the top 10  all year), Ennis, and others. To add to YellowDecember 22, 1987  jacket concerns,  there was a change  in  the  head coaching position just before our season  began-a season that would see us lose two  of the first three games. Then-the cinderella like climb began for Rockwall High School one  that led to  the finals-a battle between  the best team  in north Texas, and  the best  team in south Texas. In this game there could  be no loser and there was none. At the end of  the 48 minute contest at Texas A&M Kyle  Field last Saturday, the defending State AAAA  champion, West Orange-Stark  (ranked ninth  nationally) had outscored our Jackets by a  mere 1 0 points-17 to 7. No one in Rockwall  feels  that we suffered a defeat, but all  feel  that our team, week after week, performed a  miracle-and  I can't start  to  tell  you how  proud we all are of them. Our Yellowjackets  are champions and the only reason Troy Miller  should not be named  ""coach of  the year""  would be that he is named ""coach of the cen tury."" The Yellowjackets, quarterbacked by  Andy Hollon, are as follows:  Kevin Kaufman, Chad Keck, David Piepen burg,  Daron Gillian,  Keith Williams, Chris  Burks, Dallas Eshelman Rodney Glaze, Kelly  Johns, Robbie Birleson, Maika Hayes, Bran don Kennedy, Tony McGuire, Brian Thomas,  Brant Gillen, Wayman Moore, Kris Mason,  Byron Cromer, Brian McCormick, Jim White.  Ross Redden,  Justin Hall, Dan Willess,  David Gaffney, Gregg Coker, Brent Davis,  Mike  Grigsby,  Scott Wischnewsky,  Brian  Helmer, Doug  Johnson, Chris  Ice, Robert  Ward, Steve Aultman, Tim Walker, Dean Wil less, Daron Ballew, Mark Van Dyne,  John  Garvin, Eric Towell, Chad Ghormley,  and  David Hooker.  The trainers are: Jim Harris, Mike Thomas,  Gary Godwin, and the Rockwall High School  principal is Ron Eubanks.  No one could be more proud of this team  effort. Fans, parents, relatives, and supporters  are all proud and pleased with our Yellowjack ets. Mr. Speaker, as we adjourn today-and  as we close out  the  first half of  the 1 OOth  Congress-let us adjourn in recognition of the  Rockwall Fighting Yellowjackets of 1987-the  team who never quit-who were winners on  the gridiron and will certainly be winners and  leaders in the years that are ahead of them.

1751,952,26,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, on December 16,  1987, I was joined by eight of my colleagues  in introducing H.R. 3777, the Criminal Justice  Reform Act of 1987, on behalf of the adminis tration.  This proposed  legislation will complete the  major crime prevention initiative originally pro posed by  the administration during  the 98th  Congress-an  initiative which  has  already  seen enactment of many criminal  justice re forms as part of  the Comprehensive Crime  Control Act of 1984.  The  three measures contained  in  this bill  are extremely important for those wish to see  ",1987
