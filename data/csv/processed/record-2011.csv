0,,112,0.498,1,2011-01-07,Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado.," Madam  Speaker, today our national debt  is  $14.01 trillion. It rolled over to above  $14 trillion for the first time on New  Year’s Eve last week. On January 6,  2009, the start of the 111th Congress,  the national debt was at $10.63 trillion.  This means the national debt has increased by $3.38 trillion since then—in  just 2 short years. This debt and its interest payments we are passing to our  children and to all future Americans.  I have been submitting, and will continue to submit, this debt to the CONGRESSIONALRECORD daily, and I will  continue to do so until Washington  takes responsibility and ends its reckless spending addiction.  f  SEND YOUR RESUMES  (Mr. JACKSON of Illinois asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)

1,,112,-0.538,1,2011-01-07,Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.," Madam  Speaker, as we enter 2011, we find ourselves in the same jobs situation as in  2010. In order to show the huge need for  jobs, I will be collecting resumes from  Americans who are unemployed or underemployed. I’ll submit them for the  CONGRESSIONALRECORD. Unfortunately,  submitting  these  resumes  for  the  RECORDwill not get anybody a job.  By collecting these resumes, I hope  to dramatize the shameful condition of  unemployment and compel Congress to  do something about it. I hope to remind my colleagues every day that we  work  for those Americans who have  been left behind but who want to work.  Today, I call on my fellow Americans  to send me your resume and your story  to resumesforAmerica@mail.house.gov.  ResumesforAmerica@mail.house.gov. If  you are out of work, send me your resume and story so that I can use it to  remind our government of the need to  act.  Martin Luther King, Jr. once said:  America has issued us a bad check. It  has come back marked  ‘‘insufficient  funds.’’ But the vault of opportunity of  this Nation is not bankrupt.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

5,House,112,0.561,8,2011-01-07,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot  of arguments on the other side of the  aisle in regard to the $230 billion cost,  and on our side of the aisle, of course,  only in America can something actually cost $1.15 trillion and eliminating  it then all of a sudden costs $230 billion. But, yes, Ms. SLAUGHTER, only in  America, only in this Congress, numbers do lie.  Let me just say that what we have  been talking about on this side of the  aisle, of course,  is the voice of the  American people.  You know, it was about 3,000 years  ago that a little shepherd boy walked  into that valley of death looking up at  all of those Philistines and that 9-foot  giant Goliath from Gath. He had that  coat of mail, he had the sword, he had  the shield, he had the  javelin. And  what did little David have? He had a  little pouch and a handful of stones.  But he hit that giant right between the  eyes, brought him to his knees, and  then cut off the head of the snake.  That pouch and those little pebbles  represent the voice of the American  people. That is what we have on this  side of the aisle. That is why we are  going to pass H. Res. 9 and we are going  to pass H.R. 2 next week, and we are  going to deliver our promise to the  American people to eliminate, to repeal ObamaCare.  The American people spoke loudly.  They don’t like this bill. The Democratic majority in the Senate and the  President have  one  last  chance  to  make amends. I think they will do it.  ",2011
6,House,112,-0.502,8,2011-01-07,Mr. MARKEY.," This debate is about  health care versus don’t care.  The Democrats’ health care law lowers prescription drug costs, helps middle class families pay for health coverage for their sick children, and expands health care for 32 million more  Americans, reducing the deficit by $143  billion. The Democrats’ health care law  helps grandma afford her prescription  drugs.  The Republicans don’t care about  grandma. They want to take back the  drug benefits in the new law. GOP used  to stand for Grand Old Party; now it  stands for ‘‘grandma’s out of prescriptions.’’ The Republicans’ ‘‘don’t care’’  repeal shows they don’t care about sick  children with medical bills pushing  families  into bankruptcy,  that  they  don’t care about grandma and grandpa  who need help paying for prescription  drugs.  Vote down this rule so that we can  help grandma, sick children, and middle class families struggling to pay for  health care.  ",2011
7,House,112,0.571,8,2011-01-07,Mr. CANSECO.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise today in support of the rule and in  support of the underlying legislation,  the repealing of the job-killing health  care act.  Ten months ago, President Obama  and his allies  in the Democrat-controlled House and Senate committed  legislative malpractice  when  they  jammed through the Congress and into  law a Washington takeover of health  care. They did so despite the overwhelming opposition of the American  people. Since its enactment into law,  what was already a unpopular law has  only continued to become more unpopular.  There is no doubt that we need to reform health care in America. However,  it is not done by assaulting individual  liberties guaranteed in our Constitution,  bankrupting  our  children  and  grandchildren, and putting Washington  bureaucrats in the personal relationships between our doctors and our patients.  Repealing the health care bill will  also help encourage job growth to get  our economy back on track. Our economy is not suffering from a capital crisis; it is suffering from a confidence  crisis.  ",2011
8,House,112,-0.402,8,2011-01-07,Mr. PALLONE.," Madam Speaker, this  is nothing but a gag rule. I and so  many of my colleagues on the Democratic side went up to the Rules Committee yesterday and asked for amendments, and they were almost all excluded from this rule.  The Republican chairman of the committee says there is transparency. He  says that there is an opportunity for  participation. He can say it as many  times as he wants, but it is simply not  true.  He also said that this was a commitment to the American people. There is  no commitment to the American people here. The only commitment is to  the insurance companies. They are the  only ones that are going to gain from  repeal of this very important legislation, because they want to  increase  premiums, and they want to institute  discriminatory practices again against  women, a woman perhaps who has  breast cancer and a preexisting condition and can’t get insurance, or bring  back those lifetime caps, or bring back  those annual caps where people  lose  their insurance if they have had a serious operation and they try to go back  again and they don’t have insurance, or  perhaps the child who is up to 26 and  who also will not be able to get on  their parents’ insurance policy again.  Let me tell you here, the only one  who benefits is the insurance company,  not the American people.

Well, he had no choice with this  rule. It’s a pretty short one.  I just want to say in the brief 2 minutes that we have here that this is a  pretty  important  issue  that we are  faced with.

Madam Speaker, any Member who  does not vote in favor of this resolution  is allowing the problem to persist. This  resolution rectifies the problem which  we all realize has happened. I believe  that we have a responsibility to this  institution, we have a responsibility to  the Constitution, we have a responsibility to the American people, and this  resolution rectifies a problem that has  existed.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011
12,House,112,0.593,22,2011-01-07,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, history,  heritage  and  symbols  of  the  United States are  constantly under  criticism in this country. Even yesterday when we read the Constitution of  the United States on the House floor,  the first time it has ever been done in  200 years, there were some who complained that it is irrelevant. It is kind  of like folks in church that cover their  ears when certain sections of the Bible  are read. They don’t want to hear it because it may apply to them.  People go to court nowadays to try  to remove our national motto, In God  We Trust. It  is above the  flag, Mr.  Speaker, although television very seldom shows our national motto.  Then there are those who are offended  by  the American  flag, Old  Glory. It is not even displayed in parts  of the United States because it offends  some people. Some people that are included in the group are foreigners who  are offended by the American flag.  Now we get to today, a report by the  Houston Chronicle about Marine Michael Merola, a 60-year-old vet from  the United States Marine Corps, and he  flies, here he is, he still looks like a  Marine, this is a photograph from the  Chronicle that shows Old Glory and, of  course, the Marine flag, flying in his  backyard on a 20-foot flagpole.  No one has complained. His neighbors  like it. Kids walk by and actually compliment him on flying Old Glory and  the Marine flag. But the neighborhood  association has complained and sued.  Now, who is this guy? Well, he served  in the United States Marines from 1969  to 1977. He trained with the United  States Navy SEALs. After he left the  Marine Corps, he was responsible as  sergeant of the guard for raising the  flag at NSA right down the road. He is  from New York, but he got to Texas as  fast as he could, and he has no intention of taking down this flag or flagpole. He is a passionate American. He  is a marine.  But the association doesn’t like it,  and here  is what they have said  in  their  lawsuit: the  flagpole  is a detriment to the association. It causes imminent harm and irreparable injury to  the association. The problem with the  flagpole of that height and that significance is it flaps in the wind and causes  noise to other homeowners. That  is  their problem. So they sued him.  Now, first of all, we have an issue of  freedom of speech. The Supreme Court  has said it is a right to fly the flag.  Speech includes the flying of the American flag. It is the symbol of everything that  is good and right about  America. That is why it is behind you,  Mr. Speaker, when we go into session  every day.  Marines and sailors and soldiers and  members  of  the Coast Guard have  fought under that  flag all over the  world and have died for that flag so the  association can exist down there  in  northwest Houston. Right now we are  engaged in two wars, in Afghanistan  and Iraq, and members of our military  are fighting under that flag. But it is  flying in the breeze and offends the association because the flapping causes  irreparable injury.  Well,  flapping  in  the  breeze  has  brought safety to the United States.  The flag flying throughout the world  and the noise, if we can use that word,  the sound of freedom, is the sound of  that flag flying in the United States  and throughout the world. It is freedom of speech, and it trumps the elitist  concept that the flag and the flagpole  are offensive to the association.  You know, Mr. Merola is a marine.  Once a marine, always a marine. And  we are proud of our marines in the  United States. They  are  a  unique  bunch. That was best said by an Army  general about the Marines, ‘‘There are  only two groups that understand the  marines—the marines, and the enemy.’’  And that is correct.  So good for you, Mike Merola. Keep  your flagpole up. Fly Old Glory. Fly  the marine flag. We are proud of you.  Keep fighting for the flag, because freedom of flying the flag trumps the concept that it is offensive to some people.  God bless our marines, God bless you,  Mike Merola, and semper fi.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  ",2011
13,House,112,0.618,22,2011-01-07,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Thank you, Mr.  Speaker. I very much appreciate the  privilege to address you here on the  floor of the House in this leadership  hour designated by the majority leader.  There are a number of subjects  I  wanted to take up this afternoon, but I  am  first  inspired by  the  statement  made by the gentleman  from Texas,  Judge, Congressman, Mr. POE, about  Marine Mike Merola.  This is one of these recurring stories  that we hear across the country. Somebody that is an ACLU individual, somebody that thinks somehow they get indignant because  there  is  something  somewhere that would allow them to  vent  some  of  their  prepackaged  hyperventilation against patriotism or  the truth or life or the Constitution or  the Declaration of  Independence or  American values or the values of Western Civilization or Judeo-Christianity,  all those people out there are full of indignities.  So an American flag and a marine  flag offends somebody? I say tough. I  am glad you are there. Fly that flag.  Fly it proud and fly it long.  I especially appreciate the statement  made by Mr. POEabout the sound of  that flag. My flag is on a flagpole about  that same height, 20 foot. I step out my  door in the morning, I check the wind  and the weather and I look at that flag,  and I listen to that sound. And there is  times I am sitting there in the dark at  night on my deck and I am hearing  that flag from the light that shines on  it around the corner just a little bit,  and I hear that ripple of Old Glory. It  gives me comfort and it gives me pride,  and it reminds me of the privilege of  serving here, anywhere you can serve  Americans anywhere on this globe.  I think of a time also on March 18,  2003, where I went out here to Pershing  Park, this side of the White House,  when there was an antiwar demonstration that took place. I actually walked  around through the Mall, around the  Washington Monument as  they prepared their demonstration. I remember  former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, John Conyers, standing on a  little stage there with great big speakers calling  for  the  impeachment of  President Bush because it looked like  there was an impending liberation of  Iraq. And I saw a man there.  Every kind of discontented, counter-  cultural, anti-American group was represented in those thousands of people  that came here that day. I saw the Japanese communist flag. I saw Vegetarians for Peace. I saw every counter-  culturalist group you can imagine. And  I saw a man there, an aging hippie. He  had on a  jacket. He was a photographer, you could tell, and he was taking pictures with great pride of this  anti-Americanism.  He reached in his pocket of his jacket, a worn leather jacket, and pulled  out of his pocket a flag, an American  flag, a silk American flag, a small flag,  and he used it to wipe the lens of his  camera. That is an image I will never  forget.  But no one stepped up to say he  couldn’t do  that. Where were  they  then? Where were the critics of Mr.  Merola then? When flags are used as  grease rags to scrub the lens of a camera that  is taking pictures of anti-  Americans joined together to protest  the saving of our freedom that Marine  Merola has stepped up to defend.  Those actions against him are offensive to me, and I say guard the flag, defend the flag, and I will stand with you,  and I know Judge POEwill too.

14,,112,-0.565,36,2011-01-07,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to honor the life of a great American, Katherine C. Kelly, a lifelong champion  of human  rights and universal health care,  who died on the morning of January 6, 2011  at the age of 86.  Katherine was a good friend and supporter  for more than 40 years. Over the course of  her life, she and her late husband, Edward M.  Kelly, were prominently active in the civil rights  movement, the fight for women’s rights, gay  rights, and every progressive movement in the  United States. Katherine dedicated her life to  the Democratic Party, serving as State Committeewoman from Palm Beach County for 26  years.  Additionally, she was named to the Electoral  College and served as a delegate  to  five  Democratic National Conventions.  She also served as the Legislative Director  for Florida NOW, as Vice President of  the  Florida Women’s Political Caucus, as a Board  member for NARAL, and as Development Director of Women Leaders Online. Her continued dedication  to political and progressive  causes led to recognition as the Outstanding  Feminist 2001 by Florida NOW and Woman of  the Year in 2008 by the Democratic Women’s  Club Palm Beach County.  Mr. Speaker, Katherine was deeply  loved  and widely respected by everyone who knew  her.

15,,112,-0.386,36,2011-01-07,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to the PanPaphian Association  of America for its tremendous contributions to  our cultural and civic life. Founded more than  two decades ago by Hellenic Cypriot Americans of Paphian ancestry, the Association has  carried out its vital educational, cultural, charitable, and humanitarian mission while helping  promote peace, unity, and understanding on  the occupied island of Cyprus.  The PanPaphian Association of America  held the Ninth Evagoras Pallikarides Award of  Merit dinner-dance last month. The Evagoras  Pallikarides Award of Merit was bestowed  upon Mr. Alkinoos Ioannidis for his dedication  to promoting Hellenic culture  through music  and song. Born and raised in Nicosia, Cyprus,  Mr.  Ioannidis studied classical guitar at  the  European Conservatory, moved  to Athens,  and was signed by Universal Music at age 23.  He went on to pursue a successful career in  acting and music, eventually focusing his efforts as a thriving musical performer and composer with many successful recordings. Influenced by traditional Cypriot music, the Greek  composers of the last decades, and classical,  jazz and rock genres. He often performs with  orchestras and ensembles. Above all, he remains devoted to the Cypriot people, their culture, and their struggle for justice, donating his  time and talent to numerous concerts and performances benefitting various Hellenic organizations and causes associated with justice for  Cyprus.  The PanPaphian Association awarded  the  Distinguished Fellow Cypriot Award  to Mr.  Polys Kyriacou, a distinguished poet and lyricist who has distinguished himself in his passionate commitment to justice for Cyprus and  his love for Hellenic culture. Born in Nicosia,  he served in the Cyprus National Guard before his studies at Pantios University in Athens. He came to New York City in 1982 to  earn a Master’s Degree in Communication and  Graphic Design at the Pratt Institute and then  worked as an Art Director at the Proini daily  newspaper. He served for many years on the  board of  the Cyprus Federation of America  and  the Justice  for Cyprus Committee, published  two  volumes  of  poetry,  including  Sximata, which won First Prize for a Young  Poet from the Cyprus Ministry of Education. A  Member of the Board of Directors of Cosmos  FM Radio, he hosts his own program every  Sunday morning and remains deeply involved  in New York City’s vibrant Hellenic community.  The Member of the Year Award was given  to Mr. George Kouspos. Born and raised  in  Paphos on Cyprus, he came  to  the United  States in 1984 after serving as an officer in  the Cyprus National Guard. He earned a  Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering  from  the City College of New York  and an M.B.A. degree from Adelphi University  while working his way through school. He became  a  principal  at  CY  Electric  Corp.  Throughout his studies and his subsequent  professional success, he has  remained extraordinarily devoted to the cause of justice for  Cyprus; to the PanPaphian Association, which  he has served as Vice President, Cultural Officer, and Treasurer; and above all to his beloved family, Nancy (Nafsika), who was born  in Asgata, Cyprus, and his beautiful daughters, Demetra and Maria.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that my distinguished  colleagues rise to join me in paying tribute to  the PanPaphian Association of America,  the  recipients of its awards, and all its many contributions to the civic life of our Nation.  f  TRIBUTE  TO  CLARK  SHERIFF’S  DEPUTY  WAUGHTEL HOPPER  COUNTY  SUZANNE  HON.

The Abbasis are political refugees. Their father got in trouble in Iran because he dared to  write that Iranians actually deserve freedom.  He wrote that every man should be able to  have a say in who governs them. This simple  idea is the very foundation on which our great  Nation was built and  the  fundamental, universal human right of all mankind. But the tiny  tyrant of  Iran did not  like  that. He saw Mr.  Abbasi as a threat to his power.  The regime, having tasted power, is doing  whatever it can to keep it. That includes imprisoning,  torturing, and murdering anyone  who so dares speak against it. But these are  desperate actions  from a desperate regime.

She is the second Indian-American governor in American history, in the tradition of Louisiana Governor Bobby  Jindal, recognizing the growing significance of Indian Americans in American  society.  Our family is very grateful for the  swearing in of my oldest son, Alan Wilson of Lexington, as America’s youngest attorney general. His prosecution  experience will  serve  the people of  South Carolina well.  The inauguration was also historic  for being the first all-Republican inauguration in over 130 years with Lieutenant Governor Ken Ard; Secretary of  State Mark Hammond; Treasurer Curtis Loftis; Comptroller General Richard  Eckstrom;  Superintendent  of  Education Mick Zais; Adjutant General  Bob Livingston, Jr., America’s only  popularly elected adjutant general; and  Commissioner  of  Agriculture  Hugh  Weathers.

I pray that this debate today is civil and that it is respectful.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, and many  of our colleagues know, I served as a  judge in my State for many years. I understand what it means to be objective  and to have a fair debate. And I know  there are usually two sides to every  issue. But when it comes to repealing  the  reforms  that  Democrats  have  passed, I just can’t figure it out.  Why would Republicans add $230 billion to the deficit when their mantra  has been deficit reduction? Why would  Republicans force small businesses to  pay higher  taxes after  fighting  for  cuts? Why would Republicans  take  away a parent’s right to cover their  adult children? And why in the world  would Republicans make seniors pay  more  for their prescription drugs? I  just don’t understand. It appears to me  that this may be partisan politics.  f  ATTACK IN TUCSON  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011

The American people, quite  frankly, have never  liked  this bill, as they demonstrated last November. You can’t find a poll where it  cracked 50 percent  in approval. And  those wanting to repeal it have generally always been above that mark.  The bill  itself may be unconstitutional. Over 20 States are now challenging it in Federal court. It is certainly  likely to be unworkable. The  creation of dozens of boards, agencies,  and commissions with rulemaking authority, the fact that hundreds of companies have already asked for waivers  under  the  legislation,  suggest  it  is  going to be a bureaucratic nightmare.  b1530  Finally and most  importantly, the  bill itself is fiscally irresponsible and  unsustainable. The idea that we would  take hundreds of billions of dollars out  of Medicaid and Social Security and  Medicare at a  time when  the baby  boomer generation is beginning to retire is simply irresponsible. I am all for  saving money in Medicare, but when  we do, those savings are going to be  needed to sustain Medicare.  So I urge this House to take the fiscally  responsible  course—repeal  this  bill and start over, and give the American people the health care bill they  deserve and the health care bill they  can afford.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from  Florida  (Ms.  WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ).  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.  Speaker, I rise to oppose the Republican majority’s callous attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Reform  has already made a dramatically positive difference for millions of our constituents and small businesses while  tackling our ballooning national debt.  We in Congress must continue doing  all that we can to support American  families and businesses as we emerge  from this recession. Democrats have  pledged to measure all legislation by a  proposal’s success at creating jobs, at  strengthening the middle class, and at  bringing down  the deficit. Unfortunately, the Republican majority’s attempts to repeal the Affordable Care  Act fails on all such counts.  Repeal would hurt small businesses,  canceling $40 billion worth of tax credits to help employees afford coverage.  Repeal would stall middle class  job  growth, as one-third of small business  owners told the small business majority they were more likely to hire new  employees as a result of reform. And of  course repeal would deepen our already  exploding deficit, increasing it by $230  billion in the next 10 years and by more  than $1 trillion in the following decade.  Many of my colleagues across the  aisle have rebuffed this analysis from  Congress’ own budgetary referee, the  Congressional Budget Office, because it  doesn’t fit the Republican narrative or  campaign promise to tackle the deficit.  However, while they may be entitled to  their own opinions, they are not entitled to their own facts.  Health care repeal is the epitome of  fiscal irresponsibility, and it counters  our most basic American values: life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  We lose life when insurance companies  can freely drop those who are sick from  coverage. We lose liberty when our seniors have to choose between medications and groceries. And we lose the  pursuit of happiness if we return to the  days when only job security guaranteed health security.  Our  fiscal decisions, Mr. Speaker,  must be a reflection not only of our  economic future but of the statement  of our most central national values. By  ensuring  that Americans have vital  coverage rather than cruelly denying it  to them, we can live up to the dreams  of liberty and justice for all.  ",2011
23,House,112,0.744,9,2011-01-18,Mr. HUELSKAMP.," Mr. Speaker, as a  result of this  law, employers across  America have discovered that onerous  reporting requirements will force them  to file 1099 forms for every vendor with  which they do $600 worth of business.  This past weekend, I visited with an  accountant  in my district who  indicated he would have to expand his staff  by 25 percent to accommodate all the  extra redtape and paperwork.  Mr. Speaker, this is not the type of  job creation American envisioned.  Additionally,  businesses  and  labor  unions  alike  have  realized  that  ObamaCare is a bad deal, and at least  222 have sought waivers from having to  comply with the law. HHS Secretary  Kathleen Sebelius has approved special  privilege  exemptions  for  dozens  of  labor unions and the half a million  union members they cover. Even more  troubling  is that Secretary Sebelius  has been tardy in responding to a FOIA  inquiry regarding the secretive details  of these waiver requests.  Fortunately,  rather  than  selective  waivers for the politically connected,  we have a universal remedy—repeal the  law.  I urge my colleagues to heed the calls  voters made last year during the debate and at the ballot box.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I  would remind the gentleman that this  body voted on a majority basis to repeal the 1099 provision.  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT).  ",2011
24,House,112,-0.402,9,2011-01-18,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker,  the  choice here is whether to give more  money to insurance monopolies or to  leave just a little bit in the pockets of  middle class Americans. But for House  Republicans, always putting insurance  companies  first  seems  to be a preexisting condition.  This bill isn’t repeal and replace; it is  repeal and  forget—forget  the health  care needs of millions of Americans,  forget the hundreds of billions of dollars that with this repeal they add to  our Federal debt.  Within a year, Allison, a 23-year-old  from Bastrop, Texas, who is completing  her college degree while caring for her  mother as her mother  faces another  round of breast cancer, would lose her  health insurance.  Emily, from Wimberley, who is battling cancer herself, would now  face  lifetime  limits  on what  doctor-recommended care her  insurer will pay  for. Of course, if her husband loses or  changes his job, she won’t have any insurance at all.  Charlotte, an Austin senior, would  have to pay more for prescriptions and  preventative health care, while Republicans reduce the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by more than a decade.  Family budgets would be crushed by  this bill as health care costs remain  the leading cause of credit card debt  and bankruptcy. This same devastating  Republican bill would also hike the  Federal debt. That’s why Republicans  have rejected pay-as-you-go budgeting  and instead will borrow from the Chinese to pay for this legislation.  Yes, repeal is a priority for the insurance companies and their apologists,  but neither our family budgets nor our  Federal budget can afford it. I believe  that every American is entitled to a  family doctor, not to an appointment  with a bankruptcy  judge because of  soaring health care costs.  ",2011
25,House,112,0.57,9,2011-01-18,Mr. LANKFORD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of H.R. 2.  A few months ago, I visited with a  small business owner in Oklahoma who  has five employees but whose health  care costs for 2011 will go up by 50 percent. When he asked about that, the  reason he was given was: the cost of  implementing the new health care law.  Another business owner told me he  would not hire new employees until he  could  figure  out what  the  cost  of  health care is going to be, so he will  just stop hiring.  While  some  in  this Chamber  talk  about universal coverage and cost controls, many people in my district are  frustrated with this so-called  ‘‘solution.’’ Every person should control his  own health care option and opportunities. Every young student should have  the motivation to go into medical research and the practice of medicine. As  our  population  ages,  every  doctor  should have greater incentives to take  on Medicare patients.

Let’s repeal this bill, focus on bipartisan initiatives we all agree on like  fixing the doughnut hole, and pass tort  reform  legislation once and  for all  without spending an additional $50 million. Until we do so, jobs will continue  to be lost.  ",2011

29,House,112,-0.347,16,2011-01-18,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Madam Speaker, I  rise in strong opposition to this bill  that would hurt small businesses  in  Missouri who are finally gaining access  to affordable coverage  for their employees. Since 2010, the health care  coverage among small  firms has  increased by more than 12 percent. If this  bill passes, those small business owners  will lose the tax credits that are providing up to 50 percent of their health  care costs. Many of them will have to  drop the very health insurance they  have  just now been able to provide  their employees and their families.  These are real people, people  like  Michelle Barron, who owns an  independent book store in Rock Hill, Missouri. She used to be able to afford coverage for her employees, but over the  years couldn’t keep up. She had to drop  her employees and finally drop her own  coverage because of preexisting conditions. Last year when the health care  bill was signed into law, new options  opened up for Michelle and countless  small business owners like her.  But if we repeal health care, it will  turn back the clock for small business  owners like Michelle. Insurers would be  able to go back to denying coverage for  preexisting medical  conditions,  and  small business owners would lose the  tax  credits  that  are helping make  health care coverage affordable. We  cannot go back to the bad old days of  insurance company control. This is not  the time to step backwards.  ",2011
30,House,112,0.712,16,2011-01-18,Mr. QUAYLE.," I thank the chairman  for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2.  Last year, behind closed doors and  against the will of the American people, the Democratic majority of the  111th Congress passed a bill that fundamentally changes the doctor-patient  relationship. They passed a bill that  will increase the cost of health care  and explode our national debt. They  passed a bill that expands the scope of  government well beyond the parameters set forth in the Constitution.  The genius of our Constitution  is  that this document didn’t set  forth  what the government must do for us,  but rather what the government can’t  do to us. Requiring every individual to  enter into a commercial contract certainly falls within the realm of what  the government can’t do to us.  The people in my district understand  this, just as they understand that our  health care system needs sensible, patient-centered reforms that will reduce  costs  and  increase  access. Unfortunately, the health care bill that was  passed will increase costs and increase  our national  debt. Yes,  those who  drafted the bill tried to conceal the  true costs from the American people.  But if you look beyond the accounting  gimmicks, that bill increases our debt  by $701 billion over the next 10 years.  It is time to get our country back on  the right track, and H.R. 2 is a necessary step to fulfilling that mission.  ",2011

33,House,112,0.455,23,2011-01-18,Mr. TIPTON.," Madam Speaker, the  question before us is: Will we accept  what is, or are we willing to commit to  build what could be?  America has always been a land of  self-determination.  Our  constitutionally guaranteed rights as individuals, as a people, as a Nation have  made  us  flourish.  Innovation,  creativity,  and  freedom  are American  hallmarks.  I rise in support of H.R. 2. It does not  indite intent, but it does address outcome. In fact, the deeper we dig into  the health care act, the more we discover that it is stopping job creation,  building more government, and placing  tax burdens on American families who  are already  struggling. We can and  must do better.  Let us commit ourselves to addressing the basic concerns we hold in common  concerning health  care—affordability and accessibility. Let us strive  to empower our people to make their  own choices about the care they receive, empower private sector solutions  that will lower costs and increase the  quality of care, and eliminate governmental stumbling blocks and not build  bigger government.  Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I  yield 21⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD).  Ms.  ROYBAL-ALLARD.  Madam  Speaker, today, millions of Americans  have more freedom to choose and control their health care as a result of the  Affordable Care Act.  In my congressional district, nearly  40 percent of my constituents were uninsured. Thousands more were underinsured and living on the brink of financial disaster when facing a serious  illness or accident. With health care  reform, positive change is taking place  for them and for individuals, families,  and small businesses throughout the  country.  Young adults are grateful they can  remain  on  their  parents’  insurance  until age 26; seniors living in fear of  not being able to afford their medications are  thankful  for discounts on  brand-name drugs when reaching the  doughnut  hole;  families  with  preexisting conditions are comforted by  the new high-risk insurance pool; and  those facing serious illness are relieved  their insurers can no longer drop them  when they need coverage the most.  Small businesses, which abound  in  my district and which are a mainstay  in our Latino and minority communities, can take advantage of tax credits to offer health insurance to their  employees.  A 2009 study by MIT economist Jonathan Gruber  found that, without reform, over the next decade employers  will pay trillions of dollars in employee  health  costs;  will  potentially  cut  170,000 small business  jobs; and will  lose $51.2 billion in profits. That is why  John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of  the Small Business Majority, supports  health care reform.  Madam Speaker, H.R.  2 will hurt  small business. It will repeal the freedoms and protections Americans now  have, and it will return control of their  health care to the insurance companies.  ",2011
34,House,112,0.614,23,2011-01-18,Mr. LANDRY.," Madam Speaker, it is  with great enthusiasm that I rise to  encourage my colleagues to stand with  the American people—the hardworking  families and the small business owners  across our country—and vote for repealing the job-killing health care law.  In March, Members  of  Congress  passed  a  massive  government-run  health care  law that will kill  jobs,  raise taxes, and increase the size of our  Federal Government.  b1700  The bill called for tax increases on  American families, wasteful spending  of taxpayer dollars, and new mandates  on  small businesses. This  is wrong.  Voters made it clear in November that  ‘‘business as usual’’ must end.  I submitted the necessary paperwork  to decline the health care plan offered  to Members of Congress. I rejected this  benefit because Washington must work  just  like the American people must  work. We are not above them. I hope  my actions will energize the efforts to  repeal the government-run health care  law.  I encourage my colleagues to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on this bill and to promote commonsense  solutions  of  purchasing  health insurance across State lines and  pooling small businesses together to leverage purchasing power.

I commend the Republican leadership  for simplifying this process by drafting  a two-page, stand-alone bill for repeal.  It will be very clear, Madam Speaker,  to the American people where we stand  on repeal.  During this past campaign, I, like a  lot of candidates, spoke to small businesses every single day. There is a reason why 90 percent of small business  men and women in this country support repeal. From the billions in taxes,  to the needless paperwork, to the burdensome regulations, to the 1.6 million  estimated job loss, small business men  and women are adamant that we need  to repeal.  Finally, Madam Speaker, our opposition last year said that if you like your  plan, you can keep it. To date, there  are 222 organizations, including some  of ObamaCare’s  biggest  union  supporters, who have  received waivers.  Why? Why, Madam Speaker, if the law  was so worthy, would there be a need  for waivers?  Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker,  as a result of this repeal legislation,  small businesses in the State of Illinois  will see a tax increase of $1.7 billion.  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  MURPHY).  ",2011
36,House,112,-0.312,23,2011-01-18,Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut.," Madam  Speaker, when I testified against this  repeal before the Rules Committee, I  told a story about a family in my district. The husband  lost his  job and,  therefore, his insurance because of a  debilitating injury. This family faced a  choice: They either had to dip  into  their  savings  account,  their  high  school son’s college fund, or they had  to sell their house. They chose to first  spend down the college account so that  they could keep a roof over their head.  When I told that story, one Republican on the committee basically said,  Wait, I don’t get it. They had money,  they had a house, why should somebody else pay for their health care if  they had assets?  Well, that Member was right about  one thing: She didn’t get it. And Republicans don’t get it. Because in a nation as compassionate as this, no family should be forced out on the street  just because one of their family members gets sick. There is a moral imperative behind making sure that we live  up to our duty to be our brother’s keeper.  But it’s more than that. There is a  fiscal imperative here. What she also  didn’t get was that once that family’s  savings is gone, once they’re out on the  street, we all pick up the cost. Small  businesses pick up the cost. That’s why  small businesses are paying 18 percent  more than big businesses. That’s why  about $1,100 of every single premium  for a small business employee goes to  cover the uninsured.  There are thousands of small businesses in Connecticut organized under  the auspices of a group called Small  Businesses for Health Care Reform that  are crying out for this repeal to be defeated because they see the $260 billion  price tag attached to this bill that is  going to land on their head, as well as  the  continuation  of  discriminatory  practices that ask small businesses to  pay for the uninsured like that family  that I talked about.  This bill isn’t anything more than a  political statement, but families in my  district, small businesses  in my district need more than politics. They  need answers.  ",2011
37,House,112,0.24,30,2011-01-18,Mr. JONES.," Mr. Speaker, today I had  the honor and privilege of visiting the  wounded warriors at Bethesda Naval  Hospital. Each one of the young men I  saw, the oldest being 23, is very special,  as are all of our men and women in uniform.  The medical staff at both Bethesda  and Walter Reed  is  truly amazing.  They have done a wonderful job repairing the broken bodies and spirits of our  young servicemembers.  The number of wounded warriors returning  from war has become more  prevalent with the  increased use of  IEDs by the enemy. More and more of  our young men and women are returning without their arms and legs. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, as a constant reminder of the pain of war, I show you  this picture of a young triple amputee  and his wife. This man gave his body  for this country and will struggle for  the rest of his life. How many more  will have to return home in this condition?  This young man and his wife have  just returned from the hospital. He is  in a wheelchair. He lost an arm and  two legs and he is looking at a beautiful American flag that was on the  wall that had been drawn for him.  It is time we declare victory and get  our troops out of Afghanistan. It is evident that President Karzai does not appreciate our commitment. If he did, he  would not be so corrupt. If he did, he  would not have made the comments  that he now has three main enemies—  the Taliban, the United States and the  international community as stated in  the Washington Post on December 13.  He said that if he had to choose sides  today, he would choose the Taliban.  The Taliban are killing American service men and women.  Mr. Speaker, I have joined DENNIS  KUCINICHas well as many other members of both parties in the hope that  President Obama will keep his promise  to start withdrawing our troops in July  of this year.  b1920  In closing, I would like to urge the  American people to get engaged in this  cause and to let their Members of Congress know how they feel. They must  encourage the Members of Congress to  vote to bring our troops home. The  pain must end, and we can easily declare a victory and bring our brave  men and women home.  Mr. Speaker, as I do all the time on  the floor of the House when I speak, I  ask God to please bless our men and  women in uniform, to bless the families  of our men and women in uniform. I  ask God in his loving arms to hold the  families who have given a child dying  for freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq. I  ask God to please bless the House and  Senate that we will do what is right for  the American people. I ask God to give  strength,  wisdom,  and  courage  to  President Obama that he will do what  is right for the American people.

The military occupation of Afghanistan is longer than any war in our  Nation’s history. An entire generation  of young people—including my three  grandchildren who came with me to  visit Washington for the swearing in—  is growing up knowing nothing but a  Nation at war.  This war is not just a moral abomination with devastating human costs,  and it is not just fiscally irresponsible  and unsustainable with a price tag of  about $370 billion, though it most certainly is all of that. Perhaps the most  tragic irony of this war is, for all of the  sacrifice, it is not even doing what it  was supposed to do: keeping us safe and  defeating a terrorist threat.  If Iraq and Afghanistan have proven  anything to us, Mr. Speaker, it is that  we need an entirely new national security model; one that emphasizes brain  over brawn; one that uses soft power  instead  of hard;  one  that  protects  America by relying on the most honorable American values—love of freedom,  desire for peace, moral leadership, and  compassion for the people of the world.

But before I get to health care, I was  notified early this afternoon that a  unique,  iconic American  had  died  today; Sargent Shriver  is no  longer  with us.  This individual has had an impact on  America and the world around us that  will last for centuries. He literally created the United States Peace Corps.  The idea was developed by him and his  brother-in-law, JFK, and put into effect in the first year of the Jack Kennedy administration.  Thousands, indeed over nearly 200,000  Americans,  have  joined  the  Peace  Corps  in the ensuing years. For my  wife and  I,  it changed our  life;  it  changed the path upon which we have  traveled. We were the third iteration of  the Peace Corps back in the 1960s. We  were sent to Ethiopia. We served in a  village out in the boondocks of southwestern Ethiopia, and it put in place in  our lives the vision that we could and  should continue to serve.  We are not alone. Thousands upon  thousands of Americans,  those  that  were in the Peace Corps and those that  were affected by the Peace Corps here  in this Nation, found that same mission of being a life of service.  In  the  1990s, Sargent Shriver  returned once again to assist the Peace  Corps as the Clinton administration  undertook the rebuilding and expansion of the Peace Corps. My wife was  then working at the Peace Corps as the  associate director, and together they  and the other staff opened the Peace  Corps to the former Soviet Union nations, Eastern Europe and beyond and  also to South Africa. It was a period of  growth, and once again it was a period  in which the Shriver enthusiasm and  the Shriver determination to reach out  to everyone in this world so that they  could have a better life created these  opportunities.  We mourn his passage. Our prayers  go out to his family and to remind all  of us that we too in any way possible  should be serving our fellow man.  Sergeant Shriver, we miss you and  we know that America and millions of  people around the world that were affected by your programs will miss you  also.  Let me now turn to another issue  that affects every American, their well  being, their lives, their ability to get  the care that they need when they have  health care problems.  On this floor today we began the debate of the repeal of the Affordable  Health Care Act, an extraordinary law  that will affect each and every one of  us in this Nation; and as it affects us,  it will also affect people around the  world because this law will help America finally join the other industrialized  nations in the world and provide health  care to all of our people, not just those  who are fortunate enough to be employed by an employer who has found  it useful, wise or even correct to provide health care for their employees,  but for those individuals that are not  so fortunate to be with an employer  that does not provide health care, and  for those who are unemployed.  This is an extremely important debate going on here on the floor of the  House. It’s a debate about all of our  lives.  It was estimated before this law went  into effect that some 30,000 to 40,000  Americans every year lost their lives  because they did not have health care.  It was too late for them to get their  blood pressure under control. It was  too late for them to deal with their diabetic situation or their cancer had  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:26 Jan 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K18JA7.093 H18JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2011

A native of Beekmantown, New York, Arnie  spent decades devoting his  life  to  the New  York education system. Throughout the years,  he served as a teacher, a guidance counselor,  director of guidance, assistant principal and  principal. Outside of the classroom, he served  as a member of the college council at SUNY  Plattsburgh, President of the Kiwanis Club of  Schenectady, and a member of the Northeast  Parent and Child Society. Most recently, he  spent the last two years as chair of the College Council at SUNY Plattsburgh. Through  his decades of service, he worked to enhance  the quality of education youth receive in Upstate New York, and provided a strong foundation for countless students of all ages.  Everyone who knew Arnie can say that they  knew a man completely devoted to his family  and his community.

KENNY MARCHANT  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 18, 2011  ",2011
41,,112,0.602,58,2011-01-18,Mr. MARCHANT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to  recognize Mr. Harland Westmoreland, a  dedicated public servant who will retire as assistant chief of the Euless Police Department.  As assistant chief, Mr. Westmoreland carried  out his duties with honor, boldness, and enthusiasm. With a commitment to service, Mr.  Westmoreland has been a leader in the Euless Police Department over  the past 35  years.  Mr. Westmoreland was born  in Gorman,  Texas and attended Reagan County High  School in Big Lake, Texas and Dallas Baptist  University  for both undergraduate and graduate school. At Dallas Baptist University, Mr.  Westmoreland earned a masters degree  in  counseling and psychology. Along with numerous certifications and licenses, Mr. Westmoreland is a master peace officer. Mr. Westmoreland and his wife Juanita reside in Euless and  have four children and ten grandchildren.  In 1974, while working in the private sector,  Mr. Westmoreland  joined  the Euless Police  Department as a reserve officer. By 1975, Mr.  Westmoreland chose  to make  law enforcement and public service a full time career. In  1982, Mr. Westmoreland became an investigator, and in 1985 he was promoted to sergeant.  In January 1993, Mr. Westmoreland  was promoted to lieutenant, and in December  of the same year he earned the rank of captain.  In September 2004, Mr. Westmoreland  became assistant police chief of the city of Euless.  Assistant Chief Westmoreland has  committed his career to protecting the citizens and  community of Euless. Throughout his career in  law enforcement, Mr. Westmoreland has positively affected  the  lives of countless  individuals. As exemplified by his many acts of heroism, Mr. Westmoreland has sacrificed his  well-being to ensure the public safety of the  residents of Euless. I ask all of my colleagues  to  join  in recognizing Assistant Police Chief  Westmoreland for his bravery, for his courage,  and for his distinguished career with the Euless Police Department.  f  THE HOUSE’S READING OF THE  CONSTITUTION  HON.

43,House,112,-0.391,6,2011-01-25,Mr. CICILLINE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today with serious concerns about the  misguided agenda our friends on the  other side of the aisle are pursuing.  While Democrats continue to make  job creation, economic recovery, and  debt reduction top priorities, the majority continues to engage in political  theater.  In  fact,  their  first actions  after assuming control of the House  haven’t created a single  job or protected a single American business.  Instead, the other side’s top priority  has been to repeal the patient protections provided by the new health care  reform bill; and their so-called ‘‘budget  resolution’’ they have offered today is  a one-page document with no specific  cuts  to  reduce  spending, no budget  numbers and, most  importantly, no  ideas on job creation or on economic  recovery.  Mr. Speaker, we were sent here to  create jobs and get the American economy back on track, both the Republicans and Democrats. Let’s stop the  political gimmickry, and let’s get to  the work of putting the American people back to work.  f  DEFICIT REDUCTION PLANS—NOT  AMBIGUOUS GOALS  (Mr. ALTMIRE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

44,House,112,-0.133,6,2011-01-25,Mr. ALTMIRE.," Mr. Speaker, as we  look forward to tonight’s State of the  Union Address, it is important for all  of us to keep in mind the most important  issues to the American people:  jobs, the economy, and deficit reduction. In the weeks and months ahead,  we look forward to working together,  Democrats and Republicans, to focus  our  legislative  attention  on  these  issues.  As we debate these issues, it is easy  to simply identify the problem. We all  know that unemployment is too high,  that recovery is not as fast as we would  like, and that the deficit is out of control; but the time for simply defining  the problem has long since passed, and  realistic solutions are long overdue. As  we near completion of our first month  of the new Congress, the American people are still waiting to hear the majority’s specific recommendations on how  to address these issues.  Tonight, we will hear from the President. I look forward to soon hearing  from the majority some specific details  about their deficit reduction plans, not  just ambiguous goals.  b1210  HONORING FALLEN OFFICERS IN  ST.

45,House,112,-0.439,6,2011-01-25,Ms. CASTOR of Florida.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today to honor the sacrifice of two St. Petersburg, Florida,  police officers who were killed in the  line of duty yesterday.  Sergeant Tom Baitinger and Officer  Jeffrey Yaslowitz were following up on  a Fugitive Task Force warrant when  they and a deputy U.S. marshal were  ambushed and shot. Officer Yaslowitz  was fatally shot while trying to arrest  the  dangerous  fugitive;  Officer  Baitinger was shot while attempting to  rescue his colleagues.  Officer Yaslowitz was 39 years old. He  was a K–9 officer and had worked with  his canine partner, ‘‘Ace,’’ for the last  2 years. He is survived by his wife, Lorraine, and three young children. Sergeant Thomas J. Baitinger was 48 years  old. He is survived by his wife, Paige.  As my colleague, Congressman BILL  stated  yesterday  from  this  floor, we pray for their families, the St.  Petersburg Police Department, Mayor  Bill Foster, and Police Chief Chuck  Harmon, and we honor the sacrifice of  our community heroes and all who  wear the uniform of service.

46,House,112,0.258,6,2011-01-25,Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania.,"  Madam Speaker, tonight we will hear  about the State of the Union. I hope we  hear the sometimes painful truth about  the State of the Union: more jobs lost  in the last couple of years and we need  to do something about that.  But the answer is not more spending  that leads us to a greater deficit and  more borrowing from China. The answer is not to continue to have higher  gas prices because we are buying our  oil from OPEC, which they use to build  their  lavish palaces and drive their  Rolls Royces while our communities  are trying to find ways to afford the  patching compound to patch up our  potholes. What we need to be doing is  taking action that uses our resources  to create American jobs.  A bill that I am going to be reintroducing from last year is one that says,  Let’s stop this moratorium that prevents us from using our oil, from drilling our resources. We can actually create jobs and have about $3 trillion-plus  in Federal  revenue without  raising  taxes, without raising our trade deficit,  and without sending more money to  OPEC.  I hope this is something this Congress considers and this President has  an open mind to dealing with so that  we can create  jobs without creating  more deficit.  f  STANDING TOGETHER FOR THE  ECONOMY  (Mr. HIMES asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

47,House,112,0.343,13,2011-01-25,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, this past election  was certainly a historic pivot for our  Nation.  The  American  people  demanded that both the President of the  United States, as well as the Congress,  chart a new course because they understand  that  the  growth  of Federal  spending that we have seen for the last  several  years  is  completely  unsustainable. They understand that  this crushing burden of debt that we  are selfishly placing on our children  and our grandchildren is limiting their  opportunities. And  they also understand very clearly that this irresponsible, out-of-control Federal spending  is limiting our ability for job creation  and economic growth.  Today, this resolution clearly speaks  to the House Republicans’ Pledge to  America by demonstrating our commitment to reduce spending to pre-  stimulus, pre-bailout levels, to a level  of spending of 2008.  Many would say, Madam Speaker,  that this doesn’t even go far enough,  and that debate will continue this year  as we debate the CR, the budget resolution, and the vote for raising the debt  ceiling.  Today, Madam  Speaker,  I  would urge all of my colleagues to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution and let the  American people know that we heard  them loud and clear in November.  ",2011

51,Senate,112,-0.473,62,2011-01-25,Mr. MERKLEY.," Mr. President, it is  quite a contrast that the Senator is  drawing between an era in which in a 2-  week period the bulk of the team was  in place, ready to do the work they  were elected by the people to do—the  executive branch, headed by the President, had his Secretaries, and the Secretaries had their teams in place, and  they were ready to go forward to make  sure they were working hard on the  agenda they had laid out during the  election cycle.  As my colleague said, elections have  consequences. The vision of our Republic is one in which we elect a President,  and the President says: Here  is my  agenda. Then he puts together a team  to get it done. It is not in the spirit of  our Constitution, it is certainly not in  the spirit of our democratic souls, after  the people have elected a President, to  try to damage and inflict pain and obstruction upon that President. That is  essentially saying one does not accept  the  judgment of U.S. citizens about  electing the President.  This process has to change. We have  to find a way that folks can be brought  to the floor. It is not that this Chamber will approve every single nomination. It is that it will hold a debate and  have a vote. If there is no controversy  surrounding someone, then that will  probably be reduced to a unanimous  consent request. Some will be waived  through to not take up the time on the  floor of the Chamber.  There is more than 1,000 executive  branch positions that have to be confirmed under statute. That, too, should  be changed. There is far too many positions that are basically set up so that  they have to come to this Chamber.  That is certainly a subject of conversation. But for those that under the law  need to come for advice and consent,  then we need to exercise that responsibility in a manner that is consistent  with advise and consent but not with  attempting to damage the President  and his team.  I was looking at a speech by one of  my colleagues from Tennessee, ",2011
52,Senate,112,0.323,62,2011-01-25,Mr. ALEXANDER.," He titles it, ‘‘The Filibuster,  Democracy’s Finest Show, the Right to  Talk Your Head Off.’’ That quote at  the top of his paper is from a speech before the Heritage Foundation and  is  taken  directly  from  the  film  ‘‘Mr.  Smith Goes to Washington.’’ In other  words, the premise that my colleague  put in his paper is that there needs to  be the right of the people elected by  the citizens to have their voices heard  on the floor of the Senate. That is what  the talking filibuster is about. It is  about the people being able to see their  Senators, when they are saying there  needs to be additional debate, to actually debate.  There is a tremendous amount of bipartisan support for this notion that  Senators  should not hide  from  the  American people, that they should not  be engaging  in secret holds, but  instead, if they are going to place a hold  on a piece of legislation, to do it publicly and have accountability. There is  tremendous support for the notion that  when we proceed to vote that we want  additional  debate, we  are  actually  going to debate so we utilize the time  of the Senate to weigh the pros and  cons, to hear all colleagues. Not that  folks say: We want additional debate  and then go off to dinner. Not that Senators say: We want additional debate  and then go off on vacation.  If  they ask  for additional debate,  then we should have additional debate,  laying out the pros and cons, arguing  the merits, considering amendments—  in short, the talking filibuster.  I have a unanimous consent request  that I gave notice of half an hour ago.  We are standing by waiting for one of  our colleagues from the other side to  come, extending the courtesy for them  to come and object to this request.

53,Senate,112,-0.205,118,2011-01-25,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr.  President,  today, I introduced legislation to protect the coastal plains region of the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from  oil and gas exploration and drilling.  Every Congress since the 101st, I have  either introduced or been an original  cosponsor of legislation to protect the  Refuge, making tomorrow the twelfth  time since 1989 that I will mark my unwavering support for reaffirming the  original intent of the Refuge: to provide habitat for Alaska’s wildlife, by  designating 1.5 million acres of the Refuge as Wilderness to be included in the  National Wilderness Preservation System.  I have long believed we have a responsibility to  future generations to  preserve the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge, and I have fought to protect it  for as long as I have been in the Senate. The fact is, we do not have to  choose between conservation and exploration when it comes to our energy  future; we can do both simultaneously  while moving toward a sustainable and  diverse national energy policy.  The Arctic Refuge is home to 250 species of wildlife. Drilling there would severely harm its abundant populations  of polar bears, caribou, musk oxen, and  snow geese. Beyond that, the amount  of commercially recoverable oil in the  Refuge would satisfy only a very small  percentage of our Nation’s need at any  given time and would have no appreciable  long-tem  impact on gasoline  prices. The permanent environmental  price we would pay for ravaging the  Refuge to drain those limited resources  is simply too high.  I look forward to working with my  colleagues to pass this important legislation.

54,Senate,112,-0.4,118,2011-01-25,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. President,  from the Recovery Act to the Small  Business Jobs Act, in the previous Congress we passed a number of substantial pieces of legislation to preserve,  protect, and create American jobs. The  Recovery Act alone has supported between 2.7 and 3.7 million jobs, including  12,000 jobs in my home State of Rhode  Island. This was vital in stemming the  700,000-per-month job loss rate we faced  when the previous administration left  office. Without the Recovery Act and  the other  fiscal stimulus we passed  over the past 2 years, the economy  would have been much worse.  While  the Recovery Act protected  our country  from what would have  been a far worse economic meltdown,  the employment market is still weak  and families are still hurting. Our national unemployment rate was 9.4 percent  in December—an  unacceptably  high level. And it was higher still in  harder hit States such as Rhode Island,  where we have had an 11.5-percent unemployment rate in December. As we  begin this new Congress, our No. 1 priority must remain job retention and  creation.  The manufacturing industry has historically been the engine of growth for  the American economy. The manufacturing economy has been especially important  in the  industrial Northeast,  particularly in my State of Rhode Island. From Slater Mill in Pawtucket—  one of the first water-powered textile  mills in the Nation and the birthplace  of the Industrial Revolution—to high-  tech modern submarine production at  Quonset Point, the manufacturing sector has always been central to Rhode  Island’s economy.  Unfortunately, as American companies have faced rising production costs  and increased—and very often unfair—  competition  from  foreign  firms, U.S.  manufacturing employment has plummeted. According  to  the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, the number of manufacturing  jobs declined by almost a  third over the past decade, from 17.2  million people at work in 2000 to 11.7  million people at work in 2010. That is  6 million jobs lost. This decline has  been felt most sharply in our old manufacturing centers, such as Rhode Island. In Rhode Island, the loss of manufacturing jobs in the past decade has  topped 44 percent. The decline of the  manufacturing sector is a primary reason why Rhode Island has had greater  difficulty than most other States in recovering from the recent recession.  Over and over I have traveled around  Rhode Island to meet with local manufacturers,  listening  to  their  frustrations and discussing ideas to help their  businesses grow. During these visits, I  have heard one theme over and over:  Unfair foreign competition is killing  domestic  industries. One Pawtucket  manufacturer I visited last week told  me they recently lost 8 percent of their  business to a Chinese competitor. It is  clear to me that if we want to keep  manufacturing jobs in this country and  ERS, BOXER, DURBIN, BROWN in Rhode Island, we need to level the  playing  field  for our manufacturing  companies with their foreign competitors.  Today  I will  introduce  legislation  that will remove one homegrown incentive to move jobs offshore and help to  make competition fairer for companies  straggling to keep their factory doors  open at plants here  in  the United  States. The Offshoring Prevention Act,  cosponsored by Senators LEAHY, SANDof Ohio,  and HARKIN, would end a perverse tax  incentive that actually rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas. Under  current  law, an American  company  that manufactures goods in Rhode Island or Montana or Maine must pay  Federal income tax on profits in the  year the profits are earned. That  is  standard tax  law. But  if that same  company moves its factory to another  country, it is permitted to defer the  payment of income taxes from that factory and declare them in a year that is  more advantageous—for example, one  in which the company has offsetting  tax losses.  If an American company moves a  plant offshore, it acquires this tax deferral advantage. It makes no sense  that our Tax Code allows companies to  delay paying income taxes on profits  when made through overseas subsidiaries but charges those profits in the  year they are made at home. My bill  will put a stop to this practice on profits earned on manufactured goods exported to the United States. To put it  simply: Our tax system should not reward companies for eliminating American jobs.  The Offshoring Prevention Act  is  based on  legislation Senator Byron  Dorgan offered over the past two decades, again and again. We can all remember Senator Dorgan coming to this  floor here with pictures of iconic American goods, such as York Peppermint  Patties, Radio Flyer red wagons, Fig  Newton cookies, and Huffy bicycles, to  highlight the fact that the production  of these American classic products had  moved to Mexico, to China, and elsewhere. On dozens, if not hundreds, of  occasions, Senator Dorgan spoke passionately on this floor about the decline of American manufacturing. I am  grateful to his leadership on this critical issue and for bringing our attention to an unfair tax advantage that  rewards companies for moving manufacturing jobs overseas.  Last year, a version of Senator Dorgan’s bill was included in the Creating  American Jobs and Ending Offshoring  Act. While a majority of this body—53  Senators—voted to begin debate on the  bill, we were not able to overcome a filibuster to have a chance to consider  and pass this legislation. I am sorry we  were not able to pass the bill last year,  and I will do my best to bring it up for  a vote in this new Congress.

55,Senate,112,-0.319,139,2011-01-25,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, nearly 16  years ago I stood before you to introduce a bill ‘‘to provide an opportunity  for the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada  to have  the merits of  their claims  against the United States determined  by the United States Court of Federal  Claims.’’  That bill was introduced as Senate  Resolution  223, which  referred  the  Pottawatomi’s  claim  to  the  Chief  Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal  Claims and required the Chief Judge to  report back to the Senate and provide  sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable the Congress to  determine whether the claim of the  Pottawatomi Nation in Canada is legal  or equitable in nature, and the amount  of damages, if any, which may be legally or equitably due from the United  States.  Over a decade ago, the Chief Judge of  the Court of Federal Claims reported  back that the Pottawatomi Nation in  Canada has a legitimate and credible  legal claim. Thereafter, by settlement  stipulation,  the United  States  has  taken the position that  it would be  ‘‘fair, just and equitable’’ to settle the  claims of the  ottawatomi Nation in Canada for the  sum  of  $1,830,000.  This  settlement  amount was  reached by  the parties  after seven years of extensive, fact-intensive litigation. Independently, the  court concluded that the settlement  amount is ‘‘not a gratuity’’ and that  the  ‘‘settlement was predicated on a  credible legal claim.’’ Pottawatomi Nation in Canada, et al. v. United States,  Cong. Ref. 94–1037X at 28, Ct. Fed. Cl.,  September 15, 2000, Report of Hearing  Officer.  The bill I introduce today is to authorize  the  appropriation  of  those  funds that the United States has concluded would be ‘‘fair, just and equitable’’ to satisfy this legal claim. If enacted, this bill will finally achieve a  measure of justice for a tribal nation  that has for far too long been denied.  For  the  information  of  our  colleagues, this  is the historical background  that  informs  the underlying  legal  claim  of  the  Canadian  Pottawatomi.  The members of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada are one of the descendant  groups—successors-in-interest—of  the historical Pottawatomi Nation and  their claim originates  in  the  latter  part of the 18th century. The historical  Pottawatomi Nation was aboriginal to  the United States. They occupied and  possessed a vast expanse in what is now  the States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana,  Illinois, and Wisconsin. From 1795 to  1833, the United States annexed most of  the  traditional  land  of  the  Pottawatomi Nation through a series  of treaties of cession—many of these  cessions were made under extreme duress and the threat of military action.  In exchange, the Pottawatomi were repeatedly made promises that the remainder of their lands would be secure  and,  in  addition,  that  the United  States would pay certain annuities to  the Pottawatomi.  In 1829, the United States formally  adopted a Federal the policy of removal; an effort to remove all Indian  tribes from their traditional lands east  of the Mississippi River to the west. As  part of that effort, the government increasingly pressured the Pottawatomi  to cede the remainder of their traditional lands, some five million acres in  and around the city of Chicago, and remove their nation west. For years, the  Pottawatomi  steadfastly  refused  to  cede the remainder of their tribal territory. Then in 1833, the United States,  pressed by settlers seeking more land,  sent  a Treaty Commission  to  the  Pottawatomi with orders to extract a  cession of the remaining  lands. The  Treaty Commissioners spent 2 weeks  using  extraordinarily  coercive  tactics—including threats of war—in an  attempt to get the Pottawatomi to  agree to cede their territory. Finally,  those Pottawatomi who were present  relented and on September 26, 1933,  they ceded their remaining tribal estate through what would be known as  the Treaty of Chicago. Seventy-seven  members of the Pottawatomi Nation  signed the Treaty of Chicago. Members  of  the  ‘‘Wisconsin Band’’ were not  present and did not assent to the cession.  In exchange for their land, the Treaty of Chicago provided that the United  States would give to the Pottawatomi  5 million acres of comparable land in  what  is  now  Missouri.  The  Pottawatomi were  familiar with the  Missouri land, aware that it was similar to their homeland. However, the  Senate  refused  to  ratify  that negotiated  agreement  and  unilaterally  switched the land to five million acres  in  Iowa. The Treaty Commissioners  were sent back to acquire Pottawatomi  assent to the Iowa land. All but seven  of the original 77 signatories refused to  accept the change even with promises  that if they were dissatisfied ‘‘justice  would be done.’’  Nevertheless, the Treaty of Chicago  was ratified as amended by the Senate  in 1834. Subsequently, the Pottawatomi  sent a delegation to evaluate the land  in Iowa. The delegation reported back  that the land was ‘‘not fit for snakes to  live on.’’  While  some  Pottawatomi moved  westward, many of the Pottawatomi,  particularly the Wisconsin Band, whose  leaders never agreed to the Treaty, refused to do so. By 1836, the United  States  began  to  forcefully  remove  Pottawatomi who remained in the east  with devastating consequences. As is  true with many other American Indian  tribes,  the  forced  removal westward  came at great human cost. Many of the  Pottawatomi were forcefully removed  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:47 Aug 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S25JA1.REC S25JA1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

I also secured $15 million since 2006 for the Fish and Wildlife  Service to restore salt ponds to tidal  wetlands in the Bay.  It is necessary to ensure that these  funds continue to be appropriated and  are  spent  on  the most  important  projects for the ecosystem and public  benefit.  To  that end,  this  legislation will  prioritize funding for projects that will  protect  and  restore  vital  estuarine  habitat  for  migratory  waterfowl,  shorebirds, and wildlife; improve and  restore water quality and rearing habitat for fish; and ensure public benefits.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.

57,Senate,112,-0.374,160,2011-01-25,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I am  proud today to introduce the Criminal  Justice and Forensic Science Reform  Act of 2011. This legislation is an important first step toward guaranteeing  the effectiveness and scientific integrity of forensic evidence used in criminal cases, and in ensuring that Americans can have faith in their criminal  justice system.  In March of 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee began its examination  of serious  issues concerning  forensic  science, which is at the heart of our  criminal  justice  system. The Committee has studied the problem exhaustively, and has worked with a wide  array of experts and stakeholders. The  legislation I introduce today is a product  of  this  process.  It  seeks  to  strengthen our confidence in the criminal justice system, and the evidence it  relies upon, by ensuring that forensic  evidence and testimony  is accurate,  credible, and scientifically grounded.  The National Academy of Science  published a report in February 2009 asserting  that  the  field  of  forensic  science has significant problems that  urgently need to be addressed. The report suggested that basic research establishing  the  scientific validity of  many forensic science disciplines has  never been done  in a comprehensive  way.  It  suggested  that  the  forensic  sciences lack uniform and unassailable  standards governing the accreditation  of laboratories, the certification of forensic practitioners, and the testing  and analysis of evidence.  The National Academy of Science’s  report was an urgent call to action. It  has been hailed and widely cited since  its release. It has also been criticized  by many. I did not view the Academy’s  report as the final word on this issue,  but rather as the starting point for a  searching review of the state of forensic science in this country.  Last Congress, the Judiciary Committee held two hearings on the issue.  Committee members and staff spent  countless hours talking to prosecutors,  defense attorneys, law enforcement officers,  judges,  forensic practitioners,  academic  experts, and many, many  others to learn as much as we could  about what is happening in the forensic  sciences and what needs to be done.  As this effort has progressed, I have  been disturbed  to  learn about  still  more cases in which innocent people  may have been convicted, and perhaps  even executed, in part due to faulty forensic evidence. It is a double tragedy  when an innocent person is convicted.  An  innocent  person  suffers,  and  a  guilty person remains free, leaving us  all less safe. We must do everything we  can to avoid that untenable outcome.  At the same time, through the course  of this inquiry, it has become abundantly clear that the men and women  who test and analyze forensic evidence  do tremendous work that is vital to  our criminal justice system. I remember their important contributions and  hard work from my days as a prosecutor, when some of the forensic disciplines we have now did not even  exist. Their work is even more important today, and we need to strengthen  the field of forensics—and the justice  system’s confidence in it—so that their  hard work can be consistently relied  upon, as it should be.  It is beyond question that everyone  recognizes the need  for  forensic evidence that  is accurate and reliable.  Prosecutors and law enforcement officers want evidence that can be relied  upon to determine guilt and prove it  beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of  law. Defense attorneys want  strong  evidence that can be used to exclude  innocent people from suspicion. Forensic  science practitioners want  their  work to have as much certainty as possible and to be given deserved deference. All scientists and all attorneys  who care about these issues want the  science that is admitted as evidence in  the courtroom to match the science  that is proven through rigorous testing  and research in the laboratory.  There is also general agreement that  the forensic sciences can be improved  through  strong and unassailable  research to test and establish the validity of the forensic disciplines, as well  as the application of consistent and  regular standards in the field. There is  a dire need for well managed and appropriately directed  funding  for  research,  development,  training,  and  technical assistance. It is a good investment, as it will lead to fewer trials  and appeals, and will reduce crime by  ensuring that those who commit serious offenses are promptly captured and  convicted.  There is also broad consensus that all  forensic  laboratories  should  be  required to meet rigorous accreditation  standards  and  that  forensic  practitioners should be required to obtain  meaningful certification.  The bill I introduce today seeks to  address these widely recognized needs.  It requires that all forensic science laboratories that receive Federal funding  or Federal business be accredited according to rigorous standards. It requires all relevant personnel who perform forensic work for any laboratory  or agency that gets Federal money to  become certified in their fields, which  will mean meeting basic proficiency,  education, and training requirements.  The bill sets up a rigorous process to  determine the most serious needs for  research to establish the basic validity  of the forensic disciplines, and establishes grant programs to provide for  peer-reviewed scientific research to answer fundamental questions and promote innovation. It also sets up a process for this research to lead to appropriate standards and best practices in  each discipline. The bill funds research  into new technologies and techniques  that will allow forensic testing to be  done more quickly, more efficiently,  and more accurately. I believe these  are proposals that will be widely supported by those on all sides of this  issue.  There have been of course some areas  of disagreement, particularly as to who  should oversee these vital reforms to  the field of forensics. Some have argued that, because the purpose of forensic science is primarily to produce  evidence to be used in the investigation  and prosecution of criminal cases, it is  vital that those regulating and evaluating forensics must have expertise in  criminal justice. They have said that  at the Federal level, the Department of  Justice is the natural place for an office to examine and oversee the forensic sciences and have emphasized the  need for forensic science practitioners  to have substantial input in evaluating  research and standards.  Others have argued that, for forensic  science to truly engender our trust and  confidence, its validity must be established by  independent  scientific  research, and standards must be determined by scientists with no possible  conflict of interest. They have argued  for protections to ensure independent  scientific decision making, as well as  the significant involvement of Federal  scientific agencies.

58,Senate,112,0.342,188,2011-01-25,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, Senator BAUCUS and I first introduced a  bill to ban patents for tax inventions in  the 110th Congress. Since then, we have  worked with the leaders of the Judiciary Committee, the Patent and Trademark Office, the American Institute of  Certified Public Accountants, industry,  and members of the patent bar to perfect the language. I am pleased to introduce  this new and  improved bill  today with Senators BAUCUS, LEVIN,  WYDEN, BINGAMAN, CONRAD, ENZI, and  KERRY.  There are strong policy reasons to  ban tax strategy patents. Tax strategy  patents may lead to the marketing of  aggressive  tax  shelters or otherwise  mislead taxpayers about expected results. Tax strategy patents encumber  the ability of taxpayers and their advisers to use the tax law freely, interfering with the voluntary tax compliance system. If  firms or  individuals  were able to hold patents  for these  strategies, some taxpayers could face  fees simply for complying with the Tax  Code. And, tax patents provide windfalls to lawyers and patent holders by  granting them exclusive rights to use  tax  loopholes, which  could  provide  some businesses with an unfair advantage.  Tax strategy patents are unlikely to  be novel given the public nature of the  Tax Code. Moreover, tax strategy patents may undermine the fairness of the  Federal tax system by removing from  the public domain particular ways of  satisfying a  taxpayer’s  legal obligations. The Equal Access to Tax Planning Act  expressly provides  that a  strategy for reducing, avoiding or deferring tax liability cannot be considered a new or nonobvious  idea, and  therefore, a patent on a tax strategy  cannot be obtained. This ensures that  all taxpayers will have equal access to  strategies  to  comply with  the Tax  Code. I encourage support for this bill.  By Mr. KIRK (for himself and Mr.  DURBIN):  S. 147. A bill to amend the Federal  Water Pollution Control Act to establish a deadline for restricting sewage  dumping into the Great Lakes and to  fund programs and activities for improving wastewater discharges into the  Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  ",2011
59,Senate,112,0.274,188,2011-01-25,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. President, today I am  pleased to join with Senator DURBINto  introduce the Great Lakes Water Protection Act. This bipartisan legislation  would set a date certain to end sewage  dumping in America’s largest supply of  fresh water, the Great Lakes. More  than thirty million Americans depend  on the Great Lakes for their drinking  water, food, jobs, and recreation. We  need to put a stop to the poisoning of  our water  supply. Cities along  the  Great Lakes must become  environmental stewards of our country’s most  precious freshwater ecosystem.  The Great Lakes Water Protection  Act gives cities until 2031 to build the  full infrastructure needed to prevent  sewage dumping into the Great Lakes.  Those who violate EPA sewage dumping regulations after that federal deadline will be  subject  to  fines up  to  $100,000 for each day a violation occurs.  These fines will be directed to a newly  established Great Lakes Clean-Up Fund  within the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. Penalties collected would go  into this fund and be reallocated to the  states surrounding the Great Lakes.  From there, the funds will be spent on  wastewater treatment options, with a  special focus on greener solutions such  as habitat protection and wetland restoration.  This  legislation  is  sorely needed.  Many major cities along  the Great  Lakes do not have the infrastructure  needed to divert sewage overflows during times of heavy rainfall. More than  twenty-four billion gallons of sewage  are dumped into the Lakes each year;  Detroit alone dumps an estimated 13  billion gallons of sewage into the Great  Lakes annually. EPA estimates show  there is a total of 347 combined sewer  outflows that discharge into the Lake  Michigan basin alone. This development is echoed throughout the Great  Lakes region and is one we need to reverse.  These disastrous practices result in  thousands of annual beach closing for  the region’s 815 freshwater beaches. Illinois faced 628 beach closures or contamination advisories in 2009 alone, up  17 percent from 2008. This greatly affects the health of our children and  families—a recent University of Chicago study showed swim bans at Chicago’s beaches due to E. coli levels cost  the local economy $2.4 million in lost  revenue every year.  Protecting our Great Lakes is one of  my top priorities in the Congress. As  an original sponsor of the Great Lakes  Restoration Act, I favor a broad approach to addressing needs in the region. However, we must also move forward with tailored approaches to fix  specific problems as we continue to  push for more comprehensive reform. I  am proud to introduce this important  legislation that addresses a key problem facing our Great Lakes, and hope  my colleagues will support me in ensuring that these important resources  become free from the threat of sewage  pollution.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 147  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

60,Senate,112,-0.351,195,2011-01-25,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President,  the  Healthy  Lifestyles  and  Prevention  America Act, also known as the HeLP  America Act, will improve the health  of Americans and reduce health care  costs  by  emphasizing  prevention,  wellness, and health promotion in our  communities, workplaces and schools.  We made a significant investment in  prevention and wellness as part of the  passing of the historic Affordable Care  Act into law. The robust array of provisions contained in the HeLP America  Act continue to build off the investments made by the Affordable Care Act  and together, they will significantly  transform our current sick care system  into a true health care system.  Make no mistake about  it;  these  combined  efforts will  continue  our  transformation into a genuine wellness  society by keeping people from developing chronic diseases and from costly  hospitalizations in the first place.  Currently, the United States spends  more than $2 trillion on health care  each year but historically we invest  just four cents out of every dollar in  prevention and public health—let me  repeat  that—just  four  cents out of  every dollar is invested in prevention  and public health.  This  is pennies despite all the research that shows that prevention and  public health can effectively  reduce  health care spending. This  is why I  fought for the Prevention and Public  Health Fund that is included in the  health reform law.  But transforming our Nation into a  true wellness society requires a comprehensive approach  to make being  healthier easier for all Americans.  It just doesn’t make any sense why  we don’t put a greater emphasis on  making health promotion easier—why  would we focus so little on prevention  and public health when we know that  these initiatives can make us healthier  and  reduce our annual health  care  spending?  Well, I am proud that the bill before  the Senate continues to make significant  investments  in prevention and  wellness. The HeLP America Act will  put additional systems into place that  will improve access to nutritious foods,  opportunities for physical activity, and  affordability of recommended preventive services.  The bill  focuses on  initiatives  to  make kids and schools healthier. In  particular, it will support State efforts  to provide resources to child care providers to help them meet high-quality  physical activity and healthy eating  standards. It also directs the Department of Education to provide guidance  and technical assistance to schools to  provide equal opportunities  for  students with disabilities for physical education and extracurricular athletics.  In addition, the bill focuses on initiatives to make healthier communities  and workplaces. For example,  it requires  the Secretary of Health and  Human Services to establish guidelines  in physical activity for children under  the age of 5 and the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a grant program  promoting and  expanding  efforts  to  create community gardens. Specific to  small  businesses  and  workplace  wellness programs, there is a provision  that allows employers to deduct the  cost of athletic facility memberships  for their employees and exempts this  benefit as taxable income for employees.  The HeLP America Act also creates  systems that give Americans the information they need to make informed decisions. In particular, there is a provision that requires uniform guidelines  be developed for the use of nutrient labeling symbols or systems on the front  of food packages. There are provisions  meant to strengthen federal initiatives  to improve the health literacy of consumers by making health information  easier to understand and health care  systems easier to navigate.  Let me be clear, this bill doesn’t just  tinker around the edges; it changes the  very paradigm of a variety of systems  to make it easier for Americans to be  healthy. After many years of advocating for wellness and prevention, I  am thrilled to see that these things  were at the very heart of the historic  Affordable Care Act passed into law.  But there  is still much more to be  done, and the HeLP America Act is an  important  step  in  continuing  our  transformation into a genuine wellness  society and getting health care costs  under control.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.

65,Senate,112,-0.326,13,2011-01-31,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President. I  rise  today  with  Senators  WEBB,  BENNELSON, and CONRAD to introduce  the EPA Regulations Suspension Act of  2011. We are introducing this legislation for a simple but enormously important reason. At a time when our  economy is finally headed toward a recovery, the last thing we want to do is  add new burdens to American companies that could result in them cutting  jobs or being  less productive  in the  global marketplace.  In fact, I believe that the fate of our  entire economy, our wide and varied  manufacturing  industries  and  our  workers, especially our coal workers,  rests in part on the decisions we make  here  in Washington. One  thing we  should never do is put the fate of an entire industry into the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency.  My legislation is simple and reasonable. It requires that for 2 years the  EPA can take no regulatory action, regarding carbon dioxide and methane  emission from stationary sources. During that time no facility can be subjected to any requirement to obtain a  permit or meet a New Source Performance Standard under the Clean Air Act  with respect to carbon dioxide or methane. At the same time the legislation  specifically allows for the widely-supported motor vehicle emission standards to continue moving forward.  At the beginning of this year regulations came into effect that say if a  company wants to retrofit an existing  or build a new power plant, or factory,  they now have to find ways to reduce  their greenhouse gas emissions.  Later this year the EPA will propose  expanding these rules to cover existing  stationary sources that are not expanding their operations. The  impact of  these rules is that companies will sit  on the sidelines and opportunities for  innovation and  job creation will be  lost. Because of these new rules companies won’t build that new factory. They  won’t build that new power plant. And  so they won’t employ some of the millions of Americans who are out of  work. That is why I believe these regulations need to be suspended.  I want to make one thing perfectly  clear. I believe that climate change is  an  important  issue  and  Congress  should and will address it working collaboratively with the administration  and the private sector.  But the lead should come from Congress and not the EPA. Congress, unlike the EPA, can craft proposals that  reduce greenhouse gases while simultaneously protecting our economy. Most  importantly, Congress is directly accountable to the people whose lives we  impact.  We are capable of tackling this great  challenge in a way that supports rather  than undermines our economy and our  future.  But the process has to work. It has to  be open. It has to be truly bipartisan.  It has to acknowledge the fact that all  of our States use energy in very different ways. It has to protect our economy. This will not be achieved overnight, but it is possible.  Technology can be a solution to this  problem. West Virginia  is poised to  lead the effort on clean energy technology: because we know energy. We  know coal. We know natural gas. We  know Carbon Capture and Storage or  CCS as few others do. We are coming to  know wind and we have great potential  in learning how to use our geothermal  resources as well.  The fact is, we in West Virginia know  and embrace what too many others either don’t understand or refuse to see,  which is that our Nation and countries  around  the world are dependent on  coal. That is not something that will  change when half the globe is struggling to rise out of poverty.  In this country we get almost half  our electricity from coal. That will not  change anytime soon. Globally countries such as China and India continue  to increase their usage of coal as they  develop their economies.  To fight climate change we can’t just  choose to stop using coal. Even if we in  the United States did, the rest of the  world wouldn’t; and the problem would  continue.  Instead we must  find  the  technological solution that allows us  to use coal, while reducing its impact  on the Earth and her people.  I know that there are many on the  Republican side of the aisle who believe it does not go far enough. There  are many on my side of the aisle who  believe  it goes too  far  in tying the  EPA’s hands. Ultimately I believe this  is good  legislation because  it  is an  achievable compromise. Too often in  this body we seek to score political  points on issues rather than solve problems that the country is facing now.  And right now our Nation’s manufacturing and industrial sectors are facing  the prospect of overwhelming EPA regulation. Regulation  that makes  it  harder for them to put America back  to work. While many might think this  is not the perfect solution it is a solution that I believe we can and should  move early this year.  One piece of the debate that is often  missing in our discussions is to keep  our focus on people and all the problems, including the problem of climate  change, that affect their future.  My focus is on protecting the hard-  working people I represent—people who  changed my life when I was born anew  in the coalfields of West Virginia at  the age of 26. These people, their work  and their lives matter. Any regulatory  solution that creates more problems  for them than it fixes; and causes more  harm than good in their lives is no solution at all. EPA regulation of greenhouse gases does just that.  So that, Mr. President, is why I have  introduced  this  legislation  today.  I  hope that this body will act on  it  quickly, for we do not have time to  waste. I yield the floor.  By Mr. LEVIN:  S. 232. A bill to amend the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the  manufacturer limitation on the number of new qualified plug-in electric  drive motor vehicles eligible for credit;  to the Committee on Finance.  ",2011
66,Senate,112,-0.395,13,2011-01-31,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing legislation that is an  important step for the competitiveness  of U.S. manufacturing by continuing  the nurturing of the market for the  next generation of electric vehicles.  This bill will continue the availability  of the $7,500 consumer tax credit for  plug-in hybrid vehicles. Current  law  limits the availability of this plug-in  hybrid tax credit to the first 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer, which is too  small  to  support  the  revolutionary  technological change that we are hopefully going to witness. Failure to provide this support risks falling short of  President Obama’s important goal of  putting 1 million electric vehicles on  the road by 2015.  The U.S. auto industry is poised for a  technological explosion that promises  to  fundamentally  change  transportation here and around the world. Already, the success of GM’s Volt has  demonstrated that electric vehicles are  not  just an  engineer’s dream or a  science  fiction story. They are real,  and there is plenty more innovation  ready to be unleashed.  But  like  almost  every  transformational technology, from the great  railroads to the Internet, this technological revolution needs support if it is  to spread. President Obama last week  laid out a vision of how this kind of  technology can help ensure our economic future. With the proper support,  we can transform transportation and  create new jobs for American workers.  But if we fail to support this revolution, we risk missing an opportunity  that we may never get back. If we do  not get it right, there is no doubt that  other countries will—and their workers—in China, India, South Korea and  elsewhere—will then build these vehicles instead of American workers.  So I am pleased today to be introducing this bill that is identical to one  that my brother SANDYLEVIN introduced last week in the House of Representatives. This legislation will increase the cap on the number of vehicles eligible for the plug-in hybrid tax  credit in current law and provide much  greater certainty to our manufacturers. It says to our manufacturers that  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:38 Feb 01, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A31JA6.012 S31JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

68,House,112,-0.458,5,2011-02-11,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Let me  thank Mr. CONYERS for yielding as I  think it is important that we explain  to our colleagues what we’re doing  here.  Madam Speaker, this is part of a 7- or  9-hour marathon for committees of jurisdiction to come to the floor to respond to how important it is to, in essence,  clog  up  the  government.  It  sounds pretty, and it sounds attractive  to be able to suggest that we have not  been exercising due diligence as relates  to the regulatory process of the executive branch.  My colleague  from Tennessee was  right: when we cite the Constitution,  what we are saying is that the Founding Fathers recognized the importance  of three distinct branches:  The legislative writes legislation. It  has the right to oversight, and those  who are part of this body are elected to  represent certain perspectives.  The executive is elected by all of the  people, electing the President of the  United States.  The third branch, the judiciary, has  oversight.  So what we have taken to the floor  to do is to spend 9 hours in redundancy,  talking about what this body should be  doing anyhow. We have the responsibility of oversight. We have the ability  to  question  regulations  in  regular  order; but what we will be doing is ignoring the people’s business of creating  jobs and, frankly, putting ourselves in  the role of a clogged toilet, meaning  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:39 Feb 11, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11FE7.024 H11FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

70,House,112,0.367,12,2011-02-11,Mr. AUSTRIA.," Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.  I think we all agree that quality education is important, and I rise today to  discuss a regulation that will unduly  burden our schools and communities.  Last October,  the Department  of  Education released the Program Integrity regulations. Many educators fear  that  these  regulations will have  a  broad reach and require programs to be  licensed in each State where students  reside. Let met give you an example of  a small university in a small county in  Ohio, Pickaway County. This county  lost 2,500 jobs and only has an 11 percent baccalaureate rate.  OCU created an online degree program which currently has 1,000 students enrolled from 15 States. In addition to educating these students, OCU  has created over 150 jobs in 5 years. If  required to be licensed in all 15 States,  OCU will be forced to unenroll at least  half of the online students and lay off  staff. If implemented improperly, this  regulation would impact smaller colleges and universities  like OCU who  don’t have the resources to comply  with this heavy burden.  ",2011
71,House,112,0.363,12,2011-02-11,Mr. LUCAS.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to claim the Agriculture Committee’s time, which I believe I am  sharing with my colleague from Minnesota, and I yield myself 5 minutes.  Today, American agriculture is under  attack. Every day, the administration  seems to demonstrate just how vastly  disconnected it is from the folks who  feed us. The administration fails to realize that rural America’s economy is  dependent upon agriculture. The  in-  your-face approach that the administration has taken regarding government regulation has increased the cost  of doing business for America’s farmers  and ranchers. If the administration is  allowed to continue down this path,  the only  choice many  farmers and  ranchers will have will be to stop farming altogether. From  the dairies of  Vermont to the wheat fields near the  Chesapeake Bay to the cornfields  in  the Midwest, American agriculture is  under a constant barrage of irrational  and unworkable regulations from the  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  which are burdensome, overreaching,  and that negatively affect jobs in rural  economies.  This EPA is mostly interested in pursuing the extreme agenda of environmentalist groups without any consideration for the impact it will have on our  farmers and ranchers. For example, the  EPA wants to treat milk spills like oil  spills  simply because milk contains  animal  fat. The EPA has suggested  that milk storage should be regulated  under the Clean Water Act as large oil  tanks. The EPA wants farmers to till  fields without  producing  any  dust.  Clearly, the  folks at the EPA have  never stepped foot on a farm in western  Oklahoma, or otherwise  they would  know that dust happens, and all the  regulations in the world can’t eliminate  its existence. The EPA wants  farmers to ensure that none of the  spray we use for pests drifts even 1 foot  away from the original source.  The EPA has  started an unprecedented  re-reevaluation  evaluation—  yes, I said re-reevaluation—of the popular wheat control product Atrazine. In  2006, the EPA completed a 12-year review involving 6,000 studies and 80,000  public comments, yet one of the first  orders of business for the Obama administration was to start all over after  an article appeared in The New York  Times. The EPA is trying to regulate  watersheds based off of inaccurate and  flawed models—a problem recognized  even by the top officials at USDA.  The list goes on and on. But what  further illustrates the alarming frame  of mind of the EPA is that the agency  has gone so far as to recently hold a  contest for the public to create videos  explaining what Federal  regulations  are ‘‘important to everyone.’’ In many  instances, the agency is overreaching  its  authority.  Instead  of  operating  within the law, the EPA believes it can  order Congress to pass legislation that  gives it more authority and threaten to  regulate anyway  if Congress chooses  not to act.  The message from the President is  clear: Pass a cap-and-tax bill or we’ll  pursue an endangerment finding. Pass  more authority to regulate watersheds  or we’ll proceed with an Executive  order.  Sadly  for America’s  farmers  and  ranchers,  these  regulations  are not  limited to the EPA. The Department of  Agriculture’s Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyard agency’s proposed  rule on purported  ‘‘fairness’’  far exceeds congressional intent expressed in  the 2008 farm bill. It lacks a credible  economic analysis and has so far been  the result of a regulatory process that  can only be described as flawed. We  have  a  responsibility  to  producers,  packers, processors, retailers—and yes,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:39 Feb 11, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11FE7.025 H11FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

75,House,112,0.579,19,2011-02-11,Ms. BUERKLE.,"  I  thank  the gentleman from California for yielding his  time.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of  H. Res. 72.  Last November, the American people  sent a message to all levels of government: get the government out of the  way so that employers can create new  jobs.  Many in Washington seek a solution  to our country’s economic slowdown  through a revision of the Tax Code and  broad cuts in all levels of spending. I  support these initiatives, but I do not  believe they are enough. We must provide a climate for economic growth and  job creation. Congress must relieve the  American people from the hidden tax  of excessive regulation and red tape. It  is a tax that affects everyone, passed  on every day in increased costs of products and services.  To put things in perspective, according to a report issued last year by the  Small Business Administration, the approximate economic cost of regulation  is a staggering $1.75 trillion annually.  Increased  regulations  stifle  job creation and the expansion of businesses,  both large and small. It cripples their  competitiveness  in a global market  while smothering the innovative spirit  that has made the United States of  America great.  Moreover, businesses are not the only  ones who are harmed by these unnecessary  regulations.  Municipalities,  school districts, not-for-profits, health  care providers, and others serving the  public pay a high cost to comply with  the Federal bureaucracy.  Regardless of who I talk to in the  great State of New York, I ask, What  regulations burden you? Businesses of  all sizes and from all industries talk  about  how  they  incur  unnecessary  overhead for compliance.  ",2011
76,House,112,-0.379,19,2011-02-11,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  This  resolution directs  the House  committees to review Federal regulations for their effect on our economy. I  agree with this resolution and I will  vote for this resolution. In fact, that is  an oversight, of course, that committees should  in  fact be carrying out  without this resolution.  Democrats believe that  it’s  important to vigorously review regulations  to make sure they are keeping pace  with the changing economy, and that’s  why President Obama  has  already  issued an executive order that calls for  such a review.  Where  regulations are duplicative,  where they stifle innovation and entrepreneurship, where they hold job creation back without protecting  consumers,  they  should  be  revised  or  ended.  But let’s also remember that Federal  regulations keep our drinking water  and our air clean, protect our children  from unsafe toys and food, put a check  on abusive practices of insurance companies and credit card companies, and  help control the kind of Wall Street  gambling that wrecked our economy  just a few years ago.  b1200  As a matter of fact, even though regulations were on the books, we know  they were not enforced, which led to  literally the loss of trillions of dollars  by homeowners, individuals and businesses. We want regulations that protect Americans and  foster economic  growth and will call the committees to  review regulations with both of those  goals in mind.  There is a reason that the Democrats  have worked so hard to pass the Make  It In America agenda, an agenda with  which I am particularly identified. We  need to in that agenda, if we are going  to create the environment that I heard  one of the Members on this floor talking about that will lead to businesses  being able to make things in America  and do so profitably, review regulations, review tax policies, and review  other government policies  to make  sure we are competitive in the global  marketplace. But we  also want  to  make sure that we have consumers protected, as I said, and the environment  protected, because there should not be  a trade-off, but a complementary working of the two together.  The new environment  the Federal  Government ought to work to create  will promote growth, jobs, and success  of the American people. Make It In  America  not  only means manufacturing it, but it means succeeding in  America, succeeding in global markets.  I will, as I said, vote for this resolution. But the test will not be whether  this resolution passes or fails. The test  will be whether or not in fact we do the  work that the American public expects  us to do. The test will be whether our  economy does succeed under the revisions we have made.  I tell my friends on that side of the  aisle, neither one of us have done perhaps the job we should have done.

Ms. Allen was selected  from over 1,000 applicants for her work raising  funds for public school art programs.  The Purpose Prize  is an award given by  Civic Ventures, a  think-tank  that  focuses on  work and social purpose. For  the past  five  years the purpose prize has been given to 10  people, all age 60 and over, who have developed new ways to solve social problems. As  individuals who have completed their mid-life  careers, the winners of the purpose prize have  all shown that social innovation is not the sole  province of the young. Civic Ventures considered  the Purpose Prize  to be not a  lifetime  achievement award, but an investment in the  future of the winner.  Ms. Allen has won this award through her  laudable efforts to maintain the arts in public  schools. She is the founder and CEO of Fresh  Artists, a nonprofit that has raised more than  $100,000 benefiting 272 Philadelphia public  schools to the enrichment of over 53,000 children. Fresh Artists utilizes the creativity of our  students to achieve the goal of funding the art  programs that can help more students harness  their own creativity. The organization  invites  students  in grades K  through 12  to donate  their artwork to be used in large-scale reproductions. Fresh Artists then collects monetary  donations from businesses and organizations  who display the artwork in their buildings. The  donations are then used to buy art supplies for  Philadelphia’s most  under-resourced  public  schools. Since its founding in 2008, Fresh Artists has  installed nearly 600  reproductions.  Barbara Allen’s vision and dedication  to  the  arts have provided students with an opportunity to not only have their work displayed,  but also to have their work contribute to the  purchase of supplies that allow other students  to produce further works of art.  I ask  that my colleagues  join me  in congratulating Ms. Allen on this momentous occasion. Her dedication to the art will ensure that  the students of Philadelphia’s public schools  continue to have access to the supplies that  will allow them to fully realize their creative potential.  f  TRIBUTE TO MR.

86,House,112,0.325,19,2011-02-17,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment. We just had a very  good colloquy on the issue of the EFV  and we think we have a solution here  that is good for the taxpayer, is good  for the Marine Corps, and is good for  the Marines. Here’s an opportunity to  get something for the $3 billion that  we’ve already spent on this program.  So I must be opposed to that.  On the V–22, we’ve already voted on  that once during the earlier procedures  on this bill. The V–22 did have some developmental problems years ago. The  V–22 is a most effective weapon being  used  in Afghanistan. Because of the  high mountains, because of the high altitudes, because of the weather, the V–  22 is the vehicle of choice to move our  war fighters from where they are to  where they have to be.  I would hope that the vote would be  the same on this amendment as it was  earlier on the V–22, and that’s to defeat  it. Here is an airplane—the Marines use  this V–22 in Afghanistan on a regular  basis because it has the capability that  the CH–46 does not have. It has the  ability for altitude, it has the ability  for speed, and it is an outstanding aircraft today.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chair, although  I  support Secretary Gates’ call to terminate the  Expeditionary Force Vehicle (EFV), I must unfortunately oppose  the Woolsey amendment  because  it also seeks  to cancel  the Osprey  program, whose termination I do not support.  The EFV is clearly not a wise use of American tax dollars. It is 14 years behind schedule  and estimated to cost 168 percent more than  originally estimated. Because of  these realities, along with the evolving nature of naval  warfare, Secretary Gates, the Secretary of the  Navy and  the Commandant of  the Marine  Corps have all recommended that it be terminated—and  it was not  included  in President  Obama’s FY 12 Budget. By contrast, after  overcoming a number of operational and cost  concerns, the Osprey has become a top priority  for  the Marine Corps and does enjoy  command support.  If I could split this amendment into two separate votes, I would do so.

If  left unchallenged,  this  claim of authority would allow  the  FCC to do anything, anything it could  allege  to  promote  broadband under  their  jurisdiction, which  they don’t  have.  So Congress must stop the FCC. This  amendment will do that just by preventing any money from being spent to  implement these rules. I urge its adoption.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

I just want to make one comment on  what was said a moment ago by the  gentleman from Florida. This amendment reduces funding in this CR to $10  billion. It should be enough to withdraw the troops. But the argument was  made that to reduce the funding is not  to support our troops, to rob them of  the implements of doing their job. But  the fact is that the only power that  Congress has to effectuate the war-  making power, to control whether we  should be at war somewhere or another, is the power of the purse.  We are not saying, by adopting this  amendment, we would not be saying  that we want our troops there with no  weapons and so forth. We would be saying use the funds to bring the troops  home.  It  is more supportive of the  troops to bring them home from a war  that they should not be fighting, that  is not vital to our national security, it  is more supportive to bring them home  than  it  is to give them weapons to  fight an unnecessary war  in which  some of them, unfortunately, will lose  their lives.  So I say support our troops. Bring  them home. Support the country. Stop  fighting where it doesn’t make sense,  and spend our military resources where  it helps the national security of the  United States, which is not in Afghanistan right now.  ",2011

I want to say that every stakeholder  representing  constituents  all  over  America gave greatly to adopt this  amendment that will have, in my opinion, a responsible relaxation of the perimeter rule at Washington National  Airport.  We can talk about the details certainly as we move forward, but there  was one major  issue  left unresolved  that I think deserves a colloquy so we  know what we have to do to finish this  process in conference before we adopt  an FAA bill that is a very important  bill for our country.

Along with my colleagues from  Maryland, we have the airports that  are most affected by these changes, and  we have worked in that spirit of compromise. As the Senator from Arizona  noted, I don’t think anyone is totally  satisfied.  I wish to particularly single out the  ranking member and the chair for their  willingness to acknowledge our work  on the issue of the effects of these additional flights. Going up from where the  House position was and  the airport  authority’s original position was  to  make sure—vis-a-vis Dulles—that the  economic effects of this and the question  involving  the potential  shared  debt service between the two airports  be addressed. This was an issue, again,  that we were not able to resolve, but I  appreciate the chair, the ranking member and their staffs’ willingness to continue to work as this bill goes to conference.

This is a Leahy-Inhofe amendment.  It is on two almost unrelated things,  but the Leahy portion of the amendment extends the public safety officer  program benefits from 6 to 10 families  whose  loved ones died  in voluntary  services. It is fully offset for 10 years.  The important part of this amendment is mine, and that is—if I could  have your attention over here, and I  am speaking to the Republicans now,  we have been trying to do this for a  number of years, and Senator LEAHY  and I have agreed to this. Those of us  who have been pilots—and I have been  for 55 years—I have been involved in a  lot of humanitarian missions. What  this does is offer liability protection to  those of us who volunteer ourselves,  our money, and our aircraft to do missions no one else will do. They are humanitarian missions. The longest one I  did was all the way down to Dominica,  North of Caracas, Venezuela, through  two hurricanes, and we saved a lot of  lives down there. This would offer liability protection to those individuals  who make those sacrifices.  There are 8,000 of us, by the way,  around the country, I am sure from  every State  represented here. So  I  would encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.  ",2011

I am going to ask to have a voice vote  on  this  to accommodate everybody,  recognizing the late hour, but I want to  make a point. What Senator LEAHY  wants to do is great to help people. But  the one question we have not asked is—  and we are going to be asked to ask it  all the time from here forward given  where we are—is it a Federal responsibility to supply these benefits? You  can’t find it in the Constitution. You  can’t find it anywhere.  When we look at the hard decisions  we are going to have to make over the  next 2 years in terms of trimming both  mandatory programs and discretionary  programs, where we set an example  that we are going to expand something  that is not in our constitutional role,  we are making a mistake and we are  setting ourselves up for failure.

The American College of Radiology created the AIRP to allow radiology resident training to move forward uninterrupted by the Defense Department’s  closure  of  the  Armed  Forces Institute of Pathology, AFIP,  as part of the Base Realignment and  Closure Commission plan. The launch  of the AIRP provides an excellent example of the private sector stepping up  to help ameliorate  the  impact  that  BRAC changes can have on a community.  I am especially pleased that AIRP  chose to locate in the newly revitalized  historic American Film Institute Silver Theatre and Cultural Center, approximately 2 miles from the former  AFIP site. The AFI Silver Theatre is a  state-of-the-art education and cultural  center anchored by the restoration of  noted architect John Eberson’s historic  1938 Silver Theatre. Once slated for the  wrecker’s ball, AFI was saved through  the efforts of the local community and  reopened in 2003. Its revitalization represents a unique public-private partnership between Montgomery County,  MD, and the American Film Institute.  The launch of the AIRP at the AFI  Silver Theatre and Cultural Center  demonstrates the role the theatre is  playing as a major anchor of a redevelopment effort in Montgomery County.  Approximately 2,000 physicians annually  from around the world are expected to convene in Silver Spring for  4 weeks at a time to participate in  AIRP. With courses developed and presented by world-renowned faculty from  the most prestigious  radiology programs in the country, AIRP will further contribute to Montgomery County’s reputation as a leader in medical  research and education. I applaud the  launch of the AIRP, and I look forward  to a long and mutually beneficial relationship between AIRP and the Montgomery County community.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT A. DENNIS  ∑",2011
119,Senate,112,-0.296,166,2011-02-17,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I want  to take a moment to recognize the retirement this week of Robert A. Dennis, CBO’s Assistant Director for Macroeconomic Analysis. Mr. Dennis is retiring after more than 30 years of service at CBO.  He began his career at CBO in 1979,  working  as  a Principal Analyst  in  CBO’s Macroeconomic Division. He was  promoted to the position of Deputy Assistant Director of the Division in 1988  and then to the position of Assistant  Director of the Division in 1992, where  he has served since.  As the head of CBO’s Macroeconomic  Analysis Division, Mr. Dennis has been  one of the leading economists at CBO  and has helped drive the agency’s outstanding work. His skills as an economist have been highlighted in the diverse issues he has worked on while at  CBO, ranging from macroeconomic effects of tax policy, to the impact of flu  epidemics and terrorist disruptions at  U.S. ports.  Mr. Dennis has also played a critical  role at CBO by developing many of the  procedures the Macroeconomic Analysis Division has used to prepare its  economic forecasts. He even wrote the  computer software that the division  used for many years to analyze current  economic  developments  and  prepare  charts for CBO publications.  Mr. Dennis’s excellent work has been  recognized throughout his career. In  the 1980s, as a principal analyst, he received a CBO Director’s Award for outstanding performance. And he has since  received a number of awards recognizing his outstanding management at  CBO.  Mr. Dennis has exemplified CBO’s  high standard of professionalism, objectivity, and nonpartisanship. He has  worked tirelessly to ensure Congress  was given accurate and timely information on the key policy issues of the  day.  I thank Robert Dennis and commend  him for his many years of dedicated,  faithful, and outstanding  service  to  CBO, to Congress, and to the American  people. I wish him all the best in his  well-deserved retirement.∑  f  REMEMBERING CLIFFORD R.  PHILLIPS  ∑",2011
120,Senate,112,0.208,166,2011-02-17,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  would like to take a few minutes to  offer a tribute to Clifford R. Phillips.  He passed away on December 3, 2010, at  his home in Surprise, AZ. He was an  Alaskan fishing legend and a true hero  who fought bravely in the European  Theater during World War II.  Cliff was born on December 7, 1919, on  the west coast of Vancouver Island. His  parents, who had originally been involved in the fishing industry in England, had  immigrated to British Columbia where they managed a herring  saltery. They later moved to Ketchikan where he would, as a very young  man, begin his career in Alaskan fisheries. This was the age of ‘‘mild cure’’  salmon, and  starting at  the age of  seven Cliff began learning the family  business and the  importance of producing a high quality product. He continued to work with his father in the  family business through the 1930s.  After  seeing  the  devastation  and  heartache of the beginning of World  War II, Cliff joined the Alaska National  Guard. He trained at Chilkoot Barracks in Haines, AK, and was assigned  to duties in the Aleutian Islands. He  was one of the first to fly into the new  military airfield built in the Pribilof  Islands, which  is  located nearly 500  miles off the Siberian coast. The rugged winter saw the Islands iced in. The  base did not receive supplies by ship for  some 9 months, but Cliff and his comrades held their ground.  In September 1944, he transferred to  the European Theater and joined the  Third Army. He participated  in the  landing at Normandy, and his unit  later helped to repel the German offensive in ‘‘The Battle of the Bulge.’’ Cliff  managed to make it through combat  unscathed, and his distinguished service led to his being awarded the Silver  Star.  Upon discharge after World War II,  Cliff felt the urge to return to Alaska  and to his family heritage in the fishing industry. He naturally gravitated  back to Ketchikan in southeast Alaska  so that he could work in the waters he  knew best.  In 1950, the Phillips father-son duo  built  the E.C. Phillips cold  storage  plant on Tongass Narrows  in Ketchikan. Cliff and his father excelled at increasing capacity, efficiency, and quality. As time went by, the E.C. Phillips  product became known  for  its high  quality around the world, and today it  is still known as a premier quality  product.  After the death of his father, Cliff  took charge, but he was no desk bound  executive, and standard working hours  did not apply to him. During the fishing season he could always be found in  the processing area of his plant  inspecting the fish and supervising operations. Cliff sold his product by phone  and fax from his Alaskan office to the  entire United States and around the  world. But nothing left the plant until  he was satisfied that the fish met the  E.C. Phillips quality standard.  Before there was an Alaska Seafood  Marketing Institute, Cliff was Alaska’s  ambassador for seafood, and he traveled far and wide promoting Alaskan  seafood products. Cliff remained active  in the business well into his eighties,  but even after he retired from daily operations  and moved  to Arizona he  maintained frequent contact with the  plant and his many friends and customers.  Everyone found Cliff to be a charming man, eloquent and persuasive, but  first and foremost he saw it as his mission to insist on high quality for all  products which carried the E.C. Phillips brand name. I extend my sincerest  condolences to his wife Dixie and his  family members. We have all lost a  friend, and Alaska’s seafood industry  has lost a great champion. May he rest  in peace.∑  f  REMEMBERING NEVA EGAN  ∑",2011

Whether it was volunteering to work in  the kitchen before a dinner or  recognizing  other veterans for their service, Ray was always ready and willing to give back. He regularly volunteered to drive disabled veterans to  their appointments within the Veterans Affairs  system and even oversaw  the program  for  some time. In 2007, I had the honor of meeting Ray and working with him to help coordinate the van driving program. I will always remember the compassion and good humor Ray  brought to this basic yet essential task.  While deeply dedicated to helping his fellow  veterans, the scope of Ray’s service within the  community was much broader. He volunteered  as a mentor at the Windham Center School,  coached Willimantic Little League baseball  and softball, and was an avid fan of UCONN  athletics.  As a beloved husband, father, grandfather,  veteran, coach, and mentor,  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ray Elliott’s life  of service to his country and community.  f  FULL-YEAR CONTINUING  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2011  SPEECHOF  HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO  OFGUAM  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 15, 2011  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 1) making appropriations for the Department of Defense and  the other departments and agencies of the  Government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, and for other purposes:  ",2011
123,House,112,-0.469,8,2011-02-28,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," I thank  the gentleman from California, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 368, the Removal  Clarification Act of 2011, will enable  Federal officials to remove cases to  Federal court in accordance with the  spirit and intent of the Federal officer  removal statute, 28 U.S.C. 1442(a). This  is a noncontroversial, bipartisan bill.  In the 111th Congress, a nearly identical version passed the House under a  suspension of the rules and passed the  Senate with an amendment by unanimous consent.  Under the Federal officer removal  statute, a Federal officer should be  able to remove a case from State court  to Federal court when it involves the  Federal officer’s exercise of his or her  official  responsibilities. The purpose  underlying the Federal officer removal  statute is to prevent State litigants  from interfering with the Federal Government’s operations. There  is, however, some ambiguity as to whether the  Federal officer removal statute applies  to State pre-suit discovery procedures.  More than 40 States have such procedures, which require individuals to be  deposed or respond to discovery requests even when a civil action has not  yet been filed. This means that Federal  officials can be forced to litigate in  State court, undermining the purpose  and intent of the Federal officer removal statute.  Courts are split on whether the removal statute applies to pre-suit discovery. Some courts have found that  Federal officers cannot remove a proceeding to Federal court when these  pre-suit discovery motions are at issue  while others have found that such proceedings could be removed. This bill  will clarify that Federal officers should  be able to remove a proceeding to Federal court any time a legal demand is  made for a Federal official’s testimony  or documents if the officer’s exercise of  his or her official responsibilities was  at issue.  The legislation will also allow a Federal officer to appeal a district court’s  decision to remand the matter back to  the State court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1447. This bill will not result in the removal of the entire State case when a  Federal officer is served with a discovery request when the only hook is  that a Federal officer has been served  with such a discovery request. Rather,  the bill we consider today makes clear  that ‘‘if there is no other basis for removal, only that discovery proceeding  may be removed to the district court.’’  Finally, the bill makes clear that the  timing  requirement under  28 U.S.C.  1446 will not be changed, restating the  30-day requirement  for removing the  case when the judicial order is sought  as well as when the judicial order is enforced.  In closing,  I would  like to thank  Chairman SMITHand Ranking Member  CONYERS for working with me on this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan piece of  legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, once again I would  like  to  thank  the  gentleman  from  Georgia for bringing this bill to the  committee and to the floor. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.  ",2011

I  ask that this poem penned in honor and remembrance of  them by Albert Caswell be  placed in the RECORD.  THEPACKISBACK, ANDHOW!  In this game of old,  upon these hardened fields of frozen tundras  so . . .  But came the birth,  of one of the NFL’s greatest teams to be behold . . .  of most hallowed Green and Gold!  Were born,  The Green Bay Packers of such fame known  so,  because of their Championships,  the name Title Town they now so own!  As the only Professional team across this nation,  in any sport, who is so owned by. . .  ‘‘WE The People’’ this fine equation!  As The Legend Vince Lombardi,  ‘‘so ruled The Lombardi Nation’’ . . .  and his most hallowed teams, virtually defined . . .  the very definition of what the word football  means!  And from this Title Town so came,  the very first two Super Bowls win to claim,  as a Starr was born who in The Hall now remains!  As it was not too long before,  when a man named Brett went Favre . and gave to this Title Town again,  .  . . .  . . Big  . clash of the  another Super Bowl win once more!  As then later in later years,  a new kid in town as so appeared . . .  like The Young Man to Montana Man,  now Brett to Rogers, both had to stand!  Back to Back! Man to Man!  Replacing an Icon . . . as Rogers knew,  he’d have to go ‘‘The Longest Yard’’ to live  that dream!  And now the stage was set,  in Super Bowl XVL so yet . Titans,  Pittsburgh and Green Bay, who would survive?  Would Steel bend, or Cheese give way?  As it was these two early teams,  that so helped give the NFL its great name!  As the two rode into Texas for the game,  for this up and coming war,  as a shootout at the OK Corral for sure!  But, only one team . . .  can so wear that most hallowed crown,  that of World Champions of so renown . . and hold that Lombardi Trophy up high,  up so very proud!  As it was to be,  the young gun versus the proven one . Ben,  and the new Kid Rocket Rogers with cannons,  blazing both ones!  Who would win, and Be The Best?  But, Aaron could not spell the word DOUBT,  even if you spotted him the first five letters  no less!  And still another great question lie here so!  Which is greater, Cheese or Steel . . . yo?  As so soon, 111,000 viewers would know!  As The Pack had something to prove,  with so many players on the DL . . .  they had their own Special Mash Unit too!  While, it did not take long,  before Rogers threw strong . . and hit Jody with a 29 TD . . .  As he put a Full Nelson on the Pittsburgh D!  Then, in the Nick of time . . .  Big money Collins,  cashed in his own private Benjamins,  intercepting, a 37 yd return crossing the goal  line!  As on that very same play,  Kemoeatu, gave Big Ben ‘‘The Kemo Treatment’’,  running over him, showing him The Packer  Way!  Already you could so see, in disbelief . . .  as all over those powerful Pittsburgh Steelers,  some Rust was starting form, starting to  creep!  As, Matthews 52 cried out . . .  you better get the trainer quick . and get some Rustoleum on that,  or your all going to be eating cheese!  And then after a Steelers field goal,  Big Ben was Bushwhacked by Jarrett so,  with an interception . . . as man that was  cold!  Then, using Laser Technology,  for a TD to Jennings so sweet . . as Rogers drilled a rope for 7yds,  that exploded oh so very brilliantly!  As it looked like Polamalu number 43,  and all of the entire Steelers football team,  were having a bad hair day indeed,  yea it was not looking very pretty!  When, suddenly before the half time,  Hines Ward, had something else in mind . a great TD, reinforcing The Steel you see!  As it was at the end of a 77yd drive,  once again Big Ben came alive,  because the great one earlier,  Woodson, got hurt breaking up a play as he  dived!  But Pittsburgh apparently,  liked what they served at the halftime show,  helping them grow those Black Eyed Peas so!  .  .  .  .  . . five consecutive  Scoring a touchdown on  runs,  from the 50yd line where it all begun . . .  as Mendenhall scored with an 8yd TD, this  one!  The Steelers were bent,  but not yet broken . . . until Matthews,  molded Mendenhall into human Clay,  with his fumble so, Captain Crunch had spoken!  And with the game on the line,  Rocket Rogers say ‘‘Roger That’’,  yea one more time!  Living Large, with a 55yd drive into a TD!  As once again, on Jennings looked so splendidly,  with an 8yd throw . . . the man’s got speed,  telling all of those Terrible Towels . . . to  eat cheese!  As somehow again, The Tower of Big Ben  . . .  struck one more time, in the end zone to  Wallace . . .  who is too, was built for speed!  But, the coolest of cool . . .  as Rogers nerves of steel ruled!  Driving down the field,  for a Masonic Moment as he would not yield!  With Crosby, on the road to victory . . .  As he made the kick,  the Steelers were getting sick,  and needed a drive, as those terrible towels  began to cry!  But time ran out on Big Ben,  as Rogers cried it’s time for the belt my  friends . . .  feel my disease,  as the price of steel began to descend!  As The Black and Yellow, turned to jell–O  . . .  turned to jell-o . er’s D,  put their stamp of Wiscousin Cheese . them!  While, somewhere up in Heaven,  an Angel named Lombardi cries,  ‘‘The Pack is Back,  we’re on Top!’’ now with tear in his eye!  It was a heck of a game, as records were broken . . .  as over 111,000 people watched what was spoken!  The word TEAM, what McCarthy was invoking!  As he, had a lot legends to live up to . . .  and some tough shoes to fill, along the way!  But, now he’s shown the nation what he can  do!  It was one heck of year, as against all odds  . . .  a new World’s Champion been named,  just like the old Lombardi team’s so true!  Against all odds, in the way they were led,  from The Coach on down . . . what it said,  as a new Star who was found, ‘‘Rogers That’’!  Yea, once again THE PACK IS BACK,  AT THE VERY TOP OF THE PACK . . ALL IN THAT GREAT TITLE TOWN!  And in the end, the Nation found!  That Cheese is far stronger than Steel!  So don’t look back, were gaining on you  now!  Were only two away from six,  in this hallowed Title Town!

We have a wealth of resources in our  Nation: oil, natural gas, and coal. Yet  we see gas prices rising to unbelievable  rates here in America, approaching, in  many places, in excess of $4 a gallon.  And what are we doing about it? Not  very much. We’ve got a permitting  process that is failing America. And we  have an opportunity  today  to  show  America just how bad that problem is.  Later today, I’m going to be introducing a bill called the ROAD to Jobs  Act. It stands for regulatory openness,  accountability, and disclosure. And we  are going to show the American people,  through a report that is going to be required from the Council on Environmental Quality, just how flawed that  permitting process is, requiring them  to show the permits that are in cycle  and what the economic  implications  are of not authorizing permits to go  after America’s resources.  f  ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND  SPENDING CUTS  (Ms.  SCHWARTZ  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2011
132,House,112,-0.343,2,2011-03-11,Ms. SCHWARTZ.," Last week, we saw  real signs of economic recovery when  the unemployment rate dropped below  9 percent for the first time in 2 years.  This is encouraging news, but we still  have a long way to go to promote private sector growth.  The Republicans are digging  their  heels in on billions of dollars of reckless cuts that threaten our economic  growth and put 700,000 American jobs  at risk. We agree that spending cuts  are necessary to reduce the deficit.  This is not about whether to cut or  not. This is about where to cut, how  much to cut, and how fast to cut. The  Republican agenda threatens our core  obligations to our seniors, to our safety, and to our future.  We need disciplined budgeting. We  need targeted cuts that won’t hurt our  economy. And we need strategic investments to make America competitive  for future generations. Republicans are  putting  partisan  politics  ahead  of  American priorities. Instead of enacting job-destroying cuts, we should be  focusing on  job creation and  sound  budgeting.  Enough is enough. It’s time to get serious and pass a responsible spending  plan that grows the economy and invests in the future.

",2011
133,House,112,-0.379,2,2011-03-11,Mr. YARMUTH.," Mr. Speaker, we are  engaged in a process now and over the  next week to decide how we are going  to fund the government for the next  few months and for the next year. Republicans have already decided where  they want to put the burden of the cuts  that we all know we have to make in  the budget. They want to put them on  the least fortunate of our country.  Let me  read  something  from The  Washington Post this week written by  Harold Meyerson. Mark Whitehouse of  the Wall Street Journal looked at how  businesses were dividing up the pie 18  months into every previous recovery  since 1947 and found that 58 percent of  their increases in productivity trickled  down  to  their workers  in  increased  wages. What has happened today is the  other way around: Only 6 percent of  productivity gains have gone to our  newly more  productive workers.  In  other words, our people, our working  families have already paid the price.  What have the corporations and businesses done with that profit that they  have made? Mostly, they are buying  their stock back. They are not hiring  people or investing in research. So as  we decide where we are going to tighten the belt as we move forward on our  budget, let’s make sure that we tighten  it on the fat cats as well as the people  who have already been strangled.  f  BICYCLING ADVOCATES OFFER  POSITIVE MESSAGE OF HOPE  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

They  were addressing the issues found on the  front page every day in our newspapers  about what would happen if we made it  easier to use the most efficient form of  urban transportation ever designed. It  would make a huge difference to the  health of our  families, dealing with  traffic congestion and air pollution,  and reduce the tyranny of our addiction to oil if we burned more calories  and less fossil fuel.  It is also big business. Billions of dollars are made from the sales, service,  manufacturing, and bike tourism. And  most important, it makes our communities more livable, our families safer,  healthier, and more economically secure.  Thank you, cycling advocates,  for  your positive message of hope. I hope  that it found receptive ears here on  Capitol Hill.

135,House,112,0.387,9,2011-03-11,Mr. BACHUS.," Madam Chair, I yield  myself the balance of my time.  The American people have sent us  here to tell the truth, and the truth is  that there are too many government  programs that do not work and actually make things worse. These government programs are paid  for by the  American people.  You can say that it’s not from the  Treasury, or that it’s from the Treasury; that it’s from TARP, it’s not from  TARP. But the fact remains that it is  from the American taxpayer. In fact,  the gentleman at one  time  said  it  comes out of the Treasury. Then he  said  it comes  from TARP. But the  promise in 2008 was that it would go  back to the American people. It would  go back in the national Treasury. In  fact, it does not. I will address where it  goes, and I think the American people,  when they find out where it goes under  this program, they’re going to be even  more upset. I don’t think they’ll be  surprised, because I think they’ve come  to realize that there’s not a lot of will  in Washington to protect them, the  taxpayers.  The American people already know  that there are too many  ineffective  government programs  that cost  too  much, and this is a poster child for  those programs. If you can’t cut this  program, I’m not sure you can cut any.  And when we find such programs, we as  the representatives of the people have  a duty and a responsibility to the taxpayers to end these programs. That’s  what we are doing this morning. We’re  going to end this program. That’s what  we’re here for.  In this legislation by the gentleman  from Texas, we stop a $1 billion failed  spending program. Now it’s a well-intentioned program. But  just as  the  road to hell is paved with good intentions, so is the road to higher deficits  and record-breaking debt, a debt that  our children and our grandchildren will  have to pay.  You know, when we talk about the  taxpayers ultimately  fund  this program, when we borrow at 42 cents out  of every dollar, it’s our children and  our grandchildren that will have to pay  for  these  programs. We’re  charging  something and we’re telling them to  pay the bill.  Today, we have an unthinkable debt  of $14 trillion, a debt that imposes a  birth tax on every child born in America. It’s $45,000 today. Just last year it  was $35,000. It’s grown by $10,000. Even  worse, this debt or birth tax is growing  every day, because our government is  spending some days $5 billion, some  days $8 billion more than it takes in  and adding to what our children and  grandchildren will have to pay.  One question that the American people often confront is, are they better  off than their parents and will their  children be better off than they are,  and  their  grandchildren?  It’s  interesting that in survey after survey, or  poll after poll, the American people  say, we’re better off than our parents.  Our parents  fought  for our  freedom,  they preserved it in numerous wars,  they saved their money, they watched  their money, they worked hard, and  they left us in good shape.  But when that same question is a little different question, ‘‘Do you think  your children or grandchildren will be  better off?’’ the American people know.  They instinctively know. ‘‘No’’ is the  answer, sadly. And that’s because of  our national debt and our deficit. In  fact, both the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff and Secretary Robert  Gates have said that it’s a national security problem. Our debt threatens our  very existence as a country.  This Washington spending binge  is  driving our country right off a cliff.  We’ve seen the effect of overspending  on our economy today. The government absorbs so much money from our  citizens that it’s hard to create private  jobs. Each dollar out of the economy is  a job that the private sector can’t create.  Now actually President Reagan and  President Clinton both  realized  this  and  they grew  the economy. Those  were the only two years with a growing  economy and government spending either level or going down.

The American citizens are not rats.  The money that we are appropriating  through  good  public  policy  is  not  money that’s going down a rat hole.

141,,112,0.913,44,2011-03-11,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, today,  I  introduced  the Removing Excess Litigation  Involving Energy on Federal Lands Act, RELIEF Act. This legislation would help streamline judicial procedures for causes and claims  regarding the leasing of Federal lands for the  exploration,  development,  production,  processing, or transmission of oil, natural gas, or  any other source or form of energy.  Excessive  legal  challenges  have  significantly delayed and in many cases prevented  energy resources from reaching the American  public. These oftentimes frivolous legal challenges have helped contribute to our nation’s  economic  turmoil  and  skyrocketing  energy  costs.  The RELIEF Act would not take away anyone’s  ‘‘day  in court;’’  instead,  it will simply  streamline the process for all parties involved.  This legislation would require that all claims be  filed within 60 days of an action or decision  and  that any proceeding be resolved within  180 days of the claim being filed and gives  precedence over other court proceedings. In  addition, it requires that all appeals from the  District Court be  reviewed by  the Supreme  Court and  that any proceeding be  resolved  within 180 days of the claim being filed. To  deter  frivolous  lawsuits,  it also requires  that  any person seeking judicial review of any action under this Act shall pay the prevailing party’s legal fees and other expenses, unless the  Court finds that the position of the person was  substantially  justified  or  that  special  circumstances make an award unjust.  As  the economic downturn continues and  energy prices soar, our nation must do everything in its power to access the abundant natural  resources with which we have been  blessed. I believe this legislation can play an  important part in our nation’s economic recovery by alleviating current energy costs, while  also helping to ensure our energy future.  f  HONORING THOMAS PATRICK  O’ROURKE  HON.

As an educator for over 30 years, I have  witnessed  firsthand  the devastating  impact  bullying  and  harassment  has  on  students  emotionally, socially and academically. These  problems are pervasive and persistent in our  schools. The hostile environment created by  harassment and bullying not only deprives students of the opportunity to receive a quality  education, but also contributes  to academic  underachievement. Furthermore, bullying and  harassment can, and have, led to life-threatening violence and suicide, as evidenced by  several nationally reported incidents including  cases in New Jersey, Philadelphia, New York  and across the United States.  Existing federal civil rights statutes that address discrimination do not cover sexual orientation or gender  identity,  thus LGBT students are vulnerable to discrimination, harassment, and bullying. Furthermore, there is no  recourse or legal protection when the rights of  LGBT students are violated.  The Student Non-Discrimination Act  is a  positive step toward achieving equal protection  for LGBT students. It will do this by prohibiting  discrimination in public school based on actual  or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. These steps will provide LGBT students a  safe environment  free  from discrimination  to  learn and succeed in school.  The SNDA has goals similar to legislation I  supported as chair of the Congressional Asian  Pacific American Caucus  including  the Safe  Schools  Improvement  Act,  which  helps  schools and school districts develop and improve anti-bullying and anti-harassment initiatives. We need all of this and much more, until  our students are safe enough to study without  the strain of discrimination or fear of bullying  and harassment.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Student  Non-Discrimination Act  and  urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation to ensure that all our students have  access to a quality education free from fear.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

Mr. Speaker, as Roosevelt Dam embarks on  its second century of service, it deserves special recognition for its engineering marvel and  being an economic engine for central Arizona.  f  HONORING SPECIALIST DAVID R.  FAHEY  f  THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION  OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT DAM  HON. PAUL A. GOSAR  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, March 11, 2011  ",2011
145,,112,0.611,51,2011-03-11,Mr. GOSAR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to Theodore Roosevelt Dam, an  engineering marvel that is celebrating its centennial of service to the people of Arizona, including a majority of constituents in my own  District.  When Federal engineers built Roosevelt  Dam on the Salt River in the beginning of the  20th Century, they did not have the conveniences of a nearby  town, an existing power  supply or a locally skilled labor force. Several  engineering feats needed to be accomplished  even before construction could begin at  the  site 80 miles east of Phoenix.  A road was cut into the sides of mountains  so supplies could be hauled from the Phoenix  area  to  the  dam  site. Members  of  local  Apache tribes helped build the road, and they  continued with the construction effort for the  dam. Federal engineers also constructed a 20-  mile canal to develop hydroelectric power at  the dam to power a cement mill, aerial trams  and cableways, and other equipment.  Stone masons cut massive blocks from the  sides of  the canyon. Cranes were used  to  lower the stones, some weighing as much as  10 tons, to the riverbed. They were laid in a  stair-step fashion, which gave the dam a distinctive appearance.  Federal engineers ensured the strength of  the dam by requiring the mortar joints on the  upstream face not to exceed 1 inch in width.  Following  the  laying of  the cornerstone  in  1906,  crews worked  nearly  nonstop, with  strings of electric lights suspended above the  site allowing men to work through the night.  Five years later, Roosevelt Dam had risen 280  feet high, with a base 184 feet thick that narrowed to 16 feet at the top. On the day of its  dedication on March 18, 1911, it was the largest  rubble-masonry  thick-arch  dam  in  the  world.  Due to its engineering and construction excellence, Roosevelt Dam  stood nearly unchanged for more than 80 years. In the 1990s,  a new generation of engineers needed to address dam safety,  regulatory water storage  and  flood control  in central Arizona. During  this construction effort, the entire face of the  dam was overlain with concrete,  ranging  in  thickness from 10 to 50 feet. The concrete extended upward to create a new crest and spillways were constructed deeper and narrower,  allowing  for greater water  releases during  floods. Renovations used nearly 450,000 cubic  yards of cement, enough to pave a two-lane  road between Phoenix and Tucson. The additional 77 feet of height effectively doubled the  capacity of the reservoir, enhancing its role in  managing water  supplies  for  the  growing  greater Phoenix metropolitan area.  HON.

Fahey, who lost  his life on Monday, February 28, 2011, while  courageously serving our nation  in Afghanistan. He was killed by an IED explosion. Yesterday he was laid to rest.  Specialist Fahey enlisted at the age of 20,  in August, 2007. He was deployed to Afghanistan in June, 2010. He is mourned by family,  friends, and  fellow  soldiers  from Yorktown  Heights, New York,  to Washington State,  Korea, and Afghanistan. He has been honored  for his service with the Combat Action Badge,  the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star.  Specialist Fahey’s dedication  to protecting  his fellow citizens extended to his plans to join  the New York City Police Department after the  completion of his tour of duty. His sacrifice for  our nation will be  remembered  through  the  family he loved and freedom he protected. I  ask the House to keep in their thoughts and  prayers Specialist Fahey and all  the other  brave men and women in our armed services  who have lost their lives, as well as those who  continue to serve abroad.  f  PAYING  TRIBUTE  TO  CAPTAIN  THOMAS F.

148,House,112,0.57,2,2011-03-29,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker,  last  night, the President took to the airwaves and talked to the Nation about  the international efforts that America  is leading in Libya. This comes almost  2 weeks after the President gave his approval for the United States to be involved  in the action  in Libya. The  President discussed the United States’  interest in the conflict, the limited involvement of the United States military, and the role of other countries.  What the President  failed to deliver  was a clear articulation on what  is  America’s role in this conflict. Putting  our men and women  in harm’s way  while not knowing the specifics of how  and why is not just unacceptable, it is  dangerous.  Mr. President, you need to be more  forthcoming.  The  American  people  need more information. The American  people certainly deserve answers. The  explanation  last  night  was  disappointing, and we find ourselves even  more frustrated as specific information  was not provided. What  is the exit  strategy? What is the endgame? What  are our goals? How are we going to ensure that the next government of Libya  is not even more hostile than the current regime?  The President does need to  follow  through with his actions. We need to  have the resolve to see this through.  The President waited too long to address the Nation. Certainly, the Congress needed to be involved. And certainly the American people needed to  be involved.  f  b1410  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2011

151,House,112,-0.376,9,2011-03-29,Mr. MILLER of North Carolina.," Mr.  Chairman, I rise to oppose this bill, but  I do so with mixed feelings because I  have been one of the critics of the  HAMP program.  The members of the majority have  pointed out correctly that this program has been widely criticized  for  more than 2 years. It has been criticized by the congressional oversight  panel, by the SIGTARP  (Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset  Relief Program), by La Raza, by Elizabeth Warren, and, yes, by me. But I  have not criticized it for the reasons  that  the  gentleman  from Alabama  gave. If this bill is keeping a promise,  it is not a promise made in open to the  American people, it is keeping a promise made in secret to the banks, because the costs of this program are not  going to come out of the pockets of the  American people. This comes out of the  TARP program. That legislation said  that any money not recovered by 2013  has to be recovered from the financial  industry, and whoever’s present in 2013  has to propose to Congress exactly how  it is we’re going to get that money  back.  They can afford it. Thirty percent of  all corporate profits are in the financial sector. They can more than afford  it.  The gentleman  from Alabama  frequently  says  that he hates visiting  debt on his grandchildren, and I believe  him when he says it, but I have good  news for him. Unless his grandchildren  take a job on Wall Street in the next 2  years, they are not going to have to  pay this debt. This debt, if Congress  does keep its promise to the American  people, will not come from the American people. It will come  from Wall  Street. It will come from the people  who created the mess that we are now  trying to clean up.  But I have criticized this program because it is not as effective as it should  be. It has gone on for 2 years. It is not  what we need. The problem, however,  has not been what government has  made banks do. This program has been  run by the banks. It has not been run  by the government. It has been run by  the banks. Every horror story about a  homeowner’s  being  abused  is  being  abused by a bank, the bank handling  the mortgage, not by the Department  of the Treasury, not by the Federal  Government.  So, of course, when they come to see  a Republican Member of Congress, the  Republican Member of Congress says,  ‘‘Oh, isn’t it terrible what the Federal  Government made that poor bank do to  you.’’ No,  the Federal Government  didn’t make the banks do that.  My criticism of this program and my  criticism of the Obama administration  in how they have run this program is  not that they’ve made banks do what  they’ve done, but they have let banks  do what they’ve done. This program  can work if there are some tough rules  that are really enforced, tough on the  banks.  The gentleman from Massachusetts  mentioned earlier the bankruptcy proposal 3 years ago. I introduced that  bill. I have been trying to put rules, requirements, on the banks that they let  people out, that they try to begin to  let people out in a very orderly, logical, fair way, through judges, through  a judicial process, to begin to get control of the collapse of the housing market.  Something has got to happen to stop  the continuing fall of housing values.  Something has got to happen to end  the cycle of  foreclosures and diminished home  values  and more  foreclosures.  Republicans  have  offered  nothing to do that. We know something can work. We know that we can  design a program that will work, because it has been done before.  In the New Deal, one of the most successful programs in the New Deal was  the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation  which  bought mortgages, modified  them, worked with homeowners, tailored the mortgages to something the  homeowner could buy for those homeowners who really could afford a house,  the house that they were in but not the  mortgage that they had, and most historians say that program saved the  housing market in the Great Depression and saved the middle class.  We have got  to make  something  work. There are rules on the horizon.  There is now a pending settlement negotiation for the violations of law by  the banks  in how  they’ve managed  mortgages. It is with States attorneys  general and it is with the Federal regulatory agencies. Some on the Republican side have publicly pressured the  Federal agencies to lay off the banks. I  really cannot tell much difference between what they are doing in the pressure they are putting on banks and the  regulatory agents  in an enforcement  matter and what happened a generation ago with the Keating Five. But  they’re doing it. They’re saying, ‘‘Lay  off our buddies the banks. Don’t come  down too hard on them.’’ But there is a  real possibility the result of that settlement will be some tough rules, and  there  is now rule-making authority.  There is now a cop on the block. The  CFPB has  the authority  to develop  rules for banks in how they manage  mortgages.  But something has to work. This has  not been working. It can be fixed. It  has to be fixed. Something has to work.  ",2011

Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 493,  the small business jobs bill. The Senate  will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow  for weekly caucus meetings. Rollcall  votes in relation to amendments to the  small business  jobs bill are possible  today. Senators will be notified when  votes are scheduled.  We have 10 amendments now pending.  I spoke yesterday afternoon to the Republican leader, and I think we are in  good shape now to hopefully resolve  the 1099 matter this afternoon. We are  looking forward to having a consent  agreement we can vote on. I think we  are at a point where, in the morning,  we can vote on the McConnell amendment dealing with EPA and a couple  other amendments relating to EPA to  get rid of that issue one way or the  other.  There are other matters with the bill  we would like to set up votes on, and if  people are willing to allow us to do  that, we could do some of those this  afternoon. But we are making progress  on this very important bill. With all  the  amendments  being  offered, we  sometimes lose sight of the fact that  this bill, which has been led by Senators LANDRIEU and SNOWE, is an extremely  important bill  for  creating  jobs with small businesses. It is an innovation bill, and the programs this  bill covers have done some tremendously important things for the country.  With the CR, I spoke with the White  House this morning, and there are conversations going on with the White  House and the Republican leadership in  the House, and I think this matter,  with a little bit of good fortune, could  move down the road in the next day or  two to get us to a point where we could  have something done so there doesn’t  have to be a government shutdown.

This  legislation  would  amend the Workforce Investment Act  of 1998 to establish an industry or sector partnership grant program administered by the Department of Labor.  The SECTORS Act provides grants to  industry  clusters—interrelated  group  of businesses, service providers, and associated institutions—in order to establish and expand sector partnerships.

A sector approach  is beneficial because  it  can  focus on the dual goals of promoting  the  long-term competitiveness of  industries  and  advancing  employment  opportunities for workers, thereby encouraging economic growth. Existing  sector partnerships have long been recognized as key strategic elements within some of the most successful economic  development  initiatives  throughout  the  country.  Unfortunately, current federal policy does not  provide  sufficient  support  for  these  critical ventures.  As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate  Task Force on Manufacturing, one of  my key goals is to ensure that manufacturers have access  to a  capable  workforce. Unfortunately, manufacturers across the country have raised significant concerns about whether the  next generation of workers  is being  trained to meet the needs of an increasingly high-tech workplace.  In fact, in my home State of Maine,  the manufacturing sector has shed an  alarming 26,200  jobs  in the past ten  years, or 1/3 of the State’s manufacturing employment. And since the beginning of 1990, our state has lost 43,000  jobs. It is therefore critical that we as  a Nation provide unemployed manufacturing workers the training needed to  excel as our manufacturing sector becomes increasingly technical. This legislation provides a crucial link between  establishing worker training programs  and fostering new employment opportunities for those who have been affected by the manufacturing industry’s  decline. By promoting this innovative  partnership, we will take a crucial step  toward rejuvenating our economy.  Throughout the country, sector partnerships are being used to promote the  long-term  competitiveness  of  industries and to advance employment opportunities. For example, the State of  Maine has created the North Star Alliance  Initiative.  The  Alliance  has  brought together Maine’s boat builders,  the University  of Maine’s Advanced Engineered Wood Composites  Centers, Maine’s marine and composite  trade association, economic development groups, and investment organizations  for  the purpose of advancing  workforce training.  Our Nation’s capacity to innovate is  a key reason why our economy, despite  difficult times, remains the envy of the  world. Ideas by innovative Americans  across the spectrums of professions and  industries have paid enormous dividends, improving the lives of millions  throughout the world. We must continue to encourage all avenues for advancing our nation’s economic well-  being if America is to compete at the  vanguard of innovation. The SECTORS  Act will help align America’s workforce with the needs of our Nation’s  employers to promote a robust and  growing economy.

160,,112,0.425,100,2011-03-29,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, according to recent figures calculated by my Texas  colleague JOHNCULBERSON, an  illegal  immigrant apprehended by Border Patrol agents  during the last fiscal year had an eight in ten  chance of never being prosecuted.  Specifically,  in Fiscal Year 2010, nearly  450,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended  by  the Border Patrol. Of  this amount, only  about 73,000 were prosecuted,  roughly 16  percent. This means that 84 percent of illegal  immigrants  taken  into  custody were never  prosecuted!  And while the Obama administration claims  the border is more secure than ever, a recent  Government Accountability Office report found  that efforts by Border Patrol  to stop  illegal  crossings were ‘‘poor.’’ In fact, it is estimated  that  there are  three successful  illegal crossings for every one thwarted. That means more  than a million illegal immigrants enter the U.S.  each year.  The border is never going to be secure until  we enforce all of our  immigration  laws and  turn off the jobs magnet that encourages illegal immigration. Allowing millions to evade our  laws is unfair and hurts American workers and  taxpayers.  RECOGNIZING MARCH AS  NATIONAL KIDNEY MONTH  HON.

163,,112,0.518,12,2011-04-07,Mr. CANTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to inform our colleagues that the  House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business tomorrow. As the Members know,  this is a change from the original calendar.  Due  to  ongoing negotiations, Mr.  Speaker, surrounding continued appropriations  for the remainder of  fiscal  year 2011, I believe it is both appropriate and necessary for this House to  be in session tomorrow. I expect legislative business to include, but may not  be limited to, H.J. Res. 37, a resolution  of disapproval regarding the FCC’s recent Internet and broadband industry  practices regulation ruling.  Votes are possible at any time after  noon tomorrow. At this point, it is too  early to tell whether the House will  need to be in session this weekend. In  the case of  lapse  in appropriations,  however, I fully expect the House to  meet.  Mr. Speaker, we will not leave town  until we have fulfilled our obligation  to cut spending, to begin getting our  fiscal house in order, and to keep the  government  functioning.  Therefore,  Members should keep their schedules  for this weekend as flexible as possible.  ",2011

We are on  the sixth continuing  resolution  in as many  months for the current fiscal year. It’s time to  get the job done, and thankfully negotiations  are underway. Yet the bill we are considering  today undercuts that effort and the sincerity of  the majority to avoid a shutdown. This bill perpetuates the ‘‘my way or the highway’’ philosophy of House Republicans. It continues their  blind assault on vital services to constituents  in every community in America like education,  public safety, clean water and Social Security.  Further exposing their lack of sincerity, this bill  just puts  the hard decisions off  for another  week. Shutting down the government is not a  victory but a defeat for us, the American people and the democratic process. That’s why I  cannot be an enabler for a reckless, meat axe  approach to funding public services. Let’s reject  this short-term approach  in  favor of a  more responsible bill. We owe my constituents  and the citizens we all serve no less. Let’s do  our jobs.  ",2011
166,House,112,0.284,89,2011-04-07,Mr. WOLF.," Madam Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1363,  the Department of Defense  and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of  2011.  I am voting today for H.R. 1363 because I  do not support a government shutdown. H.R.  1363 will keep the government open. I am voting to ensure that federal employees are not  pawns  in a game of  ‘‘shut-down chicken.’’  I  am voting to ensure that FBI agents continue  on the job. I am voting to ensure that DEA  agents, ATF agents, U.S. Marshals, Border  Patrol Agents, and CIA agents, are on the job.  I am voting to ensure that tax returns filed by  mail and loans to small businesses continue to  be processed. I am voting to ensure that NIH  research and clinical trials continue. I am voting to ensure that veterans will be able to receive walk-in services at clinics. I am voting to  ensure  that  the government honors signed  contracts. I am voting to ensure that federal  employees, who are all essential, are able to  continue to do the work they do, day in and  day out, to keep our nation running.  I am also voting for H.R. 1363 because it  funds the Department of Defense for the rest  of the fiscal year. This bill provides economic  certainty to our troops and their families at a  time when they are sacrificing so much to support our military operations around the world.  We also need to provide that economic certainty to the entire federal workforce and the  American people who expect us to be on the  job working for them. We need to reach an  agreement on a spending plan for the remaining five and a half months of this fiscal year  and get on with the business of producing a  budget for FY 2012 with a resolve to continue  to take steps to reverse our nation’s mounting  debt and deficit spending.  I am voting for H.R. 1363 because it cuts  $12 billion  in discretionary spending  in one  week. Twelve billion dollars. This may well be  the  largest one week discretionary spending  cut ever passed  through  the House. The  measure before us today is another responsible step  in  the right direction until a  long  term agreement is reached.  The House has acted. Again and again,  House Republicans have voted  to keep  the  government open by  supporting  continuing  resolutions until a  long-term solution  for  the  rest of the fiscal year is reached. We are continuing to work to find a solution to the unfinished business  left by  the  leadership of  the  previous Congress. Passing H.R. 1363 will enable us to move forward on the fiscal oversight needed to ensure long term, fiscal solvency.  I am voting ‘‘yes’’ today because this measure continues our efforts  to  tackle  the debt  while keeping the government open.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, if the  majority were genuinely interested in avoiding  a government shutdown, they would bring a  clean, one week CR to the floor to give the  current negotiations time to reach a successful  conclusion. But  that’s not what we’re being  asked to vote on today.  Instead, in the most cynical demonstration  of bad faith, today’s legislation combines funding  for our  troops—which every Member of  this House supports, and which a clean CR  would provide—with  controversial  cuts and  ideologically extreme poison pills that the majority knows the nation doesn’t want and the  Senate and the President will not support.  As a result, in this moment of truth, the majority is deliberately choosing to dive headlong  into a government shutdown in order to pander  to  its Tea Party base while  the rest of  America  yearns  for honorable  compromise  and adult leadership.  As Ranking Member of  the Budget Committee, and someone who actually supported  the last two CRs, I am willing to work in good  faith with Members on both sides of the aisle  to break  the current  impasse. But  I will not  participate in this kind of eleventh hour partisan gamesmanship when our federal government’s operations are at stake.  ",2011
167,House,112,0.606,96,2011-04-07,Mr. FLORES.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize the Texas A&M University Women’s Basketball team on  their remarkable run in the 2011 NCAA  tournament  and  their  victory  over  Notre Dame to claim their first ever  national championship in school history.  I have the privilege to represent both  Baylor University and Texas A&M. I  don’t think there are many Members  here in this House who have the opportunity to represent two schools that  advanced to the Elite Eight of the  NCAA Women’s tournament. However,  I do, and one of them went all the way  and won the national championship.  Also, as a member of the Texas Aggie  Class of 1976, I am especially thrilled  that the final score was 76–70.  Coaches Gary Blair and Vic Schaefer  and their staff should be commended  for  their  leadership  in guiding  the  Texas Aggies to their sixth straight  NCAA tournament and to their first  ever national title. Let me add that  Danielle Adams, the Aggies’ all-American senior, scored 30 points, the second  highest  total  in  championship  game history.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand before my colleagues and say that there  is no other coach, no other team nor  any other fan base that deserves this  more  than Coach Blair,  the Texas  Aggie Women’s Basketball team, and  the loyal fans at Texas A&M University.

169,House,112,0.307,103,2011-04-07,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.," I  thank my friend and colleague from  the great State of New York, where our  congressional districts adjoin at that  New York-Pennsylvania border. I am  really proud to be with you on the floor  today to talk about this game changer,  as you referred to.  Mr. Speaker, we are facing critical  times—record debt, $14 trillion; skyrocketing gas prices,  in some places  over $4 a gallon and climbing; energy  dependence and addiction  to Middle  Eastern oil; and a volatile Middle East.  All  those  things  tie  together. And,  frankly, we’re here to talk about something that is a part of the solution on  how to get out from underneath each  one of those critical issues that is just  piling  on  this Nation,  the United  States of America, and that  is the  Marcellus shale natural gas. We are  proud to also have Marcellus shale underneath much of Pennsylvania. We  have New York and Pennsylvania, West  Virginia, parts of Ohio, parts of Virginia.  The Marcellus is just a tremendous  natural gas play. It’s something that  we have known has been there for a  very, very  long time, but the technology to access it is more of a recent  advent, and it is just so exciting. I’m  glad we are here to talk about all aspects of this tonight.  Over the  last month, the development of the Marcellus shale natural  gas play has been given national attention, in particular, a technical industry  term known as ‘‘hydraulic fracturing,’’  or ‘‘fracking,’’ a process utilized in oil  and gas production for almost a century and regulated now for decades. Oil  and gas workers have completed nearly  1 million fracking jobs nationally, safely and without adverse environmental  impact. Over the years, these technologies have been  refined and  improved for more efficient and environmentally safe use. In fact, Mr. Speaker,  I find that the rapid increase of technology as it comes from the natural  gas industry right now is just incredible. This is an industry that is literally very solid but is always looking  for that new opportunity on how to do  things even better.  Recently, the New York Times attempted to discredit the wealth and experience employed by the industry over  the years and the successful work of  government officials to properly regulate natural gas development. Through  half-truths  and,  frankly,  calculated  quote shopping, the New York Times  made unsubstantiated claims regarding  fracking and its impact on water quality and the environment. They repackaged old stories with sensational new  headlines, and they rehashed allegations against development of natural  resources vital for our country’s energy future.  Now  immediately  following  these  stories, the Pennsylvania Department  of Environmental Protection—which  has, frankly, jurisdiction over the drilling of natural gas  in the Keystone  State—responded, releasing tests that  show that water supplies downstream  of Marcellus shale gas drilling are safe.  This testing has addressed misinformation related to water quality in the  Commonwealth and validated with scientific data that municipal drinking  water is safe.  Mr. Speaker, each day in my district  there is news regarding the Marcellus  shale worthy of a national headline.  Through this resource and these technologies, 70 million homes and thousands of small businesses are paying  the lowest gas prices in years to heat  their homes. The lowest. Let me repeat  that. When you have gas prices, petroleum gas prices  that are at  record  highs, volatile highs for our vehicles,  natural gas prices at the same time are  at a record low. That’s where they have  a national headline. That is all because  of one thing. Natural gas in this country is largely domestically produced. It  is produced by American workers, and  it doesn’t have that volatility that you  see when you become reliant on countries such as in the Middle East.  Thousands of jobs are being created.  I have two counties in particular at the  epicenter. Actually, one of them adjoins your congressional district. The  lowest unemployment numbers probably in history, much lower than national  and State  averages. There’s  nothing better that you can do for a  person  than  create an  environment  that provides them a good-paying job,  and that is happening as a result of the  natural gas industry.  Each day, the local economy in my  district gets a little better, and every  moment the notion of an energy secure  America is easier to grasp. For me, I  define  ‘‘energy security’’ as shutting  off the pipeline from the Middle East.  I recognize that the largest amount  of our oil that we import is from Canada, and Canada is a good ally. I don’t  see any threats from Canadians other  than maybe when we get around to  hockey season between the teams. But  when it comes to the Middle East, I  think when we look at the volatility in  the Middle East today, in Egypt and  obviously Libya and Yemen, I mean,  we should end that addiction  immediately to Middle Eastern oil, and that  achieves energy security.  Now, when it comes to safety, there  can be no shortcuts, no loopholes, and  no exceptions, but sensationalism fails  to serve any good for anyone. Scare  tactics are dangerous when dealing  with such complicated and technical  matters as this. And that is what we  see with many of the headlines that we  articles written  have  been  reading,  with half-truths.  I am so very pleased that you are  hosting this hour today because we can  talk about facts and put the facts out  there. The same goes for dealing with  our Nation’s energy security. We need  to talk about facts. So I am pleased to  be with you, and I yield back at this  time.  ",2011

171,House,112,-0.426,110,2011-04-07,Mr. TONKO.," I thank you, Representative YARMUTH, and  thank you  for  leading the next 30 minutes of discussion here which I think are very critical  to  the  lives of Americans,  the  American public and American working families across our Nation.  It is an honor to serve with you on  our Budget Committee as we  spent  countless hours yesterday dealing with  a saga of a budget for 2012. Just as  we’re trying to avoid a shutdown of  America’s government this very hour,  they are also pushing through  in a  rather rushed format a 2012 fiscal plan  that takes the pain and suffering of the  2011 plan and expands it exponentially.  They grow it drastically, the pain for  2012.  As you indicated, these are choices  that we have before us. I believe firmly  that our budgets, whatever level—Federal, State, local—are a reflection of  our values, our principles, our priorities. That’s where we are now, whether  we are trying to avoid a shutdown for  the 2011 fiscal year which is looming  over us, or whether we are putting together the 2012 fiscal plan. It is about  priorities and values and principles  that we hold near and dear. It is also a  statement on an economic agenda.  I have before me here this chart that  speaks about the 1.8 million jobs that  have been added since last year, since  2010; 1.8 million private sector  jobs.  You can see the precipitous drop that  came with the red ink of the close of  the Bush recession. And then early in  2009, we began to recover. We stopped  the bleeding of the recession, and it has  been a slow but steady and upward and  forward climb as we have introduced  new jobs into the private sector arena  that allows us to now work away at  those 8.2 million jobs that were lost  during the Bush recession.  Why we would want to stop that  progress is beyond me; but those are  the cuts that will be made here in the  2011 scenario, by which we are attempting to avoid a shutdown, and the 2012  budget where there are cuts to R&D  and to science and technology.  I served as president and CEO of  NYSERDA, the New York State Energy  Research and Development Authority,  prior to coming here a couple of years  ago. I saw firsthand what science and  tech means in terms of job growth and  expanding the opportunities.  b1730  And so these cuts that are part of the  2011 plan and the 2012 budget that we’re  dealing with  in double-dose  fashion  will mean  tremendous pain  for our  middle class families.  We need to commit to a jobs agenda.  The people told Democrats and Republicans alike  in campaign season  it’s  about jobs, jobs, jobs, and the economy. It’s not about growing another  pricetag, draining our economy with  the cost of a shutdown. We need to  avoid that shutdown.  One of the concerns yesterday when  we were meeting on the 2012 budget format was—my concern, your concern,  our  concern as Democrats on  that  Budget Committee—to avoid the end of  Medicare. This plan, introduced by our  Republicans on the Budget Committee,  is called the ‘‘roadmap.’’ And I said it’s  a road to ruin for our middle class, for  our working families. They want to end  Medicare, a system that has worked for  over 40 years for 46 million Americans.  And what does it do? It shifts risk from  government over to the senior citizen.  It asks the senior citizen to dig deep  into the pocket, and then every year  dig deeper.  They are already suggesting that the  beneficiaries’ costs will more than double by the year 2022 and then more than  triple by the year 2030. Is this what  we’re about? Are these our values? Are  these our principles? Are these our priorities? I would say boldly, no, they are  not. They are not. And senior citizens  are already getting wind of this idea,  and they are supporting our efforts to  stop the end to Medicare, which is part  of the  format that they have  introduced, part of the legislation they have  introduced for their budget for 2012.  We failed in that attempt. You and I  supported it—GWENMOOREhas joined  us I see. We all supported that push to  end their desire to end Medicare. We  failed with it, and that will be coming  to a vote before the full House I think  next week.  So these are the things that people  need to be alerted to. These are the  issues that are going to be tough for  middle class America to assume for the  poor, the working poor, for the masses  out there. And when we see the concentration of wealth and all the benefits and all the focus being in just the  upper  echelon, we understand what  their choices are. Their choices are different than ours—they’re with Big Oil,  they’re with big banks, they’re with  special interests, they’re with millionaires, billionaires. They’re with handouts to the oil companies that are sitting on record profits of over $1 trillion. We’re there with the middle class  families, the working families, making  certain that we create jobs, retain jobs,  and keep this pattern of activity going.  Thank you, Representative YARMUTH,  for bringing us together  for what  I  think  is an urgent, urgent dialogue  that needs to reach every household in  America.  ",2011

187,Senate,112,-0.235,131,2011-04-07,Mr. BEGICH.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak about the Wyden-Coats-Begich  bipartisan Tax Fairness Simplification  Act. It is that time of the year again,  tax  time. Across our Nation,  small  businesses and families are struggling  to unravel the annual nightmare of paperwork required to file their taxes.  Across our Nation,  small businesses  and families are struggling. My wife  and I are small business owners so I especially understand how burdensome  and expensive the Tax Code and filing  process can be for folks at this time of  year.  This process  is costly and burdensome. The IRS estimates that Americans spend 6.1 billion hours each year  filling out tax forms and roughly $163  billion each year on tax compliance.  Small businesses are the engine and  the backbone of our still recovering  economy. We  should allow  them  to  spend more time doing what they do  best—creating  jobs and growing  the  economy—not filling out burdensome  paperwork. This is why I have joined  my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle, Senators WYDEN and COATS, to  introduce the bipartisan Tax Fairness  and Simplification Act.  Tax reform has been a long priority  of mine. I am happy to be moving forward on this important piece of legislation today. In a nutshell, our legislation simplifies the Tax Code and alleviates many of the burdensome paperwork and costly requirements that are  bogging down American families and  businesses. Our legislation will allow  most taxpayers to file their taxes using  a straightforward and shortened 1-page  1040 IRS form. This is an example of exactly what it would look like. Also individuals and families will be able to  request that the IRS prepare a tax return for them to review, modify, and  sign.  The Wyden-Coats-Begich bill reduces  the number of tax brackets for individuals from six to three: 15 percent, 25  percent, and 35 percent. It eliminates  the alternative minimum  tax which  forces millions of  taxpayers  to calculate their taxes twice and pay the  higher amount. In order to make capital investments more cost effective for  small  business  owners,  the Wyden-  Coats-Begich bill will allow 95 percent  of small businesses—those with gross  receipts of up to a million dollars—to  expense all equipment and inventory  costs in a single year. These changes  may seem simple and commonsense,  but they make a world of difference to  our middle-class  families and  small  businesses.  Let’s talk specifically about small  businesses for a second, people who are  keeping our economy going, such as  my friend John Brower from Anchorage. John owns and operates Alaska  Laser Printing  in Anchorage. John  works tirelessly, 365 days a year, and is  proud of the business he built. When  new technology  is developing  in the  printing business, it is always bringing  on needs for new equipment. This legislation would allow him to expense all  those equipment costs and would truly  make a world of difference for John  and save him thousands and thousands  of dollars in taxes.  I am here to speak  for the John  Browers and the other small businesses  all across Alaska and the country. My  view is very simple: Let’s quit giving  tax breaks to multimillion-dollar corporations. Let’s close  the corporate  loopholes and help  small businesses  such as John Brower’s.  Right now we are facing a $14.3 trillion deficit. We are hours away from a  potential government shutdown rather  than continuing on a path toward long-  term economic recovery.  Our new bill actually promotes economic growth because it allows businesses to spend more time growing and  less time worrying about the overly  burdensome tax system which we all  know only enables tax avoidance. As  all of us around here know, tax avoidance means outsourcing jobs overseas.  Instead,  our  legislation  incentivizes  and enables companies  to  invest  in  America  rather  than  incentivizing  them to invest overseas.  The legislation also promotes responsible  retirement  savings and  investments by expanding tax-free savings  opportunities.  The  American  Dream  Account,  whether it is for a new home, education  for your children, or health care, provides a unique opportunity to invest in  the American dream. Families and individuals alike can make contributions  to an account that functions much like  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:27 May 09, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S07AP1.REC S07AP1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

I cannot tell you how pleased I  am to still be a colleague of his, and I  look forward to many years of success  working together, reaching out, finding  the problems we have, addressing the  problems, and then, like a good Governor,  taking  them on and making  some good decisions, as he has done so  well in North Dakota.

191,Senate,112,0.529,159,2011-04-07,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President, I rise  as someone who lives in a State where  we balance our budget  every year,  where  the citizens of Wyoming and  families all across the State live within their means, balance their budgets.  They know what it means to have to  live within a budget. That is why our  State is one that currently today does  not have a deficit, does not have a  debt, a State where every year, by constitutional mandate, we balance our  budget. It is time for Washington to  take a lesson from Wyoming and balance  its  budget. This  irresponsible  spending must stop.  Here we are, a day  from when  it  looks as if we may be dealing with a  government shutdown, and I am ready  to vote. I am ready to vote for a bill  that already passed the House of Representatives early today. I am ready to  vote to keep the government open and  functioning, to make sure services are  there. The bill passed the House. People who have studied civics in school  realize that is how we make a law in  this country. It passes the House, the  Senate, goes  to  the President, who  signs it into law. The bill has already  passed the House. It is coming to the  Senate. I don’t know where other Senators are, but I am ready to vote.  I heard my colleague talk about a  shutdown and who was rooting for a  shutdown. It is no surprise to people  who may be watching at home that it  is  former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean who is  rooting  for a shutdown. The  former  chairman of the Democratic National  Committee says:  I think it would be the best thing in the  world to have a shutdown. He is the spokesman for the party of the other side of the  aisle. That may be what he wants. I don’t  want to do that. I want to vote for the bill  that passed the House. It is the only proposal  that is out there. I haven’t seen the Democrats offer anything. Even the New York  Times said of the President that he was ‘‘silent for too long.’’  We have heard our previous speaker  talk about the social issues. Let’s remember that it is convenient amnesia  for Democrats to talk about that specific issue because the President voted  for and signed into law spending bills  that  included  similar—actually  the  identical social issue in the past, the  one he is opposing today. So did 49 current  Senate Democrats. They  also  voted  for a spending bill that dealt  with that social issue. Why all of a sudden today it is different? I believe it  has to do with what the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee said:  I think it would be the best thing in the  world to have a shutdown.  Republicans are proposing solutions.  What do we see from the other side of  the aisle? We see the senior Senator  from New York saying, ‘‘I always use  the word ‘extreme.’’’ It doesn’t matter  what is proposed. He says, ‘‘I always  use the word  ‘extreme.’’’ There are  tape recordings of him saying this. He  then said, ‘‘That is what the caucus instructed me to use this week.’’ Regardless of how reasonable a proposal may  be,  regardless of  the  solutions  that  may be proposed,  ‘‘I always use the  word ‘extreme.’ That is what the caucus instructed me to use this week.’’  I travel back and forth to Wyoming  every weekend, visit with people and  sit around at different locations, sometimes  a morning  breakfast  group,  sometimes it is people at lunch, dinners, community meetings.  I ask them: How many of you believe  you have a life that is better than your  parents had?  Every hand goes up.  Then I ask: How many of you believe  your children will have a better life  than you have right now?  Very few hands go up. That is the  problem.  I ask them: What  is the concern?  Why do you believe you have a better  life than your parents did but your  children will not have as good a life as  you?  The answer they give is the debt, the  reckless  spending  in Washington—  reckless,  irresponsible, unsustainable.  Yet, when we want to go ahead today,  do cuts in spending, keep the military  going, deal with the issue at hand, keep  the government functioning so we can  come back and continue to work on the  debt and the spending, this body is not  ready to vote.  I am ready to vote. I am ready to  vote  for  the only proposal on  the  table—the one the Republicans in the  House of Representatives passed today.  That is real leadership. It is a plan. It  will work. It is what the American people are asking for.  I have people from Wyoming coming  to Washington all the time. They say:  We realize things are tough this year.  They come and explain a program that  is good for people in the community,  good for children, good for seniors—I  met with six or seven groups like that  today—good  for  students  in  school.  They say: We know that all of us are  going to have to deal with the realities  of the facts, that we can’t continue  with this unsustainable spending where  40 cents out of every dollar we spend is  borrowed,  significant  amounts  from  overseas. Our No. 1 lender is folks in  China.  I say:  Is that your concern?  That is absolutely the concern I hear  around the State of Wyoming.  They see that the President of China  comes over and tells America a few  weeks ago that he wants the Chinese  currency to be the currency of the future and the dollar to be the currency  of the past. That is because he knows  we have an addiction to spending, and  it must stop. That is what I hear from  people from Wyoming who come here  as well. They say: We need to make  sure we get the spending under control.  It seems reasonable to get back to  the level of 2008 spending. That is the  level many American families are living under. They balance their budgets.  It is time for Washington to do the  same.  I know the people in Wyoming. I have  visited with a number  through  the  week and in many communities last  weekend—in Worland,  Caspar,  Laramie. What they are saying is, get the  spending under control, and do it in a  reasonable manner. But for someone to  come from the other side of the aisle  and say he thinks the best thing in the  world to do is to have a shutdown and  for another person to say he always  uses the word ‘‘extreme’’ because that  is what his caucus instructed him to  use this week—that doesn’t solve the  problem. That doesn’t let us find a solution. There is a solution on the table  right now. It is a solution that has  been proposed. This Senate ought to be  voting on it tonight.  For the President to say he is going  to veto it shows that the President is  truly not engaged in this process. He  has been silent too long, according to  the New York Times. His budget that  he has proposed,  the Economist, a  world-renowned, respected publication,  called  ‘‘dishonest.’’ That  is not  the  kind of leadership we need. We need  someone in the White House fully engaged, taking an active role, and making sure we get back on a course that  is responsible, that allows us to live  within our means, as families know,  because we  have  to  stop  spending  money we do not have. Stop spending  money we do not have. That is the way  for Washington to behave in a responsible way, to make the difficult decisions necessary for the future of the  country, to focus on the issues that affect families and their needs. Families  who are trying to deal with kids and  bills and a mortgage know what  it  means to have to  live within their  means.  When we see policies coming out of  this administration that are ones making the pain at the pump even worse, as  families are noticing they are paying  $700 on average more for gasoline this  year than last year, that is money that  is not available for other bills or for a  mortgage or to help with their kids.  Those are the issues they are facing,  people  trying  to pay  for  their own  health  insurance,  realizing  the  increased cost of the insurance because  of the Obama health care  law that  passed way over the objections of the  American people, crammed down the  throats of the American people by the  other side of the aisle.  The American people are saying: This  is absolutely wrong. That  is why  I  think we saw last November the election results we did across the country.  That is why we see people continuing  to stand up and speak out across the  country. That is why people continue  to go to townhall meetings and share  their views about the problems happening in this country.

194,Senate,112,0.109,180,2011-04-07,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President. I rise  today to introduce two bills that would  lay a strong foundation to improve the  Federal acquisition system.  The first bill, the Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act of 2011, S. 761,  co-sponsored by Senators AKAKA and  MCCASKILL, would create a Federal acquisition management fellows program  to develop a new generation of acquisition leaders with government-wide perspective, skills, and experience.  The second bill, the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act of 2011,  S.  762,  co-sponsored  by  Senators  AKAKA, MCCASKILLand BROWNof Massachusetts, would provide much-needed  organizational clarity  to enable  the  Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to  fulfill its mission of facilitating career  development and better management  of the federal acquisition workforce.  The Federal acquisition  system  is  under tremendous stress. Between fiscal years  2000 and  2010, acquisition  spending by the federal government expanded by 163 percent, from $205 billion  to $535 billion. The necessary costs of  military operations, natural disasters,  homeland  security  precautions,  and  other vital programs will continue to  strain the acquisition system in the  years ahead.  This  unprecedented  level  of  purchasing creates abundant opportunities  for fraud, waste, and abuse. We have  seen far too many outrageous failures  in government contracting. The Secure  Border Initiative Network, the Census  Bureau’s handheld computers for the  2010 Census, and  the Marine Presidential Helicopter programs are among  recent, notorious and costly acquisition failures, which we can ill afford.  These  and  other  failures  demand  strong steps to protect taxpayer dollars and deliver better acquisition outcomes.  As a long-time advocate for stronger  competition, accountability, and transparency in government contracting, I  recognize the actions the Administration has taken recently to improve federal contracting. Many of these initiatives originated from legislation I co-  authored with Senator LIEBERMANduring the 110th Congress.  But, no matter how many laws we  pass  or  guidance  documents  OMB  issues, the effectiveness of our Federal  acquisition system ultimately depends  on a vital human component—the acquisition workforce.  While contract  spending has  risen  dramatically, the number of acquisition  professionals  who  help  plan,  award, and oversee these contracts has  been stagnant. And with roughly half  of the current acquisition workforce eligible to retire by 2018, the difficulties  of strengthening that workforce are becoming  increasingly  acute. A well-  trained and adequately sized acquisition workforce is critical to managing  and overseeing  federal  spending and  the increasingly complex procurements  of services and goods.  The two pieces of legislation I am introducing today are designed to address these important long-term goals.  The Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act would create a centrally  managed, Government-wide Acquisition Management Fellows Program  that combines both a Master’s degree-  level academic curriculum and on-the-  job training in multiple federal agencies. By partnering with leading universities that have specialized government acquisition programs, the government can attract top-caliber students  and retain our best government employees who are interested in pursuing  both academic advancement and public  service.  Compared  to  the  several existing,  agency-specific  intern programs, this  government-wide program would provide a much-needed skill set that we  currently do not have  in  sufficient  number;  that  is, acquisition professionals with multi-agency and multi-  disciplinary training who can understand and manage government-wide acquisition needs and perspectives.  Considering that interagency acquisition now accounts for approximately 40  percent of the Federal Government’s  entire contract spending, and that GAO  has  designated  the management  of  interagency  contracting  a  high-risk  area since 2005, it is evident that we  need to develop future acquisition leaders who understand government-wide  needs and perspectives and are able to  operate effectively outside of the traditional, single-agency environment.  Specifically, the Acquisition Management Fellows Program would include  one academic year of  full-time, on-  campus training followed by 2 years of  on-the-job and part-time training toward a Masters or equivalent graduate  degree  in related  fields; and a curriculum that would include rotational  assignments at three or more executive  agencies covering, among other issues,  acquisition planning, cost-estimating,  formation and post-award administration of ‘‘high risk’’ contract types, and  interagency contracts.  Upon graduation, participants will  have completed all required, non-agency-specific training courses necessary  for a basic contracting officer warrant.  In addition, participants would be required to enter into a service commitment to ensure the Federal Government receives a proper return on its investment. The  service  commitment  would be no less than 1 year for each  year a participant is in the program,  and would require reimbursement of  funds for those who do not successfully  complete the program or do not fulfill  the minimum service requirements.  Our second bill, the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act, would  strengthen the Federal Acquisition Institute, FAI, whose key responsibilities  are to promote career development and  strategic human capital management  for  the  entire  civilian  acquisition  workforce.  The FAI has remained largely underutilized due to a lack of organizational  clarity, the disproportionate  funding  compared to its counterpart in the Department of Defense, and its intermittent use by a few Federal agencies.  The proposed legislation would establish a clear line of responsibility and  accountability for the Institute by requiring that FAI, through its Board of  Directors, report directly to the Office  of Federal Procurement Policy, OFPP;  the director of FAI be appointed by the  OFPP Administrator, and report directly to the OFPP Associate Administrator for Acquisition Workforce; all  existing civilian agency training programs  follow  guidelines  issued  by  OFPP, which would ensure consistent  training  standards necessary  to develop uniform core competencies; and  the OFPP Administrator report annually to Congressional committees of jurisdiction projected FAI budget needs  and expense plans to fulfill its statutory mandate.  With respect to its core government-  wide functions, FAI would be required  to provide and keep current government-wide training standards and certification requirements  including ensuring effective agency  implementation of government-wide training and  certification standards; analyzing the  curriculum to ascertain if all certification competencies are covered, or if  adjustments are necessary; developing  career-path  information  for certified  professionals to encourage retention in  government  positions;  and  coordinating with the Office of Personnel  Management for human capital efforts.  The administration has identified acquisition workforce development as a  pillar for improving acquisition practices and contract performance. While  I fully agree with this goal, we need  specific and concrete action to solve  this problem.  Our  legislation would prompt  the  sustained effort necessary to rebuild  the acquisition workforce. While this  will take time and investment, I am  confident  this  is a wise  investment  that will yield  substantial  returns.  Just  think about  it:  if our better-  trained acquisition professionals can  prevent one failed procurement, it can  save the taxpayer hundreds of millions  of dollars. If they can avoid overpaying  one percent of our contract spending, it  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:27 May 09, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S07AP1.REC S07AP1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

Walt Disney,  Thomas Hart Benton, Robert Rauschenberg  and Robert Morris have all been associated  with the Institute. Two of Kansas City’s most  well known businessmen, J.C. Nichols and  William T. Kemper, Jr., served on the Board of  Trustees. Today, the Kansas City Art Institute  is an  integral part of  the cultural growth of  Kansas City and continues to sustain the support of the community.

200,House,112,0.616,8,2011-04-15,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," I appreciate the  chairman for yielding to me, and I appreciate the opportunity to stand and  speak against the Progressive Caucus  budget because it is a budget that, once  again, will spend too much money.  Mr. Chairman, one of the things that  we have heard from the American people is this: they are tired of the Federal  Government spending taxpayer money  for  programs  they  don’t want  and  spending money that they don’t have.  And it is time for us to put this fiscal  house in order.  Now, quite  frankly,  I  think  that  today is a really great day. When we  get to the end of this legislative day  and the end of this legislative week, we  will have passed  the Ryan budget,  which turns an enormous corner  for  our Nation. Over the next 10 years, it  will reduce spending not by millions  and billions, but by trillions—$6.2 trillion over the next 10 years.  Those are the kinds of  first steps  that the American people are wanting  to see. That’s the kind of fiscal responsibility that the American people are  holding us accountable for: controlling  spending, limiting spending, and making certain that there is a stable and  secure environment in which economic  growth and job creation can take place.  They have spoken loudly and clearly.  And they have said reduce what you  are spending, get your fiscal house in  order, begin to focus not on the next 6  weeks or 6 months but the next 60  years, and focus on our children and  our grandchildren, making certain that  we are not tapping their futures and  trading it to the nations that hold our  debt. I think that  it’s so  important  that we begin to arrest this and get it  under control and to pass the Ryan  budget today.  ",2011
201,House,112,-0.599,8,2011-04-15,Mr. GRIJALVA.," I yield 15 seconds to  the distinguished cochair of the Progressive Caucus, the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON).  ",2011
202,House,112,0.75,8,2011-04-15,Mr. MULVANEY.," I thank Mr. ROKITA  for the time.  I want to applaud my colleagues in  the Progressive Caucus for doing something which I think is intellectually  honest. In fact, I think if you look at a  couple of budgets that we’re going to  be looking at over the next 2 days, the  budget that the Budget Committee has  offered, I think is a fair and honest representation of where the Republican  Party is. The Republican Study Committee budget that we’ll see in just a  few minutes is a fair and honest representation of where the Republican  Study Committee  stands. And  this  budget, I think, is offered as a true and  honest position, a policy statement, of  where the progressives in this body and  in this country stand. And for that I  thank them.  That being said, it’s hard to imagine  a document that is more different from  our document. There are $16 trillion  worth of tax increases in this document. To the extent that the progressives do stand and are honest in their  belief that taxing and spending is the  way to fix the Nation, this document  certainly does contain that.  All of the 2001, 2003 tax cuts, which  we affectionately refer to around here  as the Bush tax cuts, are gone, not just  the ones on the highest income earners, everybody. This is a tax increase  on almost everybody. In fact, it is a tax  increase on everybody in the entire Nation. The top marginal rates under this  proposal go from 45 percent up to 49  percent. The capital gains rate goes up  to as high as 49 percent.  We introduced a new concept in this  budget, apparently,  the progressives  do, that takes the estate tax to a progressive model, where you get estate  tax rates that range from 45 percent up  to 65 percent. We heard a few minutes  ago, my colleague, Mr. LANKFORD, talk  about the fact that there’s a 25-cent  gas tax increase in this particular document.  This is an avalanche of new taxes. At  every single turn, the motivation behind the progressives seems to be that  the government needs more money,  that  the  government  needs more  money and it is our obligation to give  it to the government. And we simply,  wholeheartedly, dismiss that idea.  But, again, I think it is nice for a  change to have honest and open debate  on an intellectual basis in this Chamber. I thank the progressives  for at  least laying out where they stand. And  I  think  it’s a good process  to go  through. I think we’ll have a chance  later on today in just a few minutes to  see where we stand as a Nation, at  least as a body, here on these types of  changes.  I very much hope that this amendment is defeated. I think that the Republican  Budget  Committee  alternative is a better course of action. And  I would like to see this amendment defeated.  ",2011
203,House,112,0.688,22,2011-04-15,Mr. GARRETT.," Mr. Chairman, at  this time I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. FLAKE), who  realizes that the young people would do  best if we not put additional tax burdens of over $40,000 or $50,000 on their  birth coming into this country by the  actions of not living responsibly.  ",2011
204,House,112,0.855,22,2011-04-15,Mr. FLAKE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  I rise in support of the RSC budget.  With a deficit of $1.6 trillion, a debt of  $14 trillion, it’s no surprise that we’ve  got to do something. We have to do  something dramatic. This budget actually balances over a 9-year period, and  it reforms the programs that are important to many Americans, to make  them  solvent  and  sustainable  over  time.  The proposals from the other side of  the aisle simply don’t do that. They ignore the time bomb that we have in  these programs. So I commend the RSC  staff and Members for putting this together. This is a good budget. We ought  to support it to put our Nation on a  path of financial stability and security.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman,  the time bomb that’s ticking is the  time bomb on the Medicare guarantee.  With that, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. WAXMAN), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.  ",2011
205,House,112,0.737,22,2011-04-15,Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina.," Mr.  Chairman, folks, no prepared remarks,  no fancy speeches. I brought with me a  financial calculator. And regardless of  how you calculate the numbers, America is spending too much money.  You know, for 3 years in a row we  spent over a trillion dollars more than  we were bringing in as a Nation. We are  over $14 trillion in debt. This budget  puts us on a very clear path to paying  back the national debt, to reducing and  ending deficits in a very timely manner, to protecting the future for our  children and our grandchildren, our  most precious resource as Americans.  I urge my colleagues to get behind  this budget, vote for it, and let’s put  the American  spending  in  priority.  Let’s stop the spending insanity here  in Washington, D.C., and let’s do what  we tell the folks back home we are  going to do, and let’s get our fiscal  house in order.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. We can get our  fiscal house in order and do this in a  balanced way without ending the Medicare guarantee.  With that, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  ISRAEL).  ",2011
206,House,112,-0.334,22,2011-04-15,Mr. ISRAEL.," I thank my friend from  Maryland for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, every budget is about  the bottom line, and here is the Ryan  budget bottom line: If you are making  over  a million  dollars,  you  get  a  $100,000 tax cut. If you are a senior on  Medicare, you get an extra $12,000 medical bill. If you make over a million  dollars, you win the lottery. If you are  a senior citizen, you lose your Medicare.  Mr. Chairman, they say this is about  balancing the budget, but they are trying to balance the budget by giving tax  cuts to people earning over a million  dollars and taking Medicare away from  our seniors. That is no way to balance  the budget.  ",2011

Listening to the President’s speech yesterday, and to my colleagues on the floor today,  I’m convinced that this debate is about no less  than the values we hold as Americans. As the  President said, the Republican budget is less  about  reducing  the deficit  than  it  is about  changing the basic social compact in America.  Do we want to live in an America where opportunity is snatched away from young people  who want an education, or one where any student who works hard enough can find a way  to succeed?  Do we want to live in an America where our  seniors can retire with dignity after a lifetime of  hard work, or one where the elderly must ask  their children for the spare room they might  not even have to give?

I am happy  to announce  that Nathan Kruse, of Ottawa, Ohio has been  offered an appointment  to attend  the United  States  Air  Force  Academy  in  Colorado  Springs, Colorado.  Nathan brings an enormous amount of leadership, service and dedication to the incoming  class of Air Force cadets. While a gifted athlete, having earned varsity and junior varsity  letters in football and track, Nathan has also  maintained  the highest standards of excellence  in his academics. He attained a 4.0  GPA at Ottawa-Glandorf High School and is a  member of and president of  the National  Honor Society. Nathan also participated in the  German Club,  Academic Quiz  Bowl  and  Science Olympiad.  Outside the classroom, Nathan is an Eagle  Scout, Junior Optimist Club member and has  volunteered  for numerous  tutoring opportunities. Nathan’s dedication and service  to his  community and his peers has proven his ability to excel among the leaders at the Air Force  Academy.  I have no doubt  that Nathan will  take the lessons of his student leadership with  him to Colorado Springs.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating Nathan Kruse on his acceptance of appointment to the United States Air  Force Academy where he will gain a world-  class education and receive invaluable leadership experience. I am positive that Nathan will  excel during his career at the Air Force Academy, and I ask my colleagues to join me in  extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to the nation.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE PERSONALIZE YOUR CARE ACT OF 2011  HON. EARL BLUMENAUER  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 15, 2011  ",2011
211,,112,-0.428,71,2011-04-15,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  am proud  to  introduce  the Personalize Your  Care Act of 2011.  Advances in healthcare have led to increasingly complex health care decisions and more  treatment options  than we have ever before  had the benefit—or the burden—of choosing  between. Both Democrats and Republicans  agree that individuals should be fully involved  in decisions related to their own health care  and should be able  to make  informed decisions about  that care reflecting  their values  and  their needs. We also agree  that when  people have expressed their wishes, particularly in a formal and legally binding manner,  those wishes should be known and respected.  While  there  is widespread agreement  regarding these principles, too often this is not  the reality. Most adults have not completed an  advance directive;  if documents are  completed, they are not regularly revisited and can  be difficult to locate. Because these issues are  difficult to discuss, surrogates often feel ill-prepared  to  interpret  their  loved ones’ written  wishes.  These shortcomings can leave families and  healthcare proxies  faced with  the burden of  determining  their  loved ones’ wishes  in  the  midst of crisis, sometimes with little or no information about how best to direct care. This  adds not only stress and anxiety to an already  difficult situation, but studies show that lack of  advance care planning actually prolongs  the  grieving process after losing a loved one.  One of  the greatest misconceptions about  advance care planning is that it is a one-time  event. Attempting to plan for all possibilities in  a single document or within a single conversation is overwhelming and, quite likely, impossible. Where possible, this should be an ongoing conversation. Careful, early advance care  planning is important because a person’s ability to make decisions may diminish over time  and he or she may suddenly lose the capability to participate in his or her health care decisions.  Successful advance care planning  is  less  about legal documentation and more about facilitating ongoing communication about future  care wishes among  individuals,  their health  care providers, and surrogates. This approach  recognizes that advance care documents like  advance directives are not the ‘‘ends,’’ but the  ‘‘means’’—they are the tools for documenting  care preferences based on informed decisions  that  incorporate an  individual’s values, personal goals, and current circumstances.  This process not only provides higher quality care, but personalized care.  The Personalize Your Care Act aims to support advance care planning by providing Medicare andMedicaid coverage for voluntary consultations about advance care planning every  5 years or in the event of a change in health  status. This periodic revisiting of advance care  documents and goals of care recognizes that  an  individual’s preferences can change over  time. It also recognizes that the advance care  plan should be updated if an individual develops a serious or chronic illness, if additional  curative and palliative  treatment options become available, and to consistently reflect the  individual’s current circumstances and preferences.  Honoring  the expressed wishes of  individuals must also be a priority. For this to occur,  advance care planning documents must be  accessible wherever care is provided. The legislation ensures that an individual’s electronic  health record is able to display his or her current advance directive and/or physician orders  for life sustaining treatment (POLST), so that  his or her wishes are easily accessible and respected. Furthermore, under  the  legislation,  advance directives would be portable, ensuring that advance directives completed in one  the  state are honored  in another state,  in  event care needed to be provided there.  The  legislation  also  provides  grants  to  states to establish or expand physician orders  for life sustaining treatment programs. These  programs have a track record of promoting patient autonomy through documenting and coordinating a person’s  treatment preferences,  clarifying treatment intentions and minimizing  confusion, reducing repetitive activities in complying with the Patient Self Determination Act,  and facilitating appropriate treatment by emergency personnel.  These  investments  in advance care planning will reinforce patient-centered care—engaging  individuals  in planning and decision-  making about their future care and ensuring  that  those preferences are documented, accessible, and can be honored in any state and  in any care setting.  I am proud  to  introduce  the Personalize  Your Care Act with the support of patient advocates, physicians, nurses, and  the  faith  community who see every day how advance  care planning improves individuals’ and families’ peace of mind and  the quality of  their  care.  f  TERRORIST ATTACKS ON ISRAELIS  MARK NEW ESCALATION  HON.

212,,112,-0.599,78,2011-04-15,Mr. GRIJALVA.," Mr. Speaker, I am honored  to recognize former United States Army Combat Medic and current University of Arizona  student Matt Randle.  Over the course of his career in the Army,  Matt received two Army Commendation Medals, three Army Achievement Medals and two  Good Conduct Medals for his service.  Following his distinguished service  to our  country Matt returned to his hometown of Tucson, Arizona and enrolled at the University of  Arizona. Once on the UA campus, Matt began  working with UA President Robert Shelton and  his staff to develop and implement a program  to support  returning veterans attending  the  University. I am proud to say that today the  University of Arizona, located in my Congressional district, has one of the most progressive  and impressive veteran education and service  models in the country including a student run  veteran’s office.  Matt’s leadership has also played an integral role in the prosperity of the UA Veterans  club. This club received numerous awards on  the University of Arizona’s campus  including  the Club of the Year and Philanthropic Group  of  the Year  for  the 2009–2010 academic  school year. The Student Veterans of America  also recognized the club nationally, awarding it  the ‘‘Club of the Year Award.’’  This year Matt will receive the UA’s 2011  Robie Award. The award is issued to students  who show personal  integrity,  initiative, cooperativeness, enthusiasm, humility, patriotism,  well-rounded  interests, active participation  in  student affairs and a commitment to service.  Matt Randle  is a model candidate  for  this  award.  Matt Randle’s ambition and leadership both  at the UA and nationally will certainly be of  great benefit to our returning veterans. Every  day more veterans return home from the Middle East conflicts. The programs that Matt built  on the University of Arizona campus support  these men and women as they transition back  to civilian life.  Upon graduation Matt will be attending the  University Of Arizona Rogers College of Law  in the fall of 2011.  I am pleased to acknowledge my constituent  and friend, Matt Randle. I thank him for his  leadership, service and outstanding contributions to the University and our community.  f  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND  FULL-YEAR CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2011  SPEECHOF  HON.

213,,112,0.392,78,2011-04-15,Ms. GRANGER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  this Continuing Resolution. We must  pass this bill today to begin to get this Nation  on a path of fiscal stability. I want to make a  few brief remarks about the State-Foreign Operations  title of  the bill. State-Foreign Operations is reduced by 8.4 billion dollars from the  fiscal year 2011 request. While some of my  colleagues might  say  these  funding  levels  mean that diplomacy and development take a  large reduction, we need to keep in mind that  the State-Foreign Operations  bill  grew  by  more than 33% from FY08 to FY10. We simply cannot allow these programs to continue to  grow at this rate. The reductions taken in this  bill are  targeted, so  that we can remain  focused on our highest national security priorities. The bill provides critical  funds  for  the  frontline States of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. It supports security assistance to some  of our strongest allies—like  Israel, Jordan,  Mexico, and Colombia. It also addresses unexpected  humanitarian  crises  around  the  world. I want to thank my colleague, Ranking  Member Lowey,  for working with me  to address these high priority needs. I know we will  continue to work together to address problems  of bipartisan concern.  f  IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF ASHTON GENZMAN ON HER OFFER  OF APPOINTMENT  TO ATTEND  THE  UNITED  STATES  NAVAL  ACADEMY  HON.

214,,112,-0.349,85,2011-04-15,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with great  honor that I rise today and ask Congress to  recognize May 20th as TELACU Scholars  Day.  The TELACU Education Foundation was established  in 1983  to  respond  to crisis-level  dropout  rates  for Latino Students and has  since grown  into  the  largest community and  economic  development  corporation  in  the  United States. TELACU is a pioneering institution committed to service, empowerment, advancement and the creation of self-sufficiency  within the Latino community.  To  address  the  distinct  struggles many  Latino youth  face, TELACU established  the  LINC TELACU Education Foundation (LTEF).  For upwards of  two decades,  the Education  Foundation has been working towards removing the formidable barriers that could prevent  Latino youth from achieving academic success  and providing them with professional and academic role models. I am proud of the way the  LINC TELACU Education Foundation has contributed  to  the development of our  future  Latino leaders.  The TELACU Education Foundation realized  that there is no more vital asset in any community than its human capital and began their  efforts to reverse these trends. For instance,  The LINC TELACU Scholarship Program is an  exemplary program that helps students realize  their dream of a college education by providing scholarships and supplemental support.  Although TELACU understands  that  financial assistance is a vital component for college  students  to achieve academic success,  they  also  recognize  the  underlying  challenges  many  young  adults  face  including  socioeconomic  factors,  family responsibilities, cultural identity, and financial solvency. Students  who are the first member of their families to  pursue a college degree often must make their  own academic support system  in order  to  achieve  their dreams. TELACU understands  these challenges.  The LINC TELACU Scholarship Program  provides its youth not only with monetary assistance, but with  the counseling,  leadership  training, and  time management  training necessary to help students achieve their dreams.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  today to honor TELACU, the LINC TELACU  Education Foundation and for Scholarship programs like this one, for believing in the dream  of higher education for all of America’s next  generation of leaders. I extend my congratulations to the TELACU scholars and the people  who make their dreams a reality as they celebrate  the 28th Annual TELACU Education  Foundation Scholarship Awards Dinner, Building the Dream, on Friday May 20th, 2011.  f  ARMENIA REMEMBRANCE DAY  HON.

215,,112,0.69,85,2011-04-15,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Speaker, on April 24,  2011, the world will commemorate Armenian  Remembrance Day and remember  the one-  and-a-half million Armenians that endured unspeakable suffering and loss at the hand of  the Ottoman Empire during World War I.  In addition to the loss of so many Armenian  lives, the twentieth century also bore witness  to the loss of six-million Jews and four-hundred  thousand other persons deemed  ‘‘non-  desirable’’ by the Nazis, the loss of millions of  lives in Russia and in China by communist tyrannies, and modern day horrors in Cambodia,  Rwanda, and Darfur. All too often, we have  not learned from past genocides. As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states ‘‘No  one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel,  inhuman or degrading  treatment or punishment’’ and that ‘‘Everyone has the right to life,  liberty and security of person.’’  Though nothing changes the fact that mass  killings and unspeakable acts of brutality occurred, today I wish to learn from the past to  better bring about hope for a brighter, more  peaceful future and reconciliation of the people of Armenia and Turkey.  Only with a thorough examination of history  and open acknowledgement of  the past will  fully underthe Armenians be  the plight of  stood.  As we continue confronting atrocities taking  place today, and seek to prevent them from  occurring in the future, we must also be resolute in acknowledging genocides of the past.  f  A TRIBUTE TO SARAH SAVAGE  RAYMOND  HON.

216,,112,-0.519,85,2011-04-15,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  recognize Sarah Savage Raymond.  Sarah Savage Raymond has been a resident of Brooklyn since 1927, when, at the age  of 22, she moved from her home in Baltimore.  During her more  than 80 years  in Brooklyn  and  the Tenth Congressional district, Mrs.  Raymond has been a positive example for all  and a valued member of her community.  Mrs. Sarah Savage Raymond has been involved with the First AME Zion Church, originally the Fleet Street Church, since she first  moved  to New York and remains an active  participant. The First AME Zion Church  is  where Sarah met and married her husband,  Mr. Robert Raymond and where she became  involved in her adopted community, becoming  a member in the lodge and on the committee  visiting the sick.  Through more than a century of life, Mrs.  Raymond has kept her indomitable spirit and  remains alert and energetic. Although Mrs.  Raymond has no biological children, she has  three very close relatives that are extremely  supportive of her who live in the Bronx, New  Jersey and Pennsylvania. She also has  five  nieces and nephews that reside in Maryland  that also keep in touch with her. Mrs. Sarah  Savage Raymond has seen and heard what  most of us could only read in history books  and she is always willing to share her experiences with those who are interested in listening.  Mrs. Raymond says that she is ‘‘thankful’’ to  be one hundred six years of age because she  did not expect to live this long. She adds, ‘‘I  appreciate every year and did the best that I  could.’’ It is precisely this humble and exemplary attitude  that has preserved Mrs. Raymond in health and happiness for so long.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Mrs.  Raymond  for her extraordinary accomplishments and her spirit which reflect the best our  nation has to offer.  f  RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST FLIGHT OF  THE SPACE SHUTTLE  HON.

217,,112,-0.385,92,2011-04-15,Ms. SPEIER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to celebrate the retirement of Mike Murphy, the San  Mateo County Counsel.  I had the great privilege to work with Mike  when  I was a member of  the San Mateo  County Board of Supervisors. He is an exceptional  public  servant,  legal  expert,  human  being and a dear friend.  Mike was born in Yokohama, Japan on November 17, 1948 as the son of a military family. He went to Pacific Grove High School from  where he graduated  in 1966. He  then attended  the U.S. Military Academy at West  Point and graduated in 1970. He later served  on the Military Academy Advisory Committee.  Mike laid the ground work for his legal career at Boalt Hall School of Law at UC Berkeley. He graduated in May of 1978 and just six  months  later was admitted  to  the California  Bar.  In May of 1982, Mike started serving in the  office of the San Mateo County District Attorney. In 1987, the civil division of the office became the San Mateo County Counsel where  Mike continued  to serve. He was appointed  one of two Chief Deputies in 1998 and Assistant County Counsel in 2006. In 2007, he became Counsel until his retirement on March  18, 2011.  Mike served as the principal land use attorney for 22 years, a pressure cooker of a job  that he made appear effortless. Among his  highest achievements were the defense of the  County’s Local Coastal Program and Measure  A, a coastal protection initiative and the defense of Measure T, authorizing  the Devil’s  Slide tunnel bypass. During his entire career,  Mike worked as a legal advisor on the San  Bruno Mountain Habitat Conservation Plan, a  landmark  environmental  document  that  he  demonstrated his legal skill in drafting.  In 1988, Mike and San Mateo County celebrated a  true David vs. Goliath victory. The  Port of Oakland was about to dump 7 million  tons of dredged spoils into the ocean off the  San Mateo coast. The Half Moon Bay Fishermen’s Marketing Association filed a lawsuit to  stop  the dumping but  lost  in  federal court.  Mike and his colleague Stephen Toben studied the case and filed a suit for injunctive and  declaratory relief. It was their legal expertise  and perseverance that resulted in a victory in  front of the California State Court of Appeals.  While  I was  in  the California Senate  in  2003, Mike defended my financial privacy legislation and faced strong opposition from multinational conglomerates. Again, his outstanding  legal acumen  succeeded  in protecting  the  rights of San Mateo County residents.  Mike has also been serving on the Military  Academy Advisory Committee  for  the 12th  Congressional District for many years, helping  select  the next generation of America’s officers.  Mike is the loving husband of Gayle Murphy, his wife of 28 years, and the proud parent of their two daughters Erin and Shannon.  In his well deserved retirement, Mike will undoubtedly enjoy  the additional  time he will  have to read and attend San Francisco Giants  games.  Mr. Speaker, I ask this body to rise with me  to honor an extraordinary man, Mike Murphy,  for his dedication to public service and justice  in San Mateo County.  f  CELEBRATION OF ANTIQUE  TRACTOR PRESERVATION DAY  HON.

218,,112,0.269,92,2011-04-15,Mrs. EMERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the celebration of Antique Tractor Preservation Day in West Plains, Missouri. West  Plains, Missouri represents a growing community that is creating a new tradition for tractor  enthusiasts across the country.  Antique tractors and farm machinery serve  as a reminder of a key part of our nation’s agricultural heritage. Antique Tractor Preservation Day provides an opportunity  to display  these  tractors  in a venue where enthusiasts  can share their stories with one another. Enthusiasts who share this common interest can  share their passions for buying and restoring  Antique Tractors.  Antique Tractor Preservation Day also provides others, who might not be enthusiasts, an  opportunity  to  learn more about agricultural  history and  to better understand and appreciate  the significant advancements American  agriculture has made over the last century. It  is  important  to carry on  this  legacy by preserving our antique  tractors  for generations  into the future.  Mr. Speaker,  I commend Michael Hinton  and the West Plains community for their work  in creating an opportunity  for enthusiasts  to  come together and to celebrate this proud heritage and rich history.  f  TRASH REDUCTION ACT OF 2011  HON.

219,,112,-0.502,99,2011-04-15,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  today, we remember and honor the victims of the Armenian Genocide, and we call, once again, for  passage of a resolution affirming the Armenian  Genocide in the U.S. Congress.  Between 1915 and 1923, a campaign conceived and executed by the Ottoman Empire  forcibly deported nearly 2 million Armenians  from  their homes, resulting  in  the deaths of  1.5 million innocent children, women and men.  The history surrounding  this  issue  is abundantly clear—genocide did occur.  While the target of this campaign of extermination was  the Armenian people,  it was  indeed a crime against all people—and we must  not forget lest we let it happen again. On this  day every year, communities across our nation  and across  the world come  together  to  remember this great tragedy. On this day, we  are all Armenians.  The  term  ‘‘genocide’’ had not  yet been  coined in 1915, when the first Armenians were  driven from their homes. The definition of this  most profound crime against humanity came  in 1944 from Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew  who  survived  the Holocaust by  fleeing  to  America after the fall of Warsaw to the Nazis.  In the wake of World War Two, Lemkin led the  international community to establish the United  Nations Convention on  the Prevention and  Punishment of Genocide. Lemkin’s definitive  example of genocide was the crimes against  the Armenians.  And as we commemorate  the Armenian  Genocide, we must  redouble our efforts  to  stop similar crimes being committed  today.  The scorched  towns of Darfur,  in western  Sudan, continue to suffer mass murder, displacement, rape, and torture at the hands of  the government and  its militia allies.  In  the  Democratic Republic of  the Congo, armed  forces continue  to  target ethnic populations  with abductions and violence, leading to more  than 5.4 million civilian deaths in the past 15  years. And just weeks ago, the humanitarian  group Doctors Without Borders was forced to  suspend clinics in eastern Congo due to attacks from armed Congolese soldiers. These  ongoing genocides must be stopped.  Immediately.  In order to eliminate these genocides in the  future, we must keep alive the memories of  genocides past.  The U.S. House of Representatives has had  before  it,  for many years now, a  resolution  which clearly affirms the United States record  on  the Armenian Genocide.  I have been a  strong supporter and vocal cosponsor of this  resolution in every Congress, and I remain so  today.  Last year, when  the Foreign Affairs Committee voted in support of the resolution, Turkey  recalled  its Ambassador  to  the United  States. Turkey’s leaders continue to say that  properly recognizing  the Armenian Genocide  will harm U.S.-Turkey relations—that it is not  the right time to pass this resolution. But it is  always ‘‘the right time’’ for the truth.  Already, 43 states and 20 nations have officially recognized the Armenian Genocide, and  it is time for the United States to do the same.  After all, how can we have the moral authority  to call out and condemn  the genocides  in  Darfur or Rwanda when we are unable to acknowledge the tragedy of Armenia? I look forward to the day that this truth can be spoken  aloud, in one voice, by our government, and  by governments around the world. Because it  is the truth.  In 2009, the governments of Turkey and Armenia announced a roadmap for normalizing  relations between the two countries. In a process brokered by Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton, the two countries signed protocols to  resume diplomacy and end the Turkish blockade of Armenia. However, before the ink had  dried on  those accords,  the Turkish government backtracked on its commitment by adding additional preconditions.  The people of Armenia continue to face the  devastating hardships wrought by  the dual  blockades of Turkey and Azerbaijan.

220,House,112,0.742,9,2011-05-02,Mr. STUTZMAN.,"  I thank my colleague, Congressman BURTON, for his  comments.  What a momentous day, as he said,  that we can all take courage and to  look to the future, but as well as celebrate the ending of a chapter that has  caused so much pain and so much fear  in the lives of many Americans.  Three weeks after my wife and I had  our  first born  child, our American  homeland was attacked by terrorists  on September 11, 2001. As I held my  baby boy, I knew that I had to do something, and ensuring the future security  of my two sons is the reason I ran for  the U.S. Congress.  The terrorist attacks on 9/11 tested  our security, our defense, and our fortitude in protecting our country, but  we have not stood idly by. For nearly  10 years now, our American soldiers  have given their lives every day in Operation New Dawn, Operation Enduring  Freedom, and now Operation Odyssey  Dawn to protect our Nation and to secure justice. Their service demands respect and admiration.  b1920  Last night, justice was served. bin  Laden has been the leader and the symbol of al Qaeda for more than 20 years,  continually plotting attacks against  the United States and its allies.  The word ‘‘Qaeda’’ means foundation  or base. Osama bin Laden was the head  of  this  foundation,  the  face of  terrorism around the world, a foundation  upon which its members expected to  erect a vigorous, widespread network  spreading terror around the world.  Well, folks, we have beheaded their  foundation. We  have  beheaded  al  Qaeda. And should they continue, we  will be glad to bring justice and help  them join their leader once again if  they so choose.  We must continue to fight. Our third  President, Thomas Jefferson, said this:  ‘‘Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom.’’  We must use our strength and cultivate our relationships with the people around the world to ensure we take  a  stand against cruel dictatorships,  tyranny and radical Islam.  As I work with Congress and military  commanders,  I will  fight  to honor  those who have died to secure our freedom because they deserve our utmost  respect, and we  should only be  so  grateful.  I  congratulate  the men  and  the  women of our military and intelligence  communities who have devoted their  lives to this mission. For this, our soldiers have America’s boundless gratitude.  I also want to commend and congratulate President Obama and President Bush for their determination and  their willingness to continue the fight,  to pursue Osama bin Laden, who has  been the eluding terrorist, the face of  terrorism  around  this  world.  And  today, freedom has been victorious.  I am honored to represent the people  of  Indiana’s Third District and am  proud of Indiana’s 14,700 members of  the  Indiana Army and Air National  Guard. It  is the dedication of these  men and women and their families who  have brought the leader of al Qaeda to  justice and will continue to bring justice to those who seek to destroy freedom and destroy America.  As Winston Churchill once said: We  sleep safe in our beds because rough  men stand ready in the night to visit  violence on those who would do us  harm.  So, Mr. Speaker,  today  is one of  those days that I didn’t know that I  would ever see, but stand here knowing  that we have been victorious, but also  know that the fight in front of us is not  over with; that we will continue to be  vigilant;  that we will  support  our  troops, our men and our women, our  Commander-in-Chief  in this  fight on  terrorism.  ",2011
221,House,112,0.585,9,2011-05-02,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," I thank my  good  friend, Congressman STUTZMAN,  for his remarks, and I really appreciate  you taking your time to come down  here tonight.  Congressman STUTZMANtalked a little bit about the military, and I really  appreciate that because we have thousands, hundreds of thousands of men  and women in the military defending  our freedoms all around the world, in  Afghanistan and in Iraq, and we have  them in Germany and we have them in  Korea. We have  them  in bases all  around the world making sure that the  freedoms we enjoy today and tonight  will be there tomorrow for us and our  kids and our grandkids.  But tonight I’d like to read a little  bit of an article that was written just  yesterday by a  fellow named Marc  Ambinder with the National Journal.  And I think it’s really well done, and it  points out all the hard work that went  into going after Osama bin Laden.  The  team  that killed Osama bin  Laden were members of the counterterrorism unit for the Navy, known as the  Navy SEAL Team 6. It’s a highly elusive group that was developed in the  1980s to rescue American hostages in  Iran. They exist outside the military  protocol and engage in operations that  are at the highest level of classification. The fact that Team 6 is front page  news today is a measure of how important the publicity about bin Laden’s  killing is to the U.S., because normally  you don’t hear about these guys.  The President gave the order on Friday morning for the operation to pursue bin Laden. The strike began early  Sunday morning, at the Ghazi Air Base  in Pakistan,  the MH–60 helicopters  made their way to Osama bin Laden’s  tightly guarded compound, which is 70  miles from the center of Islamabad.  The helicopter carrying the team of  SEALs malfunctioned. Can you imagine that? They’re over their target and  the helicopter  stops working. As  it  hovered outside the high walls, the  pilot gently landed inside the walls of  the 3-story condo, but he couldn’t get  the helicopter going again.  And  yet  the  assault  team  disembarked to raid the massive, walled  compound, prepared to take bin Laden  dead or alive, even though they knew  there was a chance they wouldn’t have  a ride back. Their lives were at risk,  and yet they went ahead and carried  out their mission.  Bin  Laden was  discovered  using  women as human shields as American  forces fired at him. One of the women  was his wife. Bin Laden was shot in the  face by the SEALs during a firefight  after  resisting capture. Three other  males were  killed  along with  bin  Laden. One of them was his adult son.  With the team still in the compound,  the commander on the ground told a  remote  commander  that  they  had  found bin Laden. The Special Forces  blew up  the malfunctioned chopper,  helicopter, then escaped in a reinforcement close to 4:15 p.m., just 40 minutes  after they landed.  The West Wing staff worked most of  the day on the operation. President  Obama joined senior national security  officials in the Situation Room that  afternoon as the  firefight was monitored.  Leon Panetta, one of our old colleagues here, was  in his conference  room at the CIA headquarters, which  he had turned into a conference center  to give him constant contact with the  tactical leaders of the strike team. And  I want to compliment Leon as well. I  hope he’s paying attention to this.  Less than 12 hours after the raid, bin  Laden’s body was taken to the aircraft  carrier, USS Carl Vinson, and he was  buried in the North Arabian Sea overnight. A DNA match from the remains  confirmed that bin Laden was dead at  age 54.  And of course President Obama made  the official announcement of his death  from  the East Room of  the White  House at 11:35 p.m., and he said what  all of us really agree with: ‘‘Justice has  been done.’’  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:41 May 03, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K02MY7.021 H02MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

241,,112,-0.317,51,2011-05-02,Mr. COSTELLO.," Mr. Speaker, 96 years ago  this month, the Ottoman Empire began a brutal campaign against  its Armenian citizens,  marking the beginning of the Armenian Genocide. At the end of this atrocity in 1923, more  than 1.5 million Armenians had perished.  Once again, despite the absence of an official recognition on behalf of the American government, I stand to commemorate the Armenian Genocide. This  injustice deserves  recognition by the U.S. For years, a resolution affirming the U.S. position on Armenian Genocide has been introduced in the U.S. House of  Representatives and, as a member of  the  House Armenian  Issues Caucus,  I have cosponsored that resolution.  Over two dozen countries and 43 states, including my home state of  Illinois, have affirmed the Armenian Genocide, demonstrating  unwavering support for this position. As I have  said before, there will never be a convenient  time  to  officially  recognize  the Armenian  Genocide, but we must do what is right and  officially declare these atrocities as genocide.  The official commemoration of the Armenian  Genocide also provides an opportunity to recognize the indomitable spirit of the Armenian  people. Their daily contributions to our communities are the best testament of their kindness, strength and commitment to justice and  peace. As a member of  the Tom Lantos  Human Rights Commission, I call on my colleagues in Congress and the Obama administration to join me in recognizing the 96th anniversary of  the Armenian Genocide and  the  significant contributions of the Armenian people.  f  NEAL STANLEY TRIBUTE  HON.

Mr. Stanley is the director of the Great Western Oil and Gas Company, and will receive  ‘‘Wildcatter of  the Year’’  for his work  in  the  field of natural resources.  There are few people who possess the level  of experience and knowledge that Mr. Stanley  provides both his company and the state of  Colorado. He has spent over 35 years working  in the oil and gas industry, serving on several  public and private boards. Most notably, he  was president of the Independent Petroleum  Association of Mountain States from 1999 to  2001 and Senior Vice President–Western Region for Forest Oil Corporation.  Mr. Stanley will  join a  long  list of distinguished  recipients of  the  ‘‘Wildcatter of  the  Year’’ award. His devotion to the oil and gas  industry  is proven by his exemplary career,  and  the expertise he has provided  through  decades of work. There is little doubt that he  has contributed  to  the success and prominence of the industry and all the companies  he worked for.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is an honor  to  recognize  Neal Stanley  today. He has given years of  service  to a number of companies and  the  state of Colorado. He will be appropriately  honored with  the  ‘‘Wildcatter of  the Year’’  award and will continue to lead our country’s  charge into its wealth of natural resources.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF  MITCHELL MULAS  HON.

It is no exaggeration to say that Mitch Mulas  was an  icon  in Sonoma County and a role  model for generations of fire fighters, teachers  and students, and  farmers. He  represented  the best in community service and in devotion  to his family.  Mitch was born  in 1928  in Sonoma, California, the son of an Italian immigrant father  and a mother who survived  the 1906 San  Francisco earthquake. He met his wife, Nilda  when he was 15 and she was 13. They had  their  first date  three years  later, and  three  years following that, they were married. Nilda  was his partner, friend and soul mate and survives him in his passing.  Mitch was a dairy farmer and a leader in the  county’s agricultural organizations. He  joined  the Farm Bureau after he graduated from high  school and served as President  from 1965–  1967 and 1985–1986. He was  inducted  into  the Sonoma County Farm Bureau Hall of  Fame in 2002.  He took a brief hiatus from leadership positions within the Farm Bureau to serve on the  Sonoma Valley Unified School Board  for 12  years  from  1969  to  1981. His  influence  stretched  from  the classroom  to  the  football  field, where he anchored a favorite spot in the  bleachers each season. Not only did he receive  the  district’s  ‘‘Salute  to Education’’  award but  the Sonoma Valley High School  Athletic Hall of Fame created the Mulas Family Recognition Award in his honor, which is  presented annually to persons or businesses  in  the Sonoma Valley who have contributed  time and  resources  to student athletes and  coaches.  Mitch was also the ‘‘Chief,’’ a title he wore  with distinction and pride. In 1942, at the age  14, he helped his father start what later became  the Shell-Vista Fire Protection District.  He served first as a volunteer firefighter, was  named Assistant Chief in 1955 and served in  that position until he was named Chief  in  1968. He served  in  that position until his  death.  Mr. Speaker, Mitch Mulas was a farmer, educator, activist and sports enthusiast who also  protected his community for 69 years as a fire  fighter. But above all else, he was a devoted  family man who is survived by his wife, Nilda,  four children, six grandchildren and two great  grand children. An entire community mourns  his passing, and  it  is appropriate  that we  honor him at this time.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF  MITCHELL MULAS  HON. LYNN C.

245,Senate,112,0.549,10,2011-05-09,Mr. SESSIONS., I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 additional minute.  ,2011
246,Senate,112,0.423,17,2011-05-09,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President,  I  rise  in opposition to cloture on the  nomination of James Cole to be the  Deputy Attorney General of the United  States.  Last December, I objected to further  consideration of Mr. Cole’s nomination  because of the refusal of the Department of Justice, DOJ, to comply with  reasonable document requests from the  Senate Select Committee  on  Intelligence. Unfortunately, the President  decided to circumvent the Senate and  recess-appointed Mr. Cole on December  29, 2010.  Here we are 5 months later: the Justice Department is still thwarting the  Intelligence committee’s oversight.  The documents we have requested all  relate to the Guantanamo Detainee Review  Task  Force  that made  recommendations to the Administration  on whether to transfer, release, or detain Gitmo detainees. Over 2 years ago,  the committee became aware of rising  recidivism rates among former Gitmo  detainees. At that time, the rate was  around 11 percent—it is now above 25  percent. Congress has a unique obligation to the American people to ensure  that no more dangerous detainees are  released from Gitmo, and that those  who have been released do not resume  their terrorist ways. Each one of the  documents we are seeking is essential  to understanding why the task force  made certain recommendations about  certain detainees, especially those detainees our  intelligence professionals  judged were too dangerous to transfer.  The detainees remaining at Gitmo  are among the worst of the worst, yet  many are still designated for transfer.  Given the upward trend in recidivism  rates, the  Intelligence Committee  is  reasonably concerned that some of the  detainees who have been or may be  transferred to third countries will reengage  in  terrorist  activities. Lingering questions about the monitoring  capabilities of countries that have accepted detainees add to these concerns.  In making its recommendations, the  task force operated under guidance and  recommendations  from  the Attorney  General. The Department of Justice,  however,  refuses  to provide a September 2009 Attorney General memorandum  that  reportedly  recommends  that an entire category of detainees be  presumed to be eligible for transfer. If  classes of detainees are to be presumed  to be eligible for transfer by DOJ, then  I  think  the  Intelligence Committee  should know about it and why such  guidance was considered appropriate.  The Department has also refused to  provide  the  Intelligence  committee  with the task force’s recommendations  for the disposition of the detainees.  The task force documents we have been  given have entire portions of their recommendations blacked out. This is no  way to conduct oversight and it certainly puts the committee at a disadvantage in trying to understand why  transfer decisions were made. Interestingly, the Department has provided the  recommendations  made  by  review  boards during the previous administration.  As with the September 2009 memorandum,  the  Department  argues  against giving this information to Congress because of ‘‘deliberative process.’’  That assertion may work in a FOIA  case or  in the context of executive  privilege, but there is no legal basis for  using  it to deny congressional oversight, especially where the documents  pertain to national security matters. It  is time for the Justice Department to  abandon this baseless argument and  give us the documents.  The Intelligence committee is also  waiting for a list of the 92 detainees  who were approved for transfer as of  August 28, 2009, prior to the application  of the September 2009 memorandum.  The Department indicated in November  2010 that the list would be provided,  but the committee has yet to receive  it.  Last Friday, we heard from the Department for the first time in months,  wanting to work something out on the  documents in advance of the cloture  vote on the Cole nomination. This is a  bit ironic, considering that letters and  e-mails from last year have gone unanswered. The best thing they can do now  is to honor our request and give us the  documents that we have requested.  The Department’s obstruction of a  congressional review is not the only  reason I am opposing cloture. Mr. Cole  still has not explained comments he  made about the 9/11 attacks. In September 2002, he wrote an op-ed in which  he called these attacks ‘‘criminal acts  of terrorism against a civilian population.’’ Following this logic, he diminished 9/11 to being no more than ‘‘the  scourge of the drug trade, the reign of  organized crime, and countless acts of  rape, child abuse, and murder.’’ He also  argued  that  the protections of our  criminal justice system ‘‘must be applied to everyone to be effective.’’ I  could not  disagree more with  this  statement—no  terrorist deserves  the  benefits of our criminal justice system.  Mr. Cole has neither rejected these  comments, nor really explained why he  made them. Until he does so, I have to  question his  judgment and his suitability to be the second-in-command at  the Justice Department.  It is for these reasons, I cannot support cloture on the nomination of Mr.  Cole at this time.  The  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2011

250,House,112,0.598,15,2011-05-13,Mr. GOHMERT.," Madam Speaker, I  want to identify with the comments of  my  friend  from  Indiana. Well  said.  Great thoughts.  We have wonderful  friends  in this  world, as a Nation. But we need to recognize who are our friends and who are  our enemies and who are the places,  the countries, the peoples that intend  us harm, who are the people that are  willing to assist us in encouraging and  allowing for freedom to spread around  the world.  We should be well aware that there  are people across our border in Mexico  who are not Mexicans, people who  would like to see this Nation fail as  such an important keeper of the peace.  We know that Hezbollah has been  setting up camp across the U.S. border  in Mexico; that they have been working with drug cartels in Mexico, and it  appears we see some of the signs of  that in the ways that people are murdered, the way the crime business has  developed.  We know that people coming across  our border into this country, a significant percentage at  least, are other  than Mexican. OTM, they’re classified.  So many of them from the Middle East,  many who are taught to try to appear  as Hispanic and come across and try to  avoid indicating anything that would  give away the fact that they are coming here, not for jobs, but to set up to  try to do us harm.  So when you are aware that there is  so much violence on the border, Americans being murdered down on both  sides of the border, we have two lakes  between Texas and Mexico, Lake Falcon and Lake Amistad, together about  85 miles of international border that  should  be  patrolled  by  the United  States Coast Guard. But this administration doesn’t wish to see the Coast  Guard there.  Visiting with the Texas Governor a  few weeks ago, he had made clear,  please help me in urging the administration to allocate some Coast Guard  resources to these  lakes, where the  drug cartels are bringing dangerous  people, bringing drugs, bringing mayhem across into the U.S. Texas is committing money, resources, manpower  on the lake, but it’s a Federal job.  And what we’ve seen with this administration, when a State does too  good a job or tries too well to do the  job  the Federal Government  is not  doing in order to protect its State, this  administration decides to sue them.  We’ve seen also recently that if there  is plenty of evidence to support that  people or groups are funding terrorism  in the world, and it is radical Islamists  that are doing that, then this administration wants to embrace the groups  that we have evidence are funding terrorism, rather than confront them and  stop them. It’s an interesting time we  live in.  I do want to follow up on the President’s comments. Here Texas has suffered the  loss of around 2.3 million  acres burned in the last decade or so.  Other Presidents,  other  administrations, and even this administration,  have  recognized  that when  177,000  acres, 300, 400, 500,000 acres have been  destroyed, that is certainly worthy of  declaring a disaster area in order to  provide Federal support.  Texas is a donor State. We always  put much more into the Federal Government from Texas than Texas ever  gets back. We’re proud to be such an  important, vital part of  the United  States.  It does follow that when there is such  a compelling disaster as the wildfires  in Texas, 2.3 million acres destroyed,  that it would be nice to have the support of the President. But just as this  administration  snubbed all  the contributions that Houston provided to  the shuttle program, and refused to  allow a shuttle to be on display permanently in the NASA Space Center in  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:54 May 14, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K13MY7.036 H13MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

286,,112,0.36,29,2011-05-13,Mr. ADERHOLT.," Mr. Speaker, today I would  like to recognize a fallen hero, Senior Airman  Mark Andrew Forester, from my hometown of  Haleyville, Alabama.  Mark was killed in action on September 29,  2010, while so valiantly  trying  to  rescue a  wounded comrade, SGT 1st Class Calvin Harris; Mark ran into direct enemy fire, without regard of his own life, in an attempt to pull his  comrade back  to safety. Both died on  that  day, and only earlier on that morning they had  taken a beautiful photo together.  Mark was a highly decorated Airman who  gave that last full measure of devotion and received many honors, such as Purple Hearts  and a Bronze Star with Valor. He was so very  loved by all of the men in his unit, and his  beautiful family.  This coming Saturday, May 14, marks what  would have been his 30th birthday. In recognition of  that occasion  I ask  that a  tribute  to  Mark be  inserted  in  the RECORD, written by  Bert Caswell, at the behest of Mark’s fellow  airman George Earhart who was in battle with  him on that day. Airman Earhart was inspired  by Mark, that Mark was the greatest person  he has ever met, and was greatly impacted by  his love of all the children in theater.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Mark and  his family, as they continue to mourn his loss.  DEVOUT  All In . . .  All in this our Country of Tis of Thee . . .

The Unit has created a  program entitled ‘‘Merit Awards’’ in which the  unit awards the amount of $300 to each successful applicant graduating with  the senior  class of Osage Community School District.  Unit 278  is devoted  to assisting students  in  their pursuit of higher education and I am honored  to submit  for  the  record  the  following  commentary on the program in Osage.  ‘‘American Legion Auxiliary Unit 278 and the  Merit Award Program:  The Osage American Legion Auxiliary Unit  278 is very much attuned to the importance of  education and financial needs of students in  attending post high school institutions of learning. Our unit had developed a process called  ‘‘Merit Awards’’ whereby we raise monies to  be used for the student applicants in furthering  their education.  Each year we hold an event (Merit Award  luncheon and bake sale) for the community.  Proceeds from the event are used entirely for  Merit Awards. All food for the event is donated  by members and prepared at the site. In addition, members are asked  to either donate  items for the bake sale or contribute $5.00 in  lieu of a baked donation. Our unit boasts 378  members, 35 of whom are Junior members.  One of the highlights of this event is a drawing  for an American flag and flag pole which is installed by the Legion free of charge to the winner.  Each year applications are made available  to  the Osage School district  for graduating  seniors. Our unit has a committee to review  applications and determine the successful applicants. This year we had 10 applicants with  a Merit Award in the amount for $300. Two of  those awards will be made by contributions  from  two  families, one honoring one of our  auxiliary members and the other in memory of  one of our deceased members.  Presentation of these Merit Awards is made  by a member of our unit at the Osage High  School Award Assembly  in May. Unit 278  takes great pride in our efforts to communicate  to students the importance of education and  throughout the year we participate in activities  involved in education.’’  Mr. Speaker, as you can see the American  Legion Auxiliary Unit 278 is a great example  of  the commitment of patriotic Americans  to  their community.  I am honored  to represent  them and all of Osage in the U.S. Congress.  I know all my colleagues will join me in congratulating them for a job well done.  f  GEORGE WASHINGTON BOY’S SWIM  TEAM  HON.

The program gives kids age 13–18 a  chance  to  study musical  theater,  to  learn  through music and to perform for their community. This year, they celebrate their 20th season of performances.  The Teen Theater program has  long produced  entertainment  for  residents  of  the  Bronx, who come  to see high-level productions worthy of praise in any context, but especially so considering that the performers are  our community’s young people. This talented  troupe of performers recently broke their own  attendance record during productions of Rent  and The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling  Bee, and they plan more productions in the  coming months.  Children who take part in the program learn  music, dance, dramatic and literary skills and  get  the chance  to perform  for  their  friends,  family and  community. They are enriched  through  the arts,  they  learn  important skills  through the arduous rehearsal process, they  build  self-esteem  and  they make  lifelong  friends. The program has received numerous  National Youth Theater Awards in recognition  of their talented performers, including most recently  for Rent, which won awards  for Best  Ensemble Performance, Best Lead Actor in a  Musical and Best Lead Actress in a Musical.  On behalf of the many alumni of the program, the residents of the Bronx and the entire Seventeenth District, I want to recognize  and honor the Riverdale Y’s Teen Theater and  their director, Laurie Walton, to thank them for  their contributions  to our community and  to  wish them the best of luck in the future.  f  APPLAUDING THE UPPER MERION  SCHOOL DISTRICT  HON. PATRICK MEEHAN  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 13, 2011  ",2011
290,,112,0.221,36,2011-05-13,Mr. MEEHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  applaud the Upper Merion School District of  Pennsylvania  for winning an Environmental  Achievement Award  from  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Upper Merion was  recognized for being a 2010 ENERGY STAR  leader and for reducing its energy consumption by more than 30 percent, an achievement  reached by only about a dozen of the Nation’s  15,000  school  districts. All  six  of Upper  Merion’s schools have earned  the ENERGY  STAR rating and several buildings have energy reductions near 50 percent. The district  has also embarked on an aggressive recycling  program that has resulted in about 50 percent  of  its solid waste being recycled  instead of  going to the landfill. I am proud to represent  the citizens of Upper Merion in Congress, and  their example of stewardship—of a community  taking local initiative to reduce their environmental impact—is a model of bottom-up sustainability  that municipalities across America  should strive to emulate.

291,,112,-0.241,1,2011-05-24,Mr. HIMES.," Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  It is a thrill and an honor this morning on this propitious day in which a  joint session of the United States Congress will be addressed by Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to introduce  and welcome our guest chaplain of the  day, Rabbi Jeremy Wiederhorn. Rabbi  Wiederhorn is a friend, he is the spiritual leader of The Conservative Synagogue of Westport, and has been so  since 2008. Prior to doing that, he gave  service  in Henderson, Nevada,  for  8  years. He is a leader in the community  and in his synagogue. He is also true to  the ministry dictated by his and so  many of our  faiths,  including, over  time, having  led and mobilized his  community to send an emergency mission to Israel in response to the missile  strikes from Hamas in Gaza.  It  is a real honor.  I know Rabbi  Wiederhorn has served as an important  leader  in Westport  and  throughout  Fairfield County. He has served as a  friend to me. I would say that in addition to his spiritual guidance, he introduced me to cholent, which for this  Presbyterian was a new experience. I  think I thank him for introducing me  to that part of his history and culture,  if not exactly for the culinary experience.  Welcome, Rabbi Wiederhorn.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2011

295,House,112,-0.283,43,2011-05-24,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.  I too rise in support of this bill, the  2012 National Defense Authorization  Act. I want to begin by thanking the  chairman and our staffs for the outstanding work that they have done  putting together this bill.  I think Mr. MCKEONhas more than  risen to the level of the bipartisan tradition of our committee. He has upheld  the tradition held by our predecessors  that this committee should work together, Republicans  and Democrats,  that it should be an open and transparent process.  I can say that I and my staff feel  very, very good about the open process  that we have had, although we have  not agreed on everything—we do not  agree on everything—that is in the bill;  but where there were disagreements,  we had an open and honest dialogue.  We had votes in the committee, and  now we will have votes on the floor.  And overall I think the chairman and  the members of both parties and staffs  have put together a very strong bill  that will protect our national defense  and meet the primary duty of this Congress, and that is provide for the national defense and the national security of our country. So I thank the  chairman and his staff for that work,  and I look forward to continuing to  work with him throughout this process.  I also want to note one of our members, who was not able to be there during the course of our markup as she  usually is, but nonetheless contributed  greatly to the process. We all miss Congresswoman GABRIELGIFFORDS’ presence on the committee, but we work  very closely with her staff on issues  and priorities that have been important to her during her time on the  committee, and she and her staff are  still doing an outstanding job with the  committee in contributing to this process. So I thank them, and we all look  forward to GABBYcoming back to this  body and continuing her work.  In putting together this bill, there  are five main areas of priorities that I  think we should focus on. First and  foremost, whenever we have troops out  in the battlefield, as they are in Afghanistan and Iraq, and also spread out  in a whole lot of other countries, priority number one has to be to make  sure that we give them the support, the  equipment and the means necessary to  carry out the mission that we have  given them.  I believe  that  this bill prioritizes  that, both within the base bill and  within the overseas contingency operations funding to make sure that our  troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, elsewhere, have the equipment they need  to carry out the mission that we have  given them.  Second, I believe the counterterrorism in the fight against al Qaeda must  continue to be a top priority of this  committee,  and  I  believe  that we  strongly support that once again. We  all learned as a Nation and the world,  with the killing of Osama bin Laden,  how effective our Special Operations  Command and other elements of our  counterterrorism policy can be, but we  also need to be mindful that the job is  not done, and we continue  to  fund  those priorities.  I do want to specifically commend  the  folks at  the Special Operations  Command. I had the great privilege of  chairing the subcommittee that has  had jurisdiction over the Special Operations Command for 3 years. They do a  fantastic job for our Nation. Certainly,  everybody saw that in the case of getting bin Laden; but they do it every  day in many, many ways that many  people do not know and do not recognize, so I thank them for their outstanding work.  We also have a huge challenge with  the budget. As  the  chairman mentioned, finding efficiencies in the Defense budget is going to be critical. As  we have heard on this floor over and  over in many contexts, we have a massive deficit. We have a deficit that is  over 33 percent of what we spend. The  Defense budget  is 20 percent of the  overall budget. You cannot take 20 percent of the overall budget off the table  and effectively deal with a deficit of  that size.  b1900  We are going to have to look carefully at where we spend our money in  defense, just like everywhere else, to  make sure that we’re getting the most  for our dollar. I believe we have done  that effectively in this bill, but I also  believe that going forward that task is  going to get harder, not easier. We  must  find ways to save money and  spend  it more efficiently within the  Department of Defense. I also believe  that our policy in Afghanistan is going  to be critical.  As I mentioned, we certainly  fund  our troops in the effort that they are  performing right now in Afghanistan,  but going forward, we are going to really need to begin to bring those troops  home to complete that mission. We  will have some amendments that address that issue during the course of  this bill. I look forward to that debate  because I think that Congress needs to  play a strong role in concluding our  mission successfully in Afghanistan.  Lastly, the issue that the chairman  mentioned that I think is very important in this bill is detainee policy and  the AUMF. The chairman very early on  identified this as a clear priority, and I  think he is absolutely right that Congress’ voice should be heard on these  very,  very  important  issues. We’ve  worked  closely  on  that. We  have  reached  some  agreement. We  have  some areas of disagreement. The biggest one we’re going to have an amendment on this is the idea of whether or  not article 3 courts should continue to  be available for Guantanamo Bay detainees and those who would be captured in similar situations in the future.  I  believe  that  it  should. We  shouldn’t always have them in article 3  courts. Military  commissions  have  their  place.  Indefinite  detention  of  enemy combatants has its place. But  article 3 courts have effectively served  this country  for over 200 years. We  have tried and convicted over 400 terrorists  in article  3 Federal  courts.  Right now  in  the United States of  America, we have over 300 of them safely locked up. We can do it. It’s an option we should not take away from the  President.  So, again, I want to thank the chairman for a very open process. Bipartisanship is the tradition of this committee. He has upheld that very well. I  look forward to working with him as  we go forward in this process.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
296,House,112,-0.582,50,2011-05-24,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Chair, to my friends on  the other side of the aisle, I am offering an  amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill  which would defund the war in Libya.  The war is unconstitutional. The President  did not come to this Congress, he went to the  U.N. Security Council, he went to a number of  international bodies, but he didn’t come to the  United States Congress. Last week, the President did not observe  the  tolling of  the War  Powers Act, so he’s in violation of the statute.  The action over  in Libya has already exceeded the U.N. mandate; it’s in violation of  the U.N. mandate and there have been violations of international law.  What are we doing there? Why does anyone think we can afford it? Why aren’t we trying to find a path to peace so we aren’t called  upon to spend more money there? These are  questions we have  to be asking;  that’s why  Congress needs  to say we’re not going  to  spend more money there.  People are saying it’s not the United States,  it’s NATO. The Guardian  in  the U.K. did a  study which showed  that 90 percent of  the  cruise missiles are paid for by the U.S. Sixty-  six percent of the personnel working against  Libya are from the U.S., 50 percent of aircraft,  50 percent of all ships—and our government  is saying this is a NATO operation? We have  to recognize what’s going on here, which is an  expansion of the war power by the Executive  and it’s time we challenge that.  One  thing we certainly shouldn’t do  is  to  support the amendment offered by my friend,  Mr. MCKEON, which will hand over  to  the  President Congress’ constitutional authority to  declare and authorize war, substantially altering the delicate balance of power the Founding Fathers envisioned.  The annual  re-authorization  contains unprecedented and dangerous  language which  gives the President virtually unchecked power  to  take  this country  to war and  to keep us  there. The bill substantially undermines  the  Constitution, the institution that the Constitution set up  that  is Congress and sets  the  United States on a path  to permanent war.  Congress has to protect the American people  from the overreach of any Chief Executive—  Democrat, Republican—any Chief Executive  who’s enamored with unilateralism, preemption,  first strike and  the power  to prosecute  war without constitutional authority or statutory  prescriptions.  Permanent global war isn’t the answer. It’s  not going to increase our national security. Far  from ridding the world of terrorism, it will become a terrorist recruitment program. The war  in Iraq is based on lies; the war in Afghanistan  is based on a misreading of history.  Yet in Iraq we’ll spend over $3 trillion. In Afghanistan we’ve spent over half a trillion dollars.  We have people out of work here. We have  people losing their homes, losing their health  care,  losing  their retirement security. All we  hear from the White House is ‘‘we want more  war or more authorization for more war.’’ We  have to stop that and while stopping that we  have to stop this national security state and  stop the extension of the Patriot Act which is  also in this bill.

305,House,112,-0.606,10,2011-06-01,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," There is a lot of  talk and legalese about what is going  on today, but the reality is what the  Republicans are trying to do underneath all of that legalese language is to  enshrine in law the Republican Ryan  budget. By voting for the rule, what  you do is to put into force that budget.  What does that budget do? It ends  Medicare.  Now, there are people who resent  that term—that oh, no, we’re really  going to save it. Well, I’m going to tell  you, when you take away the guaranteed benefits of Medicare—that’s what  seniors get right now—for people 55 and  under, they are thrown into the not-so-  loving arms of the insurance companies, and their costs will increase out  of their own pockets by about $6,000.  That’s what the bill does.  The bill also turns Medicaid upside  down, which is not only the health care  plan for poor children in the United  States but also the largest payer for  nursing homes and home health care.  That is the single biggest part of Medicaid—paying  for nursing home care  and home health care. So it’s another  slap at the seniors.  The other thing that the legislation  does is to offer more tax breaks for the  wealthiest Americans. It lowers the tax  rates for corporation, many of which  aren’t even paying any  taxes  right  now, a couple of which got tax refunds  from  the  government.  You’ve  got  major companies paying  fewer taxes  than ordinary Americans. That’s what  this does.  ",2011

I cannot sit and not rise and object  and ask everyone in this body: Please  let’s identify limits to what we will say  and where we will go, because what we  say here the world listens to; but more  importantly, the God that we pray to  listens, too.  So it bothers me greatly. I am angered—angered—at what I heard and  what I witnessed.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  rule that we are debating here today so  that we can debate a bill on homeland  security. Now, that might come as a  surprise to many who are watching  this debate, or to the Speaker or anyone else in this Chamber today, that  we are actually debating a rule that  deals with homeland security.  Now, the fantasy discussion going on  on the left right now on any topic that  comes to mind might be entertaining  to some, but for the rest of this country, they would love to see this body  actually  debate  issues  that  are  on  topic, and that issue is homeland security. Agencies like Border Patrol, ICE  agents, Coast Guard personnel, the Secret Service, funding for all sorts of  agencies, $1 billion for FEMA disaster  relief fund, are these not issues important enough to discuss on the  floor  today?  The bill prohibits the use of funds to  move detainees at Guantanamo Bay,  Cuba, into the United States and denies them immigration benefits such as  visas,  admission  into  the  United  States, and classification as refugees,  all sorts of things that are critical to  homeland  security,  to  protecting  Americans  from  terrorism,  keeping  Americans safe.  And we are doing it under an open  rule, and that is the issue on this rule  debate. For the first time in 4 years, we  are  debating  an  appropriations  bill  that affects hundreds of millions of  Americans related to homeland security, and we are allowing every side to  bring amendments down to the floor  and to discuss those issues.  This is a critical moment. No matter  how many times the folks on the left  want to come forward and obfuscate or  change the subject, that’s fine, we can  have those debates.

Dixon on the occasion of his retirement from the United States Marine Corps. I  offer SgtMaj Dixon my sincerest thanks for his  33 years of dedicated service in protecting our  nation and safeguarding its future.  SgtMaj Dixon  joined  the Marine Corps  in  1978 at Parris Island, South Carolina. On four  separate occasions, SgtMaj Dixon was meritoriously promoted through the ranks with participation in the evacuation of a U.S. embassy,  the Palestine  Liberation Organization,  and  subsequent combat operations in Beirut, Lebanon—all within the first five years of his career.  In 1983, SgtMaj Dixon reported to 2/1 and  completed a deployment as a Platoon Sergeant to Okinawa, Japan as well as a western  pacific deployment. During  this  tour, SgtMaj  Dixon’s exceptional skills were set apart when  his squad won the First Marines Rifle Squad  competition. Shortly  following, SgtMaj Dixon  was selected along with nine other Marines to  form what became the Combat Assault Training Section where he designed and instructed  multiple courses that are utilized to this day.  SgtMaj Dixon’s additional tours of duty include Operation Desert Shield and Desert  Storm,  the 11th and 15th MEU, Operations  Desert Thunder and Desert Fox, Task Force  58 in Afghanistan and Operation Iraq Freedom  I & II. Throughout these deployments, SgtMaj  Dixon distinguished himself by extraordinary  acts of leadership time and again. Among his  many accomplishments, his decorations  include Meritorious Service Medals, a Navy  Commendation Medal,  Navy  Achievement  Medals and a Combat Action Ribbon. These  recognitions are a  true  testament of SgtMaj  Dixon’s dedication,  leadership and commitment to our country.  In 2007 SgtMaj Dixon was assigned as the  SgtMaj  for Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton where  in 2008, as a reflection of his  work,  the Base won  the Commander and  Chiefs  Installation Excellence award. Moreover, SgtMaj Dixon’s service in his current position as  the Sergeant Major  for  the Marine  Corps  Installations West has  truly been  the  capstone of a remarkable military career.  SgtMaj Dixon’s  demonstrated  leadership,  dedication and expertise has  inspired countless  fellow Marines As he enters  this new  stage of his life, I hope that SgtMaj Dixon will  benefit  from his years of work,  just as  the  United States Marine Corps has benefited. I  offer him my congratulations and may he  enjoy a rewarding retirement.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to please join me in  honoring all the brave men and women who  have  served  in  the United States Armed  Forces, and the admirable service of Sergeant  Major Jeffrey Dixon.

311,,112,-0.4,73,2011-06-01,Mr. LARSON.," Mr. Speaker, the passing of  Clem Roy—an old friend of mine—happened  so abruptly, and struck at the core of the notion we all have of our brief time on this planet, and the importance of friends and family,  and what we mean to one another.  Faith  teaches us  that Clem  is  in a better  place: at peace and without suffering, while  we scramble to fill the void left by his passing  with stories and memories of  the  friend we  laughed with, argued and debated with, and  with whom we shared in the ups and downs  of the human comedy that is life.  Two  Connecticut  writers—both  contemporaries of Clem’s—Kevin Rennie of The Hartford Courant, and Mark Pazniokas of the CT  Mirror, wrote excellent pieces about Clem that  I am proud to submit for the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORDat the same time that a flag will fly  over the United States Capitol in Clem Roy’s  memory. These writers captured his essence.  The  following are  the articles as  they appeared in The Hartford Courant and CT Mirror:  LOBBYISTCLEMROY: A SHARPOPERATOR  WITHALOTOFHEART  (By Kevin Rennie—The Hartford Courant)  ‘‘You can read a bill and you can vote for  a bill, but you shouldn’t do both.’’ So goes  the wisdom of an original in Connecticut politics, Clem Roy.  A lobbyist for more than 30 years, Clem  has been  struck by an aggressive brain  tumor diagnosed a few weeks ago. In those  decades bivouacking in the Capitol village,  he has fashioned a distinct, colorful legacy  in the gray world of state politics.  You could  tell  the  future by watching  Clem. He was what consumer analysts call  an early adopter. The first cellphones were  bigger than bricks. Clem made his look like  a natural accoutrement to his careful look.  Hard frame briefcases were at the end of  their run when Clem began carrying a Coach  leather backpack. He was right that keys  and a thick wallet wreck the drape of an elegant suit.  You could live by his compendium of aphorisms, which his legion of friends have been  sharing as they buck up each other’s flagging spirits. That is usually Clem’s job.  Born in 1946 and raised in Bristol, Clem  served in Vietnam from 1966 into 1967. Really  served, not just told people he did on the way  to a seat in the U.S. Senate. (Don’t get him  started on that.) He returned to the United  States and worked for Robert Kennedy’s 1968  presidential campaign.  He worked for a legislative committee in  the late 1970s and then, without a client, became a lobbyist. His foresight expanded beyond technology and  fashion.  In 1981, he  managed Thurman Milner’s successful campaign for mayor of Hartford, helping Milner  become the first black mayor of a New England city.  For more than 30 years, Clem has been a  source of pungent opinions, smart insights  and surprises. He represented tobacco companies at a time when the same people who  gasped at the lighting of a cigarette supported making taxpayers give drug addicts  free needles. He brought a sense of proportion  to human weakness  in  its  struggle  against tiresome Utopians.  He has had many clients and he can argue  most briefs. He knows how to create a diversion that unbalances an adversary on one  issue while working with them on a different  one. In a place where a governor’s repetitive  green ties pass for fashion, Clem Roy does it  all with high style, often purchased from  swank Louis, Boston.  Lobbying has been good to Clem. He can  employ a gruff demeanor and a memory for  slights (not the worst thing), but he has a secret. Shouldn’t everyone? He is a secret Samaritan.  When a friend was celebrating a milestone  and her newly married daughter could not  afford to fly to Connecticut from California,  Clem bought her a ticket so she could surprise her mother. The halls of government  and Hartford Hospital, where he now is, reverberate with such stories.  Clem believes mixing in mannered company can help lift one’s lot. A few years ago,  he sent the residents of a women’s shelter to  a salon, told them to get dolled up and had  them to delivered to his favorite haunt, Max  Downtown. There,  compliments  of Clem,  they learned about what was once called deportment while the staff raised their spirits  and enriched their knowledge of another part  of the world.  A successful lobbyist needs a vigilant eye  for detail and relentless  focus. Clem possesses those attributes and his perceptions  extend beyond the matter of the moment. He  had an urge to lift in ways that would escape  others. An advancing brain tumor did not  keep him from doing one more good work.

325,Senate,112,0.409,59,2011-06-13,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, if I might  add one point.  I think the Senator from Minnesota  did point out that there are a significant number of jobs that are associated  with this  industry—in  fact, one-half  million jobs. They are American jobs.  They are jobs in the heartland of this  country. They are jobs that help grow  the economy, make it more prosperous.  It strikes me, at least, that what we  ought to be looking at is more jobs in  this country and  less  investment  in  foreign regimes, where we get a lot of  our energy today.  Mr. President, $1 billion a day  is  what we send outside the United States  because of our addiction to foreign oil.  We have a dangerous dependence upon  foreign energy, and we have a fuel that,  as I said, displaces 445 million barrels  of oil every single year—more than we  import from Saudi Arabia. That is a  pretty remarkable number when you  think about it.  We had a debate here a few weeks ago  on the floor of the Senate about whether we ought to change tax policy with  regard to oil companies. The decision  was reached that we should not do  that; that  it would be punitive, directed at oil companies. We decided,  too, that it would raise taxes on gas for  people in this country.  I would make the same argument  today. We are talking about a tax increase—a large tax increase—which we  know is going to get passed on. So we  are talking about raising taxes on consumers at a time when they can least  afford it.  We have today 31⁄2to $4-a-gallon gasoline. The last thing consumers in this  country need is something that would  actually push that gas price higher. In  fact, if we did away with biofuels altogether—which some people would like  to do—there was a study out last year,  in 2010, that said the price per gallon of  gasoline would go up by 89 cents a gallon. So we have a proposal here that  would have an adverse impact on energy prices, fuel prices for people in  this country, which, frankly, again, because of  the commitment  that was  made  last December, strikes at the  very  heart  of  economic  certainty,  which so many of us come down here  and talk about: the importance of having policies in place that are reliable,  that people who are investing in particular areas of our economy can know  they are going to be there, at least  when Congress makes a commitment.  This  completely  undermines  the  commitment Congress made back  in  December that this particular tax credit would be in place until the end of the  year. So what the Senator from Minnesota and I have done is propose a  path  forward that we believe makes  sense and that is a thoughtful, measured, reasonable, responsible way  in  which to get to the goal that many of  the proponents of the amendment that  will be voted on tomorrow want to get  to; that is, to phase down the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit. But it  does it in a way that makes sense for  American consumers and  those who  have  investments  in  the  industry  today.  So I hope my colleagues will take a  look at this legislation. We think we  can get it moving this year. It does, as  was noted by my colleague from Minnesota, put a significant amount toward reducing the debt, which I think  is something all of our colleagues are  very interested in doing. So we will  present this legislation, obviously, to  our colleagues and hope there will be  many who will choose to support it.  Mr. President, I yield the floor back  to the Senator from Minnesota.  ",2011
326,Senate,112,-0.245,59,2011-06-13,Ms. KLOBUCHAR.," Mr. President,  again, we just hope our colleagues will  look at this bill. It is a serious bill and  very different  than other bills  that  have been proposed in the past, and it  actually takes existing money that was  set out for the end of this year and puts  a big number—$1 billion—into debt reduction.  f  SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS  SENATE  RESOLUTION  PORTING  NATIONAL  HEALTH WEEK  Mr. CRAPO submitted the following  resolution; which was considered and  agreed to:  207—SUPMEN’S  S.

Saturday, June 4, 2011 was a proud day to  be wearing green and blue. Over 700 miles  from home, the USA Baseball National Training Complex was  filled with Argonaut spirit.  After a remarkable season of 52–9, the University of West Florida baseball team scored a  National Championship, bringing home  the  first national NCAA title for UWF.  Under  the direction of Head Coach and  former Argo player Mike Jeffcoat, the impressive victory of 12–2 against Winona State  showcased not only his  leadership, but also  the determination of  these young athletes.  Through  their  unwavering  dedication  and  teamwork, these young men earned the title of  national champions and have made Northwest  Florida proud. Their  inspiration and victory  was a grand slam not only for the team, but  for the University and the entire Gulf Coast.  On behalf of the United States Congress, I  congratulate the University of West Florida Argonauts  for  their  outstanding  accomplishments. My wife Vicki joins me in offering our  best wishes to the team, coaches, faculty, and  students at the University of West Florida for  their continued success.  f  HONORING  50 YEARS  OF  EXEMPLARY SERVICE BY THE FILIPINO LADIES ASSOCIATION OF  GUAM  HON.

328,,112,0.712,80,2011-06-13,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. Speaker, today, I would  like to recognize Jessica Boland, a third-grade  teacher at Rose Lane Elementary School  in  Phoenix, Arizona, who on April 28th, 2011, received the 2010 Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science. This honor  is recognition of teachers with an exemplary  record in both mathematics and science. Ms.  Boland  is one of only 85  recipients of  this  celebrated honor.  Ms. Boland always knew she wanted to be  a teacher. The goal of all teachers should be  to do everything possible to encourage, support, and promote excellence  in  the classroom, and she eagerly takes on this challenge  every day. Ms. Boland has proven that she is  up to this task, and while she is humbled and  honored by  this award,  the satisfaction she  gets every day when a classroom of eager  students ‘‘get it,’’ is by far her greatest reward.  Jessica’s day does not begin with the first  bell, nor does it end when her class is dismissed. She provides before and after school  assistance to students who are struggling with  their school work, offering a greater opportunity to succeed. She facilitates math academies for parents so that their children have  more than just one teacher to help them understand. Her belief is that if a parent can help  at home, then the child never runs out of opportunities to learn. She also works with student teachers who will soon be entering the  field of education. This allows for each new  generation of teachers to have a greater feeling of comfort when entering the classroom for  the first time. Students then receive a quality  education,  regardless of  the experience of  their teacher.  Few awards offer such esteem and honor  as  the Presidential Award  for Excellence  in  Mathematics and Science. This award is testimony to the gratitude that our nation shares  for teachers like Jessica Boland. I am proud  today  to enter  this  recognition of Jessica’s  achievements  into  the  RECORD, and hope that all teachers across our  great nation share  in  the  responsibility  that  she has undertaken. It is with great joy and  honor  that  I  recognize Jessica Boland, and  thank her with never-ending gratitude for giving her students  the greatest opportunity  to  succeed.

329,,112,0.284,80,2011-06-13,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, Marine Sergeant  Sean T. Callahan  of Warrenton, Virginia,  made the supreme sacrifice for his country on  April 23, 2011, while conducting combat operations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Sergeant Callahan was assigned antitank missile  duties and was with the 3rd Battalion of the  9th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II  Marine Expeditionary Force, based at Camp  Lejeune, North Carolina.  Sean  joined  the Marine Corps  in March  2008 and received a combat meritorious promotion to the grade of sergeant on February  2, 2011. He deployed in support of Operation  Iraqi Freedom from August until October 2009.  He deployed again in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom  in December,  2010. His  awards include a Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal,  Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Iraq Campaign  Medal, Global War  on  Terrorism Service  Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, and Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Valor  Device. Sean was escorted home from Dover,  Delaware, by his brother, Corporal Daniel J.  Callahan, who is assigned to the 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion  at Camp  Pendleton, California.  Sean was born on Flag Day, June 14, 1987,  in Manassas, Virginia,  the youngest of  four  children. He grew up in Prince William County  and graduated from Brentsville High School in  2005. He was an accomplished guitar player  who loved music and went out of his way to  encourage younger musicians to pursue their  shared love of music.  Sergeant Callahan’s leadership qualities, his  loyalty and dedication all  found a purpose  when he  joined  the United States Marine  Corps. He believed deeply in his calling to defend the freedoms granted in America and in  the defense of dignity and  freedom  in other  countries.  Sean was a true son of Virginia and will be  deeply missed by those who knew and loved  him.  f  SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title  IV  of Senate Resolution  4,  agreed to by the Senate on February 4,  1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all  meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference.

337,Senate,112,0.391,40,2011-06-21,Mr. JOHANNS.," Madam President,  over a year ago now, the President  signed into law health care legislation  that we are finding is certainly long on  promises but short on sound policy.  Unfortunately, the legislation did not  follow a transparent or thorough process.  Instead,  it was hastily  rushed  through on a premise that has now become  famous,  as  said  by Speaker  PELOSI: We have to pass it to see what  is in it. Now, almost daily, newspapers,  constituent mail, and independent reports continue to reveal that the law’s  promises are not reality.  Recently,  the  Columbus Dispatch  told the story of a family with a preexisting  condition. Two  years  ago,  their struggles to find health insurance  coverage outraged this administration.  In fact, their hardship was specifically  used as an example of why we needed  to get the health care system reformed.  Well, party affiliation did not define  how we felt about this family. We all  empathized and sympathized with their  struggles and recognized the need for  basic health  insurance reforms. But,  unfortunately, we did not harness that  common ground to develop sound policy that addresses the very real problems within the health care system. Instead,  a  bitterly  partisan  bill was  shoved through Congress, and now we  are stuck with its consequences.  So what are the consequences for the  family who struggled to get insurance?  The article reports that their annual  premium has  increased  a whopping  $12,000. Clearly, one result of the law is  soaring premiums. President Obama  promised no fewer than 20 times that  he would cut premiums by $2,500 for  the average family by the end of his  term. But, unfortunately, this is not an  isolated story. This broken promise is  evident in homes all across this great  Nation. Mail from frustrated Nebraskans continues to flood my office. They  question how a health care law that  costs so much yet still allows skyrocketing premiums could have ever  passed.  A single mother from Bellevue, NE,  recently found out that her family’s  health care premium increased by $700  per year. Her insurance provider explained it was due to mandates in the  new health care law.  She pleaded with me:  Please stand up on behalf of single moms  like me. We do all we can to hold our world  together, give up time with our children to  work two jobs . . . and now this! How am I  supposed to maintain health insurance for  my family?  Well, I wish I could tell constituents  their premiums will not go up, as the  President promised. I wish I could tell  them  the new health care  law addressed the rising costs of health care,  as the President promised it would. Instead, these stories reflect what the experts predicted would happen if the law  passed. The nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office  estimated  that  individual  health  insurance  premiums  would increase by an average of $2,100  per family due solely to the new mandates included in the law. That puts  the gap between Candidate Obama’s  promise and President Obama’s health  care law at an alarming $4,600 per family.  The administration’s own Medicare  Actuary expects health care costs to  increase $311 billion over the next decade under the new law. In fact, the Actuary  testified  that  the President’s  promise that the health care law would  lower costs was ‘‘false, more so than  true.’’  Now, some may say: MIKE, just wait  until the  law  is  fully  implemented.  That is when the promises will be fulfilled. But I continue to get reports on  my desk forecasting the negative consequences  of  this  irresponsible  and  shortsighted piece of legislation.  For example, one of the law’s major  flaws  is that about half of  its new  health insurance coverage is achieved  by locking millions of more people on  an already-broken Medicaid system.  Yet the New England Journal of Medicine recently released a study showing  those on Medicaid struggle to find doctors to treat them.  The medical  journal’s research revealed that 66 percent of individuals  who mentioned Medicaid’s Children  Health Insurance Program when calling to schedule a medical appointment  were denied an appointment  for the  child.  That is compared to only 11 percent  who said they had private insurance.  That  is right—those on Medicaid’s  CHIP were six times more likely to be  denied treatment.  And when Medicaid was accepted, the  children had to wait, on average, 22  days longer than those with private insurance.  Researchers blame low Medicaid payments, delays in paying, and bureaucratic  redtape driving doctors  from  even accepting these patients.  As a former Governor, I can tell you  that these problems have long plagued  the Medicaid Program.  Yet in 2014 the President’s new law  dramatically expands Medicaid, dumping over 24 million more Americans  onto this very broken system. How can  the President promise guaranteed coverage for these millions of Americans  when this study shows the majority of  our most vulnerable population is denied treatment under the Medicaid system? The bottom line is you cannot receive care if you cannot find a doctor  to provide it. The logic simply does not  match the promise.  Another recent study by the consulting group McKinsey & Company  calls another one of the President’s  guarantees into question. Their study  analyzed the impact of the health care  law on employer-sponsored benefits.  Prior to the health care law, America’s employers were the backbone of  our Nation’s health care system, providing  165 million Americans with  health care coverage. The McKinsey  study found that 30 percent of employers will definitely or probably stop offering their employees health care insurance after 2014.  During the health care debate, supporters of the law insisted that the law  builds on the principle of employer-  sponsored coverage.  The President even repeatedly promised if you like your plan, you can keep  it. But again, this appears to be an  empty promise.  According to the study—and others  that came before it—employees will be  stripped of plans that they like and  dumped onto the new law’s health care  exchanges to fend for themselves.  I realize there is some disagreement  surrounding this particular study. But  how can we deny this commonsense  logic?  The more you know about this law,  the more you conclude it just does not  make sense for employers to offer a  health care plan.  Beginning in 2014, the health care law  mandates that employers with more  than 50 workers offer health insurance  coverage or pay a penalty of $2,000 per  worker. And with this mandate comes  a slew of other requirements. Suddenly  dropping coverage and paying the $2,000  penalty becomes an economic necessity.  During  the health  care debate,  I  spoke about this on the Senate floor. I  and many others warned that the proposed penalties  for businesses would  create a perverse incentive. When you  do the math, I said back then this is no  penalty at all, compared to the cost of  private insurance.  It is a wise business decision if you  are worried about  the bottom  line.  That is how the law encourages employers to dump their employees onto  the exchange.  A Deloitte consultant told the Associated Press, ‘‘I don’t know if the intent was to find an exit strategy for  providing benefits, but the bill as written provides  the mechanism.’’ John  Deere has responded by saying businesses will look into ‘‘just paying the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:54 Feb 24, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S21JN1.REC S21JN1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

341,,112,0.57,82,2011-06-21,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise in  recognition of our youth who show an outstanding capacity  for service.  In particular,  I  would like to commend the achievements of  Brooks Byers of Flower Mound, Texas. Mr.  Byers is the newest winner of The Congressional Award Gold Medal, Congress’s only  and very prestigious award for youth.  Earning the Gold Medal requires great commitment and devotion to service; each award-  winner must spend two or more years completing more  than 400 hours of community  service Mr. Byers’s service projects included  organizing youth tennis camps and gift-wrapping fundraisers to raise more than $3,000 for  Susan G. Komen for the Cure, tutoring at-risk  children each week and  raising money  for  their after-school program  through a book  drive, and organizing homecoming celebrations for soldiers each weekend as part of the  Welcome Home a Hero Program.  Mr. Byers’s accomplishments do not end  here. The Congressional Award Gold Medal  also  requires participants  to  complete 200  hours of personal development and physical  fitness activities, which Brooks fulfilled through  a junior golf league and his high school’s tennis team. For the Expedition part of the Gold  Medal program, Brooks planned a trip to enrich his understanding of ancient European  history in Scotland and France.  The Congressional Award Gold Medal recognizes youth who show great  initiative and  an inspiring ability to reach complex, self-imposed goals. This experience, what Mr. Byers  himself calls  ‘‘transformative’’, shows an  incredible commitment  to excellence and  the  principles of our country’s future leaders. It is  an honor  for me  to have  the opportunity  to  recognize and represent Mr. Brooks Byers.  f  A TRIBUTE TO JOSE´R. SA´NCHEZ  HON.

342,,112,0.52,89,2011-06-21,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, many senior citizens who  travel  to Florida are doing so  to  enjoy  the  retired  life after years of working  while filling their days with hours spent on the  beach. Jack McKeon, from the Sixth District of  North Carolina, crushes this stereotype as he  begins his second term as manager of baseball’s Florida Marlins.  McKeon has the full support of his family to  leave his home in the town of Elon to return  to the world of professional baseball, a move  that makes him the second-oldest manager in  history. This  calculated  return  comes with  pressure as McKeon  led  the Marlins  to  the  2003 World Series championship. His age is  sometimes  criticized,  but  the  80-year-old  McKeon said,  ‘‘I  look at  it  this way—why  should experience get penalized?  I’ve managed since I was 14 years old. I’ll probably  manage until I’m 95.’’  Marlins president of baseball operations,  Larry  Beinfest,  said,  ‘‘It’s  good  to  see  [McKeon] back. He never really left. We turn  to him to help us at a very difficult time.’’ The  Florida Marlins seem to be in need of McKeon  after a recent 10-game losing streak and the  resignation of  former manager Edwin Rodriguez. McKeon  is passionate and optimistic  about his return and has high hopes for the  coming  season.  ‘‘I  don’t  need  this  job,’’  McKeon said, ‘‘but I love it.’’  From one octogenarian to another, and on  behalf of the citizens of the Sixth District of  North Carolina, we congratulate Jack McKeon  on  resuming his duties as manager of  the  Florida Marlins and wish him the best of luck  for the remainder of this season and for however long he wishes to manage. We know that  whenever he retires for good, we are sure that  it will be in the Sixth District of North Carolina.

343,Senate,112,-0.212,18,2011-06-27,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, Winston  Churchill once said, ‘‘We make a living  by what we get, but we make a life by  what we give.’’ Today  I honor  two  great Americans who have made a wonderful life by what they have given.  Lawrence and Barbara Weinberg, or  Larry and Barbi as their family and  friends know them, have given much to  their faith, to their country, and to  their family and friends. Today I call  attention to their service that the good  life they have made can serve as an example to us all.  Larry answered our Nation’s call to  duty and served in the U.S. Infantry in  France during World War II. He was  nearly killed by the explosion of a  landmine. While he was injured on the  ground, a German soldier bayonetted  him in the stomach. He remained motionless and isolated for over thirteen  hours. Against all odds, he was rescued  by a Catholic Army Chaplain and spent  a year recovering in the hospital.  After Larry was  discharged  from  both the hospital and the Army, he  met Barbi. It was the summer of 1946.  They married 6 months  later. Larry  then  started  a Los Angeles homebuilding business. He began with just  four houses, but built his company to  become the Larwin Group Companies,  the largest privately owned single-family housing producer  in  the United  States. He later became the principal  owner and CEO of the Portland Trailblazers from 1975–1988, and served on  the board of governors of the National  Basketball Association from 1980–1983.  Together, Larry and Barbi have been  unwavering supporters of the Jewish  community and Israel. In 1973, Barbi  was elected president of the Jewish  Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles, becoming the first woman to be  elected president of a major federation  in the United States. She used her position to expand the previously secular  Foundation to Orthodox, Conservative,  and Reformed Jewish congregations.  Larry also continued his work supporting the American-Israeli relationship. He was elected president of the  American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, in 1976 for 5 years, later  serving as its chairman from 1982–1987.  He is known as the founder of modern  AIPAC.  Larry established the Jewish Foundation Barbi Weinberg Chai Award to  honor individuals who have made an  outstanding contribution  to  the enhancement of and appreciation for Jewish life. Barbi sponsored a program to  prepare junior and senior high school  students with  the knowledge,  confidence, and training to speak up for  themselves and for Israel, and to fight  anti-Semitism and anti-Israel bias on  college campuses. These programs are  so important for our Nation’s youth.  In  1984, Barbi  founded  the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.  This research foundation has become  one of the most influential think tanks  in Washington, advising policymakers  on Middle East issues.  Larry and Barbi have lived a life of  dedicated public service. They are most  proud, however, of their loving dedication to their family. During their 64  years together, Larry and Barbi have 4  children, 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-  grandchildren. All  are hardworking,  successful Americans that share Larry  and Barbi’s  commitment  to  public  service.  Larry and Barbi truly have made a  good life by what they have given. I am  proud to consider myself a friend. And  may their service be an example to us  all.∑  f  LUBEC, MAINE  ∑",2011

346,House,112,-0.329,27,2011-07-11,Mr. DOYLE.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself 5 minutes.  I rise in opposition to this bill. I was  on the committee back in 2007 when we  first wrote  the  efficiency  standards  that Republicans are trying to repeal  here today. The way I remember it, our  current chairman, Mr. UPTON,  introduced the bill to set the standards. Our  former House Speaker, Dennis Hastert,  supported it, along with many Republicans. And, finally, President George  W. Bush signed these standards into  law.  In fact, if you look at the history behind consensus efficiency standard, you  will see that this used to be something  that we all agreed upon. Beginning  with President Reagan  in 1987, Congress and the White House have enacted Federal energy efficiency standards five times, each time with bipartisan support. These standards were developed as consensus agreements with  manufacturers, energy efficiency advocates, and States.  There’s more than 50 products on the  market today that are covered by a variety of these Federal standards. Everything from dishwashers and refrigerators to traffic signals have become  more efficient as a result of these Federal standards, saving the country energy and saving consumers money.  These standards have been in effect  since 1987, have saved Americans about  3.6 quads of energy. If we continue with  enacting Federal efficiency standards,  we can save up to 6.1 quads of energy  by 2030. That is more energy than was  used in my State of Pennsylvania in  2008. The light bulb efficiency standards alone will save Pennsylvania 3.64  billion kilowatt hours of energy in a  year. That means we’ll save $465 million  in Pennsylvania  in  just 1 year  from these standards.  In Congress we don’t always agree on  much; but for the last 25 years, we have  been able to agree on energy efficiency.  And it’s been good for the country and  for American families and for the environment. So why would we wish to reverse this policy today? But you know,  energy and cost savings aren’t the only  benefits from these standards.  Having lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, my whole life, I have seen how  efficiency can revolutionize an industry and revitalize a city. In the seventies, I worked two summers at J & L  steel mill on Pittsburgh’s south side.  The industry was doing well, and Pittsburgh was a company town. But in a  few years, that  industry came to a  screeching halt as international competitors were making steel using new  technologies and more efficient processes, allowing them to undercut the  price of U.S. steel. But the steel industry didn’t leave the United States, and  it  didn’t  leave  Pittsburgh.  It  reinvented  itself.  It got  smarter and  leaner and more energy efficient.  U.S. steelmakers started using blast  oxygen furnaces rather than old open  hearth furnaces that used more energy.  They started doing continuous casting  rather than ingots and molds that required reheating. They started using  waste heat recovery and energy monitoring and management technologies.  As a result, the U.S. steel industry has  reduced the amount of energy needed  to produce a ton of steel by 33 percent  since 1990.  The  lighting  industry has already  begun to revolutionize, much like the  industrial steel industry did back in  the nineties. When the industry agreed  to these efficiency standards in 2007, it  was because they knew they could innovate and still be profitable by making the  incandescent bulb, yes, colleagues, the incandescent bulb more efficient  and  developing  new  technologies like compact fluorescents and  LED light bulbs. And even better, the  lighting industry began making those  bulbs right here in the United States of  America. Even in Pennsylvania, Sylvania retooled a plant in St. Mary’s,  Pennsylvania, to make these incandescent light bulbs that meet the energy  efficiency standards that we passed in  2007.  b1740  They are being made in the United  States by United States steelworkers  in Pennsylvania, and you  can  find  them on your shelf at the grocery store  or the hardware store. Or you can get  these Philips bulbs, also incandescent  light bulbs, colleagues. They meet the  energy standards that were set in 2007.  Steelworkers are making  the  filaments  in these bulbs  in Bath, New  York. In fact, United Steelworkers is  opposing this bill and telling us at a  time when Americans continue to experience downward  financial pressures,  energy-efficient light bulbs present an  everyday solution to a much-needed  cost savings.  But it’s not just steelworkers that  are benefiting. Light bulbs that meet  these standards are being made all over  the United States of America.

347,House,112,0.605,41,2011-07-11,Mr. HARRIS.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Let me just briefly address this so  that we can move on.  We only cut $6 million out of the $8  million. There is actually budget language further on that protects a cooperative agreement between  the U.S.  and Israeli Governments, so it does not  eliminate all the funding; it protects  that program, and there will be another amendment offered  later  that  will make that quite specific.  I understand that there is some possibility of actually getting a benefit for  partnering—and I thank the ranking  member  for  offering  assistance—but  honestly, I’m not sure what we’re going  to learn from Kazakhstan by sending  money over there to provide training  on industrial efficiency. I thought that  we were the powerhouse of the world in  industry. I thought we were the leader  of the world. It’s fine when we have a  lot of money, but the fact of the matter is we borrow 40 cents out of every  dollar, and the largest program expenditure outside of the joint program with  Israel is that expenditure in China.  Now, I want everyone to understand  there is still money available. It’s in  the Department of State budget. This  doesn’t eliminate these programs. This  just removes the Department of Energy’s contribution. I will remind the  body why the Department of Energy  was formed years and years ago. It was  to reduce our dependency on foreign  oil, and it has failed to do so. It has existed for decades, failing to do the mission for which it was established. In  my district, people in private industry  tell me, if they had a division or a department that failed to do its job for  decades, they wouldn’t be cutting it  back—they’d be eliminating it.  So, again, I thank the chairman and  I thank the ranking member, and I  urge the body to support the amendment.  ",2011

Mr. Speaker, the first person I hired for my  office when I was elected back in 1976 was  Barbara, which was one of the best decisions  I have made during my 35 years in Congress.  From  the moment  I  took  the oath of office,  Barbara served the people of my district with  a level of selflessness, loyalty and dedication  to helping others  that  is unrivaled. You will  never meet a more reliable or meticulous staffer, or a more caring person than Barbara Donnelly was. She was a perfectionist with a  heart.  Throughout her career, Barbara touched the  lives of thousands of residents in my district.  From helping constituents with Social Security  or veterans benefits, to assisting with immigration difficulties or the adoption of a child, Barbara did it all with compassion, discretion and  determination. With Barbara at the helm of my  constituent service program, I knew that she  would not rest until our office had done everything possible to help people in need.  Barbara was the definition of a public servant, giving everything  to her  job and never  asking for any credit. People like Barbara are  the unsung heroes of public service, who work  day and night to help others and almost never  see their names in the newspapers or on TV.  Barbara did not seek glory or recognition for  her work, she only sought to improve the lives  of others.  Mr. Speaker, there are few people like Barbara in this world. I feel blessed to have had  the honor of knowing her and calling her my  colleague. Over the years, I learned a lot from  Barbara’s example and it is my hope that she  will inspire others to lives of public service and  good works.  Mr. Speaker, Barbara was an irreplaceable  friend, staffer and human being. My condolences go out to her family, friends and all the  people who had the privilege of knowing her  and working with her. At this time of great sorrow,  I ask  the House of Representatives  to  join me  in honoring  the  life and memory of  Barbara Donnelly.  f  A BILL TO AMEND THE AFRICAN  GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT  HON.

354,House,112,-0.35,3,2011-07-21,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, almost  no one in Washington is talking about  jobs. For 2 months now, both Chambers  of the Congress have been locked down  in talking about the debt ceiling.  Meanwhile, if you look back at the  Bush years, America lost over 8 million  jobs while the largest recession since  the Great Depression, was precipitated  by the Bush Wall Street bailout. America has only gotten back about 2 million jobs. Yes, only 2 million; still jobs  are being created at about 120,000 per  month. That is far from where we need  to head to achieve economic recovery  for all.  But rather than this Congress engaging in intelligent dialogue on how to  create jobs, we keep going down these  side roads to nowhere. Meanwhile, unemployment  just went  up  another  10,000 jobs. 10,000 more workers filed for  unemployment.  Every Member in both Chambers will  be judged on not doing the work that  the people want us to do. Instead Congress must focus on how to use the  power of the Federal Government to  create jobs.  If you take a look at what the Republican majority in the House wants to  do, they want to cut unemployment  benefits. That’s not even understandable to any rational person.  They want to cut food. I invite any  one of them, come to my district. Come  and stand in the food lines. See how it  feels. Better yet, help us pack some of  the food bags, and then distribute them  and give them to veterans who are  coming home from the wars who don’t  have jobs. And then ask yourself what  are you really doing here. What are  you doing here? America needs jobs.  What about health benefits for people  who’ve fallen out of work, and don’t  have any more health benefits for their  family? Why should we cut there?  You know, there are some who like  to proudly proclaim they’re pro-life.  Pro-life doesn’t only involve the period  before a child is born. It involves the  entire  life of a person, of a human  being until natural death.  I think there are some philosophical  questions our Members ought to be  asking themselves about helping the  American people at this critical point  in our history.  Now, all of us want to produce balanced budgets. When you have full employment, you get balanced budgets  and you even can get extra funds. Full  employment means you can pay down  your  long-term debt. But you don’t  hear anything up here being talked  about jobs. If it were happening, we’d  have more job creation. But we have  less job creation. More people are going  on unemployment benefits. So the current conversation and discussions are  totally off base.  Let’s just look at one sector where  America and the Federal Government  could save a lot of money. America, as  a country, spends over $250 billion a  year on prescription drugs. And nearly  a third of that amount is paid for by  the Federal Government, which actually means our people paying their fair  share of taxes, when they work, to the  Federal Government and then the Federal Government meeting  its obligations to our citizenry for their security  and our Nation’s future. Now, some of  my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are saying, cut Social Security,  cut Medicare. Hurt the American people. Hurt the people who have worked  for a  living. They don’t talk about  trimming  the  excess profits of  the  pharmaceutical  companies. So,  let’s  look at that pharmaceutical industry.  You know what? They’re not paying  their fair share into the Federal till.  Let’s just look at one bag of heparin  in a hospital for which Medicare ends  up paying over $600, and in total, millions and millions of dollars a year for  a product, a blood thinner that’s been  off patent for years. It’s made in China.  The  ingredients are made  in China.  They’re not even made here. Do you realize how much money a couple of companies are making off of selling just  that  one  product? My  Republican  friends aren’t trying to get fair prices  for the American people.  Celebrex, for treating arthritis, Medicare pays for an average patient $148 a  month. For Lipitor, for those trying to  lower cholesterol, $122 a month.  Now if you take a look at the profits  of Pfizer, Pfizer made $8.3 billion in  profits, and its CEO made $25 million  last year, just in what he’s willing to  admit. Johnson and Johnson made $13.3  billion  in  profits, while  their CEO  walked away with $29 million. Other  big drugmakers like Abbott Labs, $4.6  billion. These are with Bs—billions.  These aren’t with Ms—millions. These  aren’t millions; these are billions. And  Eli Lilly, $5 billion in profits our Federal Government is just forking over  billions all the time. Yes, the Federal  Government is the pharmaceutical industry’s biggest customer, and the industry surely knows it.  Why doesn’t the Federal Government  use its purchasing power to get better  bids on these drugs and have competitive bidding in order to purchase more  fairly-priced pharmaceuticals?

355,House,112,-0.611,17,2011-07-21,Ms. CLARKE of New York.," I thank  my good friend from Ohio for the time.  Madam Speaker, the Republican majority would like the American people  to believe that a near financial collapse never happened, never occurred.  To hear the majority’s narrative over  the course of the 112th Congress, you  would think that nothing is wrong with  the economy that deregulation and tax  cuts for multi-millionaires and billionaires can’t solve.  What  the Republican majority  refuses  to acknowledge  in  their  revisionist narrative is that their tax cuts  for multi-millionaires and billionaires  helped lead our country from surplus  into massive deficits.  The majority’s revisionist narrative  also omits the fact that years of deregulation and lax oversight of financial  institutions  is what caused the  economic downturn we are struggling  to fully recover from.  Madam Speaker, the near collapse of  the national economy not only cost the  American people billions of dollars in  bailouts but also resulted in millions of  Americans  losing  their  jobs,  their  homes and life savings through no fault  of their own.  The number one priority of the 112th  Congress should be to continue the economic recovery work of the 111th Congress. The American people expect the  other side to work with the President  and congressional Democrats to put  Americans back to work.  So  I  find  it unbelievable, Madam  Speaker, that, in the face of 9.2 percent  unemployment and when millions of  Americans are  struggling  simply  to  stay  in  their homes,  the majority  would declare war on the very agency  that would prevent a similar financial  crisis from ever happening again.  By decreasing accountability, muddling decision-making and starving it  for funds, the Republican majority is  threatening to turn the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into a gridlocked agency that cannot possibly fulfill their mandate as a financial industry watchdog,  leaving the American  people once again vulnerable to the  predatory lending that precipitated the  financial collapse in the first place.  Madam Speaker, the 112th Congress  has been in session for over 6 months,  and we still have not had one comprehensive jobs bill, nor have we voted  on one  single bill  that would help  struggling homeowners stay  in their  homes. We have, unfortunately, been  forced to vote to protect tax cuts for  multi-millionaires and billionaires, we  have voted to protect the profits of  companies who ship jobs overseas, and  we have voted on bills that undercut  the social safety net for Americans at  a  time when  the most  vulnerable  amongst us need it the most. In other  words, Madam Speaker, we have wasted the American people’s time.  If the Republican majority claims to  speak for the American people, then  perhaps  they  should  listen  to  the  American people, stop playing games  and bring legislation to the floor that  addresses the number one priority of  the American people: jobs.  By bringing this bill to the floor, the  Republican majority either doesn’t remember the recent financial crisis or  simply doesn’t care about the hardships facing the American people.  I support the gentlewoman from Ohio  in bringing this point of order.  ",2011

357,House,112,-0.385,17,2011-07-21,Ms. SPEIER.," I thank my good friend  from Ohio.  This  is getting old. The majority  knows it can’t kill an idea whose time  has come. So now they’re trying to  slow down the process, just like their  friends in the banking industry who  use tricks and traps to separate American  families  from their hard-earned  money. This bill is nothing more than  an attempt to turn the CFPB into the  Center For Profits and Big Business.  The Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau will provide  families a  level  playing field upon which to shop for  the  full range of  financial products.  Nothing is getting banned. Consumers  can still choose to make bad decisions  if they wish, but now they’ll have the  tools to be better informed through the  process. Instead of mountains of mortgage documents, they’ll get a simple-  to-read one-page document that they  can then use to answer crucial questions like, Is this something that I can  afford? Is this the best deal that I can  get?  The Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau is the most accountable regulatory body in the world. In fact, it has  a whole slew of regulators watching  and questioning everything it does. It  is required to undergo an annual GAO  report; have all enforcement actions  subject to appeal; and be regulated, in  turn, by every other agency on the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  Simply put, the CFPB helps families  hold on to the money they might otherwise give  to  the banks. And  the  banks hate that.  That is precisely why the majority  has  thrown  this  ridiculous  bill  together. Among other things, this legislation would require those regulating  predatory lenders to stop if their actions threatened the company’s ‘‘safety  and soundness.’’ In other words, their  profits.  We heard all about this issue when  we banned unreasonable penalties on  credit cards. At the time, the credit  card companies said this would absolutely crush their model. Well,  look  what’s happened. Are they still alive  and well? You bet they are. But the  truth  is this  legislation  isn’t really  about any of that. No, this is about the  only area where the majority has any  kind of legislative record: legislative  delay.  The anti-consumer bloc in this Congress is engaged in a legislative Ponzi  scheme. They’re helping Wall Street  suck a few more dollars out of American families before the inevitable happens and the CFPB stands up. Every  day politicians can stall the opening of  the bureau, well, that’s more profits.  Today, the CFPB is alive, and I want  every American to look at this opportunity to call this number. This is a  hotline available today for you to access if you’ve got problems with your  credit cards; but you had better act  now because the majority wants to  shut it down.  ",2011

I  just  want to take this time while he is coming into the Chamber to say that you  can almost hear  in  the background  very foreboding music as we are counting down the days. Here we are in a situation in which we cannot get a certain group of people over in the House  of Representatives to be willing to sit  down, and, as the Good Book says, to  come and let us reason together.  If we are going to govern this country, we have to come and reason together, people of goodwill who will respect each other’s point of view, to  hammer out a final agreement in order  to start bringing this country into balance. It is sad that it is taking this  long and this much of a difficult torturous process.  FLORIDA’SHISTORY  On a much happier note, at a subsequent time I want to share with the  Senate the wonderful heritage that we  have  in this country, not  from the  English but from the Spanish. We are  about to celebrate 500 years of the discovery of what is now America, the  United States,  from the Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon who first came to  the shores of my State. Then soon  thereafter we will celebrate the 450th  anniversary of the oldest continuous  settlement, a  settlement  that  is  42  years before the English came and settled Jamestown.  Those celebrations are going to be  not just for Florida and not just for St.  Augustine but for all of Florida and all  of the country. We have a commission  that has been appointed by the Secretary of the Interior. We have just  kicked off that commission. I will be  sharing with the Senate a lot about  this  historical  restoration  in  the  public’s mind of all of those Spanish  explorers who helped  establish  this  country, first with Ponce de Leon in  1513, and he came back in 1539.  By the way, the Puerto Rican community is quite energized and excited  about  this because Ponce de Leon,  when he came and found at the Feast  of Flowers, Pascua Florida—and thus  he named La Florida—he was the Governor of Puerto Rico.  So they are quite excited, as they  should be, and they will be part of this  celebration.  After him came a Spanish explorer  named de Ayllon, who sailed up the  coast.  Later, in 1527, came Spanish explorer  Narvaez, who landed somewhere in the  Tampa region and went up into the  panhandle of Florida.  After him came the Spanish explorer  Hernando de Soto in the late 1530s. He  ended up landing also in the Tampa  Bay region when, all over Florida, they  celebrated the first Christmas because  he had Spanish priests with him and  was in what is today Tallahassee by  Christmas Day. They celebrated the  first Christian Christmas by Europeans  in this new world of what is now the  United States. That was the late 1530s.  Then he ended up traveling all over the  United States, what is now the Southeastern United States.  Then along came de Luna thinking  he would have the first permanent settlement in 1559 in Pensacola, and in  1561, along came a hurricane, and it  wiped them out. We had the King and  Queen of Spain in Pensacola on that  anniversary back in 2009.  Then later came the French thinking  they were going to set up the first permanent settlement at Fort Carline at  the mouth of what is today the St.  John’s River at Jacksonville in 1564.  But when they heard that the Spanish  explorer Menendez had come 30 miles  to the south to set up this permanent  settlement  at  St. Augustine,  they  sailed to wipe out the Spanish colony  and instead got hit by a hurricane and  were shipwrecked and thus dispatched  by  the Spanish  explorer Menendez.  From there, St. Augustine continued  all the way to the present day. You  ought to see that restored city. It is a  sight to behold, and it is not only the  history of St. Augustine, the history of  Florida, it is the history of this United  States.  I will share a lot more about our  Spanish history, our roots in this country. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts  for his kind  indulgence  so  that I might share this with the Senate.  I yield the floor.  ",2011

364,,112,-0.302,164,2011-07-21,Ms. BERKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to call  my colleagues’ attention to the 37th anniversary of the Turkish tragic invasion of Cyprus.  Turkey’s unlawful occupation, which began on  this day  in 1974,  left  thousands of  innocent  Greek Cypriot civilians without  their homes,  their land, and their families. It is crucial for us  to commemorate this unfortunate situation and  assist the people of Cyprus in reaching a solution.  Many of the Cypriot generation who suffered  the invasion have not lived to see justice or a  resolution  to  this conflict. Although many of  the survivors have had the opportunity to return to their homes on the northern side of the  island, it was only to discover them occupied  by Turkish settlers.  Only Turkey recognizes the occupied northern side of the country as a Turkish Cypriot  state, but  it does not even provide a valid  standard of living to their own citizens. This  was made evident  through  the recent demonstrations by Turkish Cypriots who have displayed their own dissatisfaction with the Turkish occupation.  Thirty-seven years after  the  invasion,  the  Turkish government continues to throw obstacles in the path to peace. Instead of compromising, Turkey threatens a deadlock on relations between Turkey and the European Union  if the Republic of Cyprus takes over the presidency of the European Union in July 2012. It  is clear that Cypriots of all kinds are ready for  peace, but how can peace be reached when  Turkey will not even accept Cyprus as a member of  the European Union? The  time has  come for Turkey to end their threats, withdraw  their troops, and return the territory that is not  rightfully theirs. That way, the Cypriots—and  the Cypriots alone—can make  the decisions  affecting their future.  f  DEBT REDUCTION PLANS EFFECTS  ON POVERTY  HON. MARCIA L.

365,,112,-0.587,164,2011-07-21,Ms. FUDGE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  highlight the devastating effects of the Republican agenda on  the poor. Debt  reduction  plans that gut social safety net programs will  put millions of low-income families at risk.  According to the U.S. Census, the number  of people in poverty in 2009—43.6 million—is  the largest number in the 51 years for which  poverty estimates have been published.  In my home state of Ohio, 15.2 percent of  the state’s population lived in poverty in 2009.  Among African-American seniors, 67 percent  are at or below the poverty line, and 12 percent of African Americans rely on Medicare to  survive.  Cuts to Medicaid will disproportionately affect African-American communities.  In 2009,  27  percent  of  African-Americans—approximately 10 million people,  including 6 million  children—were covered by Medicaid.  When everyone talks about the budget, all  you hear about are numbers. Behind  those  numbers are people: hard-working Americans  or the unemployed or those who are just getting by.  There is an urgent need to resolve the debt  ceiling issue and it is beyond irresponsible not  to raise the debt limit. We all agree that we  have to responsibly reduce the deficit, but not  on the backs of the most vulnerable. My job  in Congress is to be a voice for the voiceless  and I will fight to help these Americans by opposing the Republican budget.

William  must act as a mathematician, a physician, a  personal  trainer and a dietician  just  to stay  alive. His insulin pump functions as his lifeline.  This summer William  joined 150 children  and teens who participated in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Children’s Congress  in Washington, DC. Collectively,  they  are  fighting  for a cure and working  to help  raise research money for this chronic, debilitating disease  that affects nearly 26 million  Americans nationwide.  William  is entering high school  in  the  fall  and wants a cure for Type 1 diabetes so the  disease doesn’t change the course of his future. His dream  is  to become a commercial  pilot, but current rules prevent those who have  Type 1 diabetes from getting a license.

It  is my pleasure  to  recognize  the  Women’s Civic Improvement Club’s dedication  to promoting  the professional and personal  growth of members of the Sacramento region.  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring their leadership.  The Women’s  Civic  Improvement  Club  began in 1936 as the Negro Women’s Civic  Improvement Club. The Club was created to  provide housing for African American women  that had moved to Sacramento to work at the  McClellan Air Force Base. At the time, racial  segregation and  the  financial devastation of  the Great Depression made  finding a safe  home next to impossible for many women. In  1945, the Club’s Board of Directors signed incorporation  papers  and  the  name  was  changed, making it the WCIC that we know of  today. Throughout all of the changes our nation has faced since 1936, the WCIC has remained strong and relevant to those of us in  Sacramento.  Over the course of the last 75 years, the  WCIC has evolved  into an organization  that  helps people from low-income and disadvantaged families. The Club has expanded to include several new programs, helping individuals of all ages grow through community involvement. Their congregate meal program  provides  food and  recreational activities  for  senior citizens, allows members of  the program to get a healthy meal, and provides opportunities to socialize and be involved in the  community. Moreover,  the Playmate Head  Start Program provides quality childcare to its  members and has maintained an excellent  focus on healthy child development.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to  the Women’s Civic Improvement Club on their  75th anniversary, and  to  their outstanding  commitment to improve our community. I ask  my colleagues  to  join with me  in congratulating them on their 75 years of success.  f  PROCLAMATION  HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR.

First, with all the conflict and frustration surrounding this vote, I’m reverting to basic principles. One of which is, ‘‘don’t negotiate with  thugs.’’ It’s been long obvious that we have no  partner with whom to negotiate; only a party  that started as our comrades in government,  then our colleagues, who evolved into our opponents, declared  themselves our enemies  and now demand that we be their enablers. I  refuse to play.  Thugs are in the game to destroy, not build.  They would destroy the government, and especially this presidency. They take hostages,  and there is much work at stake that would be  their next targets. It will be endless. The president has given into all of their demands, and  they remain insatiable. It’s time we starved the  beast. Then . . .  They came  to Washington  they say committed not to do business as usual. Then they  demanded  that we protect every  loophole,  every billionaire and every greedy element in  our society except those who need some help.  They set-up something that is their fail safe.  I call it the ‘‘Kevorkian Commission’’ that will  deliver  the poison  if  in November, we don’t  volunteer to do it ourselves.  We Democrats in the House were not at the  table, and we wind up on the menu.  There are arguments  that are valid and  good for voting ‘‘aye.’’ But I didn’t come to this  place to forget the homeless, the hapless and  the hungry.  The most vulnerable  in our society don’t  watch their 401K plan, the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the futures market. Their future is getting through till tomorrow. They are  more concerned about having a roof than they  are the national debt ceiling. They need jobs,  nutrition, education and encouragement. The  time we’ve spent on this debate would indicate  that we’ve bought into the trickledown theory.  Here’s what I know: the people I came here  to help need real help. Their lives and future  are really endangered. What happens  to us  people with portfolios, and Wall Street watchers is scary, but conjecture.

371,House,112,0.388,17,2011-09-15,Mr. BUCSHON.,"  you, Mr.  Thank  KLINE.  Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to talk  about jobs. The first thing I want to do  is correct this ridiculous notion that  this bill causes jobs to go overseas. I  would argue it does just the opposite.  Just like Dr. ROE, I grew up in a  union household. My  father was  a  United Mine Worker, and that’s why I  am here today. I was elected to Congress to protect all workers, not just a  select few.  Ninety-three  percent  of American  workers are not in a union; 7 percent  are, in the private sector. The National  Labor Relations Board complaint is an  attack on American job creators.  Again, I was elected to protect all  workers, not just a select few.  The NLRB’s decision to punish Boeing for creating 1,100 new jobs is just  another example of the administration  abusing its position to advance a biased agenda. I want to remind everyone  no jobs were taken from Washington  State.  This  is a straightforward bill that  prohibits the NLRB from ordering an  employer to close, relocate, or transfer  employment under any circumstances.  This bill will create an environment  necessary  for  employers  to  develop  their businesses in the State that offers the best opportunity—and, I would  argue, in the best country that offers  the best opportunity—to grow and create jobs and not have this left up to a  board  of  unelected  bureaucrats  in  Washington, D.C.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and  let’s get America back to  work.  ",2011
372,House,112,0.663,17,2011-09-15,Mr. GOWDY.," I want to thank the  chairman  for his  leadership on this  issue and so many others on the Education and Workforce Committee.  Mr. Speaker, the NLRA is supposed  to balance the rights of employees, employers, and the general public, but  you would never know that from the  recent  actions  of  the NLRB. This  unelected group of executive branch recess appointees has abandoned all pretense of objectivity and has become,  frankly, nothing more than a taxpayer-  funded law firm for Big Labor.  Boeing is the most glaring example  of their overreach, but it is not the  only one. At a time when union membership is at a historic low, the NLRB  seeks to give Big Labor a historically  high level of influence with this administration, whether  it’s quickie elections or mandating advocacy posters in  the workplace or this, the economic  death penalty. The NLRB is out of control and it needs to be reined in so it  does not do even more damage to this  fragile economy.  With respect to the bill at hand in  which my  friend and colleague Mr.  SCOTTseeks to remove a single remedy  from the arsenal of the NLRB, leaving  a dozen other remedies, this bill simply  says that you cannot force Boeing to  close a billion-dollar facility, which is  already being constructed in Charleston, and fire the thousand workers who  have been hired and send the work  back to Washington State, which  is  tantamount  to  the  economic  death  penalty. Not a single worker has lost a  job or a benefit in Washington State,  Mr. Speaker, when Boeing started this  separate, distinct supply line.  The NLRB thinks a company should  stay in a union State no matter how  many work stoppages there are, no  matter  how many  customers  have  threatened  to go do business  somewhere else because they can’t get their  planes on time, no matter how many  fines have been paid because of late delivery of airplanes because of work  stoppages, no matter what. No matter  how much money is lost, Mr. Speaker,  the NLRB thinks that Boeing should  have to stay in a union State because  it planted a flag originally in a union  State.  This Congress has limited civil remedies when they have been abused. This  Congress has limited criminal remedies  whether they have been abused. And  this Congress must limit administrative  remedies when  they are being  abused, as they are now. Even the Chicago Tribune, Mr. Speaker, hardly a  bastion of conservative thought, acknowledges that the NLRB is out of  control.

375,Senate,112,-0.438,94,2011-09-15,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. President, I  rise to speak today as citizens of Lorain County, OH soon gather to honor  one of their favorite sons, ADM Ernest  Joseph King, an American hero, who  served as commander in chief of the  U.S. Fleet, and Chief of Naval Operations during World War II.  This Sunday, September 18, 2011, Admiral King’s memory will be honored  with  a  Lorain  elementary  school  named  in his honor. An open green  space, in the shape of an anchor, will  be dedicated directly across the street  from the admiral’s birthplace, a home  at  113 Hamilton Avenue  that  still  stands  today. Both  the  elementary  school and the green space will remind  future generations of  the admiral’s  contributions to our country and the  personal  traits  that made  him  an  American hero: tenacity, love of country, fearlessness.  Ernest Joseph King was born in Lorain on November 23, 1878, to Elizabeth  and James Clydesdale King. He was the  older brother to two sisters and two  brothers. Admiral King attended Lorain High School and graduated fourth  in his class from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1901. Still enrolled at the Naval  Academy, he  served  in  the Spanish  American War. In 1905, he married Martha Lankin Edgerton  in Baltimore,  with whom he raised six daughters and  a son. King was known to return to Lorain throughout his  life to visit his  childhood friends.  After his  distinguished  service  in  World War I, in 1927, he became a naval  aviator, and only 6 years later, he was  made chief of  the Bureau of Aeronautics of the U.S. Navy, where he  made patrol bombers an essential naval  arm. He was appointed by President  Franklin D. Roosevelt in World War II  as chief of the U.S. Fleet and Chief of  Naval Operations, taking the post only  2 weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He earned his nickname, Eagle  Eye Ernie, by possessing boundless energy, and being a strict disciplinarian.  He retired from the Navy as a decorated officer, having been awarded 10  medals and 14 Foreign Awards, including  the Navy Distinguished Service  Medal and the National Defense Service Medal. Upon Admiral King’s passing, on June 25, 1956, President Eisenhower remarked:  ‘‘Admiral King carried his heavy responsibility with courage, brilliance and continued devotion  to duty.’’  This weekend, the city of Lorain, the  Black  River  Historical  Society,  Charleston Village  Society,  Lorain  City Schools, along with several members of Admiral King’s family will join  together to honor the  legacy of an  American hero. For  school children  who will attend Admiral King Elementary School, and for all Lorain residents who will pass by his home on  Hamilton Avenue, let us remember the  lessons of Admiral Ernest Joseph King,  that patriotism and service forever anchors the greatness of our Nation.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  TRIBUTE TO SHELLY  FAGENSTROM  ∑",2011
376,,112,-0.53,115,2011-09-15,Ms. MOORE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Antonio M. ‘‘Tony’’ Pe´rez, recipient of  the 2011 Frank P. Zeidler Public Service  Award. Mr. Pe´rez is a long-time social justice  advocate, mentor, community leader and consummate professional. He currently serves as  secretary-executive director of  the Housing  Authority of  the City of Milwaukee (HACM).  The Frank P. Zeidler Public Service Award acknowledges residents whose efforts most embody the social justice and public service values and vision of former Mayor Zeidler, who  died in 2006 at the age of 93.  Mr. Pe´rez’ body of work has been exemplary. He founded the Milwaukee Community  Service Corps (MCSC), a non-profit vocational  training organization that continues to provide  employment and education to young adults in  Milwaukee.  It was modelled after  the 1930s  Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Mr. Pe´rez  developed a holistic program  that  integrates  education and life skills with on-the-job work  experience  for  low-income 18–23-year-olds.  During his  tenure at MCSC  from 1991  to  2000, more than 900 participants found jobs  and  received more  than $4.5 million  in  income. MCSC serves an average of 100 young  participants per year and has served approximately 2,000 young adults since its inception.  In 1996, Mr. Pe´rez was one of six inspirational youth role models and mentors profiled  on PBS’, ‘‘The Merrow Report: Searching for  Heroes’’. Mr. Pe´rez serves on a number of  prestigious committees and has received numerous awards including member of the Executive Committee of  the AmeriCorps National  Civilian Community Corps, past president of  the National Association of Service and Conservation Corps, and has served as a consultant to the Peace Corps. In 2006, HACM received  the  prestigious World  Leadership  Award in London, England for developing solutions to housing that are innovative to city  leaders around the world. Also, in 2007 Mr.  Pe´rez was recognized by the National Child  Labor Committee with the Lewis Hine Award.  At HACM, Mr. Pe´rez oversees an  internationally-recognized agency that provides affordable housing options for over 12,000 low-  income families, elderly and disabled persons  in  the City of Milwaukee. During his  tenure,  the agency received or leveraged more than  $265 million  in development  resources. Accomplishments while at HACM  include  the  construction of the $28 million Milwaukee Job  Corps Center in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Labor. The facility opened in the  fall 2010 and has resulted in the creation of  over 125 administrative, teaching, health care  and service jobs. Additionally, during his tenure the City of Milwaukee obtained a five-year,  $24 million federal Enterprise Zone grant that  helped thousands of youth gain training and  employment.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud Antonio M. ‘‘Tony’’  Pe´rez hails from the 4th Congressional District  and that I can call him friend. I am honored to  give praise to his many accomplishments and  life time commitment to youth and the entire  Milwaukee Community. I wish him many more  years of success.  f  HONORING AUSTIN SALMON  HON. SAM GRAVES  OFMISSOURI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 15, 2011  ",2011
377,,112,-0.465,115,2011-09-15,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of  the Pharmaceutical Stewardship  Act of 2011.  Across  the country, unused and expired  pharmaceuticals are polluting our water ways,  poisoning our children, and putting our public  safety at risk. Americans should have a convenient and safe option when they want to rid  their cabinets of unused drugs. The pharmaceutical stewardship bill  I  introduced  today  would ensure that these drugs are kept out of  drinking water and out of the hands of both  criminals and unsuspecting children.  The need for a safe drug disposal program  has never been greater. In a 2008 investigation, pharmaceutical contamination was found  in 24 out of 28 metropolitan areas’ drinking  water. Over 50 pharmaceuticals or byproducts  were found in the Philadelphia source watershed alone.  Unlike the citizens of approximately a dozen  other countries, Americans do not have a convenient and consistent place  to bring  their  medications. Without a drug  take back program, pharmaceuticals are frequently diverted  to purposes for which they were not intended.  The results can be deadly. Unguarded, unused pharmaceuticals can cause accidental  poisonings, be misused, or diverted for criminal purposes.  Every fifteen minutes, a child under four will  overdose on drugs found at home. In 2011,  the Centers  for Disease Control  (CDC)  reported  that unintentional prescription opioid  overdoses now kill more Americans than cocaine and heroin combined.  In Florida,  the  death rate for prescription drugs increased 84  percent.  Without safe disposal options, our most vulnerable and unsuspecting citizens are in the  bull’s eye of a proliferating pharmaceutical  black market. The elderly are at risk of violent  home break-ins, scams, and death as prescription drug addicts seek to steal their medications.  Drug  thieves  also  target  ‘open  house’  events and ask to use the bathroom in order  to have access to the medicine cabinet. The  problem  is so rampant  that realtors  in Ohio  are given medication lockboxes to store medications during open houses and the National  Association of Realtors recommends hiding all  prescription medications during open houses.  Americans who want to reduce the threat to  their health and safety posed by leftover prescription medications have few options.  Federal agencies from the Office of National  Drug Control Policy to the Drug Enforcement  Agency are encouraging Americans to use secure medicine  take-back programs  to return  drugs for environmentally sound disposal. But  these programs are too few and far between,  and communities are struggling  to provide  them. Because secure  take-back programs  are not widely available,  the FDA currently  recommends that the most toxic and addictive  substances be flushed down the toilet and into  the wastewater system. When take-back programs are not available, federal agencies are  forced to advise that all other unwanted pills  should be mixed with undesirable substances  in an attempt to prevent theft and then thrown  in the trash for delivery to the landfill.  The  current disposal methods are  inadequate and even dangerous. A mother with  Crohn’s disease was prescribed an opioid  patch 100 times stronger than morphine but  she was afraid her plumbing could not handle  the used patch so she threw it away. Her 4-  year old died after  finding and applying  the  patch from the trash.  Furthermore, pharmaceuticals disposed  in  the trash or down the drain reach our nation’s  waterways and our drinking water.  In 2002, the United States Geological Survey found that 80 percent of streams and 93  percent of groundwater was contaminated with  at least one pharmaceutical. In 2008, an investigation found that at least 46 million Americans  are  exposed  to  prescription  drugs  through  their drinking water. Others are exposed when food crops are fertilized with polluted biosolids and absorb pharmaceuticals  through the roots to the plant itself. Perhaps  even more frightening is that the current extent of pharmaceutical pollution  is unknown  and understudied.  Aquatic organisms and  indeed whole ecosystems can never escape this witches brew  of pharmaceuticals. The USGS  recently  reported the widespread sexual disruption in fish  across the United States.

Pat Taylor, who  has served as president of Southwest  Baptist University in Bolivar, MO, for  the last 15 years, making him the longest serving president in the 133-year  history of the school. Dr. Taylor already had an impressive record in higher education before coming to SBU in  1996. In the last 15 years he has added  to that record of accomplishment and  earned respect for his leadership and  dedication to the students and community at Southwest Baptist University.  Southwest Baptist University  is a  very special place to me. I earned my  undergraduate  degree  there  and  20  years later served 4 years as its President. Dr. Taylor is my successor, and I  have enjoyed watching the university  grow and get even better under his  leadership.  During  his  SBU:  Dr. Taylor has presented a record  11,881 degrees since 1996.  SBU  has Missouri’s  third  largest  nursing degree program on its Springfield campus.  The number of student missionaries  sent out in North American has doubled to more than 400 in the last decade, and Dr. Taylor hopes to see that  continue to increase.  remarkable  tenure  at  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:04 Sep 27, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A26SE6.019 S26SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011
379,House,112,0.66,9,2011-10-04,Mr. POMPEO.," Mr. Speaker,  since  coming to Congress 9 years ago, I have  sadly relearned that the government in  Washington D.C. only grows and grows  and grows. When Democrats and many  Republicans, too, come to the floor of  the House and  talk about  spending  cuts, they are often talking simply  about slowing the rate of growth of  government. There is seldom, if ever,  any real discussion about cutting the  size of  the Federal Government or  about eliminating an entire program or  agency. But today, with $14.8 trillion in  debt, we can’t continue to simply slow  the rate of growth. We’ve got to cut it,  and we’ve got to get rid of some things.  As a first step this week, I will proffer a bill that will eliminate the Economic Development Agency. It’s part  of the Department of Commerce and  was established in 1965 as an element of  President Johnson’s Great Society. For  over 45 years, the EDA has spent billions on  local projects, not national  projects, trying to pick winners and  losers amongst various projects by region, industry, and community. Much  like a stimulus bill or earmarks, the  EDA provides loans and grants to pet  projects  of  the  administration  in  power.  In 2008, the EDA spent $2 million on  the Harry Reid Research and Technology Park at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Just  last year,  it  spent $25 million on the Global Climate  Mitigation Incentive Fund. This year,  the agency will spend almost $300 million of  taxpayer dollars. Now,  this  might not sound like a lot of money  sometimes here in Washington, D.C.,  but  in Newton,  in  Independence,  in  Wichita,  and  in  Goddard,  Kansas,  that’s still a lot of money.  I want to take just a minute to talk  about the EDA. Most folks in Congress  and most  folks back  in Kansas will  have never heard of it. I had not before  I entered Congress. It provides these  grants and loans to projects it selects  all over the country. At its very core,  the EDA is nothing more than a giant  wealth redistribution machine. It takes  money from people in one place and at  one time and redistributes it all across  the  country  for  inherently  local  projects.  For example, it gave $2 million to the  ‘‘culinary amphitheater,’’ wine tasting  room, and gift  shop  in Washington  State. It gave $350,000 to renovate a  theater in Colorado. In 2011, it gave $1.4  million to build infrastructure development so that a steel plant of $1.6 billion could be built in Minnesota. Like  the vast majority of projects,  that  steel plant would have been built without Federal taxpayer dollars. It was a  $1.6 billion project helped by the Federal Government to the tune of only  $1.4 million.  Our even bigger problem, however, is  with EDA. It’s duplicative. It’s just one  of at least 80 Federal economic development agencies. HUD and Ag and HHS  all have economic development grants  as well.  Second, it’s ineffective. It typically  provides a very small part of any given  project. The GAO reports that most of  its financing did not have any significant effect on the success of projects  and produced, at best, inconclusive results and, in some cases, may even detract from a more flexible workforce.  Third, this is an incredibly wasteful  agency. It was identified by GAO as  one of the agencies that ought to go  away. Indeed, a recent inspector general audit of 10 projects totaling $45  million showed that 29 percent of the  grant money had been wasted due to  various violations of EDA grant requirements. Four of the 10 projects  EDA funded in that group were never  completed.  Finally  and  perhaps more  importantly, this is not the role of the Federal Government. As the Cato Institute  has written, the Federal Government  has no business trying to direct economic activity through politicized subsidy vehicles like the EDA. We’ve seen  that with bad outcomes,  like with  Solyndra, only too recently.  Every great  journey starts with a  single step. This is a small agency, but  it’s time for the first time in decades  that we eliminate an entire program,  an entire agency, so that it cannot continue to grow and grow and grow as  part of our Federal Government.  I  would ask my colleagues to support the  EDA Elimination Act.  f  POVERTY  ",2011
380,House,112,-0.562,16,2011-10-04,Ms. EDWARDS.," Mr. Speaker,  the  other side has been in the majority for  39 weeks and they still haven’t passed  a single piece of legislation to create  jobs or help small businesses. And now  they reject out-of-hand, commonsense  ideas in the American Jobs Act that  would help small business owners who  really are the economic engine responsible for creating 70 percent of the jobs  in this country.  Last week, I visited with small business owners  like Susan Bishop,  the  owner of Jaha Hair Studio. She has  been in business 16 years, has eight employees, and she has found it impossible to get a $30,000 credit extension to  meet payroll from a bank that she has  done business with for 16 years. She  wants to expand her business, to hire  others, to train others, and she can’t do  it, but she could with the American  Jobs Act.  Constituents  Abeba  and  Lene  Tsegaye, owners of Kefa Cafe, told me  that they would actually hire someone  if they could get the tax credits available in the American Jobs Act.  So why aren’t we doing it, doing it  for the owners of Kefa Cafe and other  small businesses throughout my congressional district? These are real job  creators. It’s time for this to be our top  priority.  Pass  the American Jobs Act. Get  America back to work. It’s time for the  majority to act.  f  b1230  PENDING FREE TRADE  AGREEMENTS  (Mr. MORAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

381,House,112,-0.256,30,2011-10-04,Mr. CARNEY.," I thank my colleague  from Hawaii, one of the other small  States. I know you’re a delegation of  two; we’re a delegation of one. I represent the whole State of Delaware. I  tell my constituents that we have two  Senators and one Member of Congress.  That means that I have to work twice  as hard, Mr. Speaker, to serve the people in my State.  I’m pleased to join my freshman colleagues on the Democratic side of the  aisle this afternoon for our discussion  about small business and job creation,  and I’d  like to talk  for a  little bit  about the situation in my State, the  State of Delaware.  All of us are coming off a district  work week, where we spent our time,  I’m sure, meeting with constituents,  talking to business owners, small business owners, large business owners, and  working our districts. And I did the  same thing in Delaware, not too far  from the Capitol here. I would like to  highlight two meetings that I had in  particular. One was a job fair that we  held in Georgetown, Delaware, which is  the county seat in the lower part of our  State. Many people  from the Washington, D.C. area know Georgetown as  they pass through it to go to our lovely  beaches during the summer time to  enjoy time with their family at the  beach.  This particular day we sponsored a  job fair in Georgetown, along with Senator CARPERand Senator COONS. This  was a program  that Senator COONS  championed  in Wilmington  initially,  and we’ve moved it now to the other  two counties of our State and had a job  fair in Dover and a job fair in Georgetown this past week, really helping to  connect those folks in our State who  are  unemployed  or  underemployed,  people looking to move up with employers who are looking to hire. And  even though we have over 9 percent unemployment nationally and a little bit  over 8 percent unemployment in our  State of Delaware, there are still a lot  of  jobs that go wanting, mostly because the employers are not able to  find people  that have  the  required  skills for that particular enterprise.  So the good news about this job fair  is that we had 55 employers there,  many of whom were prepared to hire  people and offer them jobs, certainly  take resumes and interview people or  set up interviews. But we had over 8,000  people who came seeking employment  or seeking an upgrade in their current  job situation. And that’s a lot of people  in the small State of Delaware in the  least populous area of our State. So it  tells us the very serious problem that  we have with the lack of jobs and the  lack of skills that people might have to  do the jobs that are out there.  Later on in the week, I met at PATS  Aircraft, which is an airplane manufacturing facility at Georgetown Airport.  They’ve been hiring airplane mechanics over the last several years. In fact,  when I was lieutenant governor, one of  the biggest problems that they had was  finding workers that had the requisite  skills to do the jobs that they had.  Now, they have since lost some of that  work; but they were looking ahead and  anticipating,  with  some  assistance  from the FAA, to extend the runway  there  at Georgetown Airport—going  back to your point about the need for  infrastructure to stir business development, business growth and  job creation. If we were able to extend the  runway  there at  the airport, PATS  would be able to hire more mechanics.  But there are a  lot of people out  there, while they might want those  jobs, would not have the skills to do  the work. And so Delaware Technical  and Community College, with the help  of the State government, has developed  a training program specifically to prepare workers for that facility and other  airplane manufacturing  facilities  in  our region.  b1450  We have a Dassault Falcon plant,  which does airplane maintenance and  mechanics at the New Castle County  Airport, as well as a large Boeing facility over the line in southeastern Pennsylvania. So these are jobs. They are  highly skilled jobs. They are jobs that  require mechanical ability. They are  jobs that require training. And there  are certainly lots of folks out there  that are looking for employment, and  these are the kinds of jobs that we need  to prepare people for.  One of the press conferences we had  this week was at Delaware Technical &  Community College where we highlighted a Federal grant that was going  to Delaware Tech to create training  programs for businesses, basically to  enable people to upgrade their skills to  take the jobs that are available. One of  the problems, obviously, that we have  in our country—and  the President’s  employment council has identified this  problem—is that we have jobs that are  out there, but we don’t have people  with the right kinds of skills for those  jobs. So we need to have programs—  and this  is where the public sector  comes into play, particularly technical  and  community  colleges—to provide  that training and those skills for those  folks.  Later on  in the week,  I met and  spoke with the Georgetown Chamber of  Commerce; and the Georgetown Chamber, of course, is comprised mostly of  very small businesses. They had a really simple message for me, as a Member  of Congress, and that is that they see  their businesses struggling because of a  lack of confidence among consumers.  And when you think about the U.S.  economy at large, about 70 percent of  economic activity is consumer driven.  So when consumers don’t have confidence either in their employment situation in the present—they may not be  employed—or their future employment  situation, they’re not willing to spend  money on small business services or  products in the community and, therefore, these small businesses suffer.  So their message to me was really a  simple one,  twofold. One  is: Do no  harm in Washington, DC. Do the work  of the people, solve the problems that  we have, and inspire confidence. And I  think one of the ways that we can do  that—there’s a lot of discussion. Most  of the discussion that I hear from my  constituents in the State of Delaware—  and we’ve had  town hall meetings.  We’re going to have a telephone town  hall meeting tonight. I’m sure I will  hear the same thing: Enough with the  partisan  bickering  back  and  forth  across the aisle. Let’s  focus on the  challenges that we face—creating jobs  and strengthening businesses, creating  a business climate in the short term  where  businesses  can  thrive, where  consumers  can  have  confidence  so  they’ll be willing to spend on small  businesses and other procurement. And  in the long term, address our deficits,  our debt, and our budget imbalances.  If we’re able to do that, we’ll at least  provide some confidence to the people  that we represent that those that they  send from Delaware, the Members of  the House of Representatives here and  our Senators across the Capitol, are  doing their part, are working together,  are focused on not the politics of where  we all stand in relation to the next  election but on solving the problems  that face our country.  I think the vote that we have coming  at the end of this year, which will be  the result of the work of the Committee on the Budget, will be maybe  one of the most important votes in a  number of years. I have heard our majority whip STENYHOYERrefer to it as  the most important vote here in the  last 30 years. And I think that’s right  in many respects, because people out  there, my constituents, your constituents, Ms. HANABUSA, in Hawaii—I see  our colleague from Rhode Island (Mr.  CICILLINE) has joined us as well—our  constituents are asking us, begging us  to do our work to inspire confidence  and to do the right thing for the country. And that involves giving people  the skills they need to be able to do the  jobs that are available out there, creating  confidence  so  businesses  can  make investments, so people will be  willing to spend money and consume so  our economy will get back on its feet  again. In the long term, we’ll set up a  fiscal situation with our government so  that the economy can be strong and  create jobs for my children and their  children.  So I want to thank my colleague  from Hawaii for leading our dialogue  this  afternoon  on  job  creation,  on  small business development across our  country in our respective districts, and  I look forward to sitting here with you  for a few more minutes and engaging in  this dialogue. I just wanted to give a  few words about how the people  in  Delaware are responding to the work  that we are doing or are not doing here  in the Congress.  ",2011

387,,112,0.26,149,2011-10-04,Mr. KING of New York.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  in  recognition of October as National  Breast Cancer Awareness Month. It is essential to take this time to promote breast cancer  awareness, share information on the disease,  emphasize the importance of screenings and  continue to work towards a cure.  Early detection is of the utmost importance  for women of all ages. The 2.5 million breast  cancer survivors through the U.S. are a testament  to  the  importance of breast  cancer  awareness  and  following  recommended  screening  guidelines.  I  strongly  encourage  women to follow the recommended mammography screening guidelines and  to perform  self-exams. Early detection saves lives!  A woman  receives a diagnosis of breast  cancer every two minutes, making this disease  one of the most frequently diagnosed cancer  among women in the United States. Despite  tremendous advances  in  treatment and prevention, it remains the second leading cause  of cancer death. I am proud to support the National Breast Cancer Coalition’s Breast Cancer  Deadline 2020, a call to end breast cancer by  January 1, 2020. This initiative focuses on determining how to prevent the development of  breast cancer and metastasis and renews the  sense of urgency to eradicate this disease.  It is my privilege to work with dedicated volunteers, patients,  caregivers and  survivors  from organizations such as Susan G. Komen  for the Cure, National Breast Cancer Coalition,  the American Cancer Society and so many  others. Their tireless work is an inspiration and  a reminder that we must keep up the fight until  there is a cure.  f  IN HONOR OF THE TECHNOLOGY  CENTER AT THE GERARD CARTER COMMUNITY CENTER  HON.

The hard-working  residents of Staten Island can now take advantage of modern technology to train and search  for 21st century jobs.  Facilities like the Gerard Carter Community  Center provide state-of-the-art  tools  for displaced workers to update their skills and regain their competitive advantage in the labor  market. It also provides a place for students to  utilize  the  latest  technology  to  further  their  education.  I applaud Time Warner Cable and the Gerard Carter Community Center  for  giving  Stapleton residents access to the latest technology. I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding Time Warner Cable and the Gerard  Community Center to create the Technology  Center—its ventures like this give the unemployed and the underemployed the opportunity  and  the encouragement  they need  to  take  back their lives and get to work.  f  HONORING THE DEER LAKES AA  BOYS VOLLEYBALL TEAM  HON.

389,,112,-0.133,149,2011-10-04,Mr. ALTMIRE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the 2011 Deer Lakes High School Boys  Volleyball Team. This past season, the team  won the WPIAL championship as well as the  Pennsylvania State Championship. I congratulate them on an outstanding season and commend  their hard work  in winning both prestigious titles.  Over the course of their season, the team  showed  remarkable  consistency while  displaying exemplary  team play.  Incredibly,  the  team did not lose a match all season.  I would also like to give special recognition  to two members of the team who played to the  best of  their abilities each and every game.  Tony Nicotra and  Jeremy Gaston deserve  praise for their team leadership and work ethic  throughout the season. Their hard work was  rewarded when they received the co-most valuable player award for both the WPIAL and  state tournaments.  In addition, a team is only as good as the  coaching staff that stands behind their players.  Head coach Richard Tatrn along with assistant  coaches BJ Ruyes, Terry Gaston, Joe Giradi,  and Kevin Hamilton all deserve recognition for  their encouragement, instruction, and leadership throughout their championship season.  I again congratulate the Deer Lakes Boys  Volleyball Team’s players and coaching staff  on all of their achievements. It is with great joy  that I pay tribute to this team on their well-deserved accomplishments this season.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CAPE COD  TIMES  HON. WILLIAM R.

390,,112,-0.329,149,2011-10-04,Mr. KEATING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the seventy-fifth anniversary of the  Cape Cod Times, a daily newspaper circulated  throughout the towns and villages of Massachusetts’ Cape and Islands.  Seventy-five years ago, businessmen J.P.  Dunn and Basil Brewer came  together  in a  Hyannis garage  to publish  the Cape Cod  Standard-Times. This union grew out of  the  men’s desire to provide the residents of the  Cape and Islands with access to community  news, so they teamed up with the New Bedford  Standard-Times  for  joint  distribution  through  the 1960s. By 1970, however,  the  success of local small businesses and industries had brought an era of expansion to the  region, augmenting the need for a local paper  to service  the needs and  interests of  the  unique communities of the Cape and Islands.  In 1975, the first Cape Cod Times edition was  published  as  an  ‘‘independent Cape Cod  newspaper,  printed  and  published  on  the  Cape, by Cape Codders, for Cape Codders.’’  Today, the Cape Cod Times provides over  60,000 readers in the region with daily headlines of national and  local  relevance—from  summer beach  closings  to breaking news  across  the  globe. The  paper’s  circulation  reaches beyond the Cape and Islands through  its online subscription, allowing readers to stay  up-to-date on community happenings no matter their location.  Time and time again, the paper has been  recognized for its national significance, having  been named  to such prestigious awards as  ‘‘Newspaper of  the Year,’’  ‘‘Website of  the  Year’’ and ‘‘Sunday Newspaper of the Year’’  by  the New England Press Association,  the  New England Newspaper Association, and the  New England Associated Press Executives  Association.  Having owned a home on Cape Cod  for  twenty years, it is with pride and gratitude that  I congratulate the Cape Cod Times, its editors  and staff on providing seventy-five years of  authentic journalism to the people of the Tenth  Congressional District of Massachusetts. I extend my best wishes to the paper for many  more years of award-winning  journalism  to  come.  f  HONORING WILLIAM ENSIGN  HON. MARCY KAPTUR  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 4, 2011  ",2011
391,,112,-0.35,149,2011-10-04,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  the  life of William Ensign a  respected and  jovial Toledoan whose ethic of  public service  resulted  in his being elected  Mayor of Toledo in 1967, and then reelected  again in 1971. We offer our condolences to  his wife of 61 years, Joan,  their children  Maria, Kimberly, Madonna, Christopher, Joel  and Thomas, as well as their families.  William J. Ensign was born  in 1924. He  grew up in Cleveland and went on to serve as  a Marine in the Pacific Theatre in World War  II. He earned his undergraduate and graduate  degrees in sociology and criminology from the  University of Notre Dame. He came to Toledo  in 1951 to work in the legal system until he  became  the director of  the county welfare  agency  in 1963, a position he held until he  was elected Mayor of Toledo in 1967.

392,House,112,0.203,3,2011-10-12,Mr. GIBSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the fair trade agreements  that we will vote on later today. I commend the Obama administration  for  their work in ensuring that our businesses and workers get the best agreement possible to grow the economy and  create jobs.  While these agreements have been in  the works for years, our country has  benefited from the improvements garnered by our U.S. Trade Representative, Ron Kirk, and his team. This is  particularly evident in their refining of  the South Korean agreement so that  our farmers and automobile manufacturers get a fair deal. Of course, each  trade agreement is different, and they  all have to be evaluated on their merits. Details matter.  Overall, these agreements will help  increase U.S. exports by an estimated  $13 billion, adding $10 billion to our annual gross domestic product and creating nearly a quarter million jobs, including many in my district in upstate  New York; and we’ll do that without  adding a single dollar to the deficit. In  fact, these fiscally responsible agreements will help cut the deficit.  Our farmers, in particular, stand to  gain  significantly  from  these agreements, opening up nearly $30 million in  new business a year for our farmers in  New York. These agreements are enthusiastically supported by our New  York State Farm Bureau and by my  Agricultural  Advisory  Panel,  comprised of farmers from across the 10  counties and 137 towns I represent, a  congressional district with over 1,000  family farmers.  Mr. Speaker, we have the smartest,  hardest-working farmers in the world.  Their  issue  is profitability. We help  farmers when we attack the impediments to growth, which include taxes,  regulations, health care costs, and energy costs. We help farmers when we  have access to quality infrastructure—  not only roads and bridges, but also access to high-speed broadband. And we  help farmers when we expand markets  to help them sell their goods. These  agreements enhance our farmers’ profitability.  Supporting our farmers is supporting  the American way. Our family farmers  represent the best of our country. And  this is also a national security issue—  no farms, no food. We must ensure our  family farms can compete, or we risk  losing them and relying on  imports  with the attendant food security risks.  That’s not what my constituents want;  that’s not what our country wants,  which is why we need to pass these  agreements.  Now, in addition to helping our farmers, the independent, nonpartisan U.S.  International Trade Commission estimates key U.S. manufacturing sectors  are also poised to gain. This includes  the increase of U.S. exports of motor  vehicles and parts by about 50 percent;  metal products by over  50 percent;  chemical, rubber, and plastic products  by over 40 percent; and machinery and  equipment by over 30 percent. This will  directly help companies in my district,  who are already relying on exports,  with  expanding markets  for  selling  their products, companies  like B&B  Forest Products  in Greene County,  Momentive in Saratoga County, EFCO  Products in Dutchess County, and Hudson River Stove Works in my home  county, Columbia.  What’s often missed  in these conversations about trade are some of the  key points. Right now, over 90 percent  of the products coming from Colombia  and Panama are already duty  free,  when less than 40 percent of our goods  currently go duty free to these countries. Our goods to South Korea suffer  under  tariff  rates about  four  times  higher. With passage of these fair trade  agreements, we will address these imbalances. These agreements will add to  our GDP, strengthen existing jobs, and  create new ones.  Let’s recognize what’s at stake, and  let’s not fool ourselves. If we fail to  pass these fair trade agreements and do  nothing, we will fall behind. In South  Korea, we have seen our beef industry  lose more and more of the share of that  country’s  business  year  after  year  since the 1990s.

393,House,112,-0.576,10,2011-10-12,Ms. BASS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to recognize National Physician Assistant Week, which  is observed  annually  from  October  6  through October 12.  On October 6, 1967, the first PAs graduated  from Duke University. Today,  more than 40 years later, legions of  practicing PAs have reached the number of over 83,000, and 307 million patients visited PAs last year alone. I  know firsthand the key role of the PA  profession in the delivery of care. Before serving  in office,  I worked  for  nearly a decade as a PA and served as  a clinical instructor who trained future  PAs.  Created in response to a shortage of  primary care physicians, the PA profession today is crucial to developing a  strong primary care workforce. Not  only do PAs provide high-quality, cost-  effective care in virtually all health  care settings, but PAs also extend the  reach of medicine to underserved communities  throughout  the U.S. With  health care reform expanding access to  33 million Americans, PAs are needed  now more than ever.  Mr. Speaker, as we mark the final  day of PA week, I ask my colleagues to  join me  in celebrating the contribution, as well as the promise, of the PA  profession.  f  FREE AMERICA TO TRADE  FREELY WITH COLOMBIA  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011
394,House,112,-0.455,17,2011-10-12,Mr. FARR.," I thank the chairman for  yielding.  I rise in support of this agreement.  Look, Colombia  is a very  important  country to us. It has a lot of problems,  but it has incredible potential. Colombia is a big country. It’s the 20th-largest  trade  partner with  the United  States.  It’s our best ally  in Latin  America. It was the oldest democracy  in Latin America, the first country to  accept Peace Corps. It allowed an Air  Force base to be built  in Colombia.  Other countries haven’t allowed that.  They fought alongside of us and are  now fighting alongside of us in Afghanistan. They help us with Mexico drug  cartels by teaching the Mexican national police and military how to handle those cartels.  It’s the first country to adopt a labor  action plan. And let me speak to that.  That  labor action plan was adopted  this year on April 11. You’re going to  hear  a  lot  of  complaints—well,  it  hasn’t moved fast. It’s only been in effect 6 months. It’s already been able to  organize the grocers into unions and  other big industries into unions. It’s  the strongest labor plan ever adopted  in the history of the United States  trade agreements. And that’s not my  opinion; that’s the opinion of the Secretary of Labor of this country. It’s the  opinion of the Congressional Research  Office.  And, frankly, a lot of people say, oh,  this is another NAFTA. No. No. No. It’s  not NAFTA. NAFTA didn’t have the  ILO declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work and the follow-up provisions. This is the Peru free  trade agreement which we passed. It  has that right here under article 17,  and this is the Colombian free trade  agreement. They are exactly the same.  The principles are the same. Number 2  reads, effective recognition of the right  to collective bargaining—effective recognition. That means that anything  that stops that can be brought under  this agreement, an action against the  country.  So,  look,  you’ll  hear  arguments  today that it will create a loss of jobs.  There’s going to be a loss of jobs if we  don’t do this. Do you know that we  have made a free trade agreement with  every single country in Latin America  except Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador? Every one of them, none of them  with  these  labor protections. These  will be the strongest. But if we don’t  lift those trade barriers, all the products that we send to Colombia have a  tariff on them. All those other countries, they don’t. All of the European  countries that are entering into a free  trade agreement with Colombia don’t  have  it. Canada doesn’t have  it. So  guess what? We’re going to lose the  jobs of people who make things here  and send them there because it’s going  to be too expensive to buy them in Colombia. So we don’t want to lose those  jobs. We want to grow those jobs. And  there’s a great market in Colombia to  do that.  They say union workers are not protected, and they’re not allowed to organize. That’s not true. In fact, the only  country that counts the crimes against  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:54 Oct 13, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12OC7.033 H12OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011
395,House,112,0.602,31,2011-10-12,Mr. MARCHANT.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today in support of these free trade  agreements. Simply  put,  the  trade  agreements create more jobs, increase  exports, and broaden economic growth.  At a time when the United States unemployment hovers around 9 percent,  including 81⁄2percent in Texas, engines  of job growth are needed.  As  the  independent  International  Trade  Commission  points  out,  the  three trade agreements would increase  U.S. exports by $13 billion. While more  jobs are good news for the country as a  whole, Texas, in particular, stands to  benefit from increased trade. In today’s  globalized  economy,  Texas  depends  more than ever on world exports.  Businesses in the Dallas-Fort Worth  area are positioned for big gains. DFW  Airport, one of  the world’s  leading  trade gateways, already handles almost  65 percent of all international air cargo  in Texas. The trade agreements would  increase shipments of goods from DFW  to some of the most lucrative Latin  American and Asian markets.  ",2011
396,House,112,-0.263,52,2011-10-12,Mr. KIND.," I thank my good friend  and colleague from the committee for  yielding me this time.  Madam Speaker, many of us have  been rising throughout the course of  the debate today talking about the  merits  of  the  three  pending  trade  agreements before us and why it’s important  for us  to move  forward on  them, the reduction of tariff and non-  tariff barriers, greater market access  to the goods, product services that are  being made right here in America, a  system of rules that all countries have  to abide by that are parties to this  agreement, according to international  labor and environmental standards included in the body of the agreement,  fully enforceable with any other provision, protection of  intellectual property rights, and on and on and on.  That’s why I’m supportive of the three  bilateral agreements before us.  But to be honest with the American  people, and as long as trade remains a  two-way street, there will be adverse  impacts of  trade on companies and  workers here in America. When that  occurs, then the workers of that business should not just be left on their  own.  That’s why the reauthorization of the  Trade Adjustment Assistance is important today, to move forward hand-in-  hand with those trade agreements so  those workers will have an opportunity  to upgrade their skills, to go to school,  to have a better match in the job market and find placement as quickly as  possible. Since 1962, the TAA program  has assisted those workers who  lost  their position as a  result of  international  trade, helped  them  retrain  and acquire skills needed for them to  be more competitive in the global marketplace.  In Wisconsin alone in 2010, we had an  estimated 10,359 workers who were covered by this program, and my State’s  not alone. In fact, the three largest  TAA State recipients were Michigan,  Ohio, California.  In 2010 in Wisconsin, 52 percent of the  TAA  participants were  successfully  employed within 3 months of leaving  the program, and 88 percent of those  participants  continued  that  employment over the next few quarters. The  benefit of this program not only helps  workers in my State, but also those  specifically in western Wisconsin that I  represent.  In 2010, again, when Chart Energy &  Chemicals in La Crosse moved some of  its production line to China, approximately 230 employees were laid off, but  they were able to receive reemployment and training services under the  Federal TAA program. When Northern  Engraving Corporation shut down its  Luxco division tool shop in La Crosse,  27 workers were laid off; and they too  qualified for assistance so that they  could get reintegrated in the regional  economy.  There are many more examples of  that throughout Wisconsin and, I am  sure,  throughout  the  country. And  that’s why it was a bit discouraging  that it took so long for us to reach an  agreement  on  TAA  reauthorization  when there’s wide bipartisan support  and great support on the outside, from  the Chamber of Commerce to the AFL–  CIO, saying this is the right and decent  thing to do for America’s workers if we  are  going  to move  forward  in  a  proactive trade agenda.  I want to take a moment and commend my good  friend and colleague,  the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee, Mr. CAMP,  for the work  that he did with Senator BAUCUS in  order to get the TAA reauthorization  in the place that it is today. I think it  was very helpful.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore  (Mrs.  MILLERof Michigan). The time of the  gentleman has expired.  ",2011

399,House,112,0.749,66,2011-10-12,Mr. FRANKS of Arizona.," Mr. CARTER,  I think we forget when we talk about  the economy and jobs that the most  important  thing we can do  for  the  economy and jobs is to make sure that  this country is secure and that productivity is allowed unfettered; that it has  a secure environment in which to flourish. If the government will get out of  the way, this economy will flourish. It  will go forward. But if we fail as a government to do what is our duty, which  is national security, there’s nothing  that could damage our economy more.  I remind everyone that we lost $2  trillion in our economy when two airplanes hit two buildings. It’s very easy  to forget the cost of war. Someone said  that war devours everything that peace  gives. And we need to make sure that  we defend this country and make sure  that the people who are investing in  this country and are trying to work in  this country and be productive know  that they can do so in a fully secure  environment. It is the most important  thing that we can do for our national  economy.  And I would suggest to you that it’s  important for us to start asking this  administration  some key  questions.  The number one question is: Where do  they put the national security of the  United States on their priority list?  Secondly: What are they willing to do  to clarify this dangerous jihadist ideology in stark terms where everyone  can understand what we’re  dealing  with and that we’re willing to do whatever is necessary to prevent terrorism  in this country and protect the American people? And third: What is Mr.  Obama willing to do? What is he willing to do to prevent Iran from gaining  nuclear weapons with which to threaten the peace of mankind?  With that,  I thank my  yielding.

418,Senate,112,-0.383,122,2011-10-12,Mr. REED.," Mr.  President,  since  World War II the United States has  traded  away American  jobs  in  the  name of foreign policy by entering into  bilateral and multilateral trade agreements.  With a 9.1 percent national unemployment rate, 14 million Americans  looking for work, and 10.6 percent unemployment in Rhode Island, there are  no more jobs to give. As such, I cannot  support these trade agreements with  Korea, Colombia, and Panama that the  Senate is considering today.  I am not convinced these trade deals  will result in net job growth for the  United States. The International Trade  Commission’s analysis of  the agreements finds negligible changes to aggregate employment and output. Analysis from The Economic Policy Institute estimates that the Korea FTA  would lead to a loss of 159,000 jobs—  much of this in the manufacturing sector. It must be stressed that, according  to these analyses, any potential  job  gains  associated with  increases  in  American exports will be offset by job  losses resulting from increased imports  to the United States.  Moreover, as a recent economic study  has shown, my State is one of the most  susceptible to labor-intensive imports.  And as the International Trade Commission’s sector analysis of these free  trade  agreements  found,  industries  that are based in Rhode Island align  with those foreign industries that will  have the most access to U.S. markets.  I am very concerned that Rhode Island  businesses will feel the brunt of this  import pressure while realizing little of  the potential gains from exports.  It is likely that U.S. job losses associated with the Korea FTA will be disproportionately felt in Rhode Island,  particularly in the textile sector. The  nature  of  the  agreement  and  the  change in tariff schedules pick clear  winners and  losers. U.S. agriculture  and passenger vehicles will be winners,  while manufacturing industries central  to my State like textiles will be losers.  I have heard from Rhode Island businesses opposed to the Korea agreement  for this very reason.  I,  also,  have  serious  reservations  about  the  Colombian  and Panama  agreements.  These  agreements will  have a relatively small impact on the  U.S. economy, but present basic questions of accountability. Colombia has  one of the highest rates of anti-union  violence in the world. Panama has its  own duty free zone and there are concerns about whether there are enough  resources being dedicated to deter illegal  transshipment  of  goods, which  could lead to other nations taking advantage of our trade agreement with  Panama by skirting customs and violating ‘‘rules of origin’’ requirements.  Additionally, despite Panama’s recent  tax information exchange agreement,  questions remain about the degree to  which transparency and bank secrecy  laws will continue to be obstacles to  enforcing U.S. tax law.  Both Colombia  and Panama have  made efforts to correct these issues.  However, the results of these efforts  are not clear and more work remains  to be done to ensure that accountability is built into the system.  I do want to stress that my opposition to these agreements is not meant  to undercut the good work of our partners and allies in Korea, Colombia, and  Panama. Korea is one of our most vital  partners in Asia and a democracy that  shares our values. Colombia is an important Latin American ally that has  made enormous progress in strengthening the rule of law and combating extremist organizations and drug traffickers. And the United States has a  singular  relationship  with  Panama  that has  progressively  strengthened  over time.  However, at this time, I think we  should stop and pause and think about  our domestic needs and how to get our  economy back on track. The United  States needs to enter into trade agreements that will unequivocally benefit  Americans workers—these trade deals  do not. So,  I will vote against the  Korea, Colombia, and Panama trade  agreements, and continue working to  find a better way to promote bilateral  trade that will lead to job growth here  at home.  ",2011
419,,112,0.387,157,2011-10-12,Mr. BACHUS.," Madam Speaker,  the  free  trade agreement between  the United States  and Colombia means jobs. If you are looking  for bright spots in the U.S. economy, our trading relationship with Colombia is one of them.  Even though we have been operating under a  handicap  to competitors  like Argentina because of higher  tariffs and duties, American  exports to Colombia have been growing. Our  exports last year were worth $12.1 billion, up  26 percent, and the International Trade Commission estimates this agreement will increase  exports by at least another $1.1 billion.  Each of those exports supports jobs in the  United States, not to mention jobs in the State  of Alabama. Colombia  is one of Alabama’s  best export markets in this hemisphere, and it  is an excellent customer for high-value manufactured products like machinery and transportation equipment. Our  former Governor Bob  Riley demonstrated the importance of the partnership when he led a trade delegation to Colombia  in 2009, and  it  is my view  that  this  agreement will create even more opportunities  for mutually beneficial trade.  Colombia is a strategic ally committed to a  free market economy. Working  together, our  governments have made progress in addressing the scourge of narcotics. The Colombian  government has also instituted major labor reforms, and the labor provisions in this agreement reflect the government’s commitment to  protect those rights. For the record, I am submitting information I received from the Colombian Ambassador  to  the U.S.  regarding  the  Action Plan on labor protections.  The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement  will open up new avenues of cooperation between our two countries, and provide an immediate boost to our farmers, the textile industry, our energy industry, and our manufacturers to name just a few. It is a win-win agreement and I am pleased to support it.

420,,112,0.512,164,2011-10-12,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  express my opposition  to  the U.S.-Korean  Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). Put simply,  this agreement is a bad business deal for the  United States.  KORUS is an example of an agreement that  stands to benefit certain industries at the expense of others. For instance, the Obama administration went  to great  lengths  to  include  special provisions  to ensure  that our auto  manufacturers have equal access  to South  Korean markets. While the economic fairness  may help,  the effect  is  likely  to be minimal.  Currently, over 95 percent of South Koreans  drive South Korean cars. Because of  this,  I  have serious concerns about the realistic ability of our auto industry to succeed in a reluctant Korean market.  In addition to my concerns with the feasibility of success for the auto industry in South  Korea,  it  is widely acknowledged  that  textile  workers will lose out because of the deal. The  Economic  Policy  Institute  estimates  that  159,000 American manufacturing jobs will be  lost, and because of the administration’s failure to address textile issues, it is estimated  that 40,000 textile jobs will be lost. I have always said that 1 job lost as a result of free  trade is too much.

421,,112,-0.514,171,2011-10-12,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pleasure and pride that I welcome President  Lee Myung-bak of  the Republic of Korea  to  the United States and his address to the Joint  Session of Congress on October 13, 2011. His  visit to our great nation is another significant  step in broadening and deepening the friendship and cooperation between our  two sovereign nations.  For more than 60 years an enduring friendship has existed between  the United States  and the Republic of Korea which has been of  enormous economic, cultural, and strategic  benefit  to both nations. Our countries share  common ideals and a clear vision for the 21st  century, where  freedom and democracy are  the  foundations  for peace, prosperity, and  progress.  During  the Korean War  the United States  and the Republic of Korea forged a bloodshed  alliance. Approximately 1,789,000 members of  the United States Armed Forces served in-theater along with the forces of the Republic of  Korea and 20 other members of  the United  Nations to defend freedom and democracy of  the Republic of Korea  from 1950  to 1953.  Since 1975, the Republic of Korea has invited  thousands of American Korean War veterans  to revisit Korea in appreciation for their sacrifices. Currently more than 28,500 members  of  the United States Armed Forces have  served annually in the United States Forces  Korea to defend the Republic of Korea against  external aggression, and to promote regional  peace.  The Republic of Korea is among the closest  allies of the United States, having contributed  troops in support of United States operations  during the Vietnam War, Gulf War, and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while also supporting  numerous  United  Nations  peacekeeping missions throughout the world.  As a Korean War veteran,  I am proud  to  see that in the 60 years since the outbreak of  the Korean War, the Republic of Korea has  emerged from a war-torn economy into one of  the major economies in the world and one of  the  largest  trading partners of  the United  States.  The success of Republic of Korea is a shining example of the peacekeeping efforts and  contribution made by the United States.  I would  like  to congratulate President Lee  Myung-bak  for  recently being awarded  the  World Statesman Award for his leadership in  furthering democracy,  freedom, peace and  human rights, on September 20, 2011, by The  Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an  interfaith organization founded and presided by my  good friend, Rabbi Arthur Schneier.  I applaud President Lee Myung-bak’s many  accomplishments, including his tenure as the  CEO of Hyundai Engineering and Construction, Member of the Korean National Assembly, Mayor of Seoul, and as the 10th President  of  the Republic of Korea. Under his presidency since 2008, Republic of Korea has  emerged as one of  the key players on  the  international scene through hosting the 2010  G–20 Seoul Summit. Now with the passage of  the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, I hope  that the economies of both the United Sates  and Republic of Korea would continue to prosper as our partnership remains strong.  f  UNITED  STATES-KOREA  FREE  TRADE AGREEMENT  IMPLEMENTATION ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. FRANK D. LUCAS  OFOKLAHOMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 11, 2011  ",2011
422,,112,0.363,171,2011-10-12,Mr. LUCAS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  this legislation.  The free trade agreement with Korea is of  vital  importance  to America’s  farmers and  ranchers.  Korea is the fifth largest market for our agricultural exports. But currently, America’s farmers and ranchers face an average tariff of 54  percent when  exporting  to Korea. Similar  goods from Korea enter our country at an average rate of only 9 percent.  Passing this agreement corrects that imbalance and gives us better access to Korea’s 49  million consumers.  The Farm Bureau estimates that once the  agreement is fully implemented, we could see  $1.9 billion in increased farm exports.  Every dollar in agricultural exports creates  another $1.31 in economic activity off the farm  in  industries  like processing, manufacturing,  and  transportation. So  the agricultural provisions alone have  the potential  to provide a  significant boost to our economy.  That  isn’t  including  the other  tariff cuts  in  this agreement, which the International Trade  Commission predicts will add more than $10  billion annually to our GDP.  Within agriculture, we could see dairy exports  to Korea quadruple under  this agreement. Fruit and vegetable sales would  increase by 50 percent. And processed  food  sales would increase by more than a third.  Those increased sales will translate directly  to more jobs—both on and off the farm. That’s  especially good news because workers whose  jobs depend on trade earn 13 to 18 percent  more than the national average.  That’s why there is such tremendous support among  the agricultural  community  for  these free trade agreements.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support our  farmers and ranchers . . . to support American jobs . . . and to support this free trade  agreement.  f  REMARKS ON TRADE  AGREEMENTS  HON. RUSH D.

423,,112,-0.448,171,2011-10-12,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition  to  the pending  free  trade  agreements (FTAs) with Colombia and Korea.  I wish, however, to commend my good friend  from Michigan and Ranking Member of  the  Committee on Ways and Means, SANDYLEVIN,  for  his  hard  and  effective work with  the  Obama Administration to improve them. Sandy  and the Administration have fought hard to ensure  improved market access  for American  workers and companies, all while insisting that  our trading partners’ labor protections be improved. Nevertheless, my  experience with  FTAs has been one of nearly two decades of  broken promises and widespread domestic  economic dislocation, particularly in my home  state of Michigan. With our economy teetering  on  the edge of  recession and  the painful  memory of millions of lost jobs, I cannot vote  in good conscience for more free trade agreements.  With respect to Colombia, I am disappointed  by the Administration’s decision not to include  the Labor Action Plan as a binding and enforceable provision of the FTA. Colombia has  a well known history as one of  the world’s  most  inhospitable places  for  labor  leaders.  While the country was showing some signs of  progress under the action plan, there is nothing to prevent Colombia from backsliding once  the FTA is in effect and the plan itself does  not have the force of law.  Although  I  recognize  that  significant  improvements in terms of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade have been made in the Korean  trade agreement,  I  rather unhappily believe  that promises will not translate into reality. In  short, I believe the United States is giving up  far too much for mediocre market share gains  in  the short  term. This agreement may well  boost our exports to Korea over the next few  years, but I am firmly convinced that the benefits Korea will reap in the long run—especially  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:09 Oct 13, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A12OC8.052 E12OCPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

426,Senate,112,-0.199,41,2011-10-19,Mr. PRYOR.," I see that I have other  colleagues on the floor. I will only be a  couple of minutes.  Today I rise to oppose an amendment  offered by Senator MORAN, amendment  No. 815. I really do appreciate the intent of Senator MORAN’s amendment. I  actually support the intent of what he  is trying to do because he is trying to  support the Watershed Rehabilitation  Program.  While I am not opposed to that program, and I recognize that difficult decisions had to be made in order to meet  our statutory spending caps outlined in  the Budget Control Act, I regret to say  I cannot support the Senator’s amendment as it is written because its offset  comes from departmental administration which provides numerous essential  services to the USDA.  These cuts would force USDA to reduce their number of employees, which  would have a detrimental effect on the  Department and its operation. In fact,  Secretary Vilsack reached out to the  Agriculture  Appropriations  subcommittee staff to relay his serious  concerns.  These USDA employees provide essential services to some of the most  rural areas in the country, so I cannot  support the amendment that would, in  effect, reduce services to rural America.  On top of that, it is important for my  colleagues to understand that the level  for departmental administration is already over $13 million below the fiscal  year 2010 level and $7 million below the  President’s request.  Although I definitely support the watershed rehabilitation program, I certainly hope Senator KOHLand Senator  MORAN can find a good offset that is  agreeable to the majority of us. Still, I  must oppose this amendment and urge  other Senators to oppose it as well.  With that, I yield the floor.  ",2011
427,House,112,-0.366,6,2011-10-27,Mr. PASCRELL.," Good morning.  I come to the floor today in support  of H.R. 674, which will repeal a burden  on government contractors, particularly small businesses.  I opposed the enactment of the 3 percent withholding when a Republican  Congress and a Republican administration enacted it because I knew that it  would hurt the economic engines of our  economy.  The repeal of this requirement will  free up small businesses’ cash flow, increasing their ability to add jobs and  bid on new projects. This is only a very  small part of a jobs plan that could  help to reduce unemployment and wage  stagnation.  The majority has not allowed a vote  on known job-creating measures such  as the infrastructure bank or funding  for our first responders and teachers,  so I would imagine that that’s not very  important,  those  items. Rather,  the  majority has decided to promote their  ‘‘False Fifteen’’ bills that attack clean  air, safe water, and consumer safety.  Be prepared, America, to eat poison.  Not only do independent economists  state that these bills do not create  jobs, a recent report found that the so-  called  ‘‘economically  stifling’’  regulatory atmosphere is not as bad as they  say. The report says this:  ‘‘Obama’s  White House has approved fewer regulations than George W. Bush at this  same point in their tenures, and the  costs of those rules haven’t reached the  annual peak set in fiscal 1992 under  President Bush’s  father,’’ President  Bush I. You would never think that by  listening  to  the propaganda on  the  other side of the aisle. We’ve overregulated—supposedly—and we’ve  caused  businesses to spend so much money on  these regulations. But again, when we  look at the facts, this is not true.  Eat your words. Even former Reagan  Treasury official Bruce Bartlett quoted  the Wall Street Journal saying, ‘‘The  main reason U.S. companies are reluctant to step up hiring is scant demand,  rather than uncertainty over government policies.’’ So you can grow as  many horns as you want onto  the  President. Once again, look at the facts  and the statistics: more regulations at  this point when former President Bush  was the President, Bush II.  It is ironic that the majority is adjusting health reform to pay for this  legislation. You condemn the health  act, and then you take the money from  the health act to pay for this legislation. That is a Ponzi scheme if I’ve  ever heard one. The majority already  voted to repeal health reform, yet to  pay for this legislation—which is a separate piece of  legislation—health reform must be in place for 10 years. How  do you do that? They get rid of the  health care act—well, they’re trying to  thank  the genanyway—and yet they use every dime  for the first 10 years to pay for the bill.  b0940  How do you do that? I’m anxious to  see how you do this.  Just as their 2012 budget was paid for  by health reform savings, and we’ve  discussed  this  in  the  budget  committee, this bill is again paid for by the  health reform which they want to annihilate. If the majority is against the  health reform bill, perhaps they should  stop making their agenda so dependent  upon it.  While I support H.R. 674, we cannot  pat ourselves on the back and claim  victory that this is a victory for jobs.  Congress must do much more.  ",2011
428,,112,0.348,27,2011-10-27,Mr. CALVERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and honor Howard H. ‘‘Tim’’ Hays  who recently passed away at the age of 94.  He will be deeply missed.  Mr. Hays spent 51 years at the Riverside  Press Enterprise, the sixth largest newspaper  in the state of California. Before coming to the  newspaper, Mr. Hays was an FBI Special  Agent during World War II. In 1946, he joined  the paper as an Assistant Editor and also  passed the California bar exam. The Riverside  Press Enterprise wrote an article detailing the  many accomplishments of Mr. Hays and the  incredible contributions he made to the newspaper, the community and the country.  [Oct. 14, 2011]  FORMERP–E PUBLISHERANDEDITORTIM  HAYSDIES  Howard H. ‘‘Tim’’ Hays, Jr., the Harvard-  educated  lawyer who chose a newspaperman’s life and led what became The Press-  Enterprise  into national prominence as a  Pulitzer Prize-winning advocate of open government and defender of the First Amendment, died Friday in St. Louis. He was 94.  Mr. Hays had been struggling with Alzheimer’s disease, his son Tom Hays said Friday. He said his father died in the afternoon  at Barnes-Jewish Hospital following a brief  acute illness.  Mr. Hays spent 51 years at The Press-Enterprise. He was an FBI special agent during  World War II and joined the newspaper as assistant editor in 1946. He passed the bar the  same year but never practiced law.  His subsequent roles included editor, co-  publisher, publisher and chairman. He continued as chairman until 1997, when The  Press-Enterprise was sold to the A.H. Belo  Co., ending 67 years of family ownership of  the Riverside-based newspaper.  The news organization’s five-story office  on Fourteenth Street was named in 2006 as  the Howard H. ‘‘Tim’’ Hays Media Center.  ‘‘Tim was a rarity, a man whose moral  compass  was  set  on  true,’’  said Mel  Opotowsky, the former managing editor of  The Press-Enterprise.  ‘‘That  is especially  important as a newspaper owner because of  the obligation as a public trust. There are  many  instances of Tim’s beneficence, not  only to his employees, but to his readers and  to principles of quality journalism.’’  Mr. Hays once joked that his choice of  journalism over law and his ‘‘semi-meteoric  rise’’ at the newspaper were due to  ‘‘diligence, and the fact that my father was co-  owner.’’  Courtly, soft-voiced and with a penchant  for remembering anyone’s name, from civic  leaders to cleaning crews in the hallways of  his newspaper, Mr. Hays’ personality contrasted sharply with flamboyant news-executive contemporaries. His memos were to his  ‘‘Fellow Employees.’’  But his reserved manner was matched with  a steely resolve.  He stood up to pressure and confrontation  to lead his newspaper to a Pulitzer Prize. He  took two open-government cases to the U.S.  Supreme Court, winning both.  Media attorneys use shorthand to refer to  two landmark cases won by the newspaper,  Press-Enterprise One and Two.  In January 1984, the newspaper won a case  establishing the public’s right to attend jury  selection in criminal trial proceedings. In a  1986 case, the court asserted the right of the  public to attend pre-trial hearings in criminal cases with few exceptions.  Mr. Hays oversaw publication of a series of  articles in 1967 that exposed malpractice in  the  conservatorship  program  for  Agua  Caliente Indians in Palm Springs. Editorials  combined with more than 100 stories, mostly  written by reporter George Ringwald, earned  the newspaper the Pulitzer Prize for meritorious public service in 1968. (Ringwald died  in 2005.)  During the newspaper’s reporting of that  issue, a judge who was under investigation  became infuriated by a Press-Enterprise editorial and ordered Mr. Hays arrested.  The publisher stood his ground and was not  jailed.  Mr. Hays also stood by his reporters, even  as advertisers took their business away in  protest over investigative pieces.  Despite national  recognition, Mr. Hays  kept his community at the foreground of his  work. He was among the civic leaders who  worked to get a University of California  campus  established  here.  UC  Riverside  opened in 1954.  ‘‘Tim had a very active mind that saw beyond the ordinary but was able to bring it  down to earth,’’ said his former executive  secretary, Jean Wingard. ‘‘He was an excellent newsman, and had the respect of those  who worked with him and for him.’’  Mr. Hays established the Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture in 1966, which was underwritten in 1998 by a $100,000 endowment after  the newspaper was sold.  The free lectures, open to the public, featured leaders in news media, including retired Washington Post Executive Editor Ben  Bradlee; Gene Roberts, former managing editor of the New York Times; and W. Thomas  Johnson, who was then president of Cable  News Network.  Mr. Hays also undertook the cause of preserving the Mission Inn.  He and other  civic  leaders maintained  their effort during a seven-year stretch in  which the state and national historic landmark in downtown Riverside was closed—at  one time surrounded by a chain-link fence.  Several attempts to reopen the Inn failed.  Some suggested the land was a prime spot  for a parking lot. In 1992, Duane Roberts  bought the hotel and invested millions of  dollars in renovations.  The Press-Enterprise under Mr. Hays also  quietly helped to underwrite local cultural  and arts organizations.  ‘‘I’m not married to any cause,’’ Mr. Hays  once said.  ‘‘I believe in generosity to the  community in which you live. I think you  can contribute more with time and energy  than with dollars. But I guess the money can  be pretty dandy, too.’’  Retired  appellate  court  Justice  John  Gabbert said Mr. Hays, similar to his brothers, developed his sense of community engagement early in life.  ‘‘He was motivated by the very strong  civic background that he probably inherited  from his father,’’ Gabbert said Friday. ‘‘They  were all there, out in the community, making it better.’’  Contemporaries of Mr. Hays said he was  less  likely to deliver a  fiery speech, and  more likely to argue his points over lunch or  in a casual conversation. Former state Sen.  Robert Presley said each time he would meet  Mr. Hays at the same downtown Riverside  restaurant, the publisher would prod him for  support of downtown Riverside projects.  ‘‘He didn’t seem to have a lot of ego, although he could be vigorous and persuasive  in his arguments,’’ Presley said Friday from  Sacramento.  ‘‘He was  a  very  special  person,’’  said  Marcia McQuern who worked for Hays at The  Press-Enterprise and eventually became the  paper’s publisher. ‘‘He had a true journalist’s  heart. He always tried to  live up to his  standards and ideals.’’  McQuern remembered Hays being well tied  into the community. So much so that he  often knew what was going on before his reporters did.  ‘‘I would come to him with a story and he’d  say, ‘You finally found that out,’’’ she said.  ‘‘But he never would kill anything.’’  Even when it may have been unpopular  among the community leaders he mingled  with.  ‘‘He took a lot of heat. He really stuck by  the newsroom. That’s where his heart was,’’  she said.  McQuern remembered one instance where  the paper wanted the name behind a large  anonymous donation to UC Riverside.  ‘‘We fought for access,’’ she said. ‘‘He let  us go fight for the information. We were  about to file suit and he finally admitted it  was him.’’  Howard H. ‘‘Tim’’ Hays, Jr. was born in  Chicago on June 2, 1917, the son of Howard H.  Hays, Sr. and Margaret Mauger Hays. He  came to Riverside with his parents in 1924.  A graduate of Riverside Polytechnic High  School, he was editor of the school newspaper, Poly Spotlight, during his senior year.  Mr. Hays earned a bachelor’s degree in social sciences at Stanford University, graduating in 1939.  In 1942, he received a law degree from Harvard Law School. After his service with the  FBI, he briefly served as a reporter at the  San Bernardino Sun before joining the family newspaper and beginning his leadership  role in American journalism.  Mr. Hays moved to St. Louis part time in  1989, and began living there full time after  his retirement  from The Press-Enterprise,  his son Tom said.  In a message read at the 2007 dedication of  the news building named after him, Mr. Hays  noted that he still read every day the newspaper that he had led for so long.  Survivors include wife Susie Hays of St.  Louis, sons Bill Hays of Corona Del Mar and  Tom Hays of New York City, and brother  Dan Hays of Riverside. His brother, William  H. Hays, died earlier this year. Mr. Hays’  first wife, Helen Hays Yeager, died two years  earlier, to the day, of Mr. Hays’ death.  Said Tom Hays, ‘‘He lived a very long and  productive and fortunate life, and he died  very peacefully,  so we are  thankful  for  that.’’  Mr. Hays will always be remembered for  his incredible work ethic, generosity, love of  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

429,,112,-0.488,34,2011-10-27,Ms. HIRONO.," Mr. Speaker, October is Filipino American History Month, giving us opportunity to remember the storied history of Filipinos in Hawaii.  From the barrios of the Philippines, Filipinos  boarded ships and sailed across the Pacific.  Upon reaching Hawaii, they worked on sugarcane plantations where  life was hard but  filled with hope and the dream of a brighter future.  Today, generations later, Filipinos represent  the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority  in the islands. Through hard work, they continue to make steady strides in all professions.  They are our doctors and lawyers, our teachers, small business owners, and community  leaders. The next generation of Filipino Americans will build upon this legacy of accomplishment.  I had  the pleasure of meeting with  members of the Kabatak Filipino Club at the  University of Hawaii—Maui College in Kahului.  Their primary goal is to raise an awareness of  Filipino culture and to encourage the recruitment, retention, and achievement of Filipino  students on the Maui campus. This is a noble  endeavor.

430,,112,0.445,34,2011-10-27,Mr. LUETKEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Rock Bridge High School Lady  Bruins tennis team for its second straight state  title.  The young women and their coaches should  be commended for all their hard work throughout  their  flawless season and on bringing  home another Class 2 State Tennis Championship to their school and community.  Making  its 12th state appearance  in 13  years,  the Rock Bridge Lady Bruins once  again showed  their  tremendous  talent. Their  competition was fierce, but the ladies battled  through to their last 5–1 victory over Parkway  Central.  I ask  that you  join me  in recognizing  the  Rock Bridge High School Lady Bruins for a job  well done.  f  TRIBUTE TO RIVERSIDE COUNTY’S  RECIPIENTS OF OPERATION RECOGNITION  HON.

431,Senate,112,-0.291,34,2011-11-09,Ms. CANTWELL.," I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee for  his leadership on this important issue.  I am glad to be on the Senate floor to  set the record straight because we are  here to talk about Internet  freedom  and about making sure the Internet  does not have undue costs and expenses  for consumers.  If you liked TARP and you liked the  bailout of the big banks, well, guess  what. Then you should vote for this  resolution because this resolution  is  about whether you are going to let the  communications companies that want  to make the Internet more expensive  by  various  technologies  have  their  way.  If you believe the FCC should establish some rules to protect the freedom  of the Internet, then you should oppose  the Hutchison resolution. I prefer legislation that I have introduced, and some  of my colleagues support, called the  Freedom of the Internet Act, that goes  further than what the Federal Communications Commission has done to implement true net neutrality. I would  prefer that, and maybe in the future  my colleagues will be working on such  legislation.  But as it is today, the Federal Communications Commission has taken a  half step,  if you will, by proposing  some rules that will set in place some  protections  for  consumers  to make  sure they are protected on important  aspects of keeping Internet costs down.  The problem with the FCC rules is they  only apply  in  some  cases  to  fixed  broadband  and  not  to  mobile  broadband.  So if you think about it this way, the  Internet  is moving  to  a mobile  broadband platform; that is, our hand-  held devices, whether they are a BlackBerry or phone or what have you. So  many more Americans are accessing  the Internet that way. So the FCC has  come up with rules on transparency  and no blocking; that is, to make sure  no content is blocked or slowed down  for any undue cost or reason, and a  nondiscrimination rule.  Unfortunately, those two last points,  no blocking and unreasonable discrimination, do not apply to the mobile side.  So we have work to do to make sure  the youth of America who are consuming  so  much  content  online  through their mobile devices are not  going to be artificially charged more or  slowed down in their access all because  the  telecommunications  industry  wants to have its way with the Internet.  My colleagues have been out here  talking about  innovation. I can tell  you, the Internet has had a ton of innovation and a ton of content creation,  all because there has been an even  playing field and net neutrality. The  fact now  is  that  the  telecommunications companies are debating an important issue, and the lines get blurred  between telecommunications and the  Internet, and it is clear we do not have  all of the rules in place to make sure  consumer interests are protected.  But today we have one thing: the  FCC rules that are trying to slow down  telecommunication companies from artificially either blocking or making  content on the Internet more expensive. Again, when we go to the mobile  phone model and we are being charged  for time and data transfer, the  fact  that the data transfer and time take  longer means we are going to have  more expensive phone bills. That  is  why I said it was TARP-like, because  the ‘‘cha-ching’’ we are going to hear  from  the  phone  companies  on  the  money they are going to make from  this is unbelievable.  So thank God the FCC took a half  step and said: Whoa. Slow down. We are  not going to let you do that. That is  why people  like Vint Cerf and Tim  Berners-Lee, the architects and inventors pushing the Internet, have said  what a bad idea it is to not make sure  that net neutrality is the law of the  land.  I notice my colleague who just spoke  said, well, there have not been any  problems. There have not been any  issues. I read the online publications.  Larry Lessig, someone I trust, was recounting in one of his interviews exactly what happened. Comcast went in  and basically blocked large data files  of peer-to-peer transfer, what is called  bit torrent traffic.  First, Comcast said: No, no. We do  not do that. We did not block that. We  do not do it. But when it was basically  found out that they did, they said: Oh,  no, we did not block it. We just slowed  it down. They sent little messages, as  Mr. Lessig says in his article, to the  Internet traffic to confuse the recipient  and basically disrupt their traffic. OK?  So that is what is happening.  These providers think  if they can  control the pipe, now they can also  control the  flow.  It  is also, as Mr.  Lessig said later in this article, as if  the entire electricity grid, our refrigerators and our toasters and our dryers, all of a sudden would start charging different rates on different things  because the electricity company would  decide it had the ability to charge different rates. Would we put up with  that? No, we would not put up with  that.  So why would we put up with allowing telcos to run at will on the Internet  charging  consumers  anything  they  want based on the fact that they think  they have the control of the switch?  I am so proud the chairman, Senator  ROCKEFELLER, has led this fight for the  freedom of the Internet to drive down  costs, to keep innovation, and to protect net neutrality. The FCC rules do  not go far enough. We cannot continue  to have this half step and not clearly,  on the mobile side, give consumers the  protection they need.  But for today, if you want to vote  with Internet consumers and Internet  users on driving down the costs of the  Internet, then vote against this resolution and keep the minimal FCC rules in  place until we can get stronger legislation passed. Make no mistake about it,  the other side is talking about, well,  they do not want to regulate the Internet. That is true. They do not want to  regulate telcos that want to take advantage of the fact that they own the  pipe and can charge a lot more.  I am glad the FCC at least took this  measure. We  should make  sure  it  stands until we can even get stronger  Internet freedom protection.  I yield the floor.  ",2011

Many people on the call spoke about  the need for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and an overwhelming majority replied in a survey  that there should be a balanced budget  amendment. I was pleased to report to  them that the House will be voting this  week on a balanced budget amendment  that will help Washington get its fiscal  house in order. And it will reverse the  dangerous practices of saddling our future generations with insurmountable  debt.  A  balanced  budget  amendment,  Madam Speaker, is not a radical idea.

And then at a gathering of  7,000 people in and around the New Life  Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado,  with a rifle and a backpack full of ammunition, Murray entered the church  and opened  fire, killing two sisters.  Murray was ultimately  stopped and  killed by a church member and a volunteer security guard, Jeanne Assam,  who has a concealed-carry permit and  once  worked  in  law  enforcement.  Assam shot Murray several times, leading him to kill himself.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011

452,,112,-0.458,215,2011-11-15,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr. Chair, I  rise today to support H.R. 2838, the ‘‘Coast  Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of  2011.’’ This legislation authorizes funding for  the Coast Guard through fiscal year 2014 and  authorizes service strength of 47,000 active  duty personnel.  As a Senior Member on the Committee on  Homeland Security and the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, I understand the  importance of protecting our maritime borders.  In our post 9/11 climate, homeland security  continues to be a top priority for our nation.  In 1787, Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist  Paper Number 12 laid the foundation for the  modern Coast Guard when he noted that ‘‘[a]  few armed vessels, judiciously stationed at the  entrances of our ports, might at a small expense, be made useful sentinels of our laws.’’  I believe protecting our country by air, land,  and sea is critical to our national security interests. As Coast Guard is beneficial to our maritime interests, and consequently, our national  security  it  is  imperative  that we provide  the  Coast Guard with the funding they need.  In the aftermath of September 11, 2001 the  focus of many federal agencies shifted to include an  increased emphasis on Homeland  Security. Under the Homeland Security Act of  2002, a number of security missions were assigned to the Coast Guard. Without question  the first mission of our Coast Guard has been  to protect our ports, waterways and to focus  on coastal security. They have completed this  mission with honor for centuries.  Across the United States there are currently  more than 350 major ports of which 23 are located in my home state of Texas.  I am honored  to represent  the 18th Congressional District which includes the Port of  Houston, one of our nation’s busiest ports.  More  than 220 million  tons of cargo moved  through the Port of Houston in 2010 and it has  been ranked as first in foreign waterborne tonnage for the 15th consecutive year.  The port links Houston with over 1,000 ports  located  in  203  countries,  and  provides  785,000  jobs  throughout  the state of Texas.  Maritime ports are major centers of  trade,  commerce,  and  travel  along  our  nation’s  coastline. All of these ports are protected by  the Coast Guard.  As a Representative from Texas, a border  state, I am extremely concerned with curtailing  the  flow of  illegal drugs entering  into  the  United States. The Coast Guard is the lead  federal agency for maritime drug interdiction.  Houston has been classified by the Office of  National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) as a  High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, and in a  2009 report, the ONDCP expressed concern  that ‘‘the sheer volume of maritime traffic and  foreign cargo that passes through the port offers another avenue for drug smuggling.’’  The Coast Guard is responsible for and has  coordinated with other federal, state, and local  agencies and countries within  the  region  to  disrupt and deter the flow of illegal drugs into  Houston and other ports. This coordinated effort has resulted in a decrease in the supply  of illicit substances being transported all over  the country.  The Coast Guard protects the interests of  American citizens and American commerce  abroad. Last year, 73.2 million tons of exports  left the Port of Houston to be sold to countries  around the world. These exports represented  $70.8 billion dollars, and countless American  jobs.  The international counter—piracy efforts of  the Coast Guard focus on preventing attacks  of piracy  that  threaten American commercial  vessels and cargo. The Coast Guard also performs vital counter terrorism measures in ports  abroad  to ensure  the safety of Americans  across the globe.  In addition, in Houston the Coast Guard routinely conducts integrated operations with city,  county, state and Federal Law Enforcement  partners. The joint agency Houston Area Maritime Operations Center is a prime example of  the type of coordination efforts directed under  a  recent Maritime Operations Coordination  Plan signed by  the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) and  U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE).  The Port of Houston as one of the world’s  busiest ports  is a  tremendous  responsibility  which has been smoothly operated by  the  Coast Guard. In terms of maritime traffic and  cargo, the Port of Houston ranks first in the  nation for number of ship arrivals and second  in total cargo tonnage. Houston handles over  50 percent of all containerized cargo arriving  at Gulf of Mexico ports.  Houston is the Energy capitol of the United  States for a reason, more than 50 percent of  the gasoline used in the United States is refined in this area. With more than 100 petrochemical waterfront facilities, Houston has the  second  largest such complex  in  the world.  Major  corporations  such  as  Exxon-Mobil,  Shell, Saudi ARAMCO, Stolt Nielson, Odfjell  USA Inc., Sea River and Kirby Marine have  national or international headquarters in Houston.  These operations typically involve the Harris  County Sheriff’s Office and  local city Police  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:45 Nov 16, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15NO8.003 E15NOPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011
453,,112,0.453,222,2011-11-15,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Chair, H.R. 2838, the Coast  Guard and Maritime Transportation Act 2011,  authorizes Coast Guard  funding  for Fiscal  Years 2012, 2013 and 2014. The authorized  levels were approved  in  the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee’s Budget Views  and Estimates, and reflect the levels set in the  House-passed Budget Resolution.  Following up on the Committee’s Sitting on  Our Assets Report, H.R. 2838 decommissions  two aging  icebreakers, neither of which currently operates. The bill also restricts the purchases of  future National Security Cutters  (NSCs) until current NSCs meet  long-promised mission performance capabilities.  In addition to authorizing the Coast Guard  and making  improvements  to  the service’s  programs and capabilities,  the bill also  improves the administration of maritime transportation, including—clarifying the circumstances  under which a foreign seaman injured outside  the United States can sue  in United States  courts.  The bill incorporates H.R. 2840, the Commercial Vessel Discharges Reform Act  of  2011. H.R. 2840 establishes a uniform national standard  for ballast water discharges.  This provision  is strongly supported by  the  U.S. and international maritime industry. It protects  the environment and makes maritime  transportation more efficient.  H.R. 2838 also  incorporates an amended  version of H.R. 2839, the Piracy Suppression  Act of 2011, which authorizes additional actions to suppress piracy. It also improves the  tracking of ransom payments to pirates to assure these payments do not fund terrorism.

455,House,112,0.706,34,2011-12-08,Mr. JORDAN.,"  b1500  I think that’s not the way we ought  to be operating. The last 7 days of the  session, or 5 days, 6 days, 7, assuming  we went through Sunday, we shouldn’t  be doing that, I suggest respectfully to  my friend, the majority leader, because  it will simply put us back into the situation the American public doesn’t want  us in, and that’s confronting one another, playing chicken with one another, bringing us to the precipice of  defeat and lack of success.  The public doesn’t want us there. We  shouldn’t want us there. And I would  urge  the gentleman not  to  include  items, as I have urged you with respect  to  the appropriation bills  that also  must be passed. That’s not in this list,  but you did mention it, of course, in  the announcement, Mr. ROGERS and  Mr. DICKShave been working hard, and  others have been working hard to get  our appropriations bills done.  We have urged that we not put controversial items in that, and we showed  our good faith on that representation  when we passed the minibus, and 165  Democrats  joined 135 Republicans to  pass that legislation.  So, again,  I would urge  the gentleman to, if he feels strongly about  that, and I know that he feels—he said  labor is for that bill. Labor is for that  bill. I think I’m for that bill, I want  the gentleman to know. So this does  not come from my particular opposition to this bill.  I am concerned about the alignment  and the aquifer. I think that’s a legitimate concern. But I think that that oil  is going to be drilled no matter what  we do. It seems to me that it’s better  for us to have it than for others to have  it and have that availability.  But having said that, gratuitously  putting it into a bill that the President  has already said I don’t agree with that  is simply playing chicken on legislation that’s very important.  If the gentleman wants to comment  on that, I would be glad to yield to  him.  ",2011

460,Senate,112,0.585,62,2011-12-08,Mr. RUBIO.," Earlier this week in Kansas, President Obama tried to score political points by chiding Senate Republicans for refusing to vote on the confirmation of Richard Cordray to be Director of the so-called Consumer Financial  Protection  Bureau—CFPB—  saying we refuse to let him do his job.  And the President asked, Why? I am  happy to answer his question, again.  Earlier this year, I joined 44 other  Senators  in  recommending  to  the  President three necessary reforms for  the CFPB in order to improve accountability in its operations. Specifically,  we asked that a board of directors be  established  to  oversee  it,  that  the  agency be subjected to the regular congressional appropriations process, and  for the establishment of a safety and  soundness check for the prudential regulators.  We made clear to the President that  without these reforms we would not  vote to confirm any nominee to run the  CFPB, regardless of political affiliation  or qualifications. The President chose  to  ignore our suggestions. Although  the President frequently pays lip service to accountability in the regulatory  process, when push came to shove, he  made this serious issue just another  talking point.  President Obama  is now trying to  pressure my colleagues to vote to confirm Mr. Cordray by traveling around  the country giving speeches. I want to  reiterate that I will not vote to confirm any director for this rogue bureaucracy until appropriate checks and  balances are put into place. President  Obama promised  that  ‘‘transparency  and accountability will be a hallmark  of my administration’’, making his refusal to make CFPB more transparent  especially disappointing.  Without  reform,  CFPB’s  director  would serve with unprecedented and  unconstitutional  amounts  of  power.  The director would have the power to  decide what rules are  issued  in the  name  of  consumer  protection,  how  funds are spent, and how its enforcement authority will be used. In short,  it empowers a single, unelected person  with seemingly endless and unchecked  authority. This bureaucracy holds the  sweeping ability to limit choices when  it comes to commonly-used financial  products such as home equity loans,  credit cards, and student loans. Simply  put, a designation from the CFPB director saying these products are ‘‘abusive’’ could restrict the availability of  credit to consumers and increase the  cost of goods or services for all Americans.  This year alone, over 70,000 pages of  new regulations have been added to the  books from agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the  National Labor Relations Board, oftentimes without  any  compelling  justification for their existence. The last  thing job creators in America need is  more uncertainty from a powerful government agency such as the CFPB that  will receive a blank check for a half  billion dollar budget with virtually no  input from Congress.  President  Obama  has  urged  the  American people to ‘‘help hold [him]  accountable’’. I stand with my Republican colleagues in an effort to do just  that. The  truth  is we need  transparency in government that provides  greater confidence that regulations are  designed to protect consumers from unfair practices, without destroying jobs.  Until basic transparency requests are  made, I will not support allowing the  CFPB to operate with unaccountable  leadership.  ",2011
461,,112,0.221,104,2011-12-08,Mr. GERLACH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate The Brandywine Health Foundation of Coatesville, Chester County, Pennsylvania, on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.  Over  the  last  ten years,  the Brandywine  Health Foundation has made over $10 million  in grants and scholarships to improve health  and  encourage  youth  development  in  the  greater Coatesville area.  Its efforts have resulted in bringing ChesPenn Health Services,  the only Federally Qualified Health Center in  Chester County, to Coatesville. This helps to  provide over 8,000 patient visits to low income  County residents. Additionally, the Foundation  has assisted  in  the development of a new  Dental Center, Chester County Community  Dental, and has partnered with  the Chester  County Department  of Mental Health  and  Mental Retardation, as well as the Coatesville  Area School District, to bring behavioral health  services to child guidance research centers.  The Brandywine Health Foundation is also  responsible  for  the construction of  the  four-  story Brandywine Center, which opened  in  April 2008 and houses the non-profit organizations  such as ChesPenn Health Services,  Chester County Community Dental, Child  Guidance Resource Centers,  and Human  Services, Inc., as well as offering 24 units of  affordable senior housing.  Mr. Speaker, in light of its years of exemplary  service  to  the  community  and  outstanding accomplishments, I ask that my colleagues  join me  today  in  recognizing The  Brandywine Health Foundation in celebration  of its 10 year anniversary.  ample of progress you see in Dunkirk today—  from waterfront development  to  the Dunkirk  Boardwalk Market,  from  the SUNY Fredonia  Incubator to the redevelopment of the vacant  Crocker-Sprague  building—you  see  Dick  Frey’s fingerprints. Through Dick’s efforts, underutilized  recreational  parks  and  other  brownfields  throughout  the city were  turned  into clean and development-ready sites.  Never shy about fighting for his city, I first  met Dick Frey in 2005, shortly after I took office  representing Dunkirk  and Chautauqua  County as a Member of Congress, and  I’ll  confess to being a little concerned. After all,  Dunkirk and Chautauqua had not been represented in Congress by a Democrat in nearly  a generation. But after our first meeting, two  things were clear: number one, Dick Frey was  a man of his word who passionately cares  about the constituents he served; number two,  Dick Frey cares about people, and not politics.  Dick once said in an interview with the Dunkirk Observer newspaper, ‘‘As far as politics  go, you can expect  to  leave politics at  the  door when dealing with [people’s] concerns.’’  That statement embodies my experience with  him completely. Though we come  from different political sides of the aisle, politics was  never an  issue between us. We both  represented the same people—the hard-working  folks in the city of Dunkirk—and we each had  a responsibility to deliver for them.  Now as his wife Pat and  their  large extended family will welcome Dick back to them  after loaning him, his time and attention to the  city and its residents for the past ten years,  we wish them good luck as Dick leaves active  civic life for a much deserved respite.  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me a  few moments to commemorate the service of  one of the most honorable public servants that  I have had  the good  fortune  to know.  I am  thankful all  the more, however,  to call Dick  Frey my friend, and to wish him Godspeed in  all of his future endeavors.  f  f  HONORING THE CAREER OF  MAYOR RICHARD FREY  RECOGNIZING CITY OF SAN LUIS  OBISPO POLICE CHIEF DEBORAH  E.

Chief Linden is a native Californian, raised  in Sunnyvale. She moved to Santa Barbara in  1979 to attend U.C. Santa Barbara, graduating  in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology. She began her law enforcement career  with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department as a Deputy Sheriff at the age of 22.  During her 18 year tenure at the Sheriff’s  Department, Chief Linden served in a variety  of assignments including Patrol Deputy, Narcotics Detective, Major Crimes Detective, Patrol Sergeant, Major Crimes Sergeant, Lieutenant, and Commander.  She was hired by  the City of San Luis  Obispo as Chief of Police on January 1, 2003.  Chief Linden holds a Master of Arts degree  in Leadership  from St. Mary’s College  in  Moraga and she is a P.O.S.T. Command College graduate. In 2004, she was honored with  a three-year gubernatorial appointment to the  California  Commission  on  Peace  Officer  Standards and Training and  she was  reappointed  to subsequent  terms  in 2007 and  2010. Chief Linden serves on the Board of the  California Police Chiefs Association and is a  lifetime member of the California Narcotic Officers Association. Chief Linden  is also dedicated to future members of law enforcement,  as she has been a criminal justice instructor  for Santa Barbara City College, an academy  instructor for Allan Hancock Law Enforcement  Academy, and an  instructor of Public Policy  for St. Mary’s College Graduate Leadership  Program.  Chief Linden also takes an active role in our  local community  in addition  to her commitments as Police Chief. She  is  involved with  many community and non-profit groups,  including serving on the boards of the Anti-Defamation League, Transitions Mental Health Association, and the Monday Rotary Club in San  Luis Obispo. She is the law enforcement representative on  the San Luis Obispo County  Homeless Services Oversight Council.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join  me in honoring Deborah Linden, for her leadership, dedication, and outstanding service to  our community and the San Luis Obispo Police Department.  f  IN HONOR OF SCOTT KENNEDY  HON.

464,,112,-0.455,104,2011-12-08,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor the life of a good friend and great leader who passed away unexpectedly on November 19, 2011. His energy,  intelligence, and  dedication served the City of Santa Cruz since  1976, when he co-founded the Resource Center for Nonviolence. In 1991, Scott began his  political career, serving on the Santa Cruz City  Council  from 1991  to 1998 and again  from  2001–2003. He also served as the mayor of  Santa Cruz in 1994 and 2004. Throughout his  life, Scott demonstrated a strong commitment  to  his  community  and  he will  be  dearly  missed. I am proud to honor my friend and his  service to the City of Santa Cruz and to the  rest of the world.  Scott was born in Nebraska on December 9,  1948, and grew up in San Jose, California. He  began his advocacy  for  international peace  while attending the University of California at  Santa Cruz when as a freshman he first traveled  to  the  Israel-Palestine  region.

465,,112,-0.279,111,2011-12-08,Mr. POLIS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call  attention  to a change  in  the Capitol Visitors  Center. Two paintings by the prominent 19th  century painter Albert Bierstadt have recently  been returned to the Capitol Complex by the  Architect of the Capitol. Originally purchased  after the Civil War, ‘‘Discovery of the Hudson  River’’ and ‘‘Entrance into Monterey,’’ are part  of  the  first  indigenous American school of  painting, called the Hudson River School. This  movement was not just restricted to beautiful  landscapes—it also had an important influence  on American  culture,  recreation, and  conservation.  Though the Hudson River School originated  in upstate New York, painters soon began  traveling widely  to study and capture new  scenes. These travels took the painters to Europe,  the Middle East, North Africa, South  America, and the American West. Bierstadt is  one of the most prominent artists of the Western United States, and has a strong connection to my district in Colorado.  In 1859, Bierstadt  traveled  to my home  State of Colorado and to Wyoming, then territories, with a government surveyor. The large-  scale  landscapes he painted  from his notes  and sketches from this trip prompted the creation of many more paintings back in his studio. Bierstadt’s depiction of the craggy peaks  of the Rockies, the Sierra Nevada, and in Yosemite, among others, resulted  in  the christening of Mount Bierstadt in my district.  In the 1870s, Congress purchased several  of Bierstadt’s works,  including  the  two  that  hang  today  in  the CVC. These same paintings, and other Western landscapes by Hudson River School painters, coupled with a  growing  environmental  conservation movement, inspired Congress to protect this natural  beauty  through  the creation of Yellowstone  and Yosemite National Parks. Later,  these  paintings were used again to prompt the formation of the National Park Service.  This  is  just one example of  the Hudson  River School of Painters’ legacy. The School  emphasized  realistic, highly detailed scenes  that were very popular over the 19th century.  These works captured the beauty and variety  of the American landscape.  Painters from the Hudson River School also  had a hand in the foundation of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Inspired  by the artistic culture of the capitals of Europe,  School painters  joined other area businessmen and academics to form the Met in 1870.  Bierstadt met with  the President, and other  painters of the School served as trustees or  as members  of  the  executive  committee.  Today, many of Bierstadt’s works hang in the  Met alongside works by many other Hudson  River School painters, as well as other institutions like the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage Americans of all  ages to take the time to view these paintings  and consider  the beauty and greatness of  these landscapes, both on canvas and in the  wilderness.  f  THE FAILURE TO PROTECT FARMERS AND RANCHERS FROM CORPORATE ABUSES  HON.

466,House,112,-0.416,2,2011-12-15,Mr. NEAL.," Madam Speaker, I want  to talk about a program that is set to  expire at the end of the year if Congress does not act, and it’s the New  Markets Tax Credit program. I have  fought for this program since its enactment in 2000 because it’s a cost-effective way to create jobs and drive investment  in communities with high  rates of poverty and unemployment.  I’ve seen the amazing results of this  initiative first hand back home in Massachusetts, and today I want to highlight  one  of  those Massachusetts  projects, the Colonial Theater in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Let me tell you a little about the  New Markets Tax Credit. The program  was designed to stimulate investment  and economic growth  in  low-income  communities  that  are  traditionally  overlooked  by  conventional  capital  markets. The New Markets Tax Credit  program attracts capital to low-income  communities by providing private investors with a 39 percent Federal tax  credit for investments made in businesses  or  economic  development  projects located in certain areas where  the individual poverty rate is at least  20 percent or where median family income is low.  According  to  the Government Accountability Office, 88 percent of the  New Markets Tax Credit investors said  they would not have made the investment  in  a  low-income  community  without New Markets Tax Credits.  Every project or business financed by  New Markets Tax Credits is located in  a low-income community and/or benefits low-income individuals. The vast  majority, over 90 percent of investment  dollars generated through New Markets, has gone to communities with  levels of economic distress that far exceed the minimum requirements of the  law; and 60 percent has gone to communities with very high unemployment  rates that are at least 1.5 times the national average.  Through 2009, New Markets cost the  Federal Government, in terms of lost  revenue, less than $4 billion. That $4  billion should be treated as a government  investment because  it has resulted in $50 billion in capital projects  in those low-income communities and  created or retained an estimated 500,000  jobs. According to the Treasury Department, every $1 of foregone tax revenue under New Markets leverages $12  of  private  investment  in  distressed  communities. That’s  results,  in my  opinion.  Unfortunately, New Markets  is  a  temporary program and unless Congress acts this month, it will expire on  December 31. I am, and have been, the  lead Democratic sponsor of legislation  to extend this program for 5 years; and  I have been  leading  the charge  for  years to make this a permanent initiative. I once again call on our colleagues  to extend New Markets.  Let’s talk about the success of New  Markets  in Massachusetts. Over  170  businesses in Massachusetts have received New Markets  financing: Hot  Mama’s Foods in Springfield; the River  Valley Market  in Northampton;  the  Holyoke Health Center; and now the  High Performance Computing Center in  Holyoke as well.  But I want to focus today on the Colonial Theater in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Pittsfield is a city in western  Massachusetts with a population of  about  42,000 people.  It’s  the  largest  community in that region of the State.  It has struggled with unemployment  and urban blight. The Colonial Theater  is a rare architectural gem and one of  the greatest acoustical houses in the  world, located in the heart of Pittsfield. It was built at the turn of the  century, and it was closed for more  than 50 years. Periodic attempts to redevelop the theater failed for lack of  money and sustained public support.  However, thanks to New Markets Tax  Credit, financing of $16.7 million of a  total project cost of $21 million, this  70,000 square foot theater and adjacent  building were magnificently restored.  With 823 seats, the theater reopened in  2006 and now  features an  impressive  lineup of plays and musical  shows.  James Taylor is currently performing  at the Colonial Theater as part of the  cast of ‘‘A Christmas Carol.’’ Since its  renovation, the theater has hosted Arlo  Guthrie, the Four Tops, and Bob Weir  of the Grateful Dead will perform this  spring. Recent musicals and plays at  the Colonial Theater  include  ‘‘The  Who’s  Tommy,’’  ‘‘The  Producers,’’  ‘‘The Wizard of Oz,’’ and ‘‘Rent.’’  After the first 2 years of operation,  the independent research firm Center  for Creative Community Development  estimated that the Colonial Theater  sustains a direct economic impact of $4  million annually and 100 full-time jobs  in the Berkshire area.  The Colonial Theater is a symbol of  the re-emergence of Pittsfield as an  economic and cultural center of the  Berkshires. Anchoring the city’s comprehensive strategy for downtown revitalization, the restored and vibrant Colonial Theater—along with six-screen  Beacon Cinema Complex, also financed  with New Markets Tax Credits—has  created jobs, attracted new businesses,  spurred residential development, and  added vitality to this city. Widespread  street-level  vacancies  in  downtown  Pittsfield has  been  virtually  eliminated and 45 new businesses and restaurants have opened. The restoration  has helped attract an estimated 400,000  new visitors to the downtown Pittsfield  area each year.  Let’s rejuvenate the New Markets  Tax Credit program.  f  WELCOME HOME, COMPANY C  ",2011

He  is a science  teacher in La Jolla, and I believe his  class is watching today. He sent me his  opinion on education:  ‘‘Weighing a pig every day doesn’t  get you a fatter pig. And annual testing of all students in all subject areas,  without it impacting their grade, has  not resulted in smarter students. It has  made our students lose their intrinsic  desire to learn and added an expensive  layer of bureaucracy to an already administratively top-heavy system.  ‘‘This is especially true for science  education. It is clear that the current  accountability system has failed. Our  students, parents, and their teachers  are being held hostage to this failed  system. When was the last time you  were forced to take an exam, asked to  do your ‘best,’ and knew that the result  wouldn’t affect how you were being  evaluated?’’  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Howard  for bringing to the House his thoughts  on education and this question to our  floor.  f  COMMUNICATION FROM THE  CLERK OF THE HOUSE  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of  Representatives:  OFFICEOFTHECLERK,  HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, DC, December 15, 2011.

468,House,112,0.545,30,2011-12-15,Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia.," Thank  you, And I appreciate that. I’m not  sure about phenom, but I’m very appreciative to be on the Energy and Commerce Committee.  We have a lot of issues in my district.  For those of you who are watching this  who aren’t familiar with my district, I  represent southwest Virginia. It is a  big  energy-producing  region  of  the  State of Virginia.  And in Virginia, we understand that  we should use our own resources to create jobs. So I come here today for jobs  to be created in the United States—not  in Virginia directly, but  in another  part of this great Nation, because the  issues are often the same. And for some  reason, this administration is standing  in the way of the creation of jobs in the  energy industry.  In Virginia, we have asked repeatedly  to be able to drill off our coast in order  to find oil and natural gas. We want to  use our resources to create jobs. We  started asking for this in Virginia back  in 2004. At that time we had Democrat  Governors, and they blocked our efforts to send this to the Federal Government. Later, having a change of  heart, one of the Governors decided, as  they were on their way out the door,  that they would send the request forward. But to this date the President  has not realized that we can create  jobs. But our jobs, unlike the jobs in  Nebraska and other parts of the United  States  affected  by Keystone,  they  would be several years down the road.  b1530  What we have here is the Nation’s  best shovel-ready project. In reality,  it’s ready to go. And while  it’s not  American oil, it’s Canadian oil. And  one would have to believe that the Canadians don’t care about their environment to be opposed to this pipeline.  One would have to believe that the  President of the United States would  prefer to see the oil from Canada going  to China. One would have to believe  that the President of the United States  would prefer for us to buy oil from  other nations, like Venezuela and some  of the Arab nations that don’t care for  us one iota, than to do this pipeline.  One would have to believe that, for  some reason, we want to be dependent,  and this President wants us to be dependent on other nations who don’t  care for us, who don’t appreciate our  democratic, republican form of government, and who don’t understand that  jobs and the economy are a driving  concern, something that we must pay  attention to and that we must do it  now.  And here we have thousands of jobs,  thousands of  jobs. We’ve heard  the  number 20,000. Those are direct jobs.  You can multiply that number out beyond and beyond. And they’re being  stopped.  And if are you an energy producer  and you see something that makes as  much sense as the Keystone pipeline  being stopped dead in its tracks because the President doesn’t want to  make a decision until next year, and  maybe the next year after that, you  have to believe that it’s not worth investing here in the United States for  energy concerns.  I had a fellow came up to me recently  back home. He said, MORGAN, I want to  tell you something. He showed me the  article he’d found. He said, I’ve always  invested  in American energy. That’s  where I’ve always put my money. He  said, But right now the situation is so  uncertain—and  this was  before we  knew the President was going to delay  this very reasonable project, the Keystone pipeline. He said, I’m now investing in southern Africa with a consortium that has, I believe it was Australians, South Africans, and Brazilians working on a project in Mozambique. He said, I didn’t want to do it,  but I don’t know what choice I have  when you look at what is coming out of  the administration, when they don’t  want us to invest in American energy.  So, ladies and gentlemen, I have to  tell you, I came here today—this does  not directly affect my district, but it  does affect my country, and  I care  deeply about my country.  Our country needs jobs. We need affordable  energy.  Keystone  pipeline  helps us both have jobs and affordable  energy. And that is why it’s important  for every person in the United States  to understand that we must have the  Keystone pipeline; and the sooner we  start, the sooner those jobs occur, and  the  sooner we get more oil  supply  that’s not from our adversaries in the  world, the people who would like to see  the United States torn down, but from  our  friend Canada, who understands  that together we can build a more prosperous North America.  Ladies and gentlemen, with that, I  would  like  to  thank  the gentleman  from Nebraska for yielding.  ",2011

479,Senate,112,-0.249,499,2011-12-15,Mr. COONS.," Mr. President, today I  rise to express my deep concern that  the 2012 National Department of Defense Authorization Act provisions pertaining to detainee treatment fail to  strike the appropriate, important balance between national security, due  process, and civil  liberties. Sections  1021, 1022, and 1023 are the latest in a  series of legislative proposals that provide ever-narrowing latitude for dealing with terrorism suspects, whether in  the U.S. or abroad.  I am concerned, that these provisions  take us one small, but significant, step  down the road towards a state in which  ordinary citizens  live  in  fear of the  military, rather than the free society  that has marked  this great nation  since the Bill of Rights was ratified 220  years ago, in 1791.  The new detention authorities thrust  upon our military in this bill are an assault on our civil liberties and do not  belong on our books. They were not requested by the Pentagon, in fact they  have been resisted by the President,  the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney  General, and the directors of National  Intelligence and the FBI. They do not  make us safer and, to the contrary,  they will create dangerous confusion  within our national security community.  Under  these  sections, a  terrorism  suspect must be remanded to U.S. military custody, even when that suspect  presents no imminent threat to public  safety and  is being held under suspicion of committing a U.S. crime. The  suspect may be held indefinitely. Indeed, if the suspect is transferred to  Guantanamo, it may be a practical reality that the suspect must be held indefinitely, thanks to the onerous certification  requirements contained  in  Section 1023. If not sent to Guantanamo, the suspect may be rendered to  a foreign power, where he may be subject to coercive interrogation, torture,  or death. Or, the individual may simply  remain in custody of our own military,  waiting for the cessation of an endless  conflict against an idea.  As my colleagues from Vermont and  Oregon, from Colorado and California,  have already said so eloquently, these  provisions reflect an unfortunate and  unwise shift away  from the current  law, in which the criminal justice system is presumed to be sufficient for  those who commit crimes on U.S. soil.  No system is perfect, but the federal  criminal justice system is considered  by many around the world to be the  gold  standard  for  fairness,  transparency and reliability. Since 9/11, the  civilian criminal process has been successful  in  securing  convictions  and  lengthy sentences against hundreds of  terrorism suspects.  This is compared to just six convictions in military tribunals, and two of  these  individuals  are walking  free  today. A third, Ibrahim al Qosi, was  convicted of being a Taliban fighter.  Under his sentence of 2 years, he would  be due to be released next summer. But  when he serves his sentence, he likely  will not be released. Instead, he will be  detained until our undefined hostilities  against  Islamic  extremism and  terrorism conclude.  In other words, he  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:21 Dec 16, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15DE6.060 S15DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011
480,Senate,112,-0.256,527,2011-12-15,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce the Equity for Visual Artists Act of 2011. This bill would  enable visual artists to benefit from  their copyrights in a meaningful way  similar to other creators of  literary  and artistic works such as authors,  playwrights and composers. It provides  for the payment of a copyright royalty  long recognized in international law to  be paid at the time a work of visual art  is sold at auction in the United States.  Half of this royalty payment will go directly to the artists or their estate and  the other half will be made available to  nonprofit American art museums as an  endowment to be used by them to purchase the works of  living American  artists so that these works may be  freely enjoyed by everyone.  Like all authors, the primary legal  right of an artist in his or her work is  the copyright. Yet, visual artists stand  alone within America’s creative community in their inability to gain any  significant income under existing copyright law. As an example, creators of  music will collect nearly $2 billion in  copyright royalty payments this year.  By contrast, America’s visual artists  receive only a tiny amount of copyright  income, primarily when  their  works are reproduced in publications  such as museum catalogues. Visual art  often generates money only when the  original work itself is first sold. The  vast majority of money-making sales  are not by artists themselves but by  collectors, dealers and auction houses  who trade in their works after their  first sale. Under current law artists receive no income from these sales.  For nearly 100 years  international  copyright law under the Berne Convention on Literary and Artistic Works, of  which the United States is a party, has  given artists a right to royalties each  time their works are resold. However,  unlike other rights protected under the  Convention,  individual countries are  not required to recognize the artists’  resale right. While over 40 other countries, including all members of the European Union,  provide  their  artists  with income from resale of their works,  the United States does not. Under the  Convention’s  reciprocity  rule,  these  countries will only pay royalties to  artists from countries that also recognize  the  resale  right. As a  result,  American artists  receive no money  from these sales.  In 1990, Congress enacted the Visual  Artists Rights Act  that  asked  the  Copyright Office to study the issue of  resale royalties and report back with  recommendations. The Copyright Office reported back to Congress that creation of new artworks would be encouraged by adoption of the Berne Convention provisions on resale rights, but it  recommended  that we wait  to  see  whether  the European Union would  first require all of its member countries to join those like France and Germany who had long provided their artists with such a right. In 2001, the European Union decided to make resale  royalties mandatory  throughout  its  territory, underpinning the Copyright  Office’s initial conclusions about the  positive effects of  introducing resale  rights. In 2006, the United Kingdom was  the last EU country to implement its  law.  In order to make the administration  of a resale right as simple as possible,  the bill would take 7 percent of any  sale $10,000 or more from only the most  public and easily accountable transactions, auction sales, and divide the  amount by artists or their beneficiaries  and non-profit museums to purchase  American art. The  legislation would  apply only to sales by entities that  have $25 million per year of cumulative  sales of visual art. It also excludes entities that solely conduct business in  online auctions over the Internet. The  bill gives primary  responsibility  for  collecting and distributing royalties to  non-governmental collecting societies  with oversight by the Copyright Office  and  reporting  requirements  to Congress.  This  legislation  is a  long overdue  step in fulfilling our obligation under  the Berne Convention to award visual  artists the benefits derived from the resale of their works, a right that literary and musical artists have enjoyed  for decades. Under current law, visual  artists are denied royalties for lucrative sales of their art, and this bill is a  meaningful start  for providing them  with just compensation. It is only fair  that, as  stipulated by  international  law, visual artists profit from the appreciation in value of their work.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 2000  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equity for  Visual Artists Act of 2011’’.  SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.  Section 101 of title 17, United States Code,  is amended by—  (1) inserting after the definition of ‘‘architectural work’’ the following:  ‘‘For purposes of section 106(b),  ‘auction’  means a public sale run by an entity that  sells to the highest bidder works of visual  art in which the cumulative amount of such  works sold during the previous year is more  than $25,000,000 and does not solely conduct  the sale of visual art by the entity on the  Internet.’’.  (2) inserting after the definition of ‘‘proprietor’’ and prior to the definition of ‘‘pseudonymous work’’ the following:  ‘‘For purposes of section 106(b), ‘price’ is the  aggregate of all installments paid in cash or  in-kind by or on behalf of a purchaser for a  work as the result of auction of that work.’’;  (3) inserting at the end of the definition of  ‘‘Publication’’ the following: ‘‘For purposes  of section 106(b), in the case of a work of visual art as defined in this section, a publication does not include photographic reproductions or other images of the work, including  castings of a sculptural work, made or distributed prior to January 1, 1978, in connection with the exhibition of such work by a  gallery or museum, whether for purposes of  sale of the original work, or in connection  with any publication authorized by a gallery  or museum in possession of the work regardless of whether such publication was with  the consent of the author. In no other circumstances is a work of visual art considered to have been published prior to January  1, 1978, unless such publication has been authorized by the express written consent of  the author of such work.’’;  (4) inserting after the definition of ‘‘registration’’ and prior  to  the definition of  ‘‘sound recordings’’ the following:  ‘‘For purposes of sections 106(b) and 701(b)(5),  ‘sale’ means transfer of ownership or physical possession of a work as the result of the  auction of that work.’’; and  (5) amending paragraph (1) of the definition  of a ‘‘work of visual art’’ to read as follows:  ‘‘(1) a painting, drawing, print, sculpture,  or photograph, existing either in the original  embodiment or in a limited edition of 200  copies or fewer that bear the signature or  other identifying mark of the author and are  consecutively numbered by the author, or, in  the case of a sculpture  in multiple cast,  carved, or  fabricated sculptures of 200 or  fewer that are consecutively numbered by  the author and bear the signature or other  identifying mark of the author; or’’.  SEC. 3. EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS.  Section 106 of title 17, United States Code,  is amended by—  (1) inserting ‘‘(a)’’ before ‘‘Subject to sections 107 through 122’’; and  (2) adding at the end the following:  ‘‘(b)(1) In this subsection, the term  ‘net  royalty’ means the royalty amount collected  less administrative expenses of the visual  artists’ collecting society. In no case shall  the administrative expenses of the visual  artists’ collecting society subtracted  from  the royalty amount collected exceed 18 percent.  ‘‘(2) Whenever a work of visual art is sold  as the result of auction of that work by  someone other than the artist who is the author of the work, the entity that collects the  money or other consideration paid for the  sale of the work shall, within 90 days of collecting such money or other consideration,  pay out of the proceeds of the sale a royalty  equal to 7 percent of the price. Such royalty  shall be paid to a visual artists’ collecting  society. The collecting  society  shall distribute, no fewer than 4 times per year, 50  percent of the net royalty to the artist or his  or her successor as copyright owner. After  payment to the artist or his or her successor  as copyright owner, the remaining 50 percent  of the net royalty shall be deposited into an  escrow account established by the collecting  society for the purposes of funding purchases  by nonprofit art museums  in the United  States of works of visual art authored by living artists domiciled in the United States.

482,,112,-0.465,548,2011-12-15,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I stand today  to pay tribute to a constituent who has dedicated his professional career to coaching high  school basketball and—over the past half century—has developed generations of successful  young women while breaking and setting winning records for women’s basketball in South  Carolina.  I commend Coach John Franklin  Thames for his 50 years of coaching women’s  basketball in the Palmetto State. It is very fitting that a scholarship for gifted athletes will  be established in his honor at his alma mater,  Manning High School.  John Thames grew up  in Alcolu, SC and  graduated from Manning High School in 1953.  At that time, America was at war with Korea.  He spent six months as Executive Officer of  Training Company  at  Fort  Jackson,  and  served 13 months in Korea as an Army Tank  Platoon Commander. Following his military  service, he matriculated at Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina, graduated in  1958, and returned home to serve his alma  mater for the next half century.  Over his 44-year career as the Lady Monarchs head  coach, Coach Thames’  teams  amassed  two State Championships,  three  State runner-ups, 15 Regional Championships,  and seven Regional Tournament Championships. He was named Region Coach of  the  Year 14  times and  the Sumter  Item Area  Coach of  the year  three  times.  In 1969, he  was selected as the Pee Dee North-South All-  Star South head coach. He served as head  coach in the South Carolina Athletic Coaches  Association North-South Girls All-Star Game in  1984 and 2000. He was also one of two South  Carolina coaches chosen to coach the South  Carolina All-Star Girls against the North Carolina All-Star Girls at Winthrop University.  Coach Thames was nominated in 1991–92  as  the Converse High School Coach of  the  Year and  the National High School Athletic  Coaches Association Coach of  the Year  in  women’s basketball. That same year, he was  named Florence Morning News Class AAA  Girls Coach of the Year. He has been a South  Carolina Coaches  Association  of Women  Sports MVP Honoree,  and  a  2000 High  School Sports Report State Coach of the Year  in AAA Girls Basketball. He was a 2009 Inaugural Inductee into the South Carolina Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame, and a 2011 Inaugural Inductee into the Clarendon County Athletic Hall of Fame.  Coach Thames has also had great success  in other sports. He served as  the Manning  High School baseball coach for 14 years and  as an assistant football coach for 36 years.  In 1993, his high school alma mater—and  50-year employer—named  its gymnasium  in  his honor for ‘‘his lifetime of contributions to  Manning High School.’’ Presbyterian College  also honored their esteemed graduate by recognizing Coach Thames as the 2011 recipient  of  the Bob Waters Award. This honor was  given for his outstanding leadership and service  to society and  the profession of athletic  coaching and  for personifying  those values  and qualities of excellence and integrity held  dear by his college alma mater.  Despite all  the accolades he has accrued  over his career, Coach Thames will be  remembered most for his generosity and love of  his players and all  students. Since 2004,  Coach Thames has conducted a  free one-  week basketball camp  for girls. He  is committed to ensuring that the inability to pay is  not an obstacle for any girl to participate in the  sport. For years, Coach Thames has used his  personal funds to buy shoes for all of his players. He has done so because he doesn’t want  to single out the ones who cannot afford new  shoes. He provides  transportation and other  clothing  for many of his students who have  limited resources. Coach Thames is also dedicated to helping students get into higher education  institutions so  they can pursue  their  dreams.  ‘‘Coach,’’ as he’s  lovingly known  to  everyone including non-athletes, is a mentor  and father figure.  In  addition  to  his  coaching  accolades,  Coach Thames has  twice been named  the  Manning High School Teacher of the Year. He  received the 2008 Outstanding South Carolina  Teacher of U.S. History by the Daughters of  the American Revolution. He was  inducted  into the Kappa Alpha Order Court of Honor in  2009. Coach Thames is a recipient of the Silver Crescent,  the highest civilian recognition  awarded by  the State of South Carolina  for  outstanding dedication to a local community,  and has been  inducted  into  the Clarendon  County  Education  Hall  of  Fame.
